POA 6414 was related to the sale of 107 Namly Avenue (<strong>Namly Property</strong>), while POA 6417 was related to the purchase of a condominium unit (<strong>Condominium Unit</strong>). At the material time, Mdm Liew was 87 years old.</p>\n<p>On or around 17 November 2017, Mdm Liew’s son (<strong>Kelvin</strong>), as well as Kelvin’s wife (<strong>Jacqueline</strong>), visited the Respondent to seek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew who was not present at this meeting.</p>\n<p>On Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on or around 20 November 2017. The Respondent had prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any other authority, from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her behalf.</p>\n<p>The Respondent met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time on 20 November 2017 at the Namly Property. Kelvin, Jacqueline, their sons, one Goh Eng Sheng Daniel (<strong>Daniel</strong>) and one Goh Eng Chun David (<strong>David</strong>) were present. Mdm Liew signed the POAs at this meeting.</p>\n<p>POA 6414 authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s behalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then 19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium Unit.</p>\n<p>POA 6417 authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in Mdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as a joint owner. It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from banks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if the sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also authorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and purchase agreement on behalf of Mdm Liew.</p>\n<p>On 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an Option to Purchase (<strong>OTP</strong>) to buyers for the purchase of the Namly Property. The OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017, and the Respondent was appointed by Kelvin to act as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer with respect to the sale of the Namly Property.</p>\n<p>On 1 December 2017, the OTP for the Condominium Unit was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline with the OTP being exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. The Respondent also acted for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew in this transaction.</p>\n<p>On 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been lodged against the Namly Property.</p>\n<p>On 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (<strong>Suit 45</strong>) in her capacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney to stop the sale of the Namly Property. On 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the mental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and declared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but had given evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p>Mdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020.</p>\n<p>The Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Davinder Singh SC, and Mr K Anparasan as DT member to investigate the complaint.</p>\n<p>Seven charges were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h4><strong>First Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (<strong>LPA</strong>), in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, without ensuring that Kelvin had the authority to give those instructions on behalf of Mdm Liew, and when the Respondent had no evidence of such authority, failed to obtain confirmation of the said instructions from Mdm Liew regarding the preparation and drafting of the said POAs, in breach of Rule 5(5)(a) and 5(5)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>PCR</strong>).</p>\n<h4><strong>Second Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, and permitted Mdm Liew to execute the said POAs without first taking sufficient steps to satisfy himself that Mdm Liew understood the nature and effect of the terms that were set out in the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Third Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, by failing to take sufficient steps to safeguard Mdm Liew’s interests by ensuring that he received his instructions, and explained the nature and effect of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017, to Mdm Liew without the presence of the attorney or other family members of the attorney so as to avoid any undue influence being exerted over the client, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fourth Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew, Kelvin and Jacqueline in the purchase of the Condominium Unit, where there was a diversity of interests that existed between the parties, and failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s and/or Jacqueline’s interests, by removing Mdm Liew’s name from the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rules 20(5) and 20(6) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fifth Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect her interests in respect of the purchase of the Condominium Unit, in particular the removal of her name, the non-inclusion of Daniel’s name, and the inclusion of Jacqueline’s name, in the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sixth Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect Mdm Liew’s interests in respect of the POAs, in particular the medical report prepared by Dr Ang Yong Guan and correspondence from Templars Law LLC relating to Mdm Liew’s alleged lack of mental capacity as at the time of the execution of the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Seventh Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor in the discharge of his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section 83(2)(h) of the Act, in that the Respondent, who had acted for Mdm Liew in respect of the matters that were the subject-matter of Suit 45, failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s interests, by failing to take Mdm Liew’s instructions or her donee’s instructions when he was served with a subpoena by solicitors acting in Suit 45, and instead taking Kelvin’s instructions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT found that the First Charge and Second Charge were made out, while the remaining Charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p>With reference to the <strong>First Charge</strong>, the DT noted that the disparity between the Respondent’s evidence about the meeting on 20 November 2017 and what was said in the Respondent’s Attendance Note was simply too huge to be credibly accounted for. The DT further observed that it was not just the nature, terms and implications of the POAs which required careful explanation, but also the issues arising from the interaction between the two POAs.</p>\n<p>The DT stated that as Mdm Liew was 87 years old at the time and had difficulty speaking, the Respondent should not only have carefully explained the relevant matters, but should also have asked if they were in line with her wishes and instructions and how she thought they were in her interests – including asking why she felt that it was in her interest for the POAs to be irrevocable. Also, as Mdm Liew was unable to communicate her understanding verbally or in writing, the Respondent should have called for a pause and asked for her condition to be reviewed by an independent medical expert or declined to act for her.</p>\n<p>Two specific red flags were raised by the DT – (1) the fact that Mdm Liew nodded when the Respondent read the POAs to her, in light of these particular POAs that he was asked to draft by Kelvin, and the fact that one of them dealt with the disposal of her home, it should not have been accepted by the Respondent as evidence that she understood the terms, nature and consequences in the POA; (2) the fact that she did not ask any questions in light of the issues in the POAs should have raised a red flag.</p>\n<p>Crucially, the Respondent also did not take steps to meet Mdm Liew privately and without the presence of Kelvin and Daniel, who stood to benefit from the POAs, and their family members to determine whether Mdm Liew was acting under any misrepresentation, misapprehension or improper influence. The Respondent also did not ask Mdm Liew whether the POAs accorded with her wishes under any will.</p>\n<p>As for the <strong>Second Charge</strong>, the DT found that the offending conduct was the same, hence it did not add to the Respondent’s culpability.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>Third Charge</strong>, the DT found that this aspect of the Respondent’s conduct was insufficient to amount to a breach of Rule 5(2)(c), and his conduct should not be viewed in isolation, and was just one of the matters that has to be taken into account in determining whether the Respondent breached his duties.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Fourth to Seventh Charges</strong> were dismissed based on the fact that Law Society had failed to discharge its burden to show that there was in law a solicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and Mdm Liew at the material time in relation to the Condominium Unit.</p>\n<p>The Respondent was ordered to pay a financial penalty that was sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed, and the Law Society’s costs of $5,000.</p>\n<p>Council accepted the findings and recommendations of the DT and imposed a financial penalty of $2,000 on the Respondent.</p>\n<p>To access the full report, click <a href=\"https://lawsoc-mc-assets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dtr-2023-06-c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jun-2023/\">Disciplinary Tribunal Reports</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg\">The Singapore Law Gazette</a>.</p>\n"

The property was registered to Seo Puay Guan (<strong>SPG</strong>), who was one of seven siblings. The other siblings had alleged that SPG held the property on trust for their late mother, and each claimed an interest in the balance sale proceeds.</p>\n<p>TALLP filed interpleader proceedings in Originating Summons No. 1100 of 2017 (<strong>OS 1100</strong>) with the seven siblings as respondents. OS 1100 was fixed for hearing for three days from 12-14 September 2018 before Dedar Singh Gill JC (as he then was) (the <strong>JC</strong>) where SPG was cross-examined on 12 September 2018 and 13 September 2018.</p>\n<p>The learned JC asked the counsels to attend in his physical chambers to deal with house-keeping matters. The attendance in chambers concluded shortly after noon on 13 September 2018, and at 1.22pm, TALLP filed SUM 4260 of 2018 in OS 1100 (the <strong>Recusal Application</strong>) for the learned JC to recuse himself from further hearing the proceedings.</p>\n<p>The Respondent filed an affidavit in support the next day (the <strong>Recusal Affidavit</strong>) which contained allegations against other legal practitioners without letting them have the opportunity to respond to the said allegations.

The Respondent returned the deposit of $7,000.00 to the Complainant on 19 January 2016.</p>\n<p>The bankruptcy order annulled on 27 August 2018 after an application by the Complainant’s new lawyers.</p>\n<p>The Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Giam Chin Toon SC and Mr Teo Weng Kie as DT member to investigate the complaint.</p>\n<p>Three charges (and its alternatives) were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h4><strong>First Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For grossly improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (<strong>LPA</strong>) in that the Respondent had failed to act promptly and diligently on the instructions of the client to set aside the Statutory Demand and/or to apply for an extension of time of the said deadline, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>Rules</strong>).</p>\n<h4><strong>Second Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For grossly improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA in that the Respondent failed to keep his client reasonably informed of the progress of the application to set aside the Statutory Demand and/or the application to extend the time to set aside the Statutory Demand, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the Rules.</p>\n<h4><strong>Third Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For grossly improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA in that the Respondent failed to use all legal means to advance the client’s interests to the extent that he may reasonably be expected to do so, and failed to take the necessary steps to apply to set aside the Statutory Demand and/or to apply for an extension of time of the said deadline, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) read with Rule 5(2)(j) of the Rules.</p>\n<p><em><strong>An alternative charge premised on section 83(2)(h) was preferred for each principal charge.</strong></em></p>\n<p>At the hearing, only the Alternative First Charge and Alternative Second Charge were proceeded with (<strong>Proceeded Charges</strong>), and the remaining charges withdrawn.</p>\n<h4><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT found that the Proceeded Charges were made out.</p>\n<p>The DT found that the Respondent was at all times fully aware of the deadline for the Setting Aside Application, but on the evidence, he had not shown any sign of concern or urgency even though time was fast running out.

charges (and its alternatives for the First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Charges) were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h4><strong>First Charge (Alternative First Charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA)</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (<strong>LPA</strong>), in that the Respondent had failed to ensure Mr Lim and Ms Sunil, who were practice trainees serving their respective practice training periods under separate practice training contracts with Foxwood LLC, were supervised by a supervising solicitor who had in force a practising certificate for a total of not less than five out of seven years immediately preceding the date of the supervision of each of the said practice trainees, in breach of Rule 36(2)(a)(ii) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>PCR</strong>).</p>\n<h4><strong>Second Charge (Alternative Second Charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA)</strong></h4>\n<p>For contravening Rule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011, by being the supervising solicitor during the practice training periods of Mr Lim and Ms Sunil, who were practice trainees serving their respective practice training periods under separate practice training contracts with Foxwood LLC, while having in force a practising certificate of a period of less than five out of the seven years immediately preceding the date of the commencement of the Respondent’s supervision of Mr Lim and Ms Sunil, which warrants disciplinary action within the meaning of section 83(2)(j) of the LPA.</p>\n<h4><strong>Amended Third Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, by behaving in a manner inconsistent with the public interest by being the supervising solicitor during the practice training periods of Mr Lim and Ms Sunil, who were practice trainees under separate practice training contracts with Foxwood LLC, when not having in force a practising certificate of a period of not less than five out of the seven years immediately preceding the date of the commencement of the Respondent’s supervision of Mr Lim and Ms Sunil as required under Rule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fourth Charge (Alternative Fourth Charge for a Breach of Rule 8(3)(b) PCR)</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, by taking unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by demanding that she pay Foxwood LLC the sum of $2,000 when this sum was not recoverable by due process of law, in breach of Rule 8(3)(a) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fifth Charge (Alternative Fifth Charge for Acting in a Manner Contrary to Position as a Member of an Honourable Profession in Breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR)</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, by acting in a manner which was deceitful by representing to Mr Lim, a practice trainee of Foxwood LLC, that by May 2020 the Respondent would meet the requirements under Rule 18(1) of the Legal Profession (Admissions) Rules 2011 to be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor during his practice training period when the Respondent knew this to be false, in breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT found that the First Charge, Second Charge, Alternative First Charge, Alternative Second Charge and Third Charge, were made out.</p>\n<p>The Fourth Charge, Alternative Fourth Charge, Fifth Charge, and Alternative Fifth Charge were not made out.</p>\n<p>The DT cited the principle in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena</em> [2005] 4 SLR(R) 320 (<strong>Selena Chiong</strong>) whereby all solicitors ought to be familiar with the rules made under the LPA, and will be deemed to be aware of their existence and applicability. It followed that each advocate and solicitor bore personal responsibility to ensure that the applicable rules of practice are strictly adhered to in all areas of his/her practice.</p>\n<p>The DT found that there was cause of sufficient gravity for the matter to be referred to the Court of Three Judges (<strong>C3J</strong>):</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>Under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA in respect of the First Charge;</li>\n<li>Under section 83(2)(j) of the LPA in respect of the Second Charge;</li>\n<li>Under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in respect of the Alternative First Charge, Alternative Second Charge and the Third Charge.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Respondent was further ordered by the DT to pay the Law Society’s costs.</p>\n<p>Council accepted the findings and recommendations of the DT and accordingly referred the matter to the C3J.</p>\n<p>The C3J found that due cause was proved under section&nbsp;83(2)(j) of the LPA on the Second Charge. The C3J <em>“agreed with the DT that the respondent “simply did not care whether there were any rules and, if so, what they were</em>.”</p>\n<p>The Respondent was suspended for 18 months with effect from 7 November 2022, and it was ordered for costs of $10,000 to be paid by the Respondent.*</p>\n<p>To access the full report, click <a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dtr_mar_2023_c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>*The decision of the C3J can be found in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Clarence Lun Yaodong</em> [2022] SGHC 269.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-mar-2023/\">Disciplinary Tribunal Reports</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg\">The Singapore Law Gazette</a>.</p>\n"

The Complainant and her husband, one Mr Padam Kumar Jawerilal Salecha, were shareholders and directors of Swina International Pte Ltd (<strong>Swina</strong>) at all material times.</p>\n<p>Swina engaged the Respondent to negotiate with Swina’s creditor banks in relation to outstanding loans of around S$16 million. The Complainant and her husband also engaged the Respondent also attend to the bankruptcy proceedings taken out against them on account they being guarantors of the loans taken out by Swina.</p>\n<p>The Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Roderick E Martin SC and Mdm Tan Gee Tuan as DT member.</p>\n<p>One charge and two alternative charges were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h3><strong>Charges</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (<strong>LPA</strong>) in that the Respondent failed to provide advice to his clients, in relation to the legal proceedings commenced against them, in breach of Rule 5(2)(h) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>PCR</strong>).</p>\n<h4><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Alternative Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services to his clients by failing to advise his clients in relation to the legal proceedings that had been commenced against them, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Alternative Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent failed to use all legal means to advance his clients’ interests to the extent that he may reasonably be expected to do so, by failing to advise his clients in relation to the legal proceedings that had been commenced against them, in breach of Rule 5(2)(j) of the PCR.</p>\n<h3><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions</strong></h3>\n<p>The DT found that the main charge, i.e. the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge, was made out on the facts beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>The DT found that the Respondent did not advise his clients on the options available to the client in response to bankruptcy and winding up applications, i.e. the prospect of voluntary arrangements, schemes of arrangements and/or judicial managements. Further, the Respondent failed to advise his clients on the issue of balance sheet solvency.</p>\n<p>The DT noted that Swina was balance sheet solvent at the material time, and this fact could have been relied on to either persuade creditor banks to grant more time for repayment, or at the very least, to seek an adjournment from the Court. The Respondent did not do that or advise the clients on the same.</p>\n<p>Because of the Respondent’s omissions, his clients did not consider making a revised repayment proposal to Maybank to avoid the bankruptcy and winding up orders.</p>\n<p>In addition, the DT found that the Respondent failed to advise his clients on their options moving forward after bankruptcy and winding up orders were made.</p>\n<p>The DT concluded that no cause of sufficient gravity existed for a referral to the Court of Three Judges, cognisant of the fact that there was no element of dishonesty on the Respondent’s part, and that he was a candid witness. The DT was of the view that a financial penalty was appropriate to address the Respondent’s misconduct. There was no order as to costs as the Complainant’s counsel had taken on the case on a <em>pro bono</em> basis.</p>\n<p>Council accepted the findings of the DT and imposed a financial penalty of S$10,000 on the Respondent.</p>\n<p>To access the full report, click <a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dtr_jan_2023-compressed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jan-2023/\">Disciplinary Tribunal Reports</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg\">The Singapore Law Gazette</a>.</p>\n"

The Firm rejected the Complainant’s request on the following grounds:</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>Payment made was non-refundable; and</li>\n<li>Payment was considered “<em>fully utilised</em>” upon access to the Portal pages.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the absence of an amicable resolution, the Complainant lodged a complaint against the Respondent by way of a letter to the Law Society of Singapore (<strong>the Law Society</strong>).</p>\n<p>Upon the application of Council, the Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Andre Yeap SC and Mr Anand Nalachandran as DT member.</p>\n<h3><strong>Charges </strong></h3>\n<p>Two (2) charges and two (2) alternative charges (collectively, the <strong>Charges</strong>) were preferred against the Respondent.</p>\n<h4><strong>First Charge </strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (<strong>LPA</strong>), in which the Respondent breached Rule 17(3) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (<strong>PCR</strong>), having failed to inform the Complainant that the fees paid were charged on a non-refundable basis.</p>\n<h4><strong>Alternative First Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, in that the Respondent failed to inform the Complainant that fees paid were charged on a non-refundable basis.</p>\n<h4><strong>Second Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, in which the Respondent breached Rules 5(2)(c) and (h) of the PCR, having failed to provide and/or initiate the timely provision of services paid for by the Complainant, despite representations that services were fast and expedient.</p>\n<h4><strong>Alternative Second Charge </strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, in that the Respondent failed to provide and/or initiate the timely provision of services paid for by the Complainant, despite representations that services were fast and expedient.</p>\n<h3><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT</strong></h3>\n<h4><strong>First Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT found that the First Charge was made out.</p>\n<p>The DT found that the Complainant had become a client of the Respondent and the Firm from the time the Complainant utilised the Portal and made payment of the fees on 12 February 2020. The DT found that the disclaimers on the Portal did not negate the presence of a retainer, noting that the disclaimers on the Portal referred to registered users as “<em>clients</em>”.</p>\n<p>The DT also found that the disclaimers on the Portal did not inform users that their payments were non-refundable. The DT did not accept the Respondent’s explanation that the phrase set out in the Portal being, “<em>your payment is considered fully utilized when you access the subsequent pages for the paid service</em>” adequately conveyed that fees were paid on a non-refundable basis as a “<em>fully utilized</em>” payment could still be refunded.</p>\n<h4><strong>Second Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT found that the Second Charge was not made out.</p>\n<p>The DT did not find that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in providing timely advice to the Complainant, as the Portal provided users with 30 days to edit the online forms submitted. The DT therefore concluded that the Respondent had not acted unreasonably in waiting for the Complainant to edit the forms.</p>\n<h3><strong>DT’s Recommendations</strong></h3>\n<p>Having made their findings on the Charges, the DT determined that while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be reprimanded.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to section 93(2) of the LPA, the DT ordered that costs fixed at $8,000 (plus reasonable disbursements) be paid to the Law Society.</p>\n<p>Council adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT.</p>\n<p>To access the full report, click <a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dtr_nov_22.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"underline\">here.</span></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-nov-2022/\">Disciplinary Tribunal Reports</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg\">The Singapore Law Gazette</a>.</p>\n"

The Complainant suffered some physical injuries. The Complainant, through his then solicitor, commenced DC Suit 2679/2015 (the <strong>Suit</strong>). The Respondent formally took over conduct of the Suit on 2 May 2016. United Legal Alliance LLC (<strong>ULA</strong>) represented Mr Chong.</p>\n<p>ULA wrote to the Respondent on 15 June 2016, and had requested for certain documents in relation to the Complainant’s case (<strong>Discovery Request</strong>). About two weeks later, the Complainant went to the Respondent’s office, and provided some documents to enable the Respondent to reply in part to the Discovery Request.</p>\n<p>On 30 June 2016, the Complainant sent a reminder to the Respondent via e-mail to respond to the Discovery Request. As the Complainant did not receive any update from the Respondent, he engaged a different solicitor in January 2017, who did a search of the Court’s file and informed the Complainant that the Suit was struck out.</p>\n<p>The Complainant’s claim for personal injury, if commenced in a fresh suit at the time it was struck out on 20 January 2017, would have potentially been time-barred. The Complainant eventually commenced civil proceedings against the Respondent for professional negligence, and the Respondent was found liable to pay the Complainant’s costs and disbursements, as well as $72,879.03 in damages.</p>\n<p>In relation to the complaint, the Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC and Mr Andrew Chan Chee Yin as DT member.</p>\n<p>Three charges (and its alternatives) were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h3><strong>First Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (<strong>LPA</strong>) in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent was aware of information that would reasonably affect the Complainant’s interests in the Suit, but failed to reasonably inform the Complainant of such information and/or the progress of the Suit, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) and/or Rule 5(2)(e) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>Rules</strong>).</p>\n<h3><strong>First Alternative Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent was aware of information that would reasonably affect the Complainant’s interests in the Suit, but failed to reasonably inform the Complainant of such information and/or the progress of the Suit.</p>\n<h3><strong>Second Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services; provide timely advice and/or use all legal means to advance the Complainant’s interests to the extent that the Respondent may reasonably be expected to do so, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c), Rule 5(2)(h) and/or Rule 5(2)(j) of the Rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Second Alternative Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services; provide timely advice and/or use all legal means to advance the Complainant’s interests to the extent that the Respondent may reasonably be expected to do so.</p>\n<h3><strong>Third Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent had failed to follow the lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that the Complainant was competent to give, which included failing to follow the Complainant’s instructions in his email to the Respondent dated 30 June 2016, in breach of Rule 5(2)(i) of the Rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Third Alternative Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to follow the lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that the Complainant was competent to give, which included failing to follow the Complainant’s instructions in his e-mail to the Respondent dated 30 June 2016.</p>\n<h3><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT; Council’s Sanctions</strong></h3>\n<p>The DT found that all three main charges (and its alternatives) were proven beyond reasonable doubt. There appeared to be no mitigating factors, while aggravating factors were present in this case.</p>\n<p>The DT was of the view that the Respondent could have complied with the Discovery Request but simply failed to, eventually causing the Suit to be struck out while leaving the Complainant in the dark.</p>\n<p>The DT emphasised that the Respondent’s conduct was egregious, and sounded its strong disapprobation of the same. Further, the DT also expressed its displeasure at the Respondent who failed and/or refused to file his Defence, List of Documents, and his Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief despite several reminders and extensions given by the DT.</p>\n<p>After considering the cases of <em>The Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer</em> [2019] SGDT 4 and <em>The Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar S/O Sethuraju</em> [2012] SGDT 4, the DT was of the view that this present case was more egregious than the 2 precedents above due to the Respondent’s contumelious and repeated failure to reasonably inform Mr Lim of his discovery obligations which ultimately led to the Suit being struck out.</p>\n<p>The DT found that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed, with the Respondent to be referred to the Court of 3 Judges (<strong>C3J</strong>). The DT had also awarded costs amounting to $8,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to the Law Society.</p>\n<p>Council adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and on 1 July 2022, the C3J ordered the Respondent to be suspended from practice for a period of five (5) years commencing 1 July 2022, and to pay the Law Society’s costs of $18,000 (inclusive of disbursements) with the costs orders made by the DT to remain.</p>\n<p>To access the full report, click <a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Oct_22_DT_Ooi_Oon_Tat.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2022/\">Disciplinary Tribunal Reports</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg\">The Singapore Law Gazette</a>.</p>\n"
