Hence, the Commission also initiated investigations to determine the\nOrganisation’s compliance with the PDPA in relation to Incident 2.\n\n1 The email addresses were “online-submission@case.org.sg” and “mediator1@case.org.sg”.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nThe Organisation requested for Incident 1 to be handled under the Expedited\n\nBreach Decision Procedure (“EDP”), which the Commission acceded to. After the\nCommission commenced its investigations into Incident 2, the Organisation likewise\nrequested for this incident to be handled under EDP, which the Commission also\nacceded to. To this end, the Organisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to all\nthe facts set out in this decision, and also to contraventions of sections 24 and 12(a)\nof the PDPA (as explained below).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation which aims to\n\npromote consumer interests, and fair and ethical trade practices. Amongst others, the\nOrganisation handles consumer-to-business disputes, where a consumer may engage\nthe Organisation to negotiate with the businesses with a view to reaching an amicable\nsettlement.\n\n6\n\nPersonal data in the Organisation’s possession or under the Organisation’s\n\ncontrol involved, amongst others, consumer complaints made to the Organisation.\nThese consumer complaints contained personal data such as the names, email\naddresses, contact numbers and complaint details.\n\nIncident 1 and Incident 2 (collectively, the “Incidents”)\n\nIncident 1\n\n7\n\nFor Incident 1, a total of 5,205 phishing emails were sent to 4,945 email\n\nrecipients from “online-submission@case.org.sg” and “mediator1@case.org.sg”\n(collectively, “the Affected Accounts”).\n\n3\n\n\f8\n\nOn 8 October 2022, some of the Organisation’s consumers received unsolicited\n\nemails from “online-submission@case.org.sg”, informing them that their complaints\nhad been escalated to the “collections and compensation department”, and that they\nwere eligible for a compensation payout. They were requested to click on a chat icon\nto fill in their banking details to complete the payment process. The account, “onlinesubmission@case.org.sg”, was utilised by the Organisation to communicate with\nconsumers who lodge complaints on the Organisation’s website (“Complaint” or\n“Complaints”).\n\n9\n\nSubsequently on\n\n“mediator1@case.org.sg”\n\n9 October 2022,\nto\n\nthe\n\nsimilar emails were sent\n\nOrganisation’s\n\nconsumers.\n\nThe\n\nfrom\n\naccount,\n\n“mediator1@case.org.sg”, was utilised by the Organisation to communicate with\nconsumers whose complaints were escalated to mediation.\n\n10\n\nThereafter, in January 2023 and February 2023, the Organisation received\n\ncomplaints of further phishing emails being sent to the Organisation’s consumers from\nemail addresses which did not originate from the Organisation’s domain. Based on the\ncircumstances, these affected consumers’ emails were likely harvested by the threat\nactor during the course of Incident 1. Further, based on the fact that the threat actor\nsent phishing emails to these consumers through external email addresses, the\nCommission considers that personal data relating to these consumers would have\nbeen exfiltrated.\n\n11\n\nIn connection with the above, 3 of the Organisation’s consumers informed the\n\nOrganisation that they had clicked on the chat icon embedded in the phishing emails,\nand had money withdrawn from their bank accounts. These individuals allegedly\nsuffered monetary losses of S$900, S$68,000 and S$149,000. The Organisation had\n4\n\n\fmade a police report, and was informed by the police to let them handle the\ninvestigations.\n\n12\n\nThe phishing emails sent in Incident 1 were generally of the same content and\n\nformat, did not contain any Complaint-specific details, and consisted of fictitious data.\n\n13\n\nThe Organisation engaged a private forensic expert (“PFE”) to ascertain the\n\ncause and extent of Incident 1. The PFE’s forensic investigations revealed that:\n\n(a)\n\nThe threat actor had successfully signed into the Affected Accounts\nusing the correct login credentials.\n\n(b)\n\nIt is likely that the correct login credentials were obtained from a\nsuccessful phishing attack on an employee of the Organisation.\n\n(c)\n\nBy gaining unauthorised access to the Affected Accounts, the threat\nactor was (1) able to harvest email addresses of the Organisation’s\nconsumers from emails in the Inbox and Sent mailboxes of these\naccounts; and (2) send phishing emails on behalf of the Organisation\nwith the Organisation’s verified domain name.\n\n(d) Further, some of the Organisation’s computers were running on end-oflife operating systems, and had vulnerable software with unapplied\nupgrades / security patches, which put the Organisation at risk of remote\ncode execution vulnerability.\n\n5\n\n\f14\n\nIn terms of the volume of personal data affected in Incident 1, the Commission\n\nnotes that:\n\n(a)\n\nThe compromising of the account “online-submission@case.org.sg”\nexposed up to 22,542 email addresses to harvesting by the threat actor.\nThis account was used to send system-generated acknowledgment\nemails to the Organisation’s consumers upon receipt of their Complaints\nthrough the Organisation’s website.\n\n(b)\n\nThe other compromised account, “mediator1@case.org.sg”, did not\ncontain any data.\n\n(c)\n\nBeyond these 22,542 email addresses, investigations did not reveal any\nfurther personal data that the threat actor had access to.\n\nIncident 2\n\n15\n\nOn 22 June 2023, in the course of investigating the circumstances surrounding\n\nIncident 1, the Commission received a complaint from a consumer of the Organisation.\nThe complainant had received a targeted phishing email sent by an email address\nwhich did not originate from the Organisation’s domain. The email was addressed to\nthe consumer, and reproduced the consumer’s Complaint submitted to the\nOrganisation.\n\n16\n\nSubsequently, the Organisation was informed of the occurrence of more of such\n\nsimilar incidents. In total, 28 individuals informed the Organisation that they received\nphishing emails (reflecting the same details they shared in their original Complaints to\nthe Organisation) from email addresses which did not originate from the Organisation’s\n\n6\n\n\fdomain. Since such data was contained within the Organisation’s systems, the\nunavoidable conclusion is that their personal data (at the very least, their email\naddresses and Complaints) had been exfiltrated from the Organisation’s systems.\n\n17\n\nWhilst the investigations did not yield a definitive conclusion regarding how the\n\ndata breach in Incident 2 actually occurred, the Commission concludes that based on\nthe circumstances set out below, Incident 2 likely occurred during a data migration\nexercise conducted by the Organisation.\n\n18\n\nAll of the 28 individuals had filed Complaints with the Organisation between 8\n\nJanuary 2019 to 19 December 2019. Investigations found that these Complaints were\nincluded as part of a data migration exercise the Organisation undertook when it\nchanged from a former vendor, Exabytes Network (Singapore) Pte Ltd, to a new\nvendor, Total eBiz Solutions Pte Ltd (“TES”) (collectively, the “Vendors”) sometime\nbetween 24 December 2019 to 1 January 2020 (the “Data Migration”). The\nOrganisation had contacted both Vendors, and there was no evidence of suspicious\nactivity during the weeks preceding the sending of the phishing emails. As such, the\nOrganisation indicated that it was likely that the data breach occurred during the Data\nMigration, which the Commission accepted.\n\n19\n\nThe Commission notes that the personal data of approximately 12,218\n\nindividuals involved in the Data Migration was put at risk of unauthorised access and\nexfiltration.\n\n7\n\n\f20\n\nThe following types of personal data were affected:\nTypes of personal data\n\nNumber of affected\nindividuals\nName, email address, contact number and 4,074\nComplaint details\nName, email address and contact number\n192\nName, contact number and Complaint details\n2,012\nName and contact number\n1,742\nName, email address and Complaint details\n155\nName and email address\n52\nContact number\n3,991\nTotal 12,218\n21\n\nThe Commission ascertained and was notified by the Organisation that none of\n\nthe affected individuals for Incident 2 suffered monetary losses.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n22\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\nActions to mitigate and contain Incident 1\n\n(a)\n\nEngaged a third party PFE to assist in investigations and perform a\nvulnerability assessment;\n\n(b)\n\nInformed email recipients who had received phishing emails from the\nAffected Accounts not to click on any links within the email;\n\n(c)\n\nPublished a media release, and alerts on the Organisation’s website and\nFacebook account to alert consumers to the phishing emails;\n\n(d)\n\nSuspended the Affected Accounts, and reset passwords of all\nadministrator accounts with increased complexity requirement; and\n\n8\n\n\f(e)\n\nAssembled a taskforce to manage the incident, conduct investigations,\nand provide recommendations to improve the cybersecurity of the\nOrganisation.\n\nActions to mitigate and contain Incident 2\n\n(a)\n\nInformed consumers not to click on phishing emails, and remained in\ncommunication with the 28 consumers who had informed the\nOrganisation of the phishing emails; and\n\n(b)\n\nPublished a media release, and alerts on the Organisation’s website and\nFacebook account to alert consumers to the phishing emails.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n\n(a)\n\nImplemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for all web-based\napplications including Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”)\nsoftware;\n\n(b)\n\nProcured a security package against malware, spams, and phishing\nemails;\n\n(c)\n\nImplemented enhanced password strength / complexity requirements,\nand mandatory password change for all mailboxes every 3 months;\n\n(d)\n\nReviewed and tightened access rights to system functions;\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented measures to ensure that contracts with all outsourced\nvendors include data protection clauses, and that vendors comply with\n\n9\n\n\fthe PDPA and the Organisation’s standard operating procedures for\nhandling personal data;\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented data protection training for all new staff, and annual\nrefresher training for all existing staff;\n\n(g)\n\nDecommissioned all end-of-life devices;\n\n(h)\n\nInstalled patch management software for security updates to be pushed\nthrough remotely;\n\n(i)\n\nArrangements are being made for the Organisation to obtain the Cyber\nEssentials Mark and subsequently the Data Protection Trust Mark; and\n\n(j)\n\nArranged to perform a penetration test to identify cybersecurity gaps\nafter the vulnerabilities identified by the PFE have been rectified.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n23\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incidents, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under Section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). Further, as the Organisation indicated that it did not have any\nInformation and Communications Technology (“ICT”) policies in place, the\n\n10\n\n\fOrganisation’s compliance with Section 12 of the PDPA (the “Accountability\nObligation”) was also investigated.\n\n24\n\nThe issues for determination are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under the\nAccountability Obligation.\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under the Protection\nObligation\n\n25\n\nTo comply with the Protection Obligation, an organisation must implement\n\nsecurity arrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. This\nincludes a consideration of the nature of the personal data in the Organisation’s\npossession and control, as well as the potential impact that unauthorised disclosure\nof the personal data might have on the affected persons2.\n\nInadequate enforcement and formulation of password policies\n\n26\n\nPoor management of accounts and passwords are one of the most common\n\ncauses of data breaches. As a necessary measure of data protection, organisations\nmust adopt, implement, and enforce a strong and robust password policy3 to ensure\n\n2 See the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Revised 16 May 2022) at\n\n[17.2].\n3 See Cognita Asia Holdings Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPCS 14 at [7].\n\n11\n\n\fthat their IT systems are not vulnerable to common hacking attempts such as brute\nforce attacks4.\n\n27\n\nIn terms of basic practices, a password policy should include reasonable\n\npassword controls such as mandating a minimum level of password complexity and/or\nlength, and enforcing a maximum validity period for a password, the duration of which\nis in turn tied to the complexity of the password5. Having set an internal password\npolicy, it is incumbent on an organisation to enforce its password policy to ensure\ncompliance.\n\n28\n\nThe Commission takes the view that the Organisation’s password management\n\npolicy was manifestly insufficient to safeguard the personal data in its possession.\nFirst, the Organisation did not enforce its own password policy. Investigations\ndisclosed that the Organisation’s password policy required (i) a minimum length of 8\ncharacters for passwords; and (ii) a mixture of alphabets and numbers (the “Password\nComplexity Policy”). However, the password for one of the Affected Accounts was\n“olse432”, which has 7 characters and would not have satisfied the Organisation’s\nPassword Complexity Policy. Yet, this password was in use because the Organisation\ndid not system-enforce its Password Complexity Policy requirements.\n\n29\n\nSecond, the Organisation admitted that it failed to adopt and enforce a policy\n\non how frequently the passwords ought to be changed. The Affected Accounts were\ncreated in January 2019 and February 2019, and the passwords for both Affected\nAccounts had remained unchanged for almost 4 years prior to Incident 1. In the\nCommission’s view, if the Organisation had formulated a password policy setting out\n\n4 See LoveBonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3 at [18].\n5 See the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems.\n\n12\n\n\fhow long a password would remain valid and how frequently the password ought to\nbe changed as a result, it is unlikely that the period of 4 years would have been\ndeemed reasonable. The Organisation’s failure to adopt and enforce a password\npolicy that included the maximum validity period for a password was a serious lapse\nof its obligation to protect the personal data in its possession or control by adopting\nreasonable security arrangements.\n\n30\n\nAs a result of the above weaknesses, the threat actor successfully managed to\n\naccess the Affected Accounts, resulting in the data breach that occurred in Incident 1.\n\n31\n\nThe Organisation accepted that it had failed to (i) enforce its own Password\n\nComplexity Policy requiring the use of passwords of sufficient complexity, and (ii)\nadopt and enforce a password policy that requires the login passwords to be changed\nat a fixed duration.\n\n32\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admissions, the\n\nOrganisation is found to have breached the Protection Obligation by failing to\nimplement and enforce an adequate password policy to protect the personal data in\nits possession or under its control.\n\nFailure to stipulate clear security responsibilities in contracts with the\nOrganisation’s Vendors\n\n33\n\nThe Commission had highlighted in previous decisions the need for an\n\norganisation to put in place appropriate contractual provisions with its data\nintermediaries that set out the obligations and responsibilities of the data intermediary\nto protect the organisation’s personal data, and the parties’ respective roles to protect\n\n13\n\n\fthe personal data6. This applies to all cases where service providers / vendors process\npersonal data on behalf of a data controller.\n\n34\n\nFurther, in the Commission’s handbook on How to Guard against Common\n\nTypes of Data Breaches7, it is recommended that organisations establish clear\nresponsibility for ICT security. Where such responsibilities are to be carried out by a\nvendor, the scope of work and area of responsibilities ought to be clearly stated in the\ncontract.\n\n35\n\nAs highlighted at [18] above, Data Migration took place between the\n\nOrganisation’s Vendors between 24 December 2019 to 1 January 2020.\n\n36\n\nHowever, investigations revealed that the Organisation’s contract with one of\n\nthe Vendors involved did not stipulate clear security responsibilities in relation to its\nICT systems or data.\n\n37\n\nIn relation to TES, the Organisation indicated that it had engaged TES to\n\ndevelop a customised CRM solution based on off-the-shelf software. The Organisation\nindicated that TES was required to conduct proactive monitoring to identify possible\nunauthorised access or disclosure and inform the Organisation of any possible system\nbreach. However, the contract with TES did not contain any provisions for\ncybersecurity protection services and such security responsibilities were not expressly\nspecified in the contract between the Organisation and TES.\n\n6 See Re Singapore Health Services Pte Ltd & Ors [2019] SGPDPC 3 at [59]; Times Software Pte Ltd and\n\nothers [2020] SGPDPC 18 at [19] and Re Smiling Orchard (S) Pte Ltd and Ors [2016] SGPDPC 19 at [45].\n7 See the Commission’s handbook on How to Guard against Common Types of Data Breaches (at page\n\n13).\n\n14\n\n\f38\n\nOn this basis, the Organisation admits negligence in failing to manage its\n\nvendor closely.\n\n39\n\nWhilst the investigations did not definitively conclude how the threat actor\n\ngained unauthorised access to the affected personal data in Incident 2 during the Data\nMigration, the Organisation’s negligent vendor management put personal data under\nits control at risk of unauthorised access and disclosure.\n\n40\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admissions, the\n\nOrganisation is found to have breached the Protection Obligation by failing to stipulate\nclear security responsibilities in the contracts with the Vendors.\n\nFailure to conduct staff training\n\n41\n\nIn Tanah Merah Country Club [2021] SGPDPCS 16, the Commission had\n\nemphasised that staff training is a critical and necessary component to ensure that an\norganisation is well placed to protect the personal data in its possession and/or control.\nThe Protection Obligation extends to and includes the training of all employees who\nhave to handle personal data in the course of their work so that an organisation’s\nemployees can then successfully adopt and implement the policies and best practices\nnecessary to ensure the protection of personal data in an organisation’s possession\nand/or control8.\n\n42\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation admitted that it had failed to conduct regular\n\nsecurity awareness training for its staff. The Organisation had last conducted data\nprotection training in 2017, around 5 years before Incident 1. Since then, there had not\n\n8 See Tanah Merah Country Club [2021] SGPDPCS 16 at [13].\n\n15\n\n\fbeen any other training including but not limited to proper device usage or\ncybersecurity awareness. While the Organisation’s IT department would send out\nemail alerts to its staff from time to time to warn staff against phishing attacks, this\nalone, in the absence of regular security awareness training for its staff was\ninadequate.\n\n43\n\nThis lack of adequate staff training to address cybersecurity risks rendered the\n\nOrganisation more vulnerable to risks that target its staff, such as phishing attacks.\nIndeed, the Organisation admitted that the credentials for the Affected Accounts were\nlikely leaked by successful phishing attacks.\n\n44\n\nMore should have been done by the Organisation to build awareness and\n\neducate its staff on the potential cyber security risks, including risks of phishing\nattacks.\n\n45\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admissions, the\n\nOrganisation is found to have breached the Protection Obligation by failing to conduct\nadequate staff training.\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with the Accountability Obligation\n\n46\n\nThe Accountability Obligation requires organisations to undertake measures in\n\norder to ensure that they meet their obligations under the PDPA and, importantly,\ndemonstrate that they can do so when required9. One such requirement is Section\n12(a) of the PDPA which requires an organisation to develop and implement policies\nand practices that are necessary to meet its obligations under the PDPA.\n9 See the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act\n\n(Revised 16 May 2022) at [21.2].\n\n16\n\n\f47\n\nDuring investigation, the Organisation confirmed that prior to Incident 1, it did\n\nnot have any ICT policies to cover critical aspects in IT security (including aspects of\napplying security patches / software updates). The Organisation admitted it had simply\n“relied on its IT staff to conduct maintenance and updates, as and when necessary”.\n\n48\n\nThis was manifestly inadequate. In Re Marshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34, the Commission had stressed that “relying solely on employees\nto perform their tasks diligently is not a sufficient reasonable security arrangement,\nand the organisation would need to take proactive steps to protect personal data”. 10\n\n49\n\nInvestigation also revealed that:\n\n(a)\n\nThere were insufficient email security measures. In this regard,\ninadequate email security solutions may fail to detect or prevent\nsuspicious login attempts or unauthorized access.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation did not have in place sufficient logging and monitoring\npractices to detect suspicious or unusual activities or unauthorized\naccess promptly.\n\n(c)\n\nThere were no controls internally to monitor the security of the\nOrganisation’s systems. The Organisation did not have a documented IT\nInfrastructure management plan or process for the protection and\nsecurity of its systems.\n\n10 See Re Marshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 34 at [21].\n\n17\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had not performed any security reviews\nof its systems in the 3 years preceding Incident 1.\n\n50\n\nAs a result of the Organisation’s lack of such policies, it was discovered by the\n\nPFE that more than 30 out of the Organisation’s 45 computers had critical and highrisk vulnerabilities which put the Organisation at risk of threat actors compromising or\nexploiting the systems.\n\n51\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admission, the\n\nCommission finds that the Organisation has failed to meet its obligations under section\n12(a) of the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n52\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA\nwere considered.\n\n53\n\nIn terms of the type and nature of the personal data affected by the\n\nOrganisation’s non-compliance:\n\n(a)\n\nIn relation to Incident 1, the Commission notes that given the nature of\nthe usages of the Affected Accounts, the threat actor was confined to\naccessing and harvesting the email addresses of the Organisation’s\nconsumers contained in the emails in the Inbox and Sent mailboxes of\nthese accounts. In this regard, the threat actor was able to harvest up to\n22,542 email addresses.\n\n18\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn relation to Incident 2, the Commission notes that that the personal data\nof approximately 12,218 individuals was put at risk of unauthorised\naccess and exfiltration. The personal data affected included a\ncombination of names, email addresses, contact numbers and\nComplaint details. Some targeted phishing emails sent in Incident 2\naimed at causing financial losses to the affected individuals, and used\nthe relevant Complaint details exfiltrated to appear more convincing and\nlegitimate. This exposed the affected individuals to greater risks of actual\nfinancial losses.\n\n54\n\nIn terms of the nature, gravity and duration of the non-compliance by the\n\nOrganisation, the Organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation and\nAccountability Obligation in relation to both Incidents continued for a long duration of\nmore than three years.

On 4 August 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was informed about a data breach incident involving the\nOrganisation’s servers being infected by ransomware on or about 13 July 2023.\nConsequently, personal data of 6,574 individuals had been exfiltrated and posted on\nthe dark web (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for the investigation\n\nto proceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision.\n1\n\n\fIt also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation first discovered malware artifacts in its servers after reports\n\nby staff members of network connectivity issues on 13 July 2023. The Organisation\nimmediately disconnected the affected servers and sought an external IT forensic\ninvestigator to investigate the extent of the Incident and undertake remedial action.\n\n4\n\nInvestigations revealed that data from the Organisation had been uploaded on\n\nthe dark web (the “Leaked Data”), including full credit card information of over 1,000\nindividuals. Separately, a total of 4.4TB of files in the Organisation’s servers had been\nencrypted due to ransomware deployment.\n\n5\n\nFrom system event logs, upon gaining initial entry the threat actor accessed 6\n\nservers (the “Affected Servers”) and 1 staff computer using Remote Desktop Protocol\n(“RDP”) connections, then deployed malicious tools that could harvest credentials\nwithin folders and disarm antivirus and threat detection software. The investigation\nrevealed the following lapses which could have contributed to the Incident:\n(a) The Organisation’s firewall FortiOS had not been patched since July 2021\nand had been susceptible to a critical severity attack1 which could be\n\nCVE-2023-27997 is a critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS’ SSL-VPN preauthentication component that is exploitable by attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fexploited at pre-authentication to allow a remote attacker to gain entry to\nsystems without using credentials.\n(b) Endpoint Detection and Response (“EDR”) applications installed on the\nAffected Servers and devices did not detect and prevent the execution of\nmalicious tools. The EDR Manager was compromised early and disabled by\nthe threat actor before executing ransomware and file encryption.\n(c) The Organisation’s environment was highly vulnerable to exploitations due to\noperating systems in 2 of the Affected Servers having reached End-of-Life\nstages in July 2015 and January 2020 respectively.\n(d) Critical hosts and staff computers had not been regularly scanned for\nvulnerabilities.\n(e) There had been a lack of essential threat detection solutions and proper logs\nretention as EDR applications installed in the Organisation’s environment\neither could not be supported by its operating systems or had outdated\nnetwork signatures2.\n(f) There had been a lack of documented robust processes implemented at the\ntime of the Incident to ensure regular patching and updates of important\nsoftware.\n\n2\n\nNetwork signatures match patterns of an attack that can crash applications or exploit the operating\nsystems on client computers. It can be changed to block or allow traffic.\n\n3\n\n\f6\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the exfiltrated data contained\n\npersonal data of 6,574 current and former members, participants of events, activities\nand/or in-training examinations organised/administered by the Organisation. The\ntypes of affected personal data are set out below. Not every affected individual had all\nof the personal data below in their personal data sets.\ni.\n\nName;\n\nii.\n\nAddress;\n\niii.\n\nPersonal email address;\n\niv.\n\nTelephone number;\n\nv.\n\nNRIC number;\n\nvi.\n\nPassport number;\n\nvii.\n\nPhotograph number;\n\nviii.\n\nPhotograph (ID photo);\n\nix.\n\nDate of birth; and\n\nx.\n\nFinancial information, including bank account details, partially redacted\n\ncredit card numbers, and credit card numbers with CVV and expiry date of\n1,083 individuals.\n\n4\n\n\f7\n\nThe Commission’s analysis of the Leaked Data by the threat actor found that it\n\nhad contained approximately 12.7GB of data from the Organisation. It was observed\nthat bank account details and credit card numbers with CVV and expiry dates had\nbeen stored in clear text without password protection or current standard file\nencryption. A list of login credentials to various online platforms used by the\nOrganisation could also be found within the Leaked Data, including credentials to its\nwebsite management system and passwords to various administrative emails.\n\nRemedial Action\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation promptly notified the affected\n\nindividuals about the Incident. The Organisation also took the following remedial\nactions:\n(a) Activated a Crisis Response Team to facilitate forensic investigations and\naddress queries related to the Incident;\n(b) Notified the relevant authorities i.e. Singapore Police Force, Cyber Security\nAgency of Singapore and Ministry of Health of the Incident;\n(c) Replaced its outdated firewall firmware to a newer version;\n(d) Tightened access controls by enabling geo-blocking on the firewall and VPN\nconfigured to only allow access to its networks via local IP addresses;\n(e) Installed and activated two-factor authentication for all staff members;\n\n5\n\n\f(f) Implemented Action 1 Patch Management that automated vulnerability\nremediation for operating systems and third-party applications, and\ncontinuous patch compliance for all servers;\n(g) Implemented monthly checks on system and software patches;\n(h) Conducted vulnerability scans on all staff-issued computers and devices;\n(i) Restored files from their tape backup and performed malware scans of the\nrestored files and all staff-issued laptops and devices; and\n(j) Engaged a third-party vendor to provide credit monitoring services to affected\nindividuals at no charges, whose financial information had been affected in\nthe Incident, to help detect any suspicious transactions that might affect the\naffected individuals’ credit reputation.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n9\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n10\n\nThe Organisation’s admissions amounted to the following breaches of section\n\n24 of the PDPA:\n6\n\n\f(a) Lack of sufficiently robust processes for updates or upgrades of important\nsoftware or firmware, which resulted in vulnerabilities that were not removed\nin the Organisation’s firewall and servers. The Organisation said that its IT\nvendor at the time of the Incident had only been onboarded in April 2023 and\nhad been focused on troubleshooting issues that arose in 2 events of system\ndowntime in May and June 2023. Prior to the system downtimes, the\nOrganisation also conducted an IT infrastructure review completed on 26\nJune 2023 that included identifying obsolete devices to remove and improving\nnetwork security. Hence, written procedures or policies on patch\nmanagement for software and firmware had yet to be developed and\nimplemented at the time. However, the Commission determined that these\ncircumstances did not mitigate the lack of sufficiently robust processes for\nupdating or upgrading important software and firmware that saw firewall\npatches not being carried out since July 2021 and servers with End-of-Life\n(“EOL”) operating systems not being upgraded.\n(b) Failure to have reasonable access control, in response to the need to\nenhance access control to the type of financial information in its possession\nor under its control. This financial information had included credit card\nnumbers with their security codes (CVVs). These had been stored in servers\nin plain text without password protection. Given the risk of harm due to the\nnature of this personal data, the Organisation could have considered\nadditional security options to enhance access controls to protect this data.\n7\n\n\fThe Commission highlighted in Re Tokyo Century Leasing (Singapore Pte\nLtd [2023] SGPDPC 9 in paragraph 11 that such data has a heightened risk\nof identity theft and/or financial loss, which called for a higher standard of\nsecurity arrangements. Examples may include separate password protection\nfor the server holding this data, encryption of the data, restrictions to the\nexport of this data, or, given the Organisation’s choice of endpoint security\nsolutions, real-time security monitoring of the data server.\n(c) Failure to stipulate data protection requirements or clear job specifications in\nthe contract of its IT vendor, specifically in the areas of the management and\nmaintenance of IT system security and the conduct of security reviews.\nWhere organisations rely on vendors to perform IT security maintenance and/\nor review, the scope of these services must be stipulated in the vendor\ncontract as part of the duty of a data controller under the Protection\nObligation.\n\n11\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n12\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA, the Commission considered all relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\n\n8\n\n\fdata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n13\n\nThe Commission considered that the personal data of 6,574 individuals had\n\nbeen affected as a result of the above breach. Further, the affected data included\nfinancial information comprising of bank account numbers and full credit card\ninformation of 1,083 individuals were leaked on the dark web.\n\n14\n\nThe Commission also considered the fact that for more than 3 years, the\n\nOrganisation had continued to deploy vulnerable servers with EOL operating systems\nfor which support and security updates had ceased since July 2015.\n\n15\n\nThe Commission considered the following mitigating factors:\n(a) The Organisation was cooperative during the course of our investigations;\n(b) The Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c) This is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the PDPA.\n\n16\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $9,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n9\n\n\fDirections\n\n17\n\nIn addition, to ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the Protection\n\nObligation, the Organisation is directed to report to the Commission on the completion\nof the following remedial actions:\n(a) Assess the need for perimeter firewalls to restrict nonstandard outbound port\naccess as per its network requirements and configure said firewalls if needed;\n(b) Conduct a thorough security architecture review and assess the need to\nsegregate sections of its network that support primary processing of personal\ndata for its purposes from sections of the network that store personal data to\nreduce the risk of unauthorised access from within the network;\n(c) Assess the need to implement hardening for endpoints, servers and network\ndevices including password policies;\n(d) Identify the sensitive personal data stored in its environment and remove or\nencrypt the information according to data security best practices e.g. the\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standards for handling payment card\ndata;\n(e) Delete any stored CVV numbers and implement policy against storing CVV\nnumbers after the initial transaction authorisation;\n\n10\n\n\f(f) Implement annual periodic security reviews of IT policies, processes and\nprocedures to ensure compliance and alignment with security best practices;\nand\n(g) Prepare and submit to the Commissioner a written report of the completion of\nthe remediation actions directed above within 60 days.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the above summary\nof the Decision:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

Ltd. (“GLS”) and Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation Ltd\n(the “Organisation”) respectively about a data breach incident (the “Incident”)\ninvolving unauthorised access and exfiltration of personal data from servers belonging\nto GLS. One of the affected servers (the “Affected Server”) contained the personal\ndata of, amongst others, the Organisation’s employees, ex-employees, directors and\nshareholders (the “Personal Data”).\n\n2\n\nSubsequently, the Commission commenced investigations to determine\n\nwhether the circumstances relating to the Incident disclosed any breaches of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n3\n\nAfter carrying out preliminary investigations, on 27 February 2023, the\n\nCommission accepted a voluntary undertaking from GLS pursuant to section\n48(L)(1)(a) of the PDPA for GLS to implement enhanced security arrangements. No\nfurther enforcement action was taken against GLS.\n2\n\n\f4\n\nOn 2 March 2023, the Organisation requested for the investigation to proceed\n\nunder the Expedited Decision Procedure, which the Commission acceded to. To this\nend, the Organisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision, and to the Organisation’s breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nRelationship between Organisation and GLS\n\n5\n\nAt the material time, the Organisation provided logistics and data centre\n\nservices, with operations across Asia Pacific and Europe.\n\n6\n\nPrior to 1 July 2022, the Organisation was the sole shareholder of Keppel\n\nLogistics Pte Ltd (which is now known as GLS). On 1 July 2022, the Organisation\ndivested then-Keppel Logistics Pte Ltd to Geodis International SAS, following which it\nwas renamed to GLS (the “Divestment”).\n\n7\n\nFor ease of reference, “GLS” is used to refer to both Keppel Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n(prior to 1 July 2022) and Geodis Logistics Singapore Pte Ltd (from 1 July 2022\nonwards).\n\nStoring of Personal Data on Affected Server\n\n8\n\nAt all material times, the Affected Server belonged to GLS. Prior to the\n\nDivestment, the Organisation and GLS utilised the Affected Server as a shared IT\nresource. Personal data of, amongst others, the Organisation and its affiliated entities’\nemployees, ex-employees, directors and shareholders was stored in the Affected\nServer.\n\n3\n\n\fMigration to Cloud in May 2020\n\n9\n\nIn or around May 2020, the Organisation, then the sole shareholder of GLS,\n\nmigrated its data (including the Personal Data stored on the Affected Server) (the\n“Migration”) to an entirely cloud-based storage solution (the “Cloud”). The Migration\nwas overseen by the Organisation’s IT department, which provided guidance to other\nstaff on the technical procedures for migrating their data to the Cloud. When briefing\nstaff about the Migration in late 2018, the Organisation did not give specific instructions\nto delete the Personal Data from the Affected Server after the Migration. The actual\ndata migration was not undertaken by the IT department because of IT access control\nrestrictions, and was left to the relevant staff to carry out themselves. The data\nmigration was also not supervised by the IT department because the staff were\nexpected to be responsible for their own data and files.\n\n10\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation’s staff did not delete the Personal Data\n\nfrom the Affected Server after copying the said data to the Cloud. The Personal Data\ntherefore continue to reside on the Affected Server post-Migration.\n\n11\n\nWhile the Organisation’s prevailing policies and practices provided for the\n\ndisposal / purging of data and decommissioning of systems that were no longer\nneeded by the Organisation, the Affected Server continued being used by GLS for its\nday-to-day operations post-Migration. The Affected Server was therefore not identified\nfor decommissioning and the Personal Data contained therein was therefore not\ndisposed / purged following the Migration. By the Organisation’s own admission, it\noverlooked that the Personal Data continued to reside in the Affected Server postMigration.\n\n4\n\n\fDivestment in July 2022\n\n12\n\nIn the lead up to the Divestment in July 2022, the Organisation’s IT department\n\nreminded staff in March 2022 to “transfer” files stored on the Affected Server to the\nCloud, because the Organisation would not be able to access the Affected Server\nfollowing the Divestment. However, it was again not made clear that the staff should\nalso delete the files after the transfer. As with the Migration in May 2020, the\nOrganisation did not delete the Personal Data from the Affected Server during the\nDivestment in July 2022. By the Organisation’s own admission, at the point of\nDivestment, it had once again overlooked that the Personal Data continued to reside\nin the Affected Server.\nThe Incident\n\n13\n\nOn or around 3 October 2022, the Organisation was alerted by a third-party\n\ncybersecurity consultant (engaged by a related entity of the Organisation) (the\n“Consultant”) of suspicious activities in relation to the Affected Server.\n\n14\n\nInvestigations revealed that an anonymous threat actor gained unauthorised\n\naccess to the Affected Server on 5 September 2022 through a compromised account\nof one of GLS’ vendors and accessed multiple files on the Affected Server between 1\nand 2 October 2022.\n\n15\n\nThere was also evidence of data exfiltration from the Affected Server. A\n\nransomware group published nine encrypted files on the dark web which it claimed\ncontained data from GLS, and one unencrypted file which it claimed was a list of the\nfiles contained within the nine encrypted files (the “File Listing”). The Organisation\nreviewed the File Listing and confirmed that it contained a subset of the files on the\n5\n\n\fAffected Server. However, the Organisation was unable to ascertain whether the\nencrypted files in fact contained the Personal Data stored in the Affected Server.\n\n16\n\nWhile it is therefore not definitively known what data was actually exfiltrated,\n\nthe Commission notes that the personal data of approximately 22,6591 individuals\n(“Affected Individuals”) was put at risk of unauthorised access and exfiltration, of\nwhich up to 7,1842 individuals’ personal data could have actually been exfiltrated.\n\n17\n\nThe Affected Individuals comprised employees and ex-employees of the\n\nOrganisation and its subsidiaries, the Organisation’s shareholders when it was listed\non the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST), and other\nindividuals relating to the Organisation’s finance departments or with whom the\nOrganisation, its subsidiaries or their respective employees had commercial or\nbusiness dealings.\n\n18\n\nIn terms of the types of personal data affected for each individual:\n(a)\n\nThe majority of the datasets (up to 19,752) comprised a combination of\nthe individual’s name, address, number of shares, and any of the\nfollowing: identity number, nationality, and country of origin.\n\n(b)\n\nA smaller number of datasets (up to 2,907) included a combination of the\nindividual’s name and one or more of the following: address, identity\nnumber, full image copy of the identity document, passport, passport\nphoto, email address, telephone number, signatures, bank account\n\n1 This is based on the Personal Data contained in the Affected Server.\n2 This is based on the File Listing.\n\n6\n\n\fnumber, date of birth, salary, nationality, educational qualifications,\nfamily information and images and/or information on re-entry permit.\n\nPartial notification of affected individuals\n\n19\n\nOn 19 December 2022, the Organisation sought a waiver of the requirement to\n\nnotify certain categories of overseas-based Affected Individuals3 of the occurrence of\nthe Incident under section 26D(7) of the PDPA, on the basis that the Organisation\ndoes not have contact information of these individuals and/or that the affected\nPersonal Data is historical salary information and out-dated, such that the Incident is\nunlikely to result in significant harm.\n\n20\n\nHaving considered the circumstances surrounding the Organisation’s request,\n\nthe Commission granted a waiver in respect of the individuals whose contact\ninformation the Organisation did not have and could not obtain after making\nreasonable enquiries.\n\n21\n\nHowever, the Commission refused to grant a waiver where the Organisation’s\n\nsole reason for seeking the waiver was that the affected Personal Data concerned outdated salary information as at 2018, because the Commission considered such\ninformation to be sufficiently recent such that there is still a likelihood of significant\nharm accruing as a result of the unauthorised disclosure of their personal data.\n\n22\n\nSave for those individuals whom the Commission has waived the notification\n\nrequirements for, the Organisation has notified all Affected Individuals whom it is\nrequired to notify under section 26(2) of the PDPA about the Incident.\n\n3 In total, the Organisation sought a waiver of the notification requirement in respect of 140 individuals.\n\n7\n\n\fRemedial actions\n\n23\n\nFollowing discovery of the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following\n\nremedial measures:\nActions to mitigate the effects of the Incident\n(a)\n\nWorked with the Consultant to ensure that measures were implemented\nto contain and/or prevent the risk of further breach in relation to the\nAffected Server;\n\n(b)\n\nConfirmed that GLS had disabled all accounts of the compromised GLS\nvendor and shut down the vendor’s remote access to the Affected\nServer;\n\n(c)\n\nRequested GLS to permanently purge all of the Personal Data from the\nAffected Server, which was done on 22 November 2022;\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the Incident or similar incidents\n(d)\n\nReviewed the May 2020 migration plan to verify that all data in local\nstorage had been deleted following the Migration;\n\n(e)\n\nConducted refresher training for all of the Organisation’s staff to ensure\nuser awareness and strict adherence to the Organisation’s policies,\nprocedures and processes; and\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented a standard operating procedure for IT and cyber due\ndiligence to address changes in ownership or possession and control of\nany IT assets.\n\n8\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA\n\n24\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation focused on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the\n“Protection Obligation”).\n\n25\n\nIn managing the risks of unauthorised access and/or disclosure, organisations\n\nmust be mindful of its security arrangements relating to the deletion and disposal of\npersonal data that is no longer necessary. Personal data that is no longer needed and\npersonal data contained in IT systems that are to be redeployed or sold should be\nproperly disposed, e.g. by secure deletion or purging of such personal data4.\n\n26\n\nFollowing the Migration of the Personal Data to the Cloud in May 2020, the\n\nOrganisation should have ensured that the Personal Data had been deleted from the\nAffected Server. However, the Organisation failed to do so. Instead, the Organisation\nleft the Migration to its staff without providing specific instructions to delete such data\nafter the Migration and without providing sufficient supervision.\n\n115 and 116 of the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA\n(https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelines-and-consultation/2020/03/advisory-guidelines-on-key-concepts-in-thepersonal-data-protection-act) and page 14 of the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems\n(https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Tech-Omnibus/Guide-to-Data-ProtectionPractices-for-ICT-Systems.ashx?la=en).\n4Pages\n\n9\n\n\f27\n\nThereafter, the Organisation had an opportunity to rectify the above failure\n\nduring the Divestment in July 2022, but again failed to do so. Similar to the Migration\nexercise in May 2020, the Organisation again did not make clear during the\nDivestment that staff should delete data from the Affected Server, and failed to\nimplement any measures to ensure that this had been done.\n\n28\n\nThe Organisation has admitted that its:\n\n(a)\n\nFailure to ensure the deletion of the Personal Data from the Affected\nServer post-Migration in May 2020; and\n\n(b)\n\nFailure to ensure the deletion of the Personal Data from the Affected\nServer prior to the Divestment in July 2022,\n\nconstituted a breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission accordingly finds that the Organisation negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by failing to ensure the deletion of the Personal Data from\nthe Affected Server for a period of more than 2 years after the Migration.\n\nObservations on other data protection practices\n\n30\n\nSeparate to the above finding, the Commission observes that had the\n\nOrganisation included the Personal Data stored on the Affected Server in its personal\ndata asset inventory, this would have facilitated earlier identification and deletion of\nthe Personal Data from the Affected Server. For the avoidance of doubt, these\nobservations are made solely to provide guidance, and (i) do not constitute additional\n\n10\n\n\ffindings of breaches of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation in this case; or\n(ii) factor in any way in the Commission’s final decision in this case.\n\n31\n\nThe creation and maintenance of a personal data asset inventory is an\n\nestablished security practice. Amongst other things, it enables an organisation to track\nits personal data assets and ensures that its periodic security reviews cover all of its\nthe personal data assets5.\n\n32\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation maintained an inventory of the data\n\nassets used for its business operations systems, which was reviewed periodically.\nHowever, this inventory did not include the Personal Data contained in the Affected\nServer. As such, despite its periodic reviews, the Organisation remained unaware that\nthe Personal Data continued to reside in the Affected Server for more than 2 years\nafter the Migration, and therefore failed to take steps to ensure its deletion.\n\n33\n\nThat said, it was not necessary for the Commission to make breach findings in\n\nrelation to the above data protection practice in this case.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n34\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA\nwere considered.\n\n35\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n5 Re Eatigo International Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 9 at [15] to [19], Re Management Corporation Strata Title\n\nPlan No. 3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [13]\n\n11\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt actions after being alerted about the\nIncident to mitigate the effects of the Incident and to prevent a\nrecurrence;\n\n(b)\n\nInvestigations were handled under the Expedited Decision Procedure,\nunder which the Organisation admitted to the facts set out in this decision\nand to its contraventions of the Protection Obligation; and\n\n(c)\n\n36\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations.\n\nHowever, in terms of the nature, gravity and duration of the non-compliance by\n\nthe Organisation, the Organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation continued for\na duration of more than two years. This long period of non-compliance, coupled with\nthe Organisation’s failure to provide clear instructions and supervise its staff during the\nMigration and the Divestment processes, reveals systemic shortcomings in the\nOrganisation’s data protection processes.\n\n37\n\nThe Commission notes that there were approximately 22,659 Affected\n\nIndividuals, of which up to 7,184 individuals’ personal data could have been exfiltrated.\n\n38\n\nThe Commission further notes that some of the personal data affected included,\n\namongst other things, specimen signatures, full images of identification cards and/or\nbank account numbers. This exposed certain individuals to greater risks of identity\ntheft or actual financial losses.\n\n12\n\n\f39\n\nFinally, for the purposes of assessing what amount of financial penalty would\n\nbe effective to deter non-compliance with the PDPA, the Commission also took into\nconsideration the turnover of the Organisation6.\n\n40\n\nIn quantifying the financial penalty to be imposed in any given case, the\n\nCommission aims to strike a careful balance between an amount that is (i)\nproportionate to the circumstances and effect of the organisation’s non-compliance\nwith the PDPA but (ii) that remains effective as a deterrent when considering the\nmeans of the organisation. In the present case, upon a consideration of all the factors\nlisted under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, the Commission is of the view that a higher\nfinancial penalty is warranted to ensure that the financial penalty meted is\nproportionate in light of the Organisation’s long period of non-compliance with the\nProtection Obligation (including during the Migration exercise in May 2020 and again\nduring the Divestment in July 2022) and the type and nature of the personal data\naffected. A higher financial penalty is also warranted to ensure that the financial\npenalty meted will be effective in ensuring future compliance with the PDPA and to\nachieve the requisite deterrent effect.\n\n41\n\nBased on the above, the Commission determined that the Organisation should\n\npay a financial penalty of $120,000 within 30 days from the date of the notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n6 See e.g. Re Fullerton Healthcare Group Pte Limited and Agape CP Holdings Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 5 at\n\n[39], Re Autobahn Rent A Car Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPCS 4 at [11], Re Century Evergreen Private Limited\n[2023] SGPDPCS 5 at [11]\n\n13\n\n\f42\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no\n\nfurther directions need be issued to the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $18,000 was imposed on CH Offshore for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect customers' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Directions","Transport and Storage","Ransomware","Vulnerability"],"date":"04 Jul 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_ch-offshore-ltd_17042024.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by CH Offshore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/06/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ch-offshore","timestamp":"2024-07-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2304-C0872\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCH Offshore Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 18\n\n\fCH Offshore Ltd.\n\n[2024] SGPDPC 2\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2304-C0872\n17 April 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nCH Offshore Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is an owner-operator and ship manager\n\nof offshore support vessels for the offshore marine oil and gas sector. On 3 April 2023,\nthe Organisation filed a Data Breach Notification (“DBN”) to the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) regarding a ransomware attack on its\nservers on or about 28 March 2023 that led to a loss of access to the Organisation’s\nshared drives and the encryption of files containing personal data (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nbelow; and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nPage 2 of 18\n\n\fFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation’s employees discovered that they could no longer access the\n\nfiles in the shared drives in the morning of 29 March 2023. Thereafter, the Organisation\nimmediately disconnected the affected servers and sought external IT forensics to\ninvestigate the extent of the Incident and undertake remedial action.\n\n4\n\nInvestigations revealed that the files had been encrypted by one ransomware-\n\nas-a-service (RaaS) threat known as “Alpha aka Blackcat” (the “Threat Actor”).\nInvestigations found that there were suspicious virtual private network (“VPN”)\nconnections over Remote Desktop Protocol at the time of the Incident, suggesting that\nthe Threat Actor likely gained access to the Organisation’s network using two VPN\naccounts that belonged to an employee and its outsourced IT vendor respectively.\n\n5\n\nEven though the investigation was unable to conclusively determine how the\n\nThreat Actor got hold of the credentials to the two VPN accounts, the investigation\nrevealed the following lapses which could have contributed to the Incident:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s firewall FortiOS had not been patched since its\ndeployment in December 2021 and had been exposed to multiple\nRemote Code Execution (“RCE”) attacks since December 2021.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had a high-risk IT infrastructure without proper\nnetwork segmentation and access control measures to prevent\nunauthorised access within its network. All the servers, clients and\nPage 3 of 18\n\n\fother work devices were connected on a single network segment. The\nOrganisation’s network diagram indicated weak network configuration\nand segmentation.\n\n(c)\n\nRDP protocols were enabled on all servers and firewall rules were not\ntightened to only allow pre-defined legitimate traffic between network\nsegments.\n\n(d)\n\nThe password policy feature in the firewall was not enabled and applied\nto the affected Firewall user accounts.\n\n(e)\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (“MFA”) was not implemented for all remote\naccess VPNs, including for user accounts with high-level system\naccess.\n\n(f)\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops –\nenabling a user to install/uninstall applications without restriction.\n\n(g)\n\nUse of obsolete applications (Finance Management Accounting\nSystem) and devices should be avoided as they operate on old and\nvulnerable protocols and ciphers.\n\n(h)\n\nCritical hosts were not regularly scanned for vulnerabilities.\n\n(i)\n\nThe\n\nSymantec Endpoint Protection\n\n(“SEP”) installed on the\n\ncompromised machines did not detect and prevent the execution of\nPage 4 of 18\n\n\fmalicious software. The SEP Manager was compromised early and\ncould have been used to disable all agents.\n\n(j)\n\nThere was an absence of Managed Security Services / Managed\nDetection and Response to adequately detect anomaly behaviour in the\nservers and clients.\n\n6\n\nEvent logs showed that 2.38TB of data was transferred over suspicious VPN\n\nconnections at the time of the Incident. The sample files from the Threat Actor\ncontained 33 employee performance appraisal forms which showed that data\nexfiltration had most likely taken place.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the affected servers contained\n\nthe following personal data of 5,906 employees, ex-employees, next-of-kin, board\ndirectors and stakeholders (with varying numbers for each affected type of personal\ndata):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nAddress;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(d)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(e)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(f)\n\nForeign ID number;\nPage 5 of 18\n\n\f(g)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(h)\n\nPassport number;\n\n(i)\n\nPhotograph;\n\n(j)\n\nThumbprints;\n\n(k)\n\nHealth information, such as employed seamen’s medical reports,\nlaboratory test reports and vaccinations;\n\n(l)\n\nFinancial information, such as bank account numbers and pay slips;\n\n(m)\n\nEducational certificates of employed seamen; and\n\n(n)\n\nSeaman’s Book that would include name, date of birth, place of birth,\nnationality, sex, height, colour of eyes and hair, next of kin’s name and\naddress.\n\nRemedial Actions\n\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation promptly notified the affected\n\nindividuals about the Incident. The Organisation also took the following remedial\nactions:\n\n(a)\n\nEngaged a cybersecurity expert to review its IT infrastructure and\nimplement effective cybersecurity solutions;\n\nPage 6 of 18\n\n\f(b)\n\nEngaged a third party security company to conduct security traffic\nmonitoring, firewall rules review and vulnerability assessment; and\n\n(c)\n\nConducted a network wide scan to ensure there was no remaining\nmalware.\n\n9\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that it intended to conduct the\n\nfollowing remedial actions:\n\n(a)\n\nHarden its perimeter firewall e.g. by implementing 2FA for incoming\nVPN connections to prevent malicious traffic from gaining its internal\nnetwork;\n\n(b)\n\nConduct periodic vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, at\nleast annually or after major systems upgrade/enhancement;\n\n(c)\n\nTighten its identity and access management by amongst others,\nenforcing an enhanced password policy and implementing MFA for\nprivileged accounts and high-risk connections;\n\n(d)\n\nInstall Endpoint Detection and Response on all servers and clients and\nURL filtering measures;\n\n(e)\n\nEnhance its cybersecurity platform by implementing Managed\nDetection and Response and/or Managed Security Services;\n\nPage 7 of 18\n\n\f(f)\n\nEnsure that all active PCs and servers are updated with the latest\npatches, and updating/replacing outdated applications and operating\nsystem;\n\n(g)\n\nImplementing measures against lateral movements unauthorised\nchanges;\n\n(h)\n\nEducating all employees on how to apply strong encryption algorithm\nfor file/folder/disk encryption;\n\n(i)\n\nConduct end user awareness training such as phishing stimulation\nexercises to train employees and IT staff to identify phishing emails and\nspot signs of compromise; and\n\n(j)\n\nTo obtain the Cyber Essential certification.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n\n10\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nPage 8 of 18\n\n\f11\n\nThe Organisation admitted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA as it failed to\n\nhave reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal data in its\npossession or under its control:\n\n(a)\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops so that\nthey could work and receive IT support remotely. The administrator\nrights facilitated the Threat Actor in disabling the endpoint security\nsoftware in the Organisation’s employee laptops before ransomware\ndeployment.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation admitted that its firewall firmware was not patched\nsince December 2021.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it did not implement multi-factor\nauthentication for remote access VPN logins.\n\n12\n\nThe Commission finds that the Organisation has breached the Protection\n\nObligation as it failed to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews, and lacked\nsufficiently robust processes to protect personal data through regular patching,\nupdates, and/or upgrades of important software or firmware.\n\n13\n\nPeriodic security reviews would have allowed the Organisation the opportunity\n\nto detect the following security issues:\n\nPage 9 of 18\n\n\f(a)\n\nWith respect to the outdated firewall which had not been patched since\nDecember 2021, the Organisation could have introduced a patch\nmanagement process to keep the firewall reasonably updated and\nreducing its exposure to any vulnerabilities.\n\n(b)\n\nThe security implications of the Organisation’s IT infrastructure should\nhave been considered either before implementation or at least during\nperiodic security reviews.\n\n(c)\n\nReasonably conducted security reviews should have assessed the\nneed for better access control to the Organisation’s network that held\npersonal data. If the user accounts had required high-level system\naccess, an access control option would have been to introduce MFA\nfor remote access VPN logins.\n\n14\n\nThe Organisation explained that security maintenance had been outsourced to\n\nits then-IT vendor and it expected the vendor to conduct such periodic security reviews\nas part of the vendor’s IT services. However, organisations that rely on vendors to\nconduct security reviews must be able to show that they had stipulated such reviews\nas a job specification of the vendor. They must also exercise reasonable oversight of\nthe vendor’s delivery of the job specified. As the Commission previously highlighted at\n[51] in Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd:1\n\n1 [2017] PDP Digest 133.\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\n\fData controllers that engage outsourced service providers have to be clear\nabout the nature and extent of services that the service provider is to provide.\nThere must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service\nprovider has agreed to undertake, and this should be properly documented.\nData controllers should follow through with the procedures to check that the\noutsourced provider is indeed delivering the services.\n\n15\n\nIn the present case, even though the Organisation had a contract with its IT\n\nvendor to perform “monthly maintenance for the IT systems”, including the firewalls,\nthe Organisation failed to exercise reasonable oversight to ensure that its IT vendor\ndid its part. The Organisation last conducted an audit of the vendor’s service delivery\nin 2021, which culminated in a one-time firewall firmware update completed in\nDecember 2021. When the Incident occurred, the audit cycle for the next review of the\nservice delivery had not yet commenced. The onus was on the Organisation to show\nthat this had been a reasonable oversight.\n\n16\n\nFurther, even though the Organisation had engaged an IT vendor, the\n\nOrganisation retained responsibility and decision-making over its IT infrastructure\nsetup and updating of important software/firmware. Ownership and responsibility for\nthese systemic issues therefore remained with the Organisation and the Organisation\nshould have been aware of the security risks from its lack of sufficiently robust\nprocesses for patching and/or upgrades of important software and firmware.\n\nPage 11 of 18\n\n\f17\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Organisation had contravened section 24\n\nof the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n18\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to\npay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA were considered.\n\n19\n\nThe Commission considered that the personal data of 5,906 individuals was\n\naffected in this personal data breach. Further, the health information (comprising of\nthe medical records, laboratory test reports and vaccinations) and financial information\n(comprising of bank account numbers and pay slips) of 1,425 seamen who were\nemployed by the Organisation were at risk of unauthorised access.\n\n20\n\nThe Commission also considered the following mitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nThis is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation cooperated with the Commission in the course of its\ninvestigations and took prompt remedial actions to address the\nIncident.\n\nPage 12 of 18\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe Organisation had voluntarily accepted responsibility for the\nIncident, thus facilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of\nthis case through the Expedited Breach Procedure.\n\n21\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Deputy Commissioner made a preliminary decision\n\nto impose a financial penalty of $27,000 on the Organisation for its breach of the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n22\n\nIn addition, to ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the Protection\n\nObligation, the Deputy Commissioner also directed the Organisation, under section\n48I of the PDPA, to furnish a schedule and report to the Commission on the completion\nof the remedial actions outlined in paragraph 9 above and the following remedial\nactions:\n\n(a)\n\nReview and enhance its asset and patch management process;\n\n(b)\n\nEnhance its servers and infrastructure to CIS benchmarks;\n\n(c)\n\nImplement network segmentation and tighten access controls in its\nnetwork; and\n\n(d)\n\nImprove its logging capabilities with a centralised log server.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\nPage 13 of 18\n\n\f23\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 9 February 2024 and was invited to make representations.\nOn 23 February 2024, the Organisation made the following representations to the\nCommission seeking a reduction in the financial penalty:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation should not be penalised for failing to procure\nManaged Security Services (“MSS”) because this was not an express\nrequirement under the PDPA and should not be seen as a lapse that\nled to the Incident.\n\n(b)\n\nIt should not be penalised for failing to review endpoint security\napplications because the lack of such reviews would not have\nprevented the Incident.\n\n(c)\n\nIt had supervised its IT vendor to ensure that maintenance services for\nits IT system were performed. An audit on the IT vendor’s services was\nconducted in December 2021 and the Incident had occurred before the\nnext audit review had commenced. Thus, the Organisation sought the\nCommission’s consideration that it had review processes in place.\n\n(d)\n\nIt could not be conclusively determined if the Threat Actor had indeed\nexfiltrated any personal data.\n\n(e)\n\nThe financial penalty imposed is disproportionately high as compared\nto the financial penalty imposed by the Commission in other cases.\nPage 14 of 18\n\n\fRepresentations not accepted by the Commission\n\n24\n\nFirst, the Commission is unable to accept the Organisation’s representations\n\nthat the financial penalty should be reduced because MSS is not an express\nrequirement under the PDPA and that it had been penalised for not implementing such\nservices.\n\n25\n\nThe Commission had only pointed to the absence of Managed Security\n\nServices in paragraph [5] above as one of the lapses which could have contributed to\nthe Incident. The Commission’s finding that the Organisation had contravened the\nPDPA was not based on the absence of MSS but rather, the overall lack of robust\nprocesses in place to update important software and firmware, which led to personal\ndata in its possession being placed at risk. The Commission found the Organisation in\nbreach of the Protection Obligation as it ought to but failed to implement reasonable\nsecurity measures commensurate with the sensitivity of the personal data in its\npossession.\n\n26\n\nThe Organisation also made representations that it could not be conclusively\n\ndetermined if the Threat Actor had indeed exfiltrated any personal data. The\nOrganisation represented that based on the dark web scans conducted by its\ncybersecurity consultant, the sample files of the data relating to the Organisation did\nnot contain any sensitive personal data such as “NRIC numbers or bank details” and\nquestioned whether the hackers obtained any personal data.\n\nPage 15 of 18\n\n\f27\n\nThe Organisation’s representations in this regard are not accepted. Based on\n\nour investigations, the sample files uploaded on the dark web by the Threat Actor\ncontained 33 employee performance appraisal forms with the full names and work\nappraisals of the affected individuals, which suffice as evidence that data exfiltration\nhad most likely occurred at the time of the Incident. The Commission is also satisfied\nthat there was unauthorised access to files containing personal data because these\nfiles had been encrypted by ransomware.\n\n28\n\nFinally, the Commission is unable to accept the representations made by the\n\nOrganisation that the financial penalty imposed is disproportionately high as compared\nto the financial penalty imposed by the Commission in other cases. The financial\npenalty for each case is assessed based on a consideration of the different factors\nlisted under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, some of which may be present and weigh\nmore heavily in some cases as compared to others. In addition, the Commission is\nunable to justify a reduction to the financial penalty on the basis of the cases cited by\nthe Organisation, when these cases were decided some time before legislative\namendments to increase the maximum financial penalty under the PDPA came into\neffect on 1 October 2022.\n\nRepresentations accepted by the Commission\n29\n\nHaving said that however, the Commission was minded to accept the other\n\nrepresentations made by the Organisation and adjust the financial penalty amount\naccordingly.\nPage 16 of 18\n\n\f30\n\nThe Organisation represented that a review of the endpoint security application\n\nwould not have prevented the Incident, and the lack of such reviews did not cause the\nIncident. The central application managing endpoint security in its network had been\ncompromised early at the time of the Incident and gave the Threat Actor control to\ndisable endpoint security capabilities.\n\n31\n\nThe Commission accepts the Organisation’s representation that periodic review\n\nand updates to the endpoint security application, albeit a good preventive measure,\nwould not have detected the malware at all when it has been successfully infiltrated\nand then disabled.\n\n32\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor only\n\nhad a general stipulation for the vendor to perform monthly IT maintenance and secure\nits systems. The Organisation represented that it was dependent on the vendor to\nperform such services and it did have review processes on its part to check the\nvendor’s service delivery. The vendor was last reviewed in December 2021 in\naccordance with its audit cycle that occurs every two to three years, and the\nOrganisation was not yet due to commence its next audit before the Incident occurred\non or about 28 March 2023.\n\n33\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Commission accepts the Organisation’s\n\nrepresentations that the Organisation did exercise some degree of oversight on its IT\nvendor by way of audit processes, particularly since the last audit had been conducted\nslightly over a year before the Incident occurred. If the last audit had been conducted\nPage 17 of 18\n\n\fmuch earlier in time, the Commission would have been less inclined to accept the\nOrganisation’s representations that the Incident occurred before the next audit cycle\nwas due to commence.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n34\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, including the\n\nrepresentations successfully made by the Organisation, the Commission hereby\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $18,000. The Organisation is\nrequired to do so within 30 days from the date of the directions, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\n35\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation is also directed to:\n\n(a)\n\nFurnish a schedule for the completion of all the remedial actions set out\n\nin paragraphs 9 and 22 of this Decision within 30 days from the date of this\nDecision; and\n(b)\n\nTo report to the Commission upon the completion of all the remedial\n\nactions outlined above.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\nPage 18 of 18\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $7,000 was imposed on Tok Leng Leng t/a Top Mobile Gallery (BR) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect against the unauthorised use of and access to customers’ personal data for registration of pre-paid SIM cards.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"04 Jul 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_tok-leng-leng-(trading-as-top-mobile-gallery-(br))_01032024.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Tok Leng Leng t/a Top Mobile Gallery (BR)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/06/protection-obligation-by-tok-leng-leng-ta-top-mobile-gallery","timestamp":"2024-07-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2024] SGPDPCS 1\nCase No. DP-2208-C0053\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTok Leng Leng (trading as Top Mobile Gallery (BR))\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nBetween the period December 2020 to April 2021, the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (“the Commission”) received 435 Do Not Call (“DNC”) complaints\nrelating to property messages, despite their numbers being registered with the DNC\nRegister. The complaints were traced to 44 M1 pre-paid SIM cards sold by Tok Leng\nLeng (trading as Top Mobile Gallery (BR)) (“Organisation”), located in a foreign\nworker dormitory at 2 Seletar North Link.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations into the Organisation for\n\nsuspected breaches under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n\fFacts of the Case\n\n3.\n\nThe 44 M1 pre-paid SIM cards were registered under 33 unique individuals who\n\nwere foreign workers. Investigations confirmed that these foreign workers lived in the\ndormitory at 2 Seletar North Link, and had purchased pre-paid SIM cards from the\nOrganisation. Additional pre-paid SIM cards were registered under their names even\nthough they had not in fact purchased these SIM cards (the “illicit SIM cards”).\n\n4.\n\nAs a retailer of M1 SIM cards, the Organisation used a terminal device issued\n\nby M1 for the purposes of SIM card registration. The SIM card registration process\nwith the M1 terminal device was as follows:\n\na.\n\nFirst, the customer’s identity document (e.g. identity card, passport, work\npass etc.) would be scanned using the terminal device, which is\nconnected directly to M1’s registration system. The system would\ncapture the customer’s particulars, and whether the customer had\nreached the limit of 3 pre-paid SIM cards.\n\nb.\n\nNext, the barcode of the SIM card(s) would be scanned so that they could\nbe tagged to the registered customer.\n\nc.\n\nFinally, the retailer would use a mobile application to load credit value to\nthe prepaid SIM card(s) to activate them for usage. This was done in the\nOrganisation’s premises. M1’s policy was for each prepaid M1 SIM card\nto have a zero-initial balance, and for retailers to load some or all the\nmoney paid by the customer.\n\n\f5.\n\nAt a certain point in time, the Organisation started registering M1 pre-paid SIM\n\ncards via a M1 mobile application on a mobile phone.\n\n6.\n\nAs the Organisation registered M1 pre-paid SIM cards by scanning the front\n\nand back of the affected individuals’ work permits, the following types of personal data\nwas affected:\n\na.\n\nName;\n\nb.\n\nSex;\n\nc.\n\nFIN / work permit number;\n\nd.\n\nDate of Birth;\n\ne.\n\nNationality; and\n\nf.\n\nName of employer.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n7.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines an “organisation” to include “any individual,\n\ncompany, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”. The\nOrganisation is a sole proprietorship and has no separate legal personality from Tok\nLeng Leng (“TLL”). Accordingly, TLL (trading as Top Mobile Gallery (BR)) is an\norganisation for the purposes of the PDPA.\n\n\f8.\n\nBased on the circumstances set out above, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentered on whether the Organisation had breached the Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n9.\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n10.\n\nDuring investigations, the Organisation admitted to a breach of section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA. TLL, the sole proprietor of Top Mobile Gallery (BR), accepted that she failed\nto have security arrangements in place to protect against the unauthorised use of and\naccess to customers’ personal data for registration of M1 pre-paid SIM cards:\n\na.\n\nFirst, TLL admitted that she could have but failed to maintain an inventory\nof M1 pre-paid SIM cards. TLL explained that in contrast to the SIM cards\nsold by other retailers such as Singtel or Starhub which came with a prepaid balance, M1 pre-paid SIM cards came with zero initial-balance. This\ncontributed to her omission to maintain an inventory. Furthermore, the\nM1 salesperson did not have a fixed schedule for delivering the pre-paid\nSIM cards to the Organisation and would deliver more pre-paid SIM\ncards to the Organisation sporadically, which her employees would then\nacknowledge receipt.\n\n\fb.\n\nSecond, TLL admitted that she failed to have processes in place that\nwould require the employees to account for each M1 pre-paid SIM card\nsold and to whom the pre-paid SIM card was registered. TLL admitted\nthat all her employees had equal access to the M1 pre-paid SIM cards.\nThe Deputy Commissioner notes that the Organisation could have\nmaintained a record of the name of the employee who sold each prepaid SIM card, the date, time and place of registration, and sufficient\nparticulars of the individual to whom the SIM card was sold and\nregistered to.\n\nc.\n\nThird, TLL alluded in her statements of how her employees enjoyed the\nsame “access” to register the pre-paid SIM cards. This was corroborated\nby an employee, who stated that the login credentials to the M1\napplication used for registration of pre-paid SIM cards was shared\namongst the employees, and that the employees would login to the M1\napplication on their personal mobile devices if the Organisation’s mobile\ndevice was not readily available. In the Deputy Commission’s view, the\nOrganisation’s failure to implement access control restrictions and to\nprohibit the sharing, amongst its employees, of the login credentials to\nthe M1 mobile application used to register pre-paid SIM cards made it\nmuch easier for the employees to turn rogue, as it became harder to\ndetect the errant employee.\n\nd.\n\nTLL also admitted that there was little or no supervision over the\nOrganisation’s employees regarding how they used or accessed the\ncustomers’ personal data. She was often not at the shop and left the\n\n\fshop to be managed by her employees. While there was CCTV footage\ninstalled at the Organisation, she did not review the CCTV footage often.\n\n11.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Deputy Commissioner finds the Organisation\n\nin breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA as there has been\na complete failure to adopt any security arrangements to protect the customers’\npersonal data from misuse.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n12.\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account.\n\n13.\n\nIn addition, the Deputy Commissioner also considered the following factors\n\nwhich would justify an increase or decrease in the financial penalty:\n\nFactors that justify an increase in the financial penalty\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation’s breaches of the PDPA had caused inconvenience to\nother innocent parties. The illicit SIM cards sold by the Organisation were\nused to send unsolicited messages to phone numbers that were\nregistered with the DNC Register.\n\nb.\n\nEven though TLL denied knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of her\nemployees, TLL has been the registered sole-proprietor of Top Mobile\nsince 2014. She ought to have been aware of the practice of registering\n\n\fillicit SIM cards. The Organisation’s lackadaisical attitude towards\npreventing the potential misuse of individuals’ personal data and failure\nto introduce reasonable safeguards displayed a higher level of\nculpability.\n\nFactors that justify a decrease in the financial penalty\n\nc.\n\nThe Organisation admitted to its contravention to the PDPA and cooperated fully with the investigation process.\n\nd.\n\n14.\n\nThis is the first incident of a personal data breach by the Organisation.\n\nHaving considered the above factors and circumstances, the Commission\n\npreliminarily determined that a financial penalty of $7,000 would be imposed in respect\nof the Organisation’s contravention of the Protection Obligation. On 23 November\n2023, the Organisation was notified of the Commission’s preliminary decision,\nincluding the full findings set out above, and given 14 days to make written\nrepresentations.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\n15.\n\nWhile the Organisation did not challenge the findings and bases of the\n\ncontravention, the Organisation made representations to the Commission seeking that\na financial penalty not be imposed, summarised as follows:\n\na.\n\nTLL, as the sole proprietor of Top Mobile Gallery (BR), admitted that as\nthe boss it was her fault in failing to realise that her staff had\nmisappropriated the information provided by the customers in time;\n\n\fb.\n\nThe Organisation had been in business since 2014 and had always\ncomplied with applicable laws and regulations. Effectively, this is the\nOrganisation’s first contravention of the PDPA;\n\nc.\n\n16.\n\nThe financial penalty of $7,000 is a hefty amount for the Organisation.\n\nThe Commission considered the representations made carefully but was\n\nunable to accept them for the following reasons:\n\na.\n\nThe Commission had already taken into account the first two factors\nraised by the Organisation, in arriving at the preliminary decision;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation had not substantiated to the Commission that it is\nexperiencing financial difficulties and would be unable to continue with\nits usual business activities following the imposition of the financial\npenalty.\n\n17.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the Commission\n\nhereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $7,000 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision.\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the above Summary\nof the Decision:\nProtection of personal data\n24(a). An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or disposal, or similar risks.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Cortina Watch for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Wholesale and Retail Trade","Ransomware","Access control"],"date":"23 May 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_cortina-watch-pte-ltd_280324.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Cortina Watch","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-cortina-watch","timestamp":"2024-05-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2024] SGPDPCS 3\nCase No.: DP-2306-C1102\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCortina Watch Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nCortina Watch Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is mainly involved in the retail,\n\nimport, and export of timepieces, branded pens, and luxury accessories. On 5 June\n2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received a Data\nBreach Notification (“DBN”) filed by the Organisation, regarding a ransomware attack\non its server (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently confirmed that the personal data of 3,953\n\nindividuals had been accessed and exfiltrated in the Incident. The breakdown of the\ndifferent types of personal data affected for the individuals was as follows:\n\n1\n\n\fTypes of Personal Data Affected\n\nNo. of Affected Individuals\n\nFull Name + Contact Number\n\n1,380\n\nFull Name + Address + Any Other Details\n\n930\n\nFull Name + Email\n\n688\n\nFull Name + Date of Birth + Any Other Details\n\n645\n\nFull Name + NRIC/Passport Number + Any 234\nOther Details\nFull Name + Email + Any Other Details\n\n68\n\nFull Name + Bank Account Number + Any 8\nOther Details\n\n3.\n\nThe Commission acceded to the Organisation’s request for the matter to be\n\nhandled under the Commission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This\nmeans that the Organisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the\nfacts set out below and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n4.\n\nBased on the Commission’s own investigations and the efforts of an IT forensic\n\ninvestigation firm engaged by the Organisation, it was determined that the\nOrganisation had experienced multiple brute force attacks between 30 April to 4 June\n2023. On 27 May 2023, a Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) account which the\nOrganisation had been using to test VPN access to live environments was\ncompromised. The threat actor successfully accessed a password-protected master\npassword file, and thereafter moved laterally across the servers. The threat actor\nexfiltrated 5.82 GB of data and deployed the “Lockbit 3.0” ransomware to encrypt other\n\n2\n\n\ffiles on the Organisation’s servers. The personal data of the affected individuals was\nsubsequently posted on the dark web.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na.\n\nAll the servers were taken offline between 4 to 9 June 2023;\n\nb.\n\nAn Endpoint Detection Response tool was deployed on all the servers\nand endpoints for security visibility;\n\nc.\n\nImplemented a centralised log management to forward the firewall logs\nto a centralised server;\n\nd.\n\nIntroduced certificate-based authentication for VPN users, in addition to\nTwo-Factor Authentication (“2FA”);\n\ne.\n\nImplemented firewall VPN access with 2FA control;\n\nf.\n\nDecommissioned all servers running on legacy Windows Server 2008\nR2 and recreated new domains with Windows 2019 servers;\n\ng.\n\nNew network environments were created and hardened with a\nmandatory password complexity requirement and account lockout after\n3 tries;\n\nh.\n\nAs the Organisation’s data was not secured with encryption, the\nOrganisation implemented a new folder/file encryption solution; and\n\n3\n\n\fi.\n\nProper backup was put in place with Managed Service Provider services\nfrom an IT Vendor.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation admitted to breaching section 24 of the PDPA by failing to\n\nhave reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal data in its\npossession/control. The Organisation admitted that there was a lack of “housekeeping” on its “test” VPN user accounts and that it failed to implement reasonable\naccess controls to its network through its “test” VPN user accounts.\n\n7.\n\nCompliance with the Protection Obligation required the Organisation to conduct\n\na security assessment of what would have amounted to reasonable access control to\nits network. After such an assessment, the Organisation could have considered\nadopting the following security arrangements which would have enhanced access\ncontrol to its network:\n\na.\n\nEnforcing rules against the use of easy-to-guess usernames. Apart from\nthe “test” VPN user account, the Organisation’s investigations revealed\nthat there were several other default account names such as\n“Administrator” and “Guest” being used on its systems. The use of default\naccount names makes it easier for a threat actor to target and mount an\nattack against these accounts.\n\nb.\n\nImplementing multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for all VPN accounts,\nfirewall access and access to files holding passwords. The Organisation\nadmitted it could have but had neglected to do so.\n\n4\n\n\f8.\n\nIn its decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 published\n\non 19 May 2022 (i.e. before the Incident), the Commission made clear that MFA was\nto be implemented as a baseline requirement for privileged accounts with remote\naccess to confidential or sensitive personal data or large volumes of personal data:\n\n“Henceforth, the Commission adopts the following tiered approach:\n\na.\n\nFirst, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data:\nsee [46]-[47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach,\nunless the organisation can show that its omission is reasonable or\nimplementation of 2FA is disproportionate.\n\nb.\n\nSecond, remote access by privileged accounts to information\nsystems that host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large\nvolumes of personal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA /\nMFA. The risks concerning remote access are higher, thus the\nexpectation to implement 2FA / MFA will correspondingly increase.\n\nc.\n\nThird, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or\nsensitive personal data, or large volumes of personal data, are\nexpected to enable and configure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that\nis available out-of-the-box. Omission to do so may be considered an\naggravating factor.”1 (emphasis added in bold)\n\n1\n\nSee Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 at [51].\n5\n\n\f9.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to enforce a strong password policy (by\n\nrequiring a combination of alphanumeric characters in addition to its existing password\npolicy of a minimum password length of 8 characters). The Commission finds the\nOrganisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA for failing to enforce a robust\npassword policy. In the Lovebonito decision, the Commission had stated at [18] and\n[19] as follows:\n\n“A robust password policy is a key security measure that an organisation must\nhave in place to ensure that its IT systems are not vulnerable to common\nhacking attempts such as brute force attacks. As noted in Re (1) The Cellar\nDoor Pte Ltd; (2) Global Interactive Works Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 22 (at\n[30(d)]):\n\n“… The need to have a strong password is fundamental to the security of the\ndatabase system. Weak passwords increase the chances of an intruder\ncracking the password and gaining full access to the database system, and,\nmore importantly, the personal data stored therein.”\n\n10.\n\nIn our Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems (the “Guide”), the\n\nCommission has encouraged organisations to implement as a basic practice, a\nminimum level of password complexity (12 alphanumeric characters with a mix of\nuppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters) particularly where password\nchanges are only enforced after periods of 6 months or more. In addition, we have\nalso encouraged organisations to impose, as an enhanced practice, a limit on the\nnumber of failed logins to minimise brute force attacks.\n\n6\n\n\fThe Commission’s starting point in assessing the robustness of an\n\n11.\n\norganisation’s data protection practices, are the practices recommended in our Guide.\nThat said, it is always open to an organisation to show that its omission to implement\nany of the Guide’s recommended practices is reasonable, and/or that alternative and\nequivalent measures have been implemented.\n\nUltimately, it is an organisation’s responsibility to put reasonable security\n\n12.\n\narrangements in place to protect the personal data in its possession or control, the\ndesign and implementation of which should reflect the volume and sensitivity of the\ndata handled, the nature of business and the types of services offered. The\nCommission reiterates the importance of data protection by design and encourages\norganisations to design and implement the appropriate protection measures so as to\nmaintain good governance over its personal data and mitigate data breach risks.\n\nHaving considered the impact of the Incident, the Organisation’s prompt\n\n13.\n\nremedial actions, and its cooperation during the course of the investigation, the\nCommission considered it appropriate, in lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to direct\nthe Organisation to comply with the following:\n\n(a)\n\nTo engage a third-party cyber security vendor to conduct a targeted\nsecurity audit to enhance access control to personal data in its\npossession within the network; and\n\n(b)\n\nTo complete the above Direction within 60 days and to submit a\ncomprehensive report to PDPC within 7 days of its completion.\n\n7\n\n\fThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24(a).

Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fHorizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2024] SGPDPC 1\n\nDenise Wong, Deputy Commissioner - Case No. DP-2304-C0943\n\n21 February 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 April 2023, Horizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”), a\n\nSingapore-based ferry operator, that provides ferries between Singapore and Batam,\nIndonesia, notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nthat there had been unauthorised access and exfiltration of the personal data of\n108,488 individuals who booked tickets on the Organisation’s website from its server\n(the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe personal data affected included the individuals’ name, passport number,\n\ndate of birth, passport issue and expiry date, nationality, email address (if provided)\nand telephone number (if provided).\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to be\n\nhandled under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure. This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in\nthis Decision and that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n2\n\n\f4.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal, or\nsimilar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it does not have its own Information Technology\n\n(“IT”) department. The Organisation relied informally on the goodwill of a single\nindividual (the “IT Supervisor”) employed by an overseas IT vendor (the “IT Support\nVendor”) who had access to the Organisation’s IT systems to provide IT support.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation did not have any service contract with the IT Support Vendor.\n\nThe IT Support Vendor was in fact engaged by PT Prima Sembilan, the Organisation’s\nticket sales partner in Batam, to provide IT services.\n\n7.\n\nThe IT Supervisor also acted on the Organisation’s behalf to liaise with other\n\ncontractors engaged by the Organisation – first, PT Mareco Prima Mandiri\n(“Contractor I”) which was engaged in 2019 to set up the Organisation’s website, and\nsubsequently, PT Rintas Inovasi Indonesia (“PTRII”) (“Contractor II”) which was\nengaged from 1 June 2022 to maintain and service the Organisation’s website before\nthe termination of this contract on 22 November 2022. For clarity, the Commission\nshould add that the Organisation engaged Contractor II to maintain and service its\nwebsite as the key personnel from the Contractor I who had helped to set up the\nOrganisation’s website founded Contractor II.\n\n3\n\n\f8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the Incident occurred because valid credentials\n\nto its Ubuntu operating system root account (the “Root Account”), which is akin to a\nsuper-user account, had been misused to gain unauthorised access to the personal\ndata in the Organisation’s possession and/or control.\n\n9.\n\nAccess to the Root Account had initially been granted to Contractor I to set up\n\nthe Organisation’s website in 2019. When Contractor I claimed that the Root Account\nwas no longer accessible sometime in 2019, the IT Supervisor sought to verify this\nclaim and tried to login to the Root Account but was unable to do so. The IT Supervisor\nthen assumed that the Root Account was no longer accessible.\n\n10.\n\nWhen the Organisation terminated its website maintenance and servicing\n\ncontract with Contractor II on 22 November 2022, the IT Supervisor acted on the\nOrganisation’s behalf to acknowledge the receipt of certain items related to the project.\nHowever, as can be seen from the Incident, the user credentials of the Root Account\nremained active and was used to gain unauthorised access to the Organisation’s\nsystem. The IT Supervisor was once again not able to verify if the credentials for the\nRoot Account had been disabled or reassigned to him.\n\n11.\n\nIt is also relevant to add that after the termination of its contract with Contractor\n\nII, the Organisation did not have any contract in force with any other IT vendor from\n22 November 2022 till the time of the Incident.\n\n12.\n\nFrom 19 March 2023 onwards, the Organisation received several ransomware\n\nemails which revealed that personal data of the Organisation’s customers had been\nexfiltrated. The threat actor demanded payment in exchange for fixing the vulnerability\nin the Organisation’s system. The Organisation’s internal investigations revealed that\n4\n\n\fvalid credentials for the Root Account had been used to gain unauthorised access to\nthe Organisation’s server. Upon making this discovery on 29 March 2023, the IT\nSupervisor promptly changed the credentials for the Root Account on the same day.\n\n13.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the IT Supervisor’s lack of familiarity with the\n\nUbuntu operating system led the latter to mistakenly believe Contractor I’s claim that\nthe Root Account was no longer active, and that the Contractors involved had only\nbeen able to login to the Organisation’s system through a different customer account.\n\nRemedial Action\n\n14.\n\nAfter the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na.\n\nEngaged a cyber incident response vendor to perform digital forensics\ninvestigations and implemented all the recommendations made by the\nvendor to improve its cybersecurity;\n\nb.\n\nEngaged a vendor to develop a new website; and\n\nc.\n\nConducted penetration testing on the new website and rectified all the\nvulnerabilities identified before the website’s launch.\n\n15.\n\nThe Organisation also informed the Commission that it would take the following\n\nremedial actions:\n\na.\n\nTrain its managers on the obligations and requirements of the PDPA.\nThe IT Support Vendor and the current web development vendor will also\nbe invited to attend the training;\n5\n\n\fb.\n\nEnter into a written agreement with the IT Support Vendor for the access\nand management of the Organisation’s systems and website. The\nOrganisation will require the IT Support Vendor to designate a staff\nmember with the relevant IT knowledge required;\n\nc.\n\nEnhance its internal guidelines on data protection; and\n\nd.\n\nDevelop guidelines and protocols for its vendors, outlining the\nprocedures for handling personal data and establishing processes for\naccess, password management and other security measures.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n16.\n\nAs the Organisation is in possession of the personal data of its customers, the\n\nOrganisation is required to comply with all the data protection obligations under the\nPDPA, including making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal, or similar risks,\npursuant to section 24 of the PDPA. This is regardless of whether the Organisation\nengaged a data intermediary as defined under the PDPA or an external IT vendor.\n\n17.\n\nFor completeness, we would add that based on the admissions made by the\n\nOrganisation, the IT Support Vendor and the Contractors involved did not carry out\nany processing activities with regards to personal data on the Organisation’s behalf\nsuch that they would fall within the definition of a “data intermediary” under section\n2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\f18.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Deputy Commissioner determines that the\n\nOrganisation failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in its possession and/or control, thus acting in breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA. In particular, the Organisation failed to:\n\na.\n\nEnsure the proper management of the IT Support Vendor by having\nwritten policies and procedures for vendor management;\n\nb.\n\nImplement an Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”)\npolicy that covers the critical aspects of IT security; and\n\nc.\n\nEnsure that security solutions were implemented for its web server.\n\nPoor Vendor Management\n\n19.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it did not have any written policies and\n\nprocedures for vendor management or policies relating to how outsourced vendors\nshould ensure the protection of personal data when handling personal data.\n\n20.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that even though it relied on the IT Support Vendor\n\nto provide IT support and to act on its behalf when liaising with external vendors such\nas the Contractors involved, the Organisation failed to define and capture the job\nscope, responsibilities and competencies required of key personnel through a formal\ncontractual agreement with the IT Support Vendor.\n\n7\n\n\f21.\n\nThe importance of clarifying the obligations of an organisation and a service\n\nprovider had been made by the Commission in several cases. In Re Smiling Orchid\n(S) Pte Ltd1, the Deputy Commissioner stated at [51] of the decision as follows:\n\n“Data controllers that engaged outsourced service providers have to be clear\nabout the nature and extent of services that the service provider is to provide.\nThere must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service\nprovider has agreed to undertake, and this should be properly documented.\nData controllers should follow through with the procedures to check that the\noutsourced provider is indeed delivering the services.”\n\n22.\n\nIn the handbook titled How to Guard against Common Types of Data Breaches\n\nissued by the Commission in May 20212, the Commission had identified the failure\namong organisations to establish clear responsibility for ICT security as one of the top\nfive most common gaps leading to a data breach based on an analysis of past cases.\nIn the handbook, the Commission recommended that organisations should establish\nclear responsibility for ICT security to either an assigned person or team. Further,\nwhere ICT security is to be performed by a vendor, the scope of work and areas of\nresponsibilities should be clearly stated in a contract.\n\n23.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to ensure that the IT Support Vendor\n\nhad personnel who were sufficiently familiar with the Ubuntu operating system so that\nthey could perform basic system administrator functions like access management. As\na result, the Organisation was not aware at the time of the Incident that the Root\n\n1 [2017] PDP Digest 133.\n2 Available at https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/news-and-events/announcements/2021/05/handbook-on-how-\n\nto-guard-against-common-types-of-data-breaches-now-available (as at 14 December 2023).\n8\n\n\fAccount had remained active. Competent vendor administration of the Organisation’s\nUbuntu operating system would have reasonably reduced the risk of the Incident\noccurring.\n\nFailure to implement an ICT policy that covers critical aspects of IT security\n\n24.\n\nThe Organisation also admitted that it did not have any ICT policy at the time\n\nof the Incident. In its Checklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches,\nthe Commission recommends at page 6 that organisations, as a basic practice,\n“develop an ICT policy that covers the critical aspects in IT security such as account\nand access control, password, email, IT risk management, asset and configuration,\nbackup and recovery, hardening and patching”.\n\nFailure to implement security solutions on its web server\n\n25.\n\nThe Organisation further admitted that it had not implemented any security\n\nsolutions on its web server at the time of the Incident. As stated in the Commission’s\nChecklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches at page 10,\norganisations should, as a basic practice, equip networks with defence devices such\nas firewalls to protect computer networks connected to the Internet.\n\n26.\n\nExamples of security solutions that the Organisation could have implemented\n\nincludes web application scanning, which might have reduced the likelihood of the\nIncident occuring. However, the Organisation simply assumed that the Contractor II\nwould conduct regular web application scanning despite this not being specified in\ntheir contract with Contractor II. In any case, the contract had already been terminated\n\n9\n\n\fa few months before the Incident, and the Organisation did not have any contract in\nforce with any IT vendor to do so at the material time.\n\n27.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Organisation is found to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n28.\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty,\nthe Commission considered the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA.\n\n29.\n\nThe Commission considered that the data breach affected 108,488 individuals\n\nand that the type of personal data affected included the passport details.\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation’s non-compliance with section 24 of the PDPA was also serious as the\nOrganisation had failed to implement basic levels of data protection policies and\npractices.\n\n30.\n\nFurthermore, this was not the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance\n\nwith the PDPA. A financial penalty of $54,000 had previously been meted on the\nOrganisation in the Commission’s decision dated 25 July 2019 for a personal data\nbreach on the Organisation’s website. More recently, the Commission issued a\nwarning to the Organisation on 16 October 2020 for failing to have reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data in the Organisation’s email account.\n\n31.\n\nThe Commission nevertheless recognises the following mitigating factors:\n\n10\n\n\fa.\n\nThe Organisation cooperated with the Commission in the course of its\ninvestigations and took prompt remedial actions to address the Incident.\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily accepted responsibility for the Incident, thus\nfacilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of this case\nthrough the Expedited Breach Procedure.\n\n32.\n\nHaving considered all the factors listed above, the Deputy Commissioner\n\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and directs the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of S$28,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date of this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgement debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n33.\n\nThe Organisation is also directed to provide written confirmation to the\n\nCommission that it has implemented the remedial measures described at paragraphs\n15(a) to 15(d) above, by 31 March 2024.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $74,000 was imposed on PPLingo for (i) failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control; and (ii) not appointing any individual to ensure its compliance with PDPA.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Education"],"date":"23 May 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_pplingo-pte-ltd-(revised)_241023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Accountability and Protection Obligations by PPLingo","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/05/breach-of-the-accountability-and-protection-obligations-by-pplingo","timestamp":"2024-05-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 12\n\nCase No. DP-2205-B9761\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nPPLingo Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 19\n\n\fPPLingo Pte. Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2205-B9761\n24 October 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 8 May 2022, PPLingo Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the Personal\n\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach incident involving\nunauthorised access to personal data contained within the Organisation’s online\neducation platform (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s\n\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the\nIncident.\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation requested for this matter to be handled under the Expedited\n\nBreach Decision Procedure, which the Commission acceded to. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to all the facts set out in this\ndecision, and also to contraventions of Sections 11(3) and 24 of the PDPA (as\nexplained below).\n\nPage 2 of 19\n\n\fFacts of the Case\n4\n\nThe Organisation is a company incorporated in Singapore and operates an\n\nonline Chinese and English language learning platform that offers virtual classes to its\nstudents aged 4 to 15 years old globally (“LingoAce”).\n\n5\n\nThe LingoAce platform incorporates an operations support system (“OPS\n\nSystem”) which provides teacher management, student management and class\nscheduling management functions. The personal data of the Organisation’s students,\nparents, teachers and other staff (including teachers and staff formerly employed by\nthe Organisation) (“Users”) was stored in the OPS System.\n\n6\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had in place a written data\n\nprotection policy and had implemented certain security measures for the LingoAce\nplatform, including network access control measures, and firewall protection for the\nOPS System. The Organisation had also organised two rounds of internal security\nawareness training for its IT development team in April 2022, one month before the\nIncident.\n\nThe Incident\n7\n\nThe Organisation engaged a private forensic expert (“PFE”) to ascertain the\n\ncause and extent of the Incident. The PFE’s forensic investigations revealed that\nsometime between 26 April 2022 to 27 April 2022, the threat actor obtained the\npassword of an administrator account of the Organisation’s OPS System\n\nPage 3 of 19\n\n\f(“Compromised Admin Account”) via brute force attacks1. The password of the\nCompromised Admin Account was “lingoace123”.\n\n8\n\nUsing the Compromised Admin Account, the threat actor created several new\n\naccounts with administrator privileges to the OPS System, and used these newly\ncreated accounts to access the personal data of the Users.\n\n9\n\nA total number of 557,144 Users were assessed to be affected by the Incident.\n\nThe breakdown of the volume and type of personal data accessed by the threat actor\nis set out in the table below:\nCategory of\n\nNumber of\n\nIndividuals\n\nIndividuals\n\nStudents\n\n303,238\n\nTypes of Personal Data Affected\n\nName, date of birth, gender, avatar link\n(including photos, where provided), native\nlanguage, learning experience & skills\n\nParents\n\n244,021\n\nName, username, mobile phone number, email\naddress, nationality, country & region, residing\ncountry, avatar link (including photos, where\nprovided), Whatsapp/Wechat ID, account class\ncredit balance, address\n\n1 Brute force attacks also include dictionary attacks.\n\nPage 4 of 19\n\n\fTeachers\n\n9,395\n\nName, username, mobile phone number, email\n\n(including ex-\n\naddress, nationality, gender, photo (where\n\nteachers)\n\nprovided), country of residence, date of birth,\nteacher ID, salary, bank name and account\nnumber, signature, Chinese resident identity\ncard number, labour agreement or independent\ncontractor agreement, Whatsapp/Wechat ID,\neducational background\n\nOther Staff\n\n490\n\n(including ex-\n\nName, username, mobile phone number, email\naddress, Wechat ID\n\nstaff)\nTotal\n\n10\n\n557,144\n\nAlthough the threat actor had accessed the personal data of the Users, there\n\nwas no evidence of any data modification or exfiltration.\n\n11\n\nOn 5 May 2022, the threat actor gained unauthorised access to email accounts\n\nof the Organisation’s employees through unidentified means. The threat actor\naccessed an email account belonging to one of the Organisation’s employees and\nsent an email to the Organisation (“Email”). In the Email, the threat actor informed that\nhe had accessed LingoAce platform’s systems and set out the personal data of a few\n\nPage 5 of 19\n\n\fUsers in the text to prove this. Nonetheless, the threat actor did not follow up with any\nfurther communication or make any subsequent demands to the Organisation.\n\nRemedial actions\n12\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\nActions to mitigate and contain the Incident\n(a)\n\nEngaged a third party PFE to assist in investigations and remedial\nmeasures;\n\n(b)\n\nInspected the servers related to the OPS System to detect any further\nintrusion;\n\n(c)\n\nReset\n\npasswords of\n\nall\n\nadministrator accounts\n\nand\n\nremoved\n\nunnecessary administrator accounts;\n(d)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication for all accounts accessing the\nOPS System;\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented enhanced password strength/complexity requirements for\naccounts accessing the OPS System;\n\n(f)\n\nAppointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”); and\n\n(g)\n\nNotified all the affected Users.\n\nPage 6 of 19\n\n\fActions to prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n(a)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication for all email accounts of the\nOrganisation;\n\n(b)\n\nSigned up for services of a third-party platform to test for bugs of the\nOPS System and improve bug discovery capabilities;\n\n(c)\n\nAdopted Data Full Life Cycle Security Specifications relating to the\ncollection, transmission, storage, usage and destruction of data;\n\n(d)\n\nCarried out audits and monitoring of the OPS System and enhanced the\nprotection of the application firewall;\n\n(e)\n\nReset passwords to strengthen the passwords or implementing twofactor authentication for other related systems connected to the\nLingoAce platform; and\n\n(f)\n\nEnhanced the Organisation’s internal security and data protection\ntraining programme, and increased the frequency of security and data\nprotection training for the Organisation’s staff.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n13\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under Section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\n\nPage 7 of 19\n\n\fdisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”).\n\n14\n\nAs the Organisation indicated that it had not appointed a DPO when notifying\n\nthe Commission of the Incident, the Organisation’s compliance with Section 11(3) of\nthe PDPA (the “Accountability Obligation”) was also investigated.\n\nBreach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation\n\n15\n\nTo comply with the Protection Obligation, an organisation must implement\n\nsecurity arrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. This\nincludes the nature of the personal data in the Organisation’s possession and control,\nas well as the potential impact that unauthorised disclosure of the personal data might\nhave on the affected persons2.\n\n16\n\nGiven the high volume and sensitivity of the personal data contained in the OPS\n\nSystem (including financial information such as bank name and account number and\nstudents/minors), the onus was on the Organisation to implement an appropriately\nrobust level of security arrangements to discharge its obligation under the Protection\nObligation.\n\n2 See the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Revised 16 May 2022),\n\nat [17.2].\n\nPage 8 of 19\n\n\fInadequate password policy\n\n17\n\nAs a necessary measure of data protection, organisations must adopt,\n\nimplement, and enforce a strong password policy3. A password policy that mandates\na minimum level of password complexity, and a fixed period of password validity or\nregular change of passwords, amongst others, are basic practices of proper\nauthentication and authorisation processes4. This can include implementing password\ncontrols such as (i) requiring a change of password upon first logon, (ii) minimum\npassword length, (iii) restricting reuse of previous passwords, and (iv) mandating a\nminimum level of password complexity. A robust password policy is a key security\nmeasure that an organisation must have in place to ensure that its IT systems are not\nvulnerable to common hacking attempts such as brute force attacks5.\n\n18\n\nInvestigations disclosed that the Organisation did not have any password policy\n\nfor the Compromised Admin Account, other than requiring a minimum length of 8\ncharacters for passwords. Given the Compromised Admin Account granted privileged\naccess to the Organisation’s OPS System, this was an inadequate security\narrangement to safeguard the personal data contained in the OPS System.\n\ni. No expiry / requirement to change passwords\n19\n\nThe use of the OPS system commenced in March 2020. The password\n\n3 See Congita Asia Holdings Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPCS 14.\n4 See the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems.\n5 See LoveBonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3, at [18].\n\nPage 9 of 19\n\n\f“lingoace123” was in use since then and remained unchanged for more than 2 years\nprior to the Incident.\n\n20\n\nThis was a serious lapse in the Organisation’s password management\n\npractices, which failed to provide for a fixed period of password validity or require\nregular change of passwords to mitigate risks of unauthorised access. The absence\nof such security arrangements meant that the OPS System was vulnerable to brute\nforce attacks.\n\nii. No requirements on password complexity\n21\n\nFurther, the Organisation failed to implement requirements to provide for an\n\nadequate level of password complexity. This would have contributed to the ease of\nbrute force attempts by the threat actor to gain access to the Compromised Admin\nAccount.\n\n22\n\nThe PFE’s forensic investigations support the Commission’s findings, as it\n\nidentified that the password for the Compromised Admin Account did not meet typical\nindustry best practices for password strength, in terms of appropriate length, and\ncombination of numbers, symbols, and/or uppercase and lowercase characters.\n\nPage 10 of 19\n\n\fGuessable phrases / components in the password\n23\n\nThe password “lingoace123” was also a weak password due to its incorporation\n\nof both the Organisation’s name and a common sequence of numbers (i.e. “123”).\nSuch a password would be vulnerable to brute force attacks by threat actors.\n\n24\n\nIn Re Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1, the password “Chi!zzle@2018”\n\nwhich complied with the organisation’s password complexity rules was nevertheless\nheld to be a weak password as it incorporated the organisation’s name as well as the\nyear “2018”. The same concern has been repeated in the Commission’s Guide to Data\nProtection Practices for ICT systems (“Guide”), stating that the use of an\norganisation’s name as a component of the password is not recommended because it\nis not difficult to guess and be cracked by hackers.\n\n25\n\nThe Organisation accepted that the password was a weak one, which left the\n\nOPS system vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n\n26\n\nAs a result of the above weaknesses, the threat actor successfully obtained the\n\npassword of the Compromised Admin Account of the OPS System, via brute force\nattacks.\n\n27\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation is found to have negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by failing to implement adequate security arrangements in\nrespect of the Compromised Admin Account.\n\nPage 11 of 19\n\n\fTwo-factor / multi-factor authentication (\"2FA / MFA”)\n28\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had not implemented a password\n\npolicy requiring two-factor (“2FA”) or multi-factor authentication (“MFA\") in respect of\nthe Compromised Admin Account. As the Incident happened shortly before the\nCommission’s decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3\n(“Lovebonito”) was published, this will not be taken into account as a basis for breach\nof the Protection Obligation in this case. However, the baseline standard described by\nthe Commission at [51] of Lovebonito bears repeating:\n“(a)\n\nFirst, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\n\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data: see\n[46]-[47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach, unless the\norganisation can show that its omission is reasonable or implementation of 2FA\nis disproportionate.\n(b)\n\nSecond, remote access by privileged accounts to information\n\nsystems that host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large\nvolumes of personal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA / MFA. The\nrisks concerning remote access are higher, thus the expectation to implement\n2FA / MFA will correspondingly increase.\n(c)\n\nThird, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or sensitive\n\npersonal data, or large volumes of personal data, are expected to enable and\n\nPage 12 of 19\n\n\fconfigure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that is available out-of-the-box.\nOmission to do so may be considered an aggravating factor.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n29\n\nAs 2FA / MFA becomes more readily available at lower cost, organisations\n\nshould expect the baseline standard described in Lovebonito to rise. An organisation\nchoosing not to implement 2FA / MFA will have to explain why this is reasonable,\nconsidering for example, costs, the organisation’s circumstances, and the level of data\nprotection risks.\n\nOther enhanced data protection practices\n30\n\nThe Commission’s Guide recommends two tiers of (i) basic and (ii) enhanced\n\ndata protection practices for organisations to adopt in different circumstances.\n\n31\n\nWhile the Organisation is not faulted for not implementing enhanced data\n\nprotection practices (and this has not been taken into account in determining the\nenforcement action in this case), it is observed that implementing the other enhanced\ndata protection practices in the Commission’s handbook on How to Guard against\nCommon Types of Data Breaches6 could have prevented or slowed down brute force\nattacks. For example, the Compromised Admin Account could have been locked after\n\n6 See the Commission’s recent release of the handbook on common causes of data breaches in How\n\nto Guard against Common Types of Data Breaches published on 24 May 2021 (at page 13).\n\nPage 13 of 19\n\n\fa pre-defined number of failed login attempts, or CAPTCHAs could have been\nimplemented to deter automated login attempts.\n32\n\nIn any event, organisations must assess whether enhanced data protection\n\npractices should be implemented7 in respect of their security arrangements to protect\nthe personal data (having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such personal data\nand the possible impact of a data breach) in their possession or control.\n\nBreach of the Accountability Obligation by the Organisation\n33\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Organisation did not appoint a DPO since its\n\nincorporation in 2016.\n\n34\n\nUnder Section 11(3) of the PDPA, all organisations are required to designate\n\nan individual to be responsible for compliance with the PDPA. Appointing a DPO is a\nbasic requirement of the PDPA.\n\n35\n\nAs emphasised in previous decisions of the Commission8, a DPO plays a vital\n\nrole in ensuring an organisation’s compliance with the PDPA, and the proper\nimplementation of an organisation’s data protection policies and practices. The\nresponsibilities of a DPO include, but are not limited to:\n(a)\n\nEnsuring compliance with the PDPA when developing and implementing\n\npolicies and processes for handling personal data;\n\n7\n\nSee the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems (at page 8).\n\n8 Re AgcDesign Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC at [5] & Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37].\n\nPage 14 of 19\n\n\f(b)\n\nFostering a data protection culture and accountability among employees\n\nand communicating personal data protection policies to stakeholders;\n(c)\n\nHandling and managing personal data protection related queries and\n\ncomplaints from the public;\n(d)\n\nAlerting management to any risks that might arise with regard to\n\npersonal data; and\n(e)\n\n36\n\nLiaising with the Commission on data protection matters, if necessary.\n\nA DPO was appointed after the Incident on 18 May 2022, more than 5 years\n\nafter the Organisation’s incorporation.\n\n37\n\nIn the circumstances, it is determined that the Organisation had negligently\n\nbreached the Accountability Obligation for failing to designate a DPO to be responsible\nfor ensuring that the Organisation complies with the PDPA.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n38\n\nIn determining whether to give directions (if any) to the Organisation pursuant\n\nto Section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether to impose a financial penalty pursuant to\nSection 48J of the PDPA, the Commission took into account the relevant facts and\ncircumstances of the case and the factors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 15 of 19\n\n\f39\n\nThe Commission noted that the Organisation had been negligent in not\n\ncomplying with its obligations under the PDPA, namely the Protection Obligation and\nthe Accountability Obligation.\n\n40\n\nThe Commission also noted that the Incident involved a high volume of\n\npersonal data, which affected 557,144 individuals. The type of datasets affected were\nof a higher sensitivity, including personal data of a financial nature and approximately\n303,238 minors.\n\n41\n\nThe Commission nonetheless recognised the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThere was no evidence of any exfiltration or misuse of the personal data\nof the Users;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions in response to the\nIncident, including notifying the affected Users;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted that it had breached the\nAccountability Obligation and the Protection Obligation; and\n\n(d)\n\n42\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations.\n\nThe Organisation’s early admission of liability for its breaches of the\n\nAccountability Obligation and Protection Obligation was considered a significant\nmitigating factor. An organisation that voluntarily accepts responsibility for its noncompliance with the PDPA is an organisation that demonstrates its commitment to its\n\nPage 16 of 19\n\n\fobligations under the PDPA and shows that it can be responsible for the personal data\nin its possession or under its control9.\n\n43\n\nHaving considered the above factors and circumstances, the Commissioner\n\npreliminarily determined that a financial penalty of $74,000 would be imposed in\nrespect of the Organisation’s negligent contraventions of the Accountability Obligation\nand Protection Obligation. On 27 July 2023, the Organisation was notified of the\nCommissioner’s preliminary decision, including the full findings set out above, and\ngiven 14 days to make written representations.\n\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n44\n\nWhile the Organisation did not challenge the findings and bases of both\n\ncontraventions, the Organisation made representations seeking that a financial\npenalty of not more than $35,000 be imposed, for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had spent significant capital on its remedial actions\n\nand wanted to implement further improvements of IT systems and processes.\nAny reduction of the financial penalty could be used to fund these further\nimprovements;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation, in full compliance with its obligations globally, had\n\nmade voluntary notifications regarding the Incident to other data protection\nauthorities in over 40 other affected locations. These other data protection\nauthorities may also impose financial penalties on the Organisation. To avoid\n\n9 See Section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 17 of 19\n\n\f“double counting”, the Commission should only consider the Singapore-based\nindividuals when assessing the total number of affected individuals rather than\nthe global figures;\n(c)\n\nLower financial penalties had been imposed in previous enforcement\n\ndecisions10 involving similarly high volumes of personal data.\n\n45\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Organisation’s representations were not\n\naccepted for the reasons outlined below:\n(a)\n\nUnder Section 11(2) of the PDPA, the Organisation is responsible for all\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control. This is not limited to the\npersonal data of affected individuals / data subjects located within Singapore;\n(b)\n\nThe Commission’s enforcement jurisdiction is not fettered by potential\n\nenforcement proceedings abroad by other data protection authorities. In any\nevent, the Organisation has not shown how or any evidence that there would\nbe any “double counting”; In any event, as a matter of principle, claiming that\nthe amount that goes towards payment of a financial penalty could be spent on\nfurther improvements is not a relevant factor;\n(c)\n\nEvery case is decided on its specific facts and circumstances. In this\n\ncase, the Organisation had committed two contraventions of the PDPA, and a\nlarge volume of minors’ personal data was affected which distinguished it from\nthe cases cited.\n\n10 GeniusU [2022] SGPDPC 1, Eatigo International Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 9, and Redmart Limited\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 8.\n\nPage 18 of 19\n\n\f46\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $74,000\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n47\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 19 of 19\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $4,000 was imposed on Payroll2U for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect its client’s employees' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Employment","Ransomware"],"date":"22 Apr 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_payroll2u-pte-ltd_070324.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Payroll2U","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-payroll2u","timestamp":"2024-04-22","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2024] SGPDPCS 2\n\nCase No. DP-2303-C0848\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nPayroll2U Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1.\n\nPayroll2U Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a payroll service provider that offers\n\npayroll outsourcing services and online payroll Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.\n\n2.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by the Organisation that the personal data of its client’s\nemployees had been posted on a ransomware leak site. The leak arose from a\nransomware attack on the servers of the Organisation around 29 December 2022 (the\n“Incident”).\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 January 2023, the Organisation received extortion emails from a threat\n\nactor identified as a LockBit affiliate. The Organisation immediately conducted an\n\n\finternal investigation and engaged an external forensics investigator to investigate the\nIncident and undertake remedial actions. Upon further investigations, it was\ndetermined that a total of 81.95 GB of data had been exfiltrated in the Incident and\nposted on the dark web. The personal data of 5,640 employees from the\nOrganisation’s client was affected, including their full name, bank account number,\nsalary information, NRIC number, address, date of birth and email address.\n\n4.\n\nInvestigations revealed that unauthorised activity had occurred from 29\n\nDecember 2022 to 16 January 2023, with a single compromised account used for\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to five servers on the Organisation’s AWS\nenvironment. Once connected to the working network, the threat actor gained\nunauthorised access to the developer’s drive and the company’s shared drive that\nwere both mapped to the compromised account. These drives gave access to the\naffected personal data.\n\n5.\n\nWhile the investigations were unable to conclusively determine how the threat\n\nactor obtained the credentials to the compromised user account, the investigation\nrevealed the following lapses that could have contributed to the Incident:\n\na.\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops, thus\nenabling a user to install/uninstall applications without restriction. The\nOrganisation confirmed that the compromised user had reformatted his\nlaptop and installed an unlicensed Windows Operating System that\nmight have downloaded ransomware and removed the Symantec\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\fEndpoint Protection. In addition, the compromised user also left the\ncomputer powered and web connected, allowing the threat actor to use\nthe account to login to the Remote Desktop Servers.\n\nb.\n\nMulti-Factor\n\nAuthentication\n\n(“MFA”)\n\nwas\n\nnot\n\nimplemented\n\nfor\n\nadministrator accounts and non-administrative accounts with access to\npersonal data.\n\nc.\n\nThere was an absence of tools to detect and remove the download of\nunauthorised software on company-issued laptops.\n\nd.\n\nThere was an absence of effective incident response and management\ncontrol, enabling the threat actor’s presence and activity within the\nOrganisation’s network to remain undetected between 29 December\n2022 to 16 January 2023.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n\na.\n\nDeactivated the compromised user account and forced change\npassword for all users accessing the network.\n\nb.\n\nImplemented MFA for users accessing internal and remotely accessible\nresources and environments.\n\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\fc.\n\nImplemented documentation and quarterly review of Windows network\ndrives and folder access. Collected log details and log reviews on a\nmonthly basis.\n\nd.\n\nConducted checks on all workstations to ensure they are equipped with\nSentinelOne and Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP).\n\ne.\n\nImplemented host-checking for SSL VPN users vis FortiClient to verify\nthat the SentinelOne and SEP processes are running before granting the\ndevice access.\n\nf.\n\nReviewed firewall configurations and rules. Fine-tuned web-filtering\nusing Fortinet UTM. Implemented secured file transfer for inbound and\noutbound traffic. Block sharing over cloud storage and whitelisted URLs\nbased on need to use basis.\n\ng.\n\nPerformed regular service account reviews to validate that all active\naccounts are authorised.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nbelow; and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to implement reasonable access\n\ncontrol. While the investigation noted and acknowledged the existence of proactive\ncybersecurity controls, the Organisation also admitted to storing the affected personal\ndata sets that included the bank account numbers and salary information on\nunsecured internal shared drives. Given both the volume and types of personal data\nhandled, the Organisation ought to have adopted additional access control beyond the\nbaseline of password protection.\n\n9.\n\nThe Organisation had the option of either frontend access control or other\n\noptions that focused on the backend. Frontend access control included MFA, at least\nfor users with remote access to the more sensitive data mentioned. Backend access\ncontrol included, for example, restrictive allocation according to the user’s need for\nadministrator-level rights that would impact personal data security as well as network\nsegmentation. Sensitive personal data could have been stored in segments of the\nnetwork that allowed access only on the basis of need.\n\n10.\n\nAs stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\n\nSystems (the “Guide”)1, access control privileges should be restricted and defined\nbased on the user roles/rights to data. Users should not be able to see information\nthat they do not need to know, and this should be reflected in an organisation’s access\ncontrol policy. In the present case, the Organisation should have assessed whether\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fthe developer in question needed account access rights to personal data of the type\naffected in the Incident.\n\n11.\n\nAnother backend access control option recommended in our Guide was\n\ndisallowing non-administrator employees from installing software and/or changing\nsecurity settings and restricting the right to do so to specific administrator accounts.\nThe Organisation failed to do so and non-administrative accounts were able to\ndownload unauthorised software on issued devices without being detected.\n\n12.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n13.\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, the Commission\nconsidered that a financial penalty was appropriate given the role of the Organisation\nas a payroll service provider and the types of personal data handled. In deciding the\nappropriate financial penalty amount, the Commission first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n14.\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, the\n\nCommission also considered the Organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\fwould be a proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter noncompliance with the PDPA. The Commission also considered the following mitigating\nfactors, which led to a further reduction in the financial penalty:\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\ninvestigations;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to a breach of the Protection\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n\nc.\n\nThis is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n15.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $4,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on Whiz Communications for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect customers' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Information and Communications"],"date":"21 Mar 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_whiz-communications-pte-ltd_20122023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Whiz Communications","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/03/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-whiz-communications","timestamp":"2024-03-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 7\n\nCase No. DP-2304-C0935\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nWhiz Communications Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nWhiz Communications Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a Singapore\n\ntelecommunications service provider offering broadband internet access, local and\nlong-distance digital IP telephony, prepaid and postpaid calling plans.\n\n2\n\nOn 22 April 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was alerted by the Singapore Police Force of a personal data breach\nincident involving the Organisation (the “Incident”), which the Organisation confirmed\non 24 April 2023.\n\n\f3\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision\nand to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA. Section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation to\nprotect personal data in its possession or control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nFacts of the Incident\n4\n\nThe Organisation’s customer management system (“CMS”) was designed and\n\ndeveloped in 2016 by an external vendor. This external vendor did not process\npersonal data on behalf of the Organisation and was not the Organisation’s data\nintermediary. The Protection Obligation in respect of customer personal data\nprocessed by the CMS therefore fell solely on the Organisation.\n\n5\n\nThe CMS from its initial design accepted any Python script requests that could\n\nbe exploited for unauthorised exfiltration of customer personal data. This failure to\nblock or manage scripts posed a data security risk and was a design flaw.\n\n6\n\nPost-Incident, the Organisation established through tracing web services and\n\ndatabased logs that Python scripts had indeed been used by the threat actor (“TA”) to\nextract .jpg files from the CMS. 29,903 attempts from 8 overseas IP addresses were\nmade over 5 days in March and April 2023, with 24,323 successful extractions of the\npersonal data of 24,323 individuals.\n\n\f7\n\nThe types of personal data exfiltrated were the front and back images of\n\nidentification documents (i.e., NRIC, passport, student pass and dependent pass) and\nother supporting documents such as tenancy agreements and letters of approval for\nwork permits issued by the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore.\n\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nRejected and denied all Python requests to the CMS;\n\n(b)\n\nRestricted overseas IP addresses from connecting to the Organisation’s\n\nnetwork;\n(c)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication and enhanced the password\n\ncomplexity requirement for the CMS’ admin users via web access; and\n(d)\n\nConducted a penetration test on the CMS.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nAs a Singapore telecommunications service provider, the Organisation had\n\nhigher-level security needs. This extended to the Organisation’s CMS that contained\nthe personal data of individuals who subscribed to the telecommunications services\nprovided by the Organisation.\n\n10\n\nFirst, the Organisation admitted it has breached the Protection Obligation under\n\nthe PDPA as it failed to provide any security requirements to the CMS IT vendor, in\nparticular, requirements that would have adequately addressed the data security risks\nposed by Python scripts.\n\n\f11\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to stipulate clear job specifications and\n\nsecurity requirements to the IT vendor who developed the CMS. There was also no\ncontractual obligation on the IT vendor to ensure that personal data would be\nprotected. In SAP Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 6, the Commission had reiterated the\nneed for organisations to provide clear job specifications and include data protection\nrequirements when engaging IT vendors. Thereafter, organisations are also expected\nto ensure that the IT vendor has satisfied the job specifications and data protection\nrequirements stipulated.\n\n12\n\nSecondly, the Organisation admitted that it was in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the PDPA as it neither had a sufficiently complex password policy\nnor enforced one. In the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\nSystems1, the Commission recommended a minimum of 12 alphanumeric characters\nwith a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. We also\nrecommended using phrases or paraphrase, combined with numbers and uppercase,\nlowercase and special characters, as these characteristics will make a password\nstronger and harder to decode.\n\n13\n\nPrior to the Incident, the Organisation’s CMS admin user password complexity\n\nrequired only 9 alphanumeric characters with at least one uppercase, which clearly fell\nshort of PDPC’s recommended password complexity. We urge organisations to meet\nPDPC’s recommended best practices relating to passwords, especially for privileged\naccess accounts such as admin accounts.\n\n1 PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems, page 15. Accessible at\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems.\n\n\f14\n\nThird, the Organisation also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation\n\nof the PDPA as it failed to ensure reasonable access control to its CMS. Given the\nnature of personal data the Organisation was in possession and control of, the\nOrganisation should have enhanced the access control to its CMS beyond the\nbaseline of password protection. This could have taken the form of implementing multifactor authentication for its CMS admin accounts, restricting access from overseas IP\naddresses to its CMS, and, last but not least, having an up-to-date web application\nfirewall to defend against typical web application attacks.\n\n15\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n16\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate given the Organisation involved and the nature of\nthe personal data affected in the Incident.\n\n17\n\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the\n\nrelevant factors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the\npersonal data breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n\f18\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the Organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and to deter noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n19\n\nFinally, I considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\n\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n20\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $9,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\fThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

The Commission subsequently commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the circumstances disclosed any breaches by the Respondent of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n2\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigations, the facts disclose a straightforward\n\nbreach of the PDPA. In particular, the Respondent admits to committing the infringing\nacts. The Commission has accordingly found the Respondent in breach of sections 13\nand 20 of the PDPA.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Respondent is a registered salesperson under the Estate Agents Act 2010.\n\nHe is appointed by ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd (“ERA”) to engage in estate agency\nwork and to otherwise promote the business of servicing the public in real estate\ntransactions.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nAt all material times, the Respondent is and was an independent agent of ERA\n\nwho receives commissions in respect of real estate services or transactions entered\ninto between customers and ERA.\n\n5\n\nThe Respondent was upfront in admitting that he has been purchasing personal\n\ndata from unknown third parties for telemarketing purposes for approximately 10 years\nfrom 2013.\n\n6\n\nIn the course of 2021, the Respondent purchased 5 sets of personal data\n\namounting to about 420,000 records (the “Purchased Data”) from an individual with\na foreign phone number known to the Respondent only as “Ali” (the “Seller”). The\nRespondent came to know of the Seller through social media and would communicate\nwith the Seller over Whatsapp, following which the Seller would e-mail the Purchased\nData to the Respondent in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The Respondent\npaid the Seller a total of about S$1,200 for the Purchased Data.\n\n7\n\nThe Purchased Data comprised the following:\n\nNumber of affected individuals\nTypes of personal data\n\n8\n\n~420,000\n• Name\n• E-mail address\n• Contact number\n• Address (either residential or office,\nbut not both)\n• Partial credit card number, i.e., the\nlast 4 digits (for some entries)\n\nAfter receiving each set of Purchased Data, the Respondent would sort through\n\nit for names, e-mail addresses, contact numbers, and residential addresses, and use\n\n3\n\n\fthis personal data to send targeted marketing e-mails and SMSes to the individuals\nconcerned. For example, if the Respondent saw that an individual was living in a\ncertain area of Singapore, he would send an e-mail or SMS to that individual informing\nhim or her of the property transaction prices in that area. The Respondent did not send\nmarketing communications to all the affected individuals as he estimated that about\n75% of the Purchased Data contained business-related information and not residential\ninformation.\n\n9\n\nThe Respondent stated that he did not use the Purchased Data for any other\n\npurpose, and that he included an unsubscribe function in his marketing emails. The\nlatter enabled him to delete the personal data of any individuals who used this\nunsubscribe function. He also stated that he would first check the contact numbers\nagainst the Do Not Call (“DNC”) Registry and would not send marketing SMSes to any\nDNC-registered contact numbers.\n\n10\n\nThe Commission found no evidence to contradict these statements. In\n\nparticular, the Commission has not received any DNC-related complaints involving the\nRespondent. There was also no evidence that the Respondent ever re-sold the\nPurchased Data, or that he was involved in the Seller’s business in any capacity other\nthan as a buyer (e.g., as an accomplice).\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nPreliminary Issues\n\n4\n\n\f11\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent was bound by the data protection obligations in\n\nParts 3 to 6A of the PDPA as he had operated as an “organisation” in respect of his\ncollection and use of the Purchased Data1:\n(a)\n\nThe definition of “organisation” in section 2(1) of the PDPA includes\nindividuals.\n\n(b)\n\nSection 4(1)(a) of the PDPA provides that Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA do\nnot impose any obligation on any individual acting in a personal or\ndomestic capacity. However, the Respondent was not acting in a\npersonal or domestic capacity in respect of his purchase of the\nPurchased Data from the Seller and subsequent use for telemarketing\npurposes. These actions were done for profit, in furtherance of the\nRespondent’s business as a real estate salesperson.\n\n(c)\n\nSection 4(1)(b) of the PDPA provides that Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA do\nnot impose any obligation on any employee acting in the course of his or\nher employment with an organization. However, as mentioned at [4]\nabove, the Respondent was not in an employee-employer relationship\nwith ERA. He acted at all material times as an independent agent.\n\nThe Consent and Notification Obligations under the PDPA\n\n12\n\nThe relevant data protection obligations applicable to the Respondent’s\n\ncollection and use of personal data are:\n\n1 The Commission has in earlier cases also determined that individuals fall within the definition of\n\n“organisation” under the PDPA, and that individuals are subject to the obligations in Parts 3 to 6A of the\nPDPA insofar as they are not acting in a personal or domestic capacity (see for example Re Sharon\nAssya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at [9] to [12]) and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi\nMobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12 (at [8])).\n\n5\n\n\f(a)\n\nthe obligation, before collecting, using or disclosing the personal data, to\ninform the individual(s) in question of the purposes for which such\npersonal data is being collected, used or disclosed (the “Notification\nObligation”)2; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe obligation to first obtain the consent of the individual(s) in question to\nthe collection, use or disclosure of the personal data for such purposes3\n(an individual cannot be said to have given consent unless he or she has\nbeen provided with the information required under the Notification\nObligation, and has provided consent for the stated purposes4) (the\n“Consent Obligation”).\n\n13\n\nThe central issue in this case is whether the Respondent breached the Consent\n\nObligation and/or the Notification Obligation under the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Respondent breached the Consent Obligation\n\n14\n\nOn the facts of this case, the Respondent breached the Consent Obligation by\n\nfailing to ascertain that the consent of the individuals concerned had been obtained\nbefore purchasing their personal data from the Seller and subsequently sending\nunsolicited telemarketing communications to them.\n\n15\n\nThe fact that the Respondent purchased the Purchased Data from a third party\n\n(i.e. the Seller) does not derogate from the Commission’s breach finding. The\nCommission has in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at [13]) and\n\n2 Section 20 of the PDPA.\n3 Section 13 of the PDPA.\n4 Section 14 of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\fRe Amicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor. [2019] SGPDPC 33 (at [26] and [47]) observed\nthat purchasing personal data from a third-party seller constitutes the collection of\npersonal data under the PDPA, notwithstanding that such personal data was not\ncollected directly from the individuals concerned themselves.\n\n16\n\nThe fact of this “indirect” collection does not exempt data buyers from their data\n\nprotection obligations in relation to the collection or subsequent use or disclosure of\nthe collected personal data. The required standard was articulated in Re Amicus\nSolutions (at [48] and [49]), quoting in turn the UK Information Commissioner’s Office\n(“ICO”)’s decision in The Data Supply Company:\n\n“48 … The ICO issued a monetary penalty of £20,000 and gave the following\nguidance in the Monetary Penalty Notice (at [22] to [25]):\n\nData controllers buying marketing lists from third parties must\nmake rigorous checks to satisfy themselves that the third party\nobtained the personal data fairly and lawfully, that the individuals\nunderstood their details would be passed on for marketing\npurposes, and that they have the necessary consent.\n\nData controllers must take extra care if buying or selling a list that is to\nbe used to send marketing texts, emails or automated calls. The Privacy\nand Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 specifically require\nthat the recipient of such communications has notified the sender that\nthey consent to receive direct marketing messages from them. Indirect\nconsent (ie consent originally given to another organisation) may be valid\nif that organisation sending the marketing message was specifically\n7\n\n\fnamed. But more generic consent (eg marketing ‘from selected third\nparties’) will not demonstrate valid consent to marketing calls, texts or\nemails.\n\nData controllers buying in lists must check how and when consent\nwas obtained, by whom, and what the customer was told. It is not\nacceptable to rely on assurances of indirect consent without\nundertaking proper due diligence. Such due diligence might, for\nexample, include checking the following:\n•\n\nHow and when was consent obtained?\n\n•\n\nWho obtained it and in what context?\n\n•\n\nWhat method was used – eg was it opt-in or opt-out?\n\n•\n\nWas the information provided clear and intelligible? How was it\nprovided – eg behind a link, in a footnote, in a pop-up box, in a clear\nstatement next to the opt-in box?\n\n•\n\nDid it specifically mention texts, emails or automated calls?\n\n•\n\nDid it list organisations by name, by description, or was the consent\nfor disclosure to any third party?\n\n•\n\nIs the seller a member of a professional body or accredited in some\nway?\n\n…\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n8\n\n\f49 While there is no uniform industry standard in relation to how a buyer should\nverify whether the seller has obtained the consent of the individuals, the\npositions articulated by the ICO must be right. A reasonable person would likely\nundertake proper due diligence, such as seeking written confirmation that the\npersonal data sold was actually obtained via legal sources or means, or inquire\nfurther as to whether the individuals had provided their consent and were\nnotified of the disclosure, and if so, obtain a sample of such consent and\nnotification.”\n\n17\n\nThe Respondent has fallen short of the standard set out in Re Amicus Solutions\n\nPte. Ltd. by failing to perform the required due diligence to ensure that the individuals’\nconsent had been obtained for the sale of the Purchased Data by the Seller to the\nRespondent, or for the Respondent’s subsequent use for the purposes of\ntelemarketing. During the Commission’s investigations, the Respondent admitted that\nhe did not know whether the Seller had obtained the consent of the individuals in\nrelation to the sale of the Purchased Data, and that he did not perform any additional\nverification checks or question the Seller as to how he had obtained the Purchased\nData. There is no evidence that the Respondent contacted the individuals directly to\nobtain their consent. The Respondent also stated that he was not aware of whether\nthe Purchased Data originated from any data breaches5.\n\n18\n\nThe Respondent was negligent in purchasing and using the Purchased Data\n\nfrom an unknown online seller without performing any due diligence in relation to the\nprovenance of the Purchased Data or whether the individuals concerned had been\n\n5 Based on the Commission’s investigations, the Purchased Data may have originated from the data\n\nbreach incident involving RedMart Limited (see Re RedMart Limited [2022] SGPDPC 8).\n\n9\n\n\fnotified of or given their consent for its collection and use. He therefore did not take\nsufficient steps to discharge the requirements under the Consent Obligation. As stated\nat [9] and [10] above, the Commission accepts that the Respondent had provided an\nopt-out option in his telemarketing e-mails, took pains to ensure compliance with the\nDNC provisions under the PDPA, and had breached the PDPA out of ignorance\ntowards his data protection obligations. Nevertheless, ignorance is not a legitimate\nexcuse for breaching the Consent Obligation. Accordingly, the Respondent was found\nto have negligently breached the Consent Obligation in relation to both his collection\nand use of the Purchased Data.\n\nWhether the Respondent breached the Notification Obligation\n\n19\n\nThe Commission applied the same standards set out at [18] above to its\n\nassessment of whether the Respondent breached the Notification Obligation. In this\nregard, the Respondent also did not perform the required due diligence to ensure that\nthe individuals had been informed of the purposes for which their personal data was\nsubsequently collected, used and/or disclosed by the Respondent and the Seller, and\nthere is likewise no evidence that the Respondent contacted the individuals directly to\ninform them of this. The Respondent has accordingly also negligently breached the\nNotification Obligation in relation to both his collection and use of the Purchased Data.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n20\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Respondent\n\nunder section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Respondent should be required to\npay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA were considered, including the following mitigating factors:\n10\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent was highly cooperative during the Commission’s\ninvestigations. In particular, the Respondent candidly admitted to the\ninfringing acts at first instance and co-operated fully with the investigation\nprocess.\n\n(b)\n\n21\n\nThe Respondent is a first-time offender.\n\nThe Commission considers that there are compelling policy reasons in favour\n\nof taking a strong stance against the unauthorised buying of personal data. Some of\nthese policy reasons have been enumerated in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang (at\n[30]), in the context of the unauthorised sale of personal data:\n\n“The Commissioner likewise takes a serious view of such breaches under the\nPDPA. There are strong policy reasons for taking a hard stance against the\nunauthorised sale of personal data. Amongst these policy reasons are the need\nto protect the interests of the individual and safeguard against any harm to the\nindividual, such as identity theft or nuisance calls. Additionally, there is a need\nto prevent abuse by organisations in profiting from the sale of the individual’s\npersonal data at the individual’s expense. It is indeed such cases of potential\nmisuse or abuse by organisations of the individual’s personal data which the\nPDPA seeks to safeguard against. In this regard, the Commissioner is prepared\nto take such stern action against organisations for the unauthorised sale of\npersonal data.”\n\n22\n\nAlthough the Commission’s investigations did not disclose that the Respondent\n\nre-sold the Purchased Data, the demand generated by buyers such as the\n11\n\n\fRespondent incentivises sellers to engage in the unauthorised sale of personal data,\ncontributing to the market for the unauthorised buying and selling of personal data.\nThere are strong policy reasons to deter would-be participants of such a market as its\nexistence significantly increases the risk of potential misuse or abuse of personal data.\n\nThe Respondent’s Representations\n\n23\n\nOn 20 October 2023, the Respondent was notified of the Commission’s\n\nPreliminary Decision, which sets out:\n(a)\n\nthe Commission’s findings on the Respondent’s breaches of the Consent\nObligation and the Notification Obligation (as set out above);\n\n(b)\n\nthe Commission’s intention to impose a financial penalty of S$28,000;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nthe Commission’s intention to give certain directions on the Respondent\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n\n24\n\nOn 1 November 2023, the Respondent submitted written representations on\n\nthe amount of the financial penalty to be imposed. These representations included the\nfollowing:\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent stated that while he had made sure not to send any\nmarketing SMSes to any DNC-registered contact numbers, he was\nunaware that using e-mail addresses for telemarketing purposes was\nalso a violation of the PDPA;\n\n12\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe Respondent had no malicious intentions in using the Purchased\nData and was only seeking to provide for his family; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent’s financial situation was extremely challenging. The\nfinancial penalty imposed would exacerbate his financial difficulties. In\nparticular, the Respondent stated that he was already struggling to meet\nhis ongoing expenses, including medical expenses for a family member’s\ntreatment.\n\nDecision\n\n25\n\nThe Commission is unable to accept the Respondent’s representations at\n\n[24(a)] and [24(b)] above:\n(a)\n\nAs stated at [18] above, ignorance is not a legitimate excuse for\nbreaching the PDPA. To the Respondent’s credit, he has in his\nrepresentations accepted that ignorance does not excuse his actions,\nand stated that he had only raised this point to provide context.\n\n(b)\n\nNotwithstanding the Respondent’s personal motivations in this regard,\nthe Respondent’s actions were ultimately still done for profit, in\nfurtherance of his business as a real estate salesperson.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission has already taken the Respondent’s self-confessed\nignorance about his data protection obligations and his personal motivations into\naccount when it determined that the Respondent had negligently breached the\nConsent and Notification Obligations: see [18-19] above.\n\n13\n\n\f26\n\nHowever, the Commission accepts and takes into account the Respondent’s\n\nrepresentation at [24(c)] above. When imposing financial penalties, the Commission\nmay take into consideration the personal and financial circumstances of the\norganisation / individual, bearing in mind that financial penalties should not impose a\ncrushing burden or cause undue hardship6. The Commission has given due\nconsideration to the Respondent’s financial situation based on the evidence furnished\nby the Respondent and accepts that the imposition of a high financial penalty would\ncause substantial hardship to the Respondent.\n\n27\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, including the\n\nRespondent’s representations, the Commission hereby imposes a reduced financial\npenalty of S$16,800. This decision is made on the basis of the exceptional financial\ncircumstances demonstrated by the Respondent, and should not be taken as setting\nany precedent for future cases. The Commission requires the Respondent to pay the\nfinancial penalty of S$16,800 in accordance with the notice accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nDirections\n\n28\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, including the fact that\n\nthe Purchased Data is still in the Respondent’s possession, the Commission also\ndetermines that the following directions should be imposed on the Respondent under\n\n6 See Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12 (at [21]).\n\n14\n\n\fsection 48I of the PDPA, in order to ensure the Respondent’s compliance with the\nConsent Obligation and the Notification Obligation:\n(a)\n\nthe Respondent is to cease his use of all of the Purchased Data\nimmediately;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Respondent is to cease the retention of all of the Purchased Data\nwithin 7 days from the date of this Decision; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe Respondent is to inform the Commission within 7 days from the date\nof this Decision of the completion of the steps directed above.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n15\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was administered to a financial advisor for: (i) using dictionary attack methods to generate telephone numbers;  (ii) failing to obtain clear and unambiguous consent; and  (iii) failing to check the DNC Register, before making marketing calls to DNC-registered individuals.","tags":["Do Not Call Provisions","Warning","Finance and Insurance","Telemarketing"],"date":"22 Feb 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_kenny-lin_20102023.pdf","nature":"Do Not Call Provisions","title":"Breach of Do-Not-Call (\"DNC\") Provisions by a Financial Advisor","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/02/breach-of-do-not-call-dnc-provisions-by-a-financial-advisor","timestamp":"2024-02-22","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 6\n\nCase No. ENF-DNC-230119-0007 & Others\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nLin DaoWen Kenny\n\n… Person\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nThe Do Not Call Registry (“DNC Registry”) is a national database kept and\n\nmaintained by the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\npursuant to section 39 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Persons\nmay register their Singapore telephone numbers with the DNC Registry so as to not\nreceive unsolicited telemarketing calls and messages. The DNC Registry comprises\nof 3 separate registers (i) the No Text Message Register, (ii) the No Voice Call\nRegister, and (iii) the No Fax Message Register.\n\n2.\n\nFrom January 2023 to July 2023, the Commission received twelve (12)\n\ncomplaints arising from unsolicited telemarketing calls made by Lin DaoWen Kenny\n\n\f(the “Individual”) to telephone numbers registered on the No Voice Call Register of\nthe DNC Registry (the “Complaints”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether there had\n\nbeen any breaches of the “Do Not Call” provisions in Parts 9 and 9A of the PDPA\n(“DNC Provisions”). This case also illustrates how the employment of online tools to\ngenerate Singapore telephone numbers to market products or services may lead to a\nbreach of section 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\n4.\n\nThe Individual is a financial advisor. In order to generate leads, he used an\n\nExcel spreadsheet formula (“randbetween”) to generate a list of all numbers upon\nentering the extreme ends on a numerical spectrum. The Individual generated 1000\nnumbers (the “Phone List”) with the intention of finding Singapore telephone numbers\nto market his financial advisory services.\n\n5.\n\nOf the 1,000 numbers generated on the Phone List, 384 corresponded to\n\nSingapore telephone numbers that were registered with the No Voice Call Register of\nthe DNC Registry.\n\n6.\n\nThe Individual engaged a telemarketer to make marketing calls to the numbers\n\non the Phone List to promote his financial advisory services. The Individual admitted\nthat he failed to check if the telephone numbers were registered with the Do Not Call\nRegistry before providing the Phone List to the telemarketer. Given the means by\nwhich the Individual generated the Singapore telephone numbers, the Individual was\nalso unable to provide any evidence (written or otherwise) that he had obtained clear\nand unambiguous consent from the subscribers of the 384 DNC-registered numbers\n\n\fbefore making the marketing calls. In light of above, the Individuals has negligently\ncontravened section 43(1) of the PDPA.\n\n7.\n\nFurther, by generating the 384 Singapore telephone numbers through the Excel\n\nspreadsheet formula mentioned above and engaging a telemarketer to make\nmarketing calls to promote his financial advisory services, the Individual has also\ncontravened section 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8.\n\nThe Individual claimed to have inadvertently overlooked screening the numbers\n\non the Phone List on this occasion. The Assistant Commissioner considered that the\nIndividual had a previous compliance record of screening telephone numbers to\nascertain if they were on the DNC Registry. Further, the Individual immediately ceased\nthe telemarketing calls and promptly purchased more credits that can be used to\nscreen if the telephone numbers were registered on the DNC Registry so as to ensure\ncompliance with the DNC Provisions of the PDPA. Upon careful consideration of these\nfacts, the Assistant Commissioner issued a warning to the Individual for contravening\nsections 43(1) and 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\nThe following section(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in\nthe above summary:\nDuty to check register\n43.—(1) Subject to section 48(2), a person must not send a specified message\naddressed to a Singapore telephone number unless the person has, at the time the\nperson sends the specified message, valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone\nnumber is not listed in the relevant register.\nProhibition on use of dictionary attacks and address-harvesting software\n48B.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a person must not send, cause\nto be sent or authorise the sending of an applicable message.\n\n\f(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an employee (P) who sends, causes to be\nsent or authorises the sending of an applicable message in good faith —\n(a)\n\nin the course of P’s employment; or\n\n(b)\nin accordance with instructions given to P by or on behalf of P’s employer in the\ncourse of P’s employment.\n(3) However, subsection (2) does not apply to a person (P) who, at the time\nthe applicable message was sent, was an officer or a partner of the sender and it is\nproved that —\n(a)\nP knew or ought reasonably to have known that the telephone number is an\napplicable telephone number; and\n(b)\nthe applicable message was sent with P’s consent or connivance, or the\nsending of the applicable message was attributable to any neglect on P’s part.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 was imposed on Carousell for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its platform users in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fCarousell Pte. Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case Numbers. DP-2209-C0166 and DP-2210C0312\n\n28 December 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nCarousell Pte. Ltd. (“Carousell”) runs an online marketplace website and\n\nmobile application for the buying and selling of new and second-hand goods and\nservices (the “Platform”). In recent years, the Platform has expanded to include\nproperty listings. The Platform is available to users in several markets, including\nSingapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.\n\n2\n\nIn 2022, Carousell notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) of two data breach incidents:\n\n(a)\n\nOn 5 September 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of a data\n\nbreach incident involving the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of\n44,477 individuals across Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and the\nPhilippines using Carousell’s Platform (the “1st Incident”).\n\n2\n\n\f(b)\n\nOn 17 October 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of a separate\n\nand unrelated incident involving the sale of the personal data of at least 2.6\nmillion1 individuals using Carousell’s Platform (the “2nd Incident”) (collectively,\nthe “Incidents”).\n\n3\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine Carousell’s\n\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the\nIncidents. On 13 February 2023, Carousell requested for the investigations into the\nIncidents to be handled under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure\n(“EDP”), which the Commission acceded to. To this end, Carousell voluntarily and\nunequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision and to its contravention of\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Incidents.\n\nFacts of the 1st Incident\n\n4\n\nCarousell’s Platform includes a chat function allowing potential buyers to send\n\nand receive messages to and from listing owners on the Platform. This chat function\nwas available for use by both individuals who had registered accounts with the\nPlatform (“Registered Users”) and by individuals who did not register accounts with\nthe Platform (“Guest Users”). The chat function served all categories of listings on the\nPlatform, including property listings in different countries.\n\n1\n\nCarousell was unable to confirm the exact number of individuals affected. Carousell had estimated that\napproximately 3.389 million individuals may have been affected. However, the threat actor’s listing on the online\nforum claimed to consist of the personal data of approximately 2.6 million individuals.\n\n3\n\n\f5\n\nOn 13 July 2022, Carousell implemented changes to the chat function. The\n\nchange was intended to be limited to users in Philippines responding to property\nlistings. Where such users had provided their prior consent, their first name (if the user\nwas a Registered User), email address and phone number would be automatically\nappended to the message sent to the owner of the property listing.\n\n6\n\nHowever, due to human error, the changes caused the chat function to\n\nautomatically append the email addresses and names of Guest Users to messages to\nlisting owners of all categories in all markets (the “July 2022 Bug”). For Guest Users\nin the Philippines, their telephone numbers were also appended to the messages.\n\n7\n\nOn 18 August 2022, having not identified the July 2022 Bug, Carousell\n\nimplemented a fix to resolve an unrelated issue with the pre-fill functionality of the chat\nfunction (“August 2022 Bug”). However, these changes caused the chat function to\nautomatically append the email addresses and names of Registered Users to\nmessages to listing owners of all categories in all markets as well, expanding the effect\nof the July 2022 Bug. For Registered and Guests Users in the Philippines, their\ntelephone numbers were also appended.\n\n8\n\nCarousell was eventually made aware of the August 2022 Bug via a user report\n\nsent on 18 August 2022. On 24 August 2022, Carousell implemented a fix which\nresolved both the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs.\n\n9\n\nAs a result of the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs, the personal data of 44,477\n\nindividuals comprising email addresses of all affected users and mobile phone\n\n4\n\n\fnumbers of users in the Philippines were disclosed without their consent. Although the\nnames associated with users’ accounts were also disclosed, the Commission accepts\nCarousell’s explanation that these names were not necessarily indicative of actual\nnames of the users, and are voluntarily disclosed by users on his/her own public\nprofiles. As such, the Commission did not consider disclosure of these names relevant\nfor assessing the breaches of the PDPA in the Incidents.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n10\n\nFollowing the 1st Incident, Carousell took the following remedial actions:\nActions to mitigate the effects of the 1st Incident\n(a)\n\nDeleted all affected personal data disclosed in the chat function by 3\nSeptember 2022; and\n\n(b)\n\nNotified users who had written to Carousell about the 1 st Incident by 6\nSeptember 2022.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the 1st Incident or similar incidents\n(c)\n\nConducted an exercise to identify corrective and preventive measures to\nguard against the possible recurrence of similar incidents;\n\n(d)\n\nRevised its Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) policy such that personal\ndata\n\nissue\n\nreports\n\nare\n\nmarked\n\nas\n\n“Severity-1”\n\nto be resolved within 8 hours. Additionally, alerts of SLA breaches will\nnow trigger over the weekends to shorten the turnaround time for breach\ndetection and response;\n\n5\n\n\f(e)\n\nImplemented an automated unit test which automatically runs on every\nbuild of the Platform to ensure that the Platform does not erroneously\nappend any personal data in chat messages; and\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented requirement for additional approval from the Quality / Test\nengineers in each team prior to implementation of new features involving\nusers’ personal data.\n\n11\n\nThe Commission notes that Carousell did not notify all users affected by the 1st\n\nIncident as it assessed that the 1st Incident was unlikely to result in significant harm\ngiven that the disclosure was limited to basic contact information (telephone number,\nemail address).\n\nFacts of the 2nd Incident\n\n12\n\nOn 15 January 2022, Carousell launched a public-facing Application\n\nProgramming Interface (“API”) during a system migration process. However,\nCarousell inadvertently omitted to apply a filter on that API, resulting in a vulnerability\nwhich was eventually exploited by a threat actor (the “API Bug”).\n\n13\n\nThe API’s original intended function was to retrieve the personal data of users\n\n(“Following/Follower Users”) followed by or following a particular Carousell user\n(\"Subject User”). A filter applied to the API would have ensured that only publicly\navailable personal data of the Following/Follower Users - user name, name and profile\nimage – would be called up. However, due to an inadvertent omission of the filter, the\n\n6\n\n\fAPI was able to call up non-public personal data of Following/Follower Users. These\ncomprised their email addresses, telephone numbers and dates of birth.\n\n14\n\nA threat actor (“TA”) was able to exploit this vulnerability by scraping the\n\naccounts of 46 Subject Users with large numbers of associated Following/Follower\nUsers, thereby obtaining the personal data of these Following/Follower Users.\nForensic investigation revealed that the scraping of non-public data of various users\noccurred between 7 May 2022 and 13 May 2022, and then on 25 June 2022.\n\n15\n\nCarousell’s internal engineering team discovered the API Bug on 15 September\n\n2022 and deployed a patch on the same day. Carousell conducted internal\ninvestigations to determine whether there had been unauthorised access to its users’\npersonal data in the 60-day period prior to 15 September 2022, but did not detect any\nanomalies within that period. They therefore remained unaware of the exploitation by\nthe TA until 13 October 2022.\n\n16\n\nOn 13 October 2022, Carousell was alerted by the Commission that an\n\nindividual was offering the personal data of approximately 2.6 million Carousell users\nfor sale on an online forum. Carousell conducted investigations and confirmed that the\ndata had been exfiltrated as a result of the vulnerabilities caused by the API Bug. On\n17 October 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of the data breach.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n17\n\nFollowing the 2nd Incident, Carousell took the following remedial actions:\n\n7\n\n\fActions to mitigate the effects of the 2nd Incident\n\n(a)\n\nDeployed a fix on 15 September 2022, the same day on which the API\nBug was discovered;\n\n(b)\n\nCompiled a list of users who were following a large number of other users\nto identify any risk of data abuse;\n\n(c)\n\nIdentified and blocked the TA’s account on 13 October 2022, the same\nday on which Carousell was informed of the exploitation;\n\n(d)\n\nNotified all affected individuals by email.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the 2nd Incident or similar incidents\n\n(e)\n\nConfigured its GitHub repository to scan for and generate alerts for data\nleakage;\n\n(f)\n\nConducted a security audit for all existing APIs and implemented a\nsystemic regular audit;\n\n(g)\n\nImplemented an automated security audit process for API rollouts. Alerts\nare generated for all API code changes which involve personal data,\nwhich would result in those code changes being reviewed by the relevant\nteams;\n\n(h)\n\nImplemented rate limiting follow and batch-follow APIs to prevent\npotential abuse by users who follow other users;\n\n8\n\n\f(i)\n\nCompiled a list of users following large numbers of users a day and\nidentifying potential risks of data abuse, with the view to banning users\nwho attempted abuse;\n\n(j)\n\nActively monitored API requests for abnormal behaviour;\n\n(k)\n\nImposed stricter IP address rate limits;\n\n(l)\n\nExplored third-party anomalous API access solutions; and\n\n(m)\n\nImplemented annual penetration tests for customer-facing applications.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n18\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incidents, the Commission’s investigation\n\nfocused on whether Carousell had breached its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). Carousell was determined to have breached the Protection Obligation\nin two respects.\n\nFailure to conduct reasonably scoped pre-launch testing\n\n19\n\nProper pre-launch testing is necessary to identify data protection risks and\n\ndefects before new and updated IT features are deployed in live environments. This\n\n9\n\n\fhas been expressly stated in the Commission’s prior decisions2 and in guidance\npublished by the Commission.\n\n20\n\nThe importance of properly scoped code review was highlighted in the\n\nCommission’s previous decision of Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No.\n3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [9]:\n\n“…[O]rganisations should conduct code reviews and pre-launch testing before\nnew IT features or changes to IT systems are deployed. These processes allow\norganisations to pick up and rectify errors and/or flaws in the new IT features\nand/or systems prior to deployment. There have been a number of cases where\nerrors in the application code resulted in the unintended disclosure of personal\ndata or unintended access to personal data …”\n\n21\n\nAs stated at page 5 of the PDPC’s Handbook on How to Guard Against\n\nCommon Types of Data Breaches (“PDPC’s Handbook”), organisations should\nensure that applications are subjected to comprehensive testing such as unit testing,\nregression testing, security testing, and User Acceptance Testing (“UAT”) before\ndeployment. A comprehensive UAT should ensure good test coverage of scenarios\nincluding possible user journeys and exception handling, which should match realworld usage. PDPC’s Checklist to Guard Against Common Data Breaches (“PDPC’s\nChecklist”) also recommends a test suite encompassing functional and non-functional\nrequirements and security testing.\n\n2 SAP Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 6, Grabcar Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 14\n\n10\n\n\f22\n\nAdequate pre-launch testing includes implementing reasonable code review.\n\nAs the Commission has stated at page 3 of the PDPC’s Checklist, organisations\nshould ““[c]onduct code review and rigorous unit testing which includes complete\ntesting of functional requirements to verify the compliance to the requirements specs\nat early stage in system development lifecycle.”\n\n23\n\nIn respect of the 1st Incident, Carousell failed to conduct reasonable pre-launch\n\ntesting upon implementing its changes to the Platform’s chat function on 13 July 2022\nand 18 August 2022. Specifically, Carousell admitted that, since changes were only\nintended to impact Registered Users in a specific category of listings (i.e. property\nlistings in the Philippines market), testing was not undertaken to check how the\nchanges may have affected other users and listings outside the intended category.\nGiven that the same chat function served all categories of listings, Carousell should\nhave conducted pre-launch testing on categories other than property listings in the\nPhilippines market. Reasonable code reviews and testing would have detected the\nJuly 2022 and August 2022 Bugs before the changes went “live”.\n\n24\n\nIn respect of the 2nd Incident, Carousell had selectively performed code reviews\n\nand tests during its system migration, only for certain purposes and on certain APIs.\nSince the function of the API relevant to the 2nd Incident was to retrieve personal data,\nCarousell should have identified this API and tested it for data security risks. Carousell\nfailed to do so. Carousell admitted that prior to the 2 nd Incident, it did not mandate\ncomprehensive code reviews for security issues.\n\n11\n\n\fFailure to adequately document software functional and technical specifications\n\n25\n\nMaintaining\n\nreliable\n\ndocumentation\n\non\n\nthe\n\nfunctional\n\nand\n\ntechnical\n\nspecifications of an application helps an organisation keep track of issues over time.\nIt can help to provide context to historical changes and reasons why changes were\nmade in a certain way, which would be especially important where new personnel are\nexpected to take over work on the application. In this regard, page 5 of the PDPC’s\nHandbook recommends organisations to:\n\n“Invest effort to document all software functional and technical\nspecifications (e.g. program specifications, system specifications and\ndatabase specifications). The usefulness of this documentation will become\neven more apparent over time as the original developers move on from the\nproject and new developers take over the software maintenance and upgrading.\nWithout proper documentation, developers often have no references to fall back\non, and may end up making assumptions about code logic that could produce\nincorrect results.”\n\n26\n\nIn respect of the 1st Incident, lack of proper documentation contributed to the\n\nerror which resulted in the data breaches. Carousell’s Platform’s chat function, which\nwas essentially a chat widget and data form, served multiple purposes which were not\nlimited to facilitating property listings in the Philippines market. Depending on the\nuser’s purposes, different form fields would be visible to the user within the chat\nfunction. The engineer who implemented the changes to the chat function on its\nPlatform was not the original author of the function, and did not have the context\n\n12\n\n\fnecessary to know that such changes would affect messages regarding other users\nand listing categories.\n\n27\n\nCarousell admitted that, while its handover process (at the time of the Incidents)\n\nincluded a document of the key features supported by the outgoing engineer, such\nprocess was otherwise undocumented and/or not directly communicated to the\nincoming engineer by the outgoing engineer. With regard to the 1st Incident\nspecifically, Carousell admitted that while the handover documentation pertained to\nthe chat function’s technical aspects, it did not address how Carousell uses the\nfunction for different purposes or how changes would affect specific groups of users.\n\n28\n\nIn respect of the 2nd Incident, the APIs involved in the system migration were\n\nbuilt in 2016 and did not have proper documentation. Carousell admitted that, as a\nresult, the personnel involved in the system migration may not have been aware of the\nneed to apply the filter to the relevant API post-migration.\n\n29\n\nIn the circumstances, it is determined that the Organisation negligently\n\nbreached the Protection Obligation in the Incidents by failing to conduct adequately\nscoped pre-launch testing, and by failing to adequately document functional and\ntechnical specifications of its software.\n\n13\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n30\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on Carousell pursuant to\n\ns 48J of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty, the factors listed at\ns48J(6) of the PDPA were taken into account.\n\n31\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n(a)\n\nCarousell was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nCarousell took prompt and effective remediation actions upon discovery\nof the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs in the 1st Incident, and the API\nBug and the data exfiltration in the 2nd Incident; and\n\n(c)\n\n32\n\nCarousell has not previously contravened the PDPA.\n\nThe Commission also recognises that the TA in the 2nd Incident was particularly\n\nsophisticated in avoiding the security measures Carousell had implemented. Carousell\nhad, prior to the 2nd Incident, put in place API processes and security measures, such\nas rate-limiting and traffic monitoring against API vulnerabilities. Carousell’s security\nmeasures in respect of detecting anomalies and/or abuse of its APIs were found to be\nadequate in general.

It has\noperated since 2015 from a shop located in Geylang. As a retailer of M1 SIM cards,\n\n1\n\nUnder Section 43 of the PDPA, a person is not allowed to send specified messages to a Singapore telephone number registered\nwith the DNC register unless the person has, at the time where he sends the specified message, valid confirmation that the\nSingapore telephone number is not listed in the DNC register.\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fKWM was provided a terminal device by M1 installed at the Organisation’s premises\nfor the purposes of SIM card registration (the “M1 Terminal Device”). The M1\nTerminal Device was used for registration of SIM cards prior to December 2021. SIM\ncard registration had to be carried out in accordance with the conditions of M1’s\ntelecommunications licence granted under Section 5 of the Telecommunications Act\n(Chapter 323).2 The typical SIM card registration process would be as follows:\n(a)\n\nFirst, the customer’s identity document (e.g. identity card, passport, work\n\npass etc.) would be scanned using the M1 Terminal Device, which is connected\ndirectly to M1’s registration system. The system would capture the customer’s\npersonal data, and state whether the customer had reached the permitted limit\nof 3 prepaid SIM cards.\n(b)\n\nNext, the barcode of the SIM card(s) would be scanned so that they\n\ncould be tagged to the registered customer.\n(c)\n\nFinally, a mobile application would be used to load credit value to the\n\nprepaid SIM card(s) to activate them for usage. This was done in the\nOrganisation’s premises. M1’s policy was for each prepaid M1 SIM card to have\na zero-initial balance, and for retailers to load some or all of the money paid by\nthe customer.\n\n4\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that KWM exploited the above\n\nregistration process in order to use his customers’ personal data without consent to\n\n2\n\nThe version of the Telecommunications Act 1999 which was in force at the time\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fregister for additional prepaid M1 SIM cards that his customers did not intend to\npurchase. To do so, KWM would employ one of two methods:\n(a)\n\nMethod 1 (Duplicate Scanning) – After scanning a customer’s identity\n\ndocuments via the M1 Terminal Device to register the SIM card they wished to\npurchase, KWM would scan the identity documents a second time to register a\nsecond SIM card to the same customer without their knowledge. KWM would\nthen hand over only one SIM card to the customer, and keep the other to sell\nto unauthorised purchasers.\n(b)\n\nMethod 2 (Incomplete Transactions) – Occasionally, customers who\n\nhad completed the registration process would not want to continue with their\npurchase after learning that the credit value of the SIM card would have to be\nseparately loaded. At this juncture, instead of cancelling or reversing the\nregistration process, KWM would keep the SIM card(s) and activate them\nwithout the customer’s knowledge, and thereafter offer them for sale to other\nunauthorised purchasers.\n\n5\n\nDuring investigations, KWM admitted that the purpose of the above two\n\nmethods was to earn extra money from the unauthorised sale of the preregistered SIM\ncards. In his 4 years of selling such SIM cards to anonymous purchasers, KWM\nestimated that he made a profit of approximately $35,000 (i.e. around 250 illicit SIM\ncards per year at a profit of $35 per card).\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f6\n\nThe affected personal data collected and used by KWM to register the illicit SIM\n\ncards include the following personal data of 73 individuals (used to register 95 SIM\ncards):\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nThe customers’ names;\n\n(b)\n\nThe customers’ addresses; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe customers’ NRIC / FIN / passport numbers.\n\nHowever, it is likely that the personal data of many more individuals\n\n(approximately 1,000) was affected, based on KWM’s admission that he sold an\naverage of 250 prepaid SIM cards annually over 4 years.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines an “organisation” to include “any individual,\n\ncompany, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”. The\nOrganisation is a sole proprietorship and has no separate legal personality from KWM.\nFurther, KWM was acting in a business capacity in selling the illicit SIM cards to make\na profit, and not a domestic capacity (which ordinarily would have excluded him from\nbeing bound by the PDPA).3 Accordingly, KWM (trading as the Organisation) is an\norganisation for the purposes of the PDPA.\n\nSee also Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 at [9] – [10] and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile)\n[2021] PDPC 12 at [8]\n3\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\f9\n\nBased on the circumstances set out above, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether KWM had breached:\n(a)\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA\n10\n\nUnder Section 13 of the PDPA, organisations are prohibited from collecting,\n\nusing or disclosing an individual’s personal data unless the individual gives, or is\ndeemed to have given, his consent, unless otherwise authorised under the PDPA or\nany other written law (the “Consent Obligation”).\n\n11\n\nKWM breached the Consent Obligation by using his customers’ personal data\n\nwithout their consent:\n(a)\n\nIn the case of Method 1 (Duplicate Scanning), KWM’s customers\n\nconsented to the collection and use of their personal data only for the purpose\nof registering the number of SIM card(s) they had requested. They did not\nprovide consent to KWM to use their personal data for any other purpose,\nincluding the registration of additional SIM cards.\n(b)\n\nIn the case of Method 2 (Incomplete Transactions), the customers had\n\nwithdrawn their consent to the use of their personal data at the point where they\nfound that the credit value of the SIM card would have to be separately loaded.\nThe correct action for KWM to take would have been to cancel the SIM card\nregistration and not use the customers’ personal data any further. Instead,\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fKWM proceeded to keep the registered SIM card and activated them\nseparately, thereby continuing with the use of customers’ personal data for\npurposes they had not consented to.\n\n12\n\nIn the premises, KWM breached the Consent Obligation.\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under Section 18 of the PDPA\n13\n\nUnder Section 18 of the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances, and where that individual has been\ninformed of the said purposes under Section 20 of the PDPA (the “Purpose Limitation\nObligation”). As set out in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in\nthe PDPA:4\n“The main objective of the Purpose Limitation Obligation is to ensure that\norganisations collect, use and disclose personal data that are relevant for the\npurposes, and only for purposes that are reasonable.\nFor the purposes of section 18 (and as stated in that section), whether a\npurpose is reasonable depends on whether a reasonable person would\nconsider it appropriate in the circumstances. Hence the particular\ncircumstances involved need to be taken into account in determining whether\nthe purpose of such collection, use or disclosure is reasonable. For example,\na purpose that is in violation of a law or which would be harmful to the\n\n4\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 16 May 2022) at [13.3] – [13.4]\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\findividual concerned is unlikely to be considered appropriate by a reasonable\nperson.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n14\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation limits the use of personal data to the\n\npurposes for which the data subject had been notified and consented to, unless an\nexception to the consent requirement is applicable. The purpose for processing is\nsubject to a backstop, in that it must be reasonable in the circumstances.5 In\nconsidering whether the Purpose Limitation Obligation was breached, it is obvious that\nthe data subject did not give his consent for his or her personal data to be used for\nregistering SIM cards that were to be sold to other purchasers. The purpose that the\ndata subjects had consented to were for registration of SIM cards that they were\npurchasing.\n\n15\n\nIn the present case, KWM admitted that his purpose for using his customers’\n\npersonal data was to register illicit SIM cards in order to sell them to third parties and\nthereby make a profit. KWM also admitted that he knew this was wrong and illegal.\nSuch use of personal data is clearly not a reasonable purpose under any\ncircumstances, as KWM’s customers could not have reasonably intended for their\npersonal data to be used to register illicit SIM cards for KWM’s financial gain.\n\n5\n\nSee Re AIA Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 10 at [18] and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC\n12 at [15]\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\f16\n\nIn the premises, KWM has breached the Purpose Limitation Obligation.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n17\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on KWM pursuant to\n\nsection 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty, the matters\nset out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\ntaken into account, including the following aggravating and mitigating factors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nKWM’s breaches of the PDPA were difficult to detect as they did not\n\ncome to light until the customers’ numbers and personal data had been misused\nto send marketing messages. The Commission notes that prepaid SIM cards\nare frequently used to further criminal activities; accordingly, a supplier of\nprepaid SIM cards who breaches the PDPA must be dealt with severely for\ndeterrence purposes;\n(b)\n\nKWM’s actions were intentional and took place over a long period of 4\n\nyears;\n(c)\n\nKWM’s breaches of the PDPA caused inconvenience to innocent\n\nparties, as the illicit SIM cards sold by him were used to send unsolicited\nmessages to phone numbers that were registered with the DNC Register;\n(d)\n\nThrough the sale of the illicit SIM cards for approximately 4 years, KWM\n\nfinancially gained approximately $35,000 through the misuse of his customers’\npersonal data; and\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n(e)\n\nKWM admitted to liability early in the investigation process, thus reducing\n\nthe time and resources expended on investigations.\n\n18\n\nKWM was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s letter\n\ndated 16 May 2023 and was invited to make representations on the same.\n\nRepresentations Made by KWM\n19\n\nOn 17 May 2023, KWM made the following representations to the Commission\n\nseeking that a financial penalty not be imposed:\n(a)\n\nHe is the sole breadwinner of his family. However, he is likely to have a\n\nperiod without any income as he had been charged with committing an offence\nunder Section 5(1) (read with Section 11A) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap.\n50A, Rev. Ed. 2007) for unauthorised use of computer material, and was likely\nto be sentenced to an imprisonment term. The Commission notes that on 14\nSeptember 2023, he was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for the said\noffence; and\n(b)\n\nHe was seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for\n\nmental health issues.\n\n20\n\nKWM’s representations are not accepted for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nDespite the Commission’s repeated requests for him to adequately\n\nsubstantiate his assertions of personal and financial hardship, he did not do so.\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe fact that he was charged and sentenced for a criminal offence,\n\narising from the same set of actions as those which caused the breaches of the\nPDPA, is not in and of itself relevant to any enforcement action taken by the\nCommission.\n(c)\n\nThe fact that he was seeking treatment at the IMH is not, in and of itself,\n\na mitigating factor – especially when he was unable to provide further\ninformation about (i) the condition(s) for which he was seeking treatment and\n(ii) how such condition(s) were related to his breaches of the PDPA.\n\n21\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires KWM to pay a financial penalty of $48,000 within 30\ndays from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which\ninterest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\n22\n\nNo further directions are required given that the Organisation has ceased the\n\nunauthorised sale of preregistered SIM cards.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Tipros for failing to use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate.","tags":["Consent","Notification","Purpose Limitation","Directions","Others"],"date":"14 Dec 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_tipros_080623.pdf","nature":"Consent, Notification, Purpose Limitation","title":"Breach of the Purpose Limitation Obligation by Tipros","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/12/breach-of-the-purpose-limitation-obligation-by-tipros","timestamp":"2023-12-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2023] SGPDPC 7\nCase No. DP-2207-C0019\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTipros\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 8\n\n\fTipros\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2207-C0019\n8 June 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1. On 21 July 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived a complaint that Tipros (the “Organisation”), a sole proprietorship in the\nwholesale of and repair of electrical appliances, had unreasonably disclosed the\npersonal data of the complainant when responding to the complainant’s review on\nthe Organisation’s Google reviews page (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The Commission commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) and for\nsuspected breaches of the same.\n\nFacts of the Case\n3. The complainant had engaged the Organisation to repair a refrigerator. Following\nthe repairs made, the complainant gave a “1-star” review on a Google reviews page\n“24hr fridge refrigerator #1 Quick repair service Trusted in Singapore”, which has\nsince been renamed “Tipros.sg”.\n\n4. The Organisation promptly responded to the complainant’s review. What is\nproblematic was that the Organisation included the complainant’s personal data,\nincluding the complainant’s residential address and mobile number in their\nPage 2 of 8\n\n\fresponse. The complainant filed a complaint with the Commission as the\ncomplainant was of the view that there was no reason for the Organisation to\ndisclose her personal data in the course of responding to the review she left on the\nOrganisation’s Google reviews page.\n\n5. Apart from the Organisation’s response to the complainant’s review, the\nCommission found 13 other responses on the Organisation’s Google reviews page\nwhich disclosed, in a similar fashion, the personal data of other customers who had\ngiven reviews.\n\nOur Investigations\n\n6. The Commission commenced investigations. In the course of investigations, it was\nascertained that the Organisation’s place of business was vacant and its registered\noffice was occupied by another business which was not related to the Organisation.\nThus, a Notice to Produce Documents and Information for Investigation (“NTP”)\nwas delivered by hand on 25 October 2022 to the residential address belonging to\nthe Organisation’s sole proprietress, one Er Lee Cheng @ Angela Er Wei Leng\n(“Angela”). The Organisation failed to respond by the stated deadline.\n\n7. Thereafter, the Commission issued three further notices to Angela to attend\ninterviews, which were delivered by hand to Angela’s residential address on 8\nNovember 2022, 15 December 2022, and 10 January 2023.\n\nPage 3 of 8\n\n\f8. Following these notices, an individual claiming to be Angela contacted the\nCommission through an unlisted number on various occasions, namely 11\nNovember 2022, 17 November 2022, and 27 December 2022, and declined our\nrequest to attend an interview, or to schedule any other alternative dates for an\ninterview.\n\n9. The Commission is satisfied that the Organisation had received due notice of our\ninvestigative proceedings. Given the Organisation’s refusal to respond to our NTP\nand our notices to attend an interview, the Commission proceeded with its\ninvestigations based on the evidence available to it.\n\n10. The Commission is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Organisation’s\nresponses which disclosed the complainant’s personal data had been posted by\nthe Organisation for the following reasons: First, The Google reviews page reflects\nthe name of the Organisation; and second, the Organisation has a direct and\nmaterial interest in the reviews given by the complainant and other individuals on\nthe Organisation’s Google reviews page.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n11. Based on the circumstances disclosed above, the Commission’s investigations\ncentered on whether the Organisation had breached the Purpose Limitation\nObligation under section 18 of the PDPA.\n\nPage 4 of 8\n\n\fThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of the PDPA\n12. Under section 18(a) of the PDPA, organisations may collect, use or disclose\npersonal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate\nin the circumstances and — under section 18(b) — that the individual had been\ninformed prior to the intended collection, use or disclosure (the “Purpose\nLimitation Obligation”).\n\n13. I had previously discussed the ambit of when it would be acceptable for an\norganisation to disclose personal data when responding to public comments in M\nStars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 and in Big Bubble\nCentre [2018] SGPDPC 25. In Re M Stars Movers, I stated at [18] and [19] as\nfollows:\n“The Deputy Commissioner advises caution in disclosing personal data when\nresponding to public comments. An organisation should not be prevented or\nhampered from responding to comments about it using the same mode of\ncommunications that its interlocutor has selected. In some situations, it may be\nreasonable or even necessary to disclose personal data in order to advance an\nexplanation. … An individual who makes false or exaggerated allegations\nagainst an organisation in a public forum may not be able to rely on the PDPA\nto prevent the organisation from using material and relevant personal data of\nthe individual to explain the organisation’s position on the allegations through\nthe same public forum.\n\nThe following observations may be made in this context about the approach\nthat the Commission adopts. First, the Commission will not engage in weighing\nPage 5 of 8\n\n\fallegations and responses on golden scales in order to establish proportionality.\nThe better approach is to act against disclosures that are clearly\ndisproportionate on an objective standard before the Commission intervenes in\nwhat is essentially a private dispute…”\n\n14. When an individual chooses a public platform to pass comments about an\norganisation, the organisation is fully entitled to respond on the same platform in a\nproportionate and reasonable manner. In such circumstances, the individual had\ninitiated the communication and selected the public platform. The nature of the\nindividual’s comments will determine whether a response from the organisation is\nnecessary. Where the nature of the individual’s comments invites a response for\nthe purpose of advancing an explanation, such a purpose is considered reasonable\nin the circumstances under section 18(a). In advancing an explanation, it may be\nnecessary to use or disclose relevant facts in order for the explanation to be\neffective. Such disclosure is reasonable in the circumstances provided that the\nextent of disclosure is proportionate.\n\n15. Further, the requirement under section 18(b) read with section 20(1)(b) that the\nindividual be informed of the purpose prior to use or disclosure is also met in these\ncircumstances. The raison d’être for this requirement is to keep the individual\ninformed of the purposes for which his or her personal data is to be used or\ndisclosed, unless such use or disclosure is for purposes that are authorised by law.\nIn cases such as the present, the individual initiated the communication and the\nnature of his or her comments shapes the organisation’s response. As long as the\norganisation’s response is for a reasonable purpose that is a natural consequence\nPage 6 of 8\n\n\fof the individual’s comments, the individual is deemed to have been informed of\nsuch purpose. Thus, where an individual makes a complaint on a public platform\nin relation to an interaction with the organisation, it is natural that the organisation\nresponds on the same platform for the purpose of providing an explanation. And if\nuse or disclosure of personal data is necessary for such a purpose, the individual\nis deemed to have been informed prior to such user or disclosure since it is the\nindividual’s earlier actions that had elicited the response.\n\n16. In the present case, I am of the view that the Organisation’s disclosure of the\ncomplainant’s personal data was unreasonable and disproportionate. The\ncomplaint related to the poor standard of service that the Organisation delivered.\n\n17. The complainant alleged that two weeks after the Organisation repaired his or her\nrefrigerator, the refrigerator stopped working. The complainant was aggrieved that\nthe Organisation sought a payment of $80 ($20 transport fees and $60 checking\nfees) to check on the refrigerator two weeks after the Organisation fixed the\nrefrigerator, and that the Organisation’s technician was supposedly not available\nover the weekend when the complainant had only engaged the Organisation\nbecause the Organisation had supposedly advertised itself as providing round-theclock service. Given the grievances flagged in the complainant’s review, there was\nno issue about the location for delivery of the service. Thus, it was unnecessary for\nthe Organisation to disclose the complainant’s residential address. In the same\nvein, I do not see how disclosure of the complainant’s mobile number was\nnecessary to advance an explanation in response to the complaint.\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\n\fThe Commission’s Decision\n18. Based on the facts established, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach\nof its obligation under section 18(a) of the PDPA. The Organisation’s failure to\nrespond to NTP and refusal to attend for an interview are duly considered as\naggravating factors. As the Organisation had not taken any action to remove or\namend its response to the complaint, there is no mitigating factors to speak of.\n\n19. In the circumstances, I hereby direct the Organisation to:\n(a) Remove the disclosure of the complainant’s residential address and mobile\nnumber in its response to the complainant’s comments on the Organisation’s\nGoogle reviews page; and\n(b) Review the 13 other responses on the Organisation’s Google reviews page\nwhere it had also disclosed personal data of other customers in response to their\nreviews, and to remove disclosure of personal data if such disclosure is not\nreasonable or proportionate in order for the Organisation to respond to the Google\nreviews.\nThe Organisation is given 30 days to comply with these directions.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on Ascentis for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Admin and Support Services"],"date":"10 Nov 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_ascentis_12092023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Ascentis","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/10/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ascentis","timestamp":"2023-11-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 10\n\nCase No. DP-2209-C0193 / DP-2209-C0217\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nAscentis Pte.

No further\nenforcement action was taken against Starbucks SG.\n\nFacts of the Case\nThe CRM System and CRM Database\n5\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of developing, providing and integrating\n\nsoftware solutions for Customer Relationship Management and eCommerce.\n\n6\n\nOn 19 December 2014, Starbucks SG engaged the Organisation to develop,\n\nimplement, support, and host a Customer Relationship Management system (the\n“CRM System”) to support Starbucks SG’s “My Starbucks Rewards” loyalty program\n(the “Rewards Program”).\n\n7\n\nWhen an individual signed up as a member of the Rewards Program, their\n\npersonal data including name, email address, telephone number, and birth date was\ncollected and stored on a cloud database (the “CRM Database”).\n\n1\n\nA copy of Starbucks SG’s voluntary undertaking is available at https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Undertakings.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Project for development of the Platform\n8\n\nOn 14 September 2020, Starbucks SG engaged the Organisation to separately\n\ndevelop and provide, as well as render ongoing technical support for, the Platform, an\nonline store for the sale and purchase of products offered by Starbucks SG (“the\nProject”).\n\n9\n\nIn turn, on 1 January 2021, the Organisation engaged one Kyanon Digital Co.\n\nLtd (“Kyanon”), a company based in Vietnam in the business of software development\nand provision, to provide additional manpower and software development support to\nthe Organisation for its execution of the Project.\n\n10\n\nOne of Starbucks SG’s requirements for the Project was for a Rewards Program\n\nmember’s personal data to be auto-completed in electronic forms on the Platform,\nsuch that the member would not have to manually key in his/her personal data to\ncomplete a transaction on the Platform.\n\n11\n\nThe personal data of Rewards Program members was originally only stored on\n\nthe CRM Database (and not on the Platform). In order to make it more convenient for\nmembers to use the Platform, the Organisation implemented a process to\nautomatically synchronise a member’s personal data from the CRM Database to the\nPlatform whenever an individual logged in as a member on the Starbucks SG website\nand then visited the Platform. This synchronisation occurred in real-time. Once the\n4\n\n\fsynchronisation was complete, the member’s personal data would exist separately in\na database within the Platform. Both the CRM Database and the database within the\nPlatform were hosted and operated independently.\n\nKyanon’s involvement in the Project\n12\n\nDespite Kyanon’s engagement, the Organisation maintained control and\n\nmanagement of, and had direct involvement in, the Project. The leader of the team\ndelivering the Project (the “Project Team”), was an employee of the Organisation,\nwhile the remaining personnel comprising the Project Team were employees of\nKyanon (the “Kyanon Employees”)\n\n13\n\nThe Kyanon Employees were provided with accounts to the Platform with full\n\nadministrative privileges (the “Admin Accounts”). These enabled the Kyanon\nEmployees to support, check and perform configuration of the Platform, troubleshoot\nany technical problems, and check if data received on the Platform had been\nsynchronised correctly. The Admin Accounts also granted rights to Kyanon Employees\nto export data from the Platform (the significance of which is discussed below). Prior\nto the Incident, the Admin Accounts did not require multi-factor authentication (“MFA”).\n\n14\n\nOne of the Kyanon Employees, “Peter”, left the employ of Kyanon in May 2022.\n\nHe handed over the credentials to his Admin Account (“Peter’s Admin Account”) to\nthe remaining members of the Project Team via a shared Google Sheet. Despite the\ncessation of Peter’s employment with Kyanon, Peter’s Admin Account was not\n5\n\n\fdisabled. Rather, the Kyanon Employees changed the password of Peter’s Admin\nAccount to “Kyanon@123456”, updated the shared Google Sheet with the new\npassword, and continued using Peter’s Admin Account among themselves.\n\nThe Incident\n15\n\nSometime between 10 and 13 September 2022, a malicious actor used Peter’s\n\nAdmin Account to gain access to the Platform, where the personal data of those\nRewards Program members who had previously logged into the Platform was stored.\nThe Organisation was not able to determine the exact method by which the malicious\nactor gained access to Peter’s Admin Account; it was possibly through the\nabovementioned shared Google Sheet. The malicious actor granted other accounts\nadministrative privileges, performed data gathering, and exported the gathered data\nto an external email address.\n\n16\n\nIn total, the personal data of 332,774 individuals stored in the Platform\n\ncomprising names, email addresses, dates of birth, membership details relating to the\nRewards Program, last login dates to the Platform, the physical addresses of 181,875\nindividuals, and the telephone numbers of 310,560 individuals (“Subject Data”) was\nexfiltrated in the Incident.\n\n17\n\nThe Subject Data was subsequently advertised for sale on an online forum on\n\nthe dark web. The Commission was notified of the same by the Singapore Computer\nEmergency Response Team on 13 September 2022. Starbucks SG and the\n6\n\n\fOrganisation submitted data breach notifications to the Commission on 15 and 16\nSeptember 2022, respectively.\n\nRemedial Actions\n18\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took remedial actions which\n\nincluded:\n(a)\n\nActivating an emergency response team and establishing an investigation\nteam (including an external cybersecurity firm) to investigate the Incident;\n\n(b)\n\nDisabling access to the Platform by all accounts, validating all Platform\naccounts, and resetting all administrator accounts;\n\n(c)\n\nBlocking the malicious actor’s IP address in the Platform firewall;\n\n(d)\n\nMandating that all vendors, including Kyanon, perform full anti-virus and\nmalware scans, and provide reports of these scans to the Organisation\nbefore resuming work; and\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented MFA for all its accounts.\n\n7\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n19\n\nUnder the Protection Obligation, an organisation must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n20\n\nThe Protection Obligation also applies to data intermediaries2. A data\n\nintermediary is defined under section 2(1) of the PDPA as “an organisation which\nprocesses personal data on behalf of another organisation but does not include an\nemployee of that other organisation”. In turn, the “processing” of personal data is\ndefined as:\n“in relation to personal data, means the carrying out of any operation or set of\noperations in relation to the personal data, and includes any of the following:\n\n2\n3\n\n(a)\n\nrecording;\n\n(b)\n\nholding;\n\n(c)\n\norganisation, adaptation or alteration;\n\n(d)\n\nretrieval;\n\n(e)\n\ncombination;\n\n(f)\n\ntransmission;\n\n(g)\n\nerasure or destruction;”3\n\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA.\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\f21\n\nAs the developer and host of the CRM System and the Platform, the Organisation\n\nprocessed personal data (including the Subject Data) in the CRM Database and the\nPlatform on Starbucks SG’s behalf. Accordingly the Organisation was a data\nintermediary of Starbucks SG and was subject to the Protection Obligation in respect\nof the Subject Data.\n\n22\n\nThe reasonableness of an organisation’s security arrangements would be\n\nassessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such personal data and the\npossible impact of a data breach. As stated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines\non Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 16 May 2022)\n(“Advisory Guidelines”) at paragraphs 17.3(a) and (b), an organisation should:\n\n“a) design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n…\nc) implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of security\n…”\n\n23\n\nAdditionally, as stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices\n\nfor ICT Systems (“ICT Systems Guide”) at page 8:\n\n9\n\n\f“For organisations that hold large quantities of different types of personal data or\ndata that might be more sensitive to the individuals or the organisations, they\nshould additionally implement the relevant enhanced practices suggested in\neach section. The design and implementation of these protection measures\nshould always take into consideration the extent of the sensitivity of the data\nbased on the nature of business and types of services offered.”\n\n24\n\nIn the present case, having regard to the large volume of personal data hosted\n\nin the Platform, reasonable security arrangements to protect the Subject Data were\nnot implemented. The Commission sets out the reasons for this finding in the\nparagraphs below. In particular, the Organisation failed to disable Peter’s Admin\nAccount after he was no longer working on the Project.\n\n25\n\nIn the ICT Systems Guide, the Commission recommends at page 15 that\n\norganisations should, as a basic practice, conduct “Regular review of user accounts\nto ensure that all the accounts are active and the rights assigned are necessary (i.e.\nremove user accounts when a user has left the organisation or update the user’s\nrights when he/she has changed his/her role within the organisation).” (emphasis\nadded in bold).\n\n26\n\nIn this case however, the Organisation did not disable Peter’s Admin Account\n\nafter he left the employ of Kyanon but permitted its continued use by Kyanon\nEmployees. While Peter was an ex-employee of Kyanon and not of the Organisation,\n10\n\n\fit was nevertheless (by the Organisation’s own admission) the Organisation itself\nwhich retained responsibility for the development and management of the Platform,\nincluding the creation and management of administrator accounts. The Organisation\nadmitted that the failure to disable Peter’s Admin Account was a “lapse” on its part,\nand further admitted that it failed to create new accounts for the Kyanon Employees\nwho took over Peter’s duties.\n\n27\n\nThe failure to disable Peter’s Admin Account was exacerbated by the fact that\n\nthe account was not protected with a sufficiently complex password. Having taken over\nPeter’s Admin Account, the Kyanon Employees changed the password to\n“Kyanon@123456” (the “New Password”). The Organisation informed the\nCommission that the New Password met the Platform’s password complexity\nrequirements, namely that passwords be at least 8 characters in length, have at least\n1 upper and 1 lower case letter, at least 1 special character, and not be a repeat of\nthe account’s previous 5 passwords.\n\n28\n\nThe Commission has made clear in previous enforcement decisions that mere\n\ntechnical compliance with password complexity requirements is not good enough if\nthe password remains guessable4. Although the New Password complied with the\nPlatform’s password complexity requirements, it incorporated the name “Kyanon” and\n\n4\n\nRe Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPR 1 at [5(d)].\n\n11\n\n\fa sequential series of digits (“123456”). This made the New Password easily\nguessable and insecure.\n\n29\n\nFurther, the sharing of credentials for Peter’s Admin Account via a shared\n\nGoogle Sheet meant that anyone who obtained access to the said Google Sheet could\ngain access to Peter’s Admin Account. As the Commission has stated in the ICT\nSystems Guide at page 16, an organisation should “[h]ave clear policies that prohibit\nthe sharing of passwords such as admin credentials”. Such sharing posed a\nheightened risk of unauthorised access especially if a malicious actor was familiar with\nPeter’s user ID.\n\n30\n\nThe Organisation stressed to the Commission that passwords for accounts to the\n\nPlatform were hashed, and that the Organisation was unaware of the New Password.\nFurther, the Organisation stated that Peter’s Admin Account was used by Kyanon\nEmployees and not the Organisation’s employees, and that the New Password was\nset by the Kyanon Employees using Peter’s Admin Account.\n\n31\n\nWhile the immediate cause for the weak New Password and insecure sharing of\n\nthe credentials for Peter’s Admin Account may have been the Kyanon Employees, the\nOrganisation could have managed this better by specifying clearer data protection\nrequirements to Kyanon as part of its involvement in the Project, including in relation\nto account management.\n\n12\n\n\f32\n\nWhile the Master Services Agreement between the Organisation and Kyanon\n\ndated 1 January 2021 did impose broad data protection obligations on Kyanon, it did\nnot mandate any specific measures in relation to account management, beyond\nstating that “secure authentication and authorisation processes” were to be\nimplemented.\n\n33\n\nIn addition, Kyanon had provided the Organisation with a signed Letter of\n\nUndertaking in which Kyanon undertook to comply with “the standards in relation to\npersonal data protection, including those required under the Personal Data Protection\nAct (No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore (the “PDPA Policy”)”, the Organisation’s Security\nand Services Guide, and the Organisation’s Personal Data Handling and Measures.\nHowever, these documents did not specify any specific requirements for the disabling\nof ex-employee accounts.\n\n34\n\nTaking into consideration the above, the Commission finds the Organisation in\n\nbreach of the Protection Obligation for failing to disable Peter’s Admin Account after\nPeter was no longer a Kyanon employee.\n\nObservations on other data protection practices\n35\n\nSeparate to the above finding (which the Organisation admitted to), the\n\nCommission sets out observations on two other data protection practices which, if\nimplemented, could have prevented the unauthorised disclosure of personal data in\nthe Incident even if Peter’s Admin Account had not been disabled. For the avoidance\n13\n\n\fof doubt, these observations are made solely to provide guidance, and (i) do not\nconstitute additional findings of breaches of the Protection Obligation by the\nOrganisation in this case, or (ii) factor in any way in the Commission’s final decision in\nthis case.\n\nScoping of rights assigned to Admin Accounts\n36\n\nAll Admin Accounts assigned to Kyanon Employees were granted rights to\n\nexport data from the Platform, even though such rights may not have been necessary\nfor their work on the Project.\n\n37\n\nAs stated in the ICT Systems Guide (page 15) and paragraph 25 above, the\n\nCommission recommends regular review of user accounts to ensure that only the\nnecessary rights are assigned. The Commission has previously found organisations\nin breach for failing to carry out such review.5\n\nImplementation of MFA for Admin Accounts\n38\n\nThe level of privileges granted to all Admin Accounts created a heightened risk\n\nthat large volumes of personal data could be exfiltrated from the Platform if an Admin\nAccount was compromised. This risk was exacerbated by the fact that the Admin\nAccount did not require MFA. In Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3,\nthe Commission made clear that MFA should be implemented as a baseline\n\n5\n\nRedMart Limited [2022] SGPDPC 8 at [19].\n\n14\n\n\frequirement for administrative accounts with access to confidential or sensitive\npersonal data or large volumes of personal data.6\n\n39\n\nIn this case, the Organisation explained that while it had plans to implement\n\nMFA for the Admin Accounts (as part of unified access controls), these plans were\ndelayed due to manpower shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n40\n\nWhile the Commission recognises the business difficulties brought on by the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, implementation of MFA for the Admin Accounts could\nnevertheless have been given greater priority considering the volume of personal data\naccessible from the Platform, and the associated heightened data protection risks.\n\n41\n\nIt was not necessary for the Commission to make breach findings in relation to\n\nthe above two data protection practices in this case. However, the Commission will\nnot hesitate to find organisations in future enforcement cases in breach of the\nProtection Obligation for failing to implement the same – particularly in cases involving\nunauthorised use of administrative accounts with access to sensitive or large volumes\nof personal data.\n\n6\n\nLovebonito Singapore Pte.

Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) of a ransomware attack which resulted in the encryption of the\npersonal data of 141,412 individuals (“Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested that the investigation be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure. The Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and admitted to the facts set out below, and admitted that it had failed to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data accessed\nand encrypted during the Incident, in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation is in the leasing and hire-purchase business. It operates a\n\nwebsite through which existing or potential customers may submit applications to enter\ninto hire-purchase or leasing agreements.\n\nPage 2 of 14\n\n\f4\n\nOn 12 June 2022, the Organisation was notified by a customer that he was\n\nunable to submit an online application. The Organisation conducted an internal\ninvestigation and discovered that 7 servers and 6 employee computers had been\ninfected with ransomware, resulting in the encryption of the personal data of 141,412\nindividuals, comprising:\n\na)\n\n111,156 customers whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number,\ndate of birth, address, contact number, income statement, email address,\nemployer information, bank account, and additionally for foreign customers,\ntheir passport numbers and employment pass numbers;\n\nb)\n\n30,220 guarantors whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number,\ndate of birth, address, contact number, income statement, email address,\nemployer information, and bank account; and\n\nc)\n\n36 employees whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number, date\nof birth, address, contact number, email address, bank account, resume\ninformation, and medical check-up information.\n\n(collectively the “Subject Data”)\n\n5\n\nThe Subject Data was encrypted by a virus with the extension “.myghost”. The\n\nOrganisation also discovered a ransom note instructing the Organisation to contact\n“apichai[@]keemail.me” or “teeraanu[@]tuta.io” to obtain the decryption key, failing\n\nPage 3 of 14\n\n\fwhich the Subject Data would be leaked. The ransom note did not specify a ransom\namount. The Organisation did not respond to the ransom note.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation notified the Commission of the Incident on 14 June 2022. On\n\n8 July 2022, the Organisation requested that the investigation be handled under the\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure, and in a statement by its\nManaging Director dated 29 July 2022, admitted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\nInvestigations were conducted between 14 June 2022 and October 2022,\n\ncomprising the efforts of an IT forensic investigation firm engaged by the\nOrganisation’s parent organisation, and the Commission’s own investigations. The\ninvestigations revealed that:\n\na)\n\nA malicious encryption programme “Stager.exe” had been executed on at\nleast 3 servers by a compromised administrator account through Remote\nDesktop Connections;1\n\nb)\n\nThe IP address of each of the Remote Desktop Connections was generated\nby a FortiGate 100E Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) and firewall device\n(“Device”) in use by the Organisation since September 2019;\n\nc)\n\nThe software installed on the Device was the outdated version 6.0.4 of\nFortiOS and had a known vulnerability CVE-2018-13379 (“Vulnerability”).2\n\n1\n\nA Remote Desktop Connection refers to the connection and control by a user to a target device (such as a computer) remotely\nthrough the internet or other network.\n2\nThis is the same vulnerability that may have been exploited in the data breach incident which is the subject of the Commission’s\ndecision in The Law Society of Singapore [2023] SGPDPC 4.\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\fThe effect of the Vulnerability was that a malicious actor could, via the\ninternet, remotely access system files on the Device, specifically\n“sslvpn_websession”, containing the username and password of a VPN\nsession. With such details, the malicious actor would be able to gain access\nto the VPN to which the target’s (in this case, the Organisation) devices\nwere connected;\n\nd)\n\nThe most likely cause of the Incident was that malicious actor(s) exploited\nthe Vulnerability, thereby gaining access to the Organisation’s VPN. The\nmalicious actor(s) in turn compromised one of the Organisation’s\nadministrator accounts, gaining access to the Subject Data stored on the\nOrganisations servers and computers. However, no evidence was\ndiscovered to indicate that the Subject Data had been exfiltrated;\n\ne)\n\nThe Device’s manufacturer released a patch in May 2019 to address the\nVulnerability,3 but the patch had not been installed by the time of the\nIncident. The Organisation informed the Commission that while its IT\nvendor had the responsibility of upgrading the Organisation’s firewall, such\nupgrading / patching was only triggered upon request by the Organisation.\nHowever, the Organisation was unaware of the patch, did not have\nprocesses in place to manage software patches, and therefore did not\nrequest its IT vendor to patch the Vulnerability; and\n\nFortinet, Inc, “FortiOS system file leak through SSL VPN via specially crafted HTTP resource requests” (FortiGuard Labs, 24\nMay 2019) <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384> accessed 23 March 2023.\n3\n\nPage 5 of 14\n\n\ff)\n\nThe Organisation had not implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (“MFA”)\nfor its administrator accounts at the time of the Incident.\n\nRemedial Action\n8\n\nAfter the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na)\n\nReported the Incident to the Singapore Police Force and the Commission,\nwithin 72 hours of the discovery by the Organisation of the same;\n\nb)\n\nPublished a notice of the Incident on its website, and engaged an external\ncall centre to provide hotline services to affected customers;\n\nc)\n\nConducted anti-virus scans on all its computers;\n\nd)\n\nEngaged an IT forensic investigation firm to scan and monitor the internet\nfor the Subject Data. The IT forensic investigation firm did not detect any\ndisclosure of the same on the internet;\n\ne)\n\nPatched the Vulnerability and its Windows systems;\n\nf)\n\nChanged the passwords for its administrator accounts for all its servers and\ncritical network equipment; and\n\ng)\n\nImplemented MFA for access to its VPN.\n\nPage 6 of 14\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n9\n\nUnder section 24 of the PDPA an organisation must protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n10\n\nThe reasonableness of an organisation’s security arrangements to protect\n\npersonal data would be assessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such\npersonal data and the possible impact of a data breach. As stated in the Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 17\nMay 2022) (“Advisory Guidelines”) at paragraphs 17.3(a) and (b), an organisation\nshould:\n\n“a) design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n…\nc) implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of security\n…”\n\n11\n\nIn the present case, the Subject Data comprised a large volume of sensitive\n\npersonal data affecting 141,412 individuals. Such data included names, NRIC\nnumbers, bank account information and income statements. Given the nature of such\nPage 7 of 14\n\n\fpersonal data, there was a heightened risk of identity theft and/or financial loss, which\ncalled for a higher standard of security arrangements.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons set out below the Commission determines that the Organisation\n\nfailed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the Subject Data, in\nbreach of the Protection Obligation. In particular, the Organisation failed to:\n\na)\n\nConduct regular monitoring for software patches;\n\nb)\n\nImplement processes to manage software patches and upgrades; and\n\nc)\n\nImplement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\nFailure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches\n13\n\nThe importance of conducting regular monitoring for software patches, and more\n\ngenerally testing the vulnerability of info-communications and technology (“ICT”)\nsystems, has been stressed repeatedly by the Commission.\n\n14\n\nIn Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11, the Commission highlighted at\n\nparagraph 14 that it was necessary for organisations to conduct regular reviews and\nmonitoring of their ICT systems, which would include monitoring for software patches\nand updates.\n\n15\n\nThe Commission has also made clear at page 27 of its Guide to Data Protection\n\nPractices for ICT Systems, that as a basic measure, organisations ought to “conduct\nPage 8 of 14\n\n\fregular ICT monitoring, alerts, security audits, scan and tests to detect vulnerabilities\nand non-compliance with organisational standards.”\n\n16\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to conduct regular monitoring for software\n\npatches for the software on the Device. The Device (with the Vulnerability) had been\nin use by the Organisation since September 2019, more than 3 months since the\nDevice’s manufacturer had released the patch in May 2019. The Vulnerability\nremained un-patched for a period of almost 3 years thereafter until the Incident\noccurred. The Organisation admitted that it was unaware of the patch until after the\nIncident and that it did not conduct regular monitoring for software patches. Had the\nOrganisation conducted regular monitoring for software patches, it would have learned\nof the patch for the Vulnerability.\n\n17\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches to the\nsoftware on the Device.\n\nFailure to implement processes to manage software patches and upgrades\n18\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches\n\nunderscores the importance for organisations to implement processes to manage the\nsame.\n\n19\n\nAs noted at paragraph 7(e) above, software patching was done on an ad-hoc\n\nbasis by the Organisation’s IT vendor on the instructions of the Organisation. However,\nas the Organisation failed to monitor for software patches, it was unaware of the\nPage 9 of 14\n\n\favailable patch for the Vulnerability, and did not instruct the IT vendor to install the\npatch.\n\n20\n\nBased on the Organisation’s clarifications to the Commission, it is likely that the\n\nOrganisation assumed that its IT vendor would monitor for software patches even\nthough the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor did not contain any requirements\nfor the IT vendor to conduct regular monitoring. The Organisation failed to properly\napply its mind to the issue of regular monitoring, as this was not contained in the\ncontract between the Organisation and its IT vendor.\n\n21\n\nIn its Checklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches, the\n\nCommission recommends at page 6 that organisations should, as a basic practice,\n“Develop an ICT policy that covers the critical aspects in IT security such as account\nand access control, password, email, IT risk management, asset and configuration,\nbackup and recovery, hardening and patching.”\n\n22\n\nWhile the Commission does not prescribe the specific terms of such ICT\n\npolicies and/or processes, the Organisation could, for example, have implemented\nprocesses by which the Organisation or its IT vendors were automatically notified of\navailable software patches, or reminded on a periodic basis to conduct checks for\nsoftware patches. Further, the contract between the Organisation and its IT vendor\ncould have specifically included an obligation for the IT vendor to conduct regular\nmonitoring for patches, without the need for the Organisation to request patching on\nan ad-hoc basis. However, the Organisation failed to implement any such processes\nto manage software patches and upgrades.\nPage 10 of 14\n\n\f23\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation provided the Commission with copies of its\n\nInternal Data Protection Policy and its Compliance Handbook. However, neither\ndocument sets out any processes to manage software patches and upgrades.\n24\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement processes to manage software patches and\nupgrades.\n\nFailure to implement MFA for administrator accounts\n25\n\nThe Organisation also failed to implement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\n26\n\nIn its decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 published\n\non 19 May 2022 (i.e. before the Incident), the Commission made clear that MFA was\nto be implemented as a baseline requirement for accounts with access to confidential\nor sensitive personal data or large volumes of personal data:\n\n“Henceforth, the Commission adopts the following tiered approach:\n\n(a) First, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data: see [46][47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach, unless the\norganisation can show that its omission is reasonable or implementation of 2FA\nis disproportionate.\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\f(b) Second, remote access by privileged accounts to information systems\nthat host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large volumes of\npersonal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA / MFA. The risks\nconcerning remote access are higher, thus the expectation to implement 2FA /\nMFA will correspondingly increase.\n\n(c) Third, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or sensitive\npersonal data, or large volumes of personal data, are expected to enable\nand configure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that is available out-of-the-box.\nOmission to do so may be considered an aggravating factor.”4 (emphasis added\nin bold)\n\n27\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to implement MFA for its administrator\n\naccounts despite these accounts having access to confidential and sensitive personal\ndata.5 The Organisation did not furnish any explanation as to why such failure was\nreasonable or that the implementation of MFA would have been disproportionate.\n\n28\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission notes that the present case and the first tier of the approach\n\nin Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 (reproduced at paragraph 25\nabove) deal specifically with administrator accounts. However, where an account is\n\n4\n\nSee Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd.

Further, the patch for the\nVulnerability had been available for a lengthy period of 2 years and 9 months from\nthe time the Organisation first started using the Device until the Incident, but was not\ninstalled during that time. The Organisation had also failed to implement MFA for its\nadministrator accounts.\n\n32\n\nThe Commission nevertheless recognises the following mitigating factors:\n\na)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\nb)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial actions to address the Incident; and\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\n\fc)\n\nthe Organisation had voluntarily accepted responsibility for the Incident,\nthus facilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of this case\nthrough the expedited breach procedure.\n\n33\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby\n\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $82,000 within 30 days from the\ndate of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the\nrate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty\nis paid in full.\n\n34\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures already\n\ntaken by the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 14 of 14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on Century Evergreen for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of jobseekers in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Employment","URL manipulation"],"date":"15 Sep 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_century_evergreen_260723.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Century Evergreen","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/09/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-century-evergreen","timestamp":"2023-09-15","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 5\n\nCase No. DP-2212-C0526\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCentury Evergreen Private Limited\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 11 December 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a complaint against Century Evergreen Private Limited\n(the “Organisation”) that images of identification documents (which includes the\nNational Registration Identity Card) submitted by jobseekers to the Organisation\nwere publicly accessible on the Organisation’s website (“Incident”). The\nOrganisation is a manpower contracting services company and required\njobseekers to submit their identification documents to verify the identity of and\nsuitability of the jobseeker in question.\n\n2. Following the complaint received, the Commission commenced investigations to\ndetermine the Organisation’s compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”). The Organisation requested that the investigation be handled\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fthe Organisation voluntarily provided and admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. The Organisation also admitted that it failed to implement reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and control,\nand was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n3. The Organisation admitted that the Insecure Direct Object References (“IDOR”)\nvulnerability on its website, which allowed the complainant to manipulate the URL\nhad existed from the time the website was launched on 9 November 2015. As a\nresult of this vulnerability, 96,889 images of identification documents belonging to\n23,940 individuals were downloaded from the Organisation’s website from 10 to 12\nDecember 2022.\n\n4. The Organisation admitted that it was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA as it\nfailed to include any security requirements to protect personal data in its contract\nwith the vendor who first developed and subsequently maintained the website. In\nthis regard, even though the Organisation had engaged an IT vendor from the time\nthe website was developed and launched, the Organisation remained solely\nresponsible for protecting the personal data in its possession and control at all\nmaterial times.\n\n5. What is expected from organisations who engage professional services to build\ntheir websites and other online portals is explained in the Commission’s Guide on\nBuilding Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) (the “Guide”). The Commission\nhad consistently advised organisations of the need to emphasise the protection of\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\fpersonal data to their IT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms.1 The\ncontract should clearly state the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the\nPDPA. In this regard, the Commission noted that there was a glaring omission of\nclauses to protect personal data in the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor.\n\n6. The Organisation also admitted that apart from conducting functionality testing\nwhen the website was first launched, the Organisation had no arrangements with\nits IT vendor to conduct any security tests prior to the launch of the website, or\nthereafter. The Organisation had also failed to impose any security requirements\non the IT vendor to protect personal data, via contract.\n\n7. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner found that the Organisation had\ncontravened section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n8. In deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered that\na financial penalty ought to be imposed as the personal data affected included not\njust the identification numbers, but the images of the identification documents.\nFurthermore, there was a long period of non-compliance. The vulnerability was not\naddressed since 2015.\n\n9. In deciding on the appropriate amount of financial penalty, the circumstances set\nout above and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were considered,\nspecifically the impact of the personal data breach on the individuals affected and\nthe nature of the Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA. In the\ncircumstances, this was not an insignificant breach given the number of individuals\n\n1\n\nSee Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1] and Re EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 38.\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\faffected (ie 23,940) and the nature of personal data exfiltrated: 96,889 images of\nidentification documents.\n10. The Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA was also not simply one of\nmere negligence but that of gross negligence. There was a long period of noncompliance on the facts of this case. As set out above, the Commission had issued\nthe Guide to assist SMEs, and consistently cautioned the need for organisations\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA even when they engage an IT vendor in our\nprevious decisions.2\n\n11. In deciding on the appropriate amount of the financial penalty, the following factors\nwere considered – the Organisation’s turnover and profitability, its cooperation\nthroughout the investigation, its voluntary admission of breach of the Protection\nObligation under the EDP, and the prompt remedial actions taken after the\nOrganisation became aware of the IDOR vulnerability. This included rectifying the\nIDOR vulnerability, making server configuration changes to improve security,\nimplementing vulnerability scans, migrating its backup server to an encrypted\nremote server, deploying additional security software and subscription to security\nservices, and securing a new contract with its vendor to manage the security of its\nwebsite. In addition to its prompt remedial actions, its poor performance in the most\nrecent financial year was also taken into consideration. Finally, the organisation\nhad admitted to its culpability at an early stage and elected to proceed under the\nEDP.\n\n2\n\nRe EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 38 and Re Vhive Pte Ltd (Case No. DP-2013-B8138).\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f12. For the reasons above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and directs the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of S$9,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date of\nthis decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgement debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount\nof such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on Autobahn Rent A Car for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1\n\nOn 21 October 2022, Autobahn Rent A Car Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal\ndata breach (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates a car-sharing service, Shariot, in Singapore. On 24\n\nSeptember 2022, the Organisation received customer feedback that a photograph on\nits mobile application had been replaced with a pornographic photograph. The\nOrganisation discovered that the pornographic photograph had been uploaded\nthrough an unrevoked administrator account belonging to an ex-employee, who had\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\fleft the Organisation in May 2022. The ex-employee received an email from an\nunknown sender on 10 September 2022 stating that his personal laptop had been\nhacked and demanding Bitcoins as ransom payment. The threat actor was able to log\ninto the Shariot’s mobile application administrator portal through the administrator\naccount belonging to the ex-employee, and used the export CSV function to download\na copy of the Shariot’s users personal data.\n\n3\n\nSubsequently, on 21 October 2022, a cybersecurity solutions provider alerted\n\nthe Organisation of a cybercrime forum post offering the sale of a Shariot database\ncontaining personal data. The Commission commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by the Organisation.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision.\nIt admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s internal investigations discovered that compromise of the\n\ndormant administrator account credentials enabled the unauthorised access to Shariot\nbackend admin web portal, leading to the exfiltration of 53,000 personal data sets of\nShariot users. The personal data that were affected in the Incident included names,\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\femail addresses, mobile phone numbers, NRIC numbers and general location data\n(e.g. Bishan, Toa Payoh or Orchard).\n\n6\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n(a)\n\nImmediately conducted an internal audit of its administrator accounts to\n\nensure that any employee access that was not required was revoked;\n(b)\n\nEnhanced its software code and admin panel user interface to mask\n\ndisplayed or exported NRIC numbers to show only the last 4 characters; and\n(c)\n\nConducted cyber hygiene and awareness training for all staff handling\n\npersonal data.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had failed to ensure it had reasonable security\n\narrangements in place to prevent the unauthorized access or disclosure of the\npersonal data in its possession or control, as it failed to implement and ensure\nreasonable access control to its backend admin web portal. First, the Organisation\nfailed to revoke the login credentials of an administrator account belonging to an exemployee once the employment relationship came to an end in May 2022. As a result,\nthe ex-employee’s administrator login credentials remained active, which – when\ncompromised – enabled the malicious actor access into its network.\n\n8\n\nSecond, the Organisation also admitted that the Incident would not have\n\nhappened if it had implemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) as an additional\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\faccess control for its administrator accounts that had access to its sizeable user\ndatabase. In Re Lovebonito [2022] SGPDPC 3, the Commission had highlighted the\nneed for organisations to strengthen access control, through the use of a one-time\npassword (“OTP”) or 2FA/MFA, to such accounts. Indeed, regardless of whether an\naccount is an administrative account, once an account is granted access rights to a\ndatabase containing sensitive personal data records or a significant volume of\npersonal data that would adversely impact the affected individuals in the event of a\npersonal data breach, we would encourage organisations to consider implementing\nenhanced access controls to the account such as through the use of a OTP or\n2FA/MFA to better safeguard the personal data.\n\n9\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n10\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate as the personal data breach was not insignificant.\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA. In this regard, while the NRIC numbers and general\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\flocation data was affected, this is less serious than if the NRIC images and specific\nGPS location had been disclosed.\n\n11\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter non-compliance\nwith the PDPA. On the facts of this particular case, the organisation’s turnover has\nbeen taken into consideration to arrive at a proportionate and effective financial\npenalty. I also considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $3,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\f13\n\nIn addition to the financial penalty imposed, the Organisation is also directed to\n\ndo the following:\n(a)\n\nImplement processes for systems and applications revocation within a\n\nreasonable window of cessation of need for access by an employee;\n(b)\n\nStrengthen access controls measures to administrator accounts with\n\naccess to databases holding personal data;\n(c)\n\nConduct reasonable security review of technical and administrative\n\narrangements for the protection of personal data in possession or under control\nof the Organisation within 60 days of the date of this Direction;\n(d)\n\nRectify any security gaps identified in the security review directed above;\n\nand\n(e)\n\nInform the Commission within 1 week of the completion on the steps\n\ndirected above.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal or similar risks\nand;\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was administered to a registered salesperson of an estate agency for failing to (i) obtain clear and unambiguous consent; or (ii) check the Do Not Call Register before sending specified messages to individuals registered on the Do Not Call Register.","tags":["Do Not Call Provisions","Warning","Real Estate"],"date":"16 Aug 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_leon-wee_11072023-(004).pdf","nature":"Do Not Call Provisions","title":"Breach of Duty to Check the Do Not Call Register by a Registered Salesperson","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/08/breach-of-duty-to-check-the-do-not-call-register-by-a-registered-salesperson","timestamp":"2023-08-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 8\n\nCase No. ENF-DNC-221129-0007 & Others\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nWee Jing Kai Leon\n\n… Person\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fWee Jing Kai Leon\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. ENF-DNC-221129-0007 &\nOthers\n\n11 July 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nThe Do Not Call Registry (“DNC Registry”) is a national database kept and\n\nmaintained by the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\npursuant to section 39 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Persons\nmay register their Singapore telephone numbers with the DNC Registry so as to not\nreceive unsolicited telemarketing calls and messages. The DNC Registry comprises\nof 3 separate registers (i) the No Text Message Register, (ii) the No Voice Call\nRegister, and (iii) the No Fax Message Register.\n\n2\n\nBetween November 2022 and March 2023, the Commission received ten (10)\n\ncomplaints that one Wee Jing Kai Leon (“Individual”) had sent unsolicited\ntelemarketing messages to telephone numbers registered on the No Text Message\nRegister of the DNC Registry (the “Complaints”).\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether there had\n\nbeen any breaches of the “Do Not Call” provisions in Part 9 and 9A of the PDPA (“DNC\nProvisions”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n4\n\nThe Individual is a real estate salesperson registered with Propnex Realty Pte\n\nLtd since 2006. Over the years, the Individual collated a list of 2,918 Singapore\ntelephone numbers (the “Marketing List”).\n\n5\n\nOf the 2,918 telephone numbers in the Marketing List, 1,224 were registered\n\nwith the No Text Message Register of the DNC Registry on or around 31 March 2023.\n\n6\n\nThe Individual did not send any marketing messages to the telephone numbers\n\non his Marketing List before November 2022 and only admitted to sending a short\nmessaging service message each month from November 2022 to March 2023 (the\n“SMS Messages”) to the telephone numbers on the Marketing List to offer, advertise\nand/or promote his services as a real estate salesperson. According to the Individual,\nby November 2022, the challenging business environment had made it more difficult\nfor him to get leads. He therefore opted to rely on the numbers in the Marketing List to\nprospect for leads.\n\n7\n\nGiven that the Marketing List included 1,224 telephone numbers registered on\n\nthe DNC Registry, the Individual had sent approximately 6,120 SMS Messages to\n\n3\n\n\ftelephone numbers registered on the DNC Registry from November 2022 to March\n2023.\n\n8\n\nThe SMS Messages bore the sender ID “Propnex LW”, which is registered\n\nunder the SMS Sender ID Regime (“SSIR”)1 by DGK Global Pte Ltd (“DGK Global”),\na company owned by the Individual. During investigations, the Individual clarified that\nDGK Global was not involved in his real estate business, and that he used DGK Global\nto register the sender ID under SSIR because he needed a UEN number to do so.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Duty to check DNC Registry under section 43(1) of the PDPA\n9\n\nThe Commission’s investigation focused on whether the Individual had\n\nintentionally or negligently breached section 43(1) of the PDPA by:\n(a)\n\nsending “specified messages” addressed to Singapore telephone\nnumbers,\n\n(b)\n\nwithout having valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone numbers\nwere not listed in the DNC Registry at the time the specified messages\nwere sent.\n\n1\n\nThe SSIR was set up in March 2022 to enable organisations to protect their customers from receiving fraudulent\nSMS messages that spoofed the organisations’ SMS Sender IDs. Organisations intending to send SMS messages\nto Singapore mobile numbers can register any alphanumeric Sender IDs under the SSIR. The Full SSIR Regime\ncame into effect from 31 January 2023, upon which all non-registered Sender IDs will be marked as “LikelySCAM” for a transition period of 6 months. Thereafter, messages with non-registered Sender IDs will be blocked\nand not delivered to end-users.\n\n4\n\n\f“Specified message”\n10\n\nA message is a “specified message” if one of its purposes is for: 2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nAdvertising, promoting, or offering to supply or provide:\n(i)\n\ngoods or services;\n\n(ii)\n\nland or an interest in land;\n\n(iii)\n\nbusiness opportunity or an investment opportunity;\n\nAdvertising or promoting a supplier or provider (or a prospective supplier\nor provider) of the items listed in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) above.\n\n11\n\nWhether a “specified message” has one of the above purposes is determined\n\nwith regard to the following:3\n(a)\n\nthe content of the message;\n\n(b)\n\nthe presentational aspects of the message;\n\n(c)\n\nthe content that can be obtained using the numbers, URLs or contact\ninformation (if any) mentioned in the message; and\n\n(d)\n\nif the telephone number from which the message is made is disclosed to\nthe recipient (whether by calling line identity or otherwise), the content\n(if any) that can be obtained by calling that number.\n\n12\n\nThe SMS Messages were “specified messages” within the meaning of the DNC\n\nProvisions, as they were sent for the purpose of advertising and/or promoting the\nIndividual’s real estate services. The SMS Messages contained statements such as,\n2\n3\n\nTenth Schedule to the PDPA.\nSection 37(1) of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\n\f“Engage Professional & Committed Agent to Sell/Rent your Home.”, and “Whatsapp\nLeon Wee directly at https://chatwith.io/s/enquire to rent/sell your property”. They also\nincluded links to the Individual’s website and social media profiles.\n\n13\n\nThe Individual admitted that the SMS Messages were addressed to Singapore\n\ntelephone numbers, as also evidenced by the complaints received by the Commission.\n\nValid confirmation\n14\n\nA person can obtain valid confirmation that a Singapore telephone number is\n\nnot listed in the DNC Registry by doing the following:4\n(a)\n\nWithin 21 days before sending the specified message,5 the person can\napply for and receive confirmation from the Commission that the\nSingapore telephone number is not listed in the relevant register of the\nDNC Registry;6 or\n\n(b)\n\nThe person can obtain confirmation that the Singapore telephone\nnumber is not listed in the relevant register of the DNC Registry from a\n“checker”,7 but must not have reason to believe that, or be reckless as\nto whether the checker’s information was obtained more than 21 days\nago, or is false or inaccurate.\n\n4\n\nSection 43(2) of the PDPA.\nSection 15 of the Personal Data Protection (Do Not Call Registry) Regulations 2013 (the “DNC\nRegulations”).\n6\nUnder section 40(2) of the PDPA\n7\nA “checker” refers to a person that, for a reward, provides to another person (P) information on whether a\nSingapore telephone number is listed in the relevant register for the purpose of P’s compliance with Section 43(1)\nof the PDPA. A “checker” is a person other than the Commission, an employee of P, and an employee or agent\nof a checker.\n5\n\n6\n\n\f15\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Individual did not obtain valid confirmation that\n\nthe telephone numbers on his Marketing List were not listed in the DNC Registry.\n\nWhether the Individual received clear and unambiguous consent\n16\n\nEven if a specified message is sent to a Singapore telephone number without\n\nvalid confirmation that the number is not listed in the DNC Registry, a person does not\ncontravene section 43(1) of the PDPA if:\n(a)\n\nthe subscriber or user of the Singapore telephone number gave clear\nand unambiguous consent to the sending of the specified message; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe consent is evidenced in writing or other form so as to be accessible\nfor subsequent reference8. This means that the consent must be\ncaptured in a manner or form which can be retrieved and reproduced at\na later time in order to confirm that such consent was obtained. Possible\nforms include an audio or video recording of the consent given9.\n\n17\n\nIn the course of investigations, the Individual represented to the Commission\n\nthat he was under the impression that since he had obtained the telephone numbers\nprior to the enactment of the PDPA, he could use them for marketing purposes.\n\n18\n\nThe Commission recognises that a subscriber of a Singapore telephone\n\nnumber is deemed to have given his consent to a person to send a specified message\nto that Singapore telephone number if the subscriber consents to the sending of the\n8\n9\n\nSection 43(4) of the PDPA.\n[8.3] of the Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions (revised 1 February 2021)\n\n7\n\n\fspecified message before 2 January 2014 (i.e. before the DNC Provisions came into\neffect), and that consent has not been withdrawn.10 Even if the subscriber\nsubsequently adds his telephone number to the DNC Registry, this would not amount\nto withdrawal of consent.11\n\n19\n\nHowever, this does not relieve the Individual of his obligations under section\n\n43(4) to obtain the consent of the subscribers or users of the Singapore telephone\nnumber to which a specified message is sent to him. In other words, if the Individual\nintended to rely on section 43(4) of the PDPA, he should have obtained clear and\nunambiguous consent to the sending of the SMS Messages to the telephone numbers\nin his Marketing List from the subscribers of the Singapore telephone numbers\ncontained therein evidenced in written or other forms. The Commission sets out, at\n[8.5] of the Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions (revised 1 February 2021),\nvarious methods through which such consent can be obtained from the subscribers or\nusers:\n“For example, persons may seek to obtain consent by asking individuals to:\na) respond to a pop-up on a webpage;\nb) respond to pop-ups or other form of notifications within mobile applications;\nc) fill out and submit a web form;\nd) fill out and submit a physical form;\ne) indicate their choice by signing or ticking against a check box printed on a\nletter or service agreement; or\n10\n11\n\nSection 47(4) of the PDPA.\nSection 47(5) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\ff) call or send an SMS to the person.”\n\n20\n\nThe Commission found no evidence of the Individual obtaining such clear and\n\nunambiguous consent from any of the subscribers of the Singapore telephone\nnumbers on the Marketing List, in written or other forms before or after 2 January 2014.\n\n21\n\nAccordingly, the Individual failed to obtain valid confirmation that the telephone\n\nnumbers in the Marketing List are not listed in the DNC Registry before sending the\nSMS Messages, and has negligently contravened section 43(1) of the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Individual is an employee acting in the course of employment\n22\n\nFor completeness, the Commission assessed whether the defence under\n\nsection 48 of the PDPA was available to the Individual, and concluded that it was not.\nSection 48(2) provides that section 43(1) does not apply to an employee who sends a\nspecified message to a Singapore telephone number if he can prove that he did so in\ngood faith in the course of his employment or in accordance with instructions given to\nhim by or on behalf of his employer in the course of his employment. The Commission\nconsidered the following:\n(a)\n\nIn accordance with industry practices, real estate salespersons such as\nthe Individual are not in an “employer-employee relationship” with their\nagencies.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Individual confirmed that he is not an employee of Propnex Realty\nPte Ltd (“Propnex”) despite being registered with them. He does not\n\n9\n\n\freceive salary from Propnex, nor does Propnex provide the Individual\nwith medical benefits, CPF contributions, or annual leave benefits. The\nIndividual is self-employed and does not report to Propnex on the\nconduct of his business.\n(c)\n\nThe contents of the SMS Messages related to the services of the\nIndividual specifically, and not Propnex.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n23\n\nIn determining whether any financial penalties or directions should be imposed\n\non the Individual, the Commission took the following into consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Individual was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Individual had otherwise made efforts to ensure his compliance with\nother DNC Provisions, in particular the requirement under section 44 of\nthe PDPA to include clear and accurate information identifying the\nsender of the SMS Messages and how he can be readily contacted. He\nhad also provided recipients the option to unsubscribe from the SMS\nMessages, and would remove a recipient’s telephone number from the\nMarketing List if so requested; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Individual’s efforts to register the sender ID “Propnex LW” showed\na willingness to comply with regulatory regimes, in particular the SSIR.\n\n24\n\nHaving considered all the factors listed above, the Individual is hereby\n\nadministered a warning in respect of his breach of section 43(1) of the PDPA. No other\n\n10\n\n\fdirections are necessary in view of the Individual’s voluntary cessation of sending\nspecified messages to numbers on the Marketing List.\n\n25\n\nThe Commission observes that this case occurred alongside media reports of\n\nan increase in property scams. The Commission has also investigated complaints\ninvolving property agents who had concealed their identities while sending marketing\nmessages in contravention of the DNC Provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, while\nthere was no evidence that the Individual was involved in any scams or had attempted\nto conceal his identity in his marketing messages, the Commission will continue to\nmonitor this trend involving property agents and calibrate its decisions in future cases\naccordingly to ensure compliance with the DNC Provisions of the PDPA.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $74,400 was imposed on Ecommerce Enablers for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect users' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"16 Aug 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/decision---ecommerce-enablers.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Ecommerce Enablers","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/08/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ecommerce-enablers","timestamp":"2023-08-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 6\n\nCase No. DP-2009-B7056\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nE-Commerce Enablers Pte.

Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2009-B7056\n16 May 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 25 September 2020, E-Commerce Enablers Pte. Ltd. (“Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) and its customers of an\nincident involving unauthorised access to its customer data servers (the “Incident”).\nPDPC subsequently received 2 complaints from the Organisation’s customers in\nrelation to the Incident. On 12 November 2020, the Organisation's customer database\nwas offered for sale on an online forum indicating that personal data was exfiltrated\nduring the Incident.\n\n2\n\nPDPC commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s compliance\n\nwith the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the Incident.\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation runs an online platform offering cashback for purchases\n\nmade through affiliated merchant programs. The platform also provides coupons,\nvoucher codes, and comparison features with discounts for users.\n\n4\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation hosted its customer database on\n\nvirtual servers in an Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud environment (“Customer\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fStorage Servers”). The Organisation employed a 12-man Site Reliability Engineering\n(“SRE”) team whose responsibilities included maintaining the Organisation’s\ninfrastructure, providing, and managing the Organisation’s cloud environment on\nAWS, and ensuring security of the AWS keys. The SRE team made use of an AWS\naccess key with full administrative privileges (the “AWS Key”) for the purposes of its\nwork, including infrastructure deployment. Only SRE team members had access to,\nand were authorised to use, the AWS Key. On 4 June 2019, the AWS Key was\ninadvertently committed to software code in a private repository in GitHub, by a senior\nmember of the SRE team. This was discovered by another SRE team member on 6\nJune 2019, and the AWS Key was removed from GitHub on the same day. However,\nit remained viewable in GitHub’s ‘commit history’, which records all changes and\nprevious versions of code uploaded on GitHub.\n\n5\n\nOn 21 June 2019, the AWS Key was to be deleted and replaced by a new key\n\nas part of an out-of-cycle key rotation. The member of the SRE team in charge of the\nkey rotation informed the SRE team (via email) that he had created a new key to\nreplace the AWS Key, and that he would be deleting the AWS Key. However, after\ncreating the replacement key, he failed to fully disable and remove the AWS Key.\n\n6\n\nAs a result, the AWS Key continued to be usable to access the Organisation’s\n\nAWS environment (and consequently the Customer Storage Servers) until shortly after\nthe time of the Incident, about 15 months later.\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fThe Incident\n7\n\nOn 9 September 2020, a malicious threat actor accessed the Organisation’s\n\nAWS environment utilizing the AWS Key. The AWS Key was likely found by the threat\nactor in the commit history of the GitHub private repository.\n\n8\n\nHaving gained privileged access to the AWS environment, the threat actor (i)\n\nconducted reconnaissance to identify the Organisation’s data repositories, (ii) modified\nsecurity settings including to allow remote internet access to the Organisation’s\ndatabase instances (i.e. its virtual servers hosting data), and (iii) generated a fresh\ndatabase instance to stage its data exfiltration.\n\n9\n\nThe threat actor then proceeded to exfiltrate data from the Customer Storage\n\nServers. The data items, and the corresponding number of individuals affected, are\nset out below:\n\nTypes of personal data\nEmail Address\n\nNumber of affected users\n1,457,637\n\nName\n\n840,210\n\nMobile number\n\n447,076\n\nAddress\n\n138,327\n\nGender\n\n23,278\n\nNRIC numbers\n\n9,961\n\nDate of birth\n\n202,634\n\nBank Account number\n\n299,381\n\nPartial credit card information, including:\n\n378,531\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f(i) partial credit card number (first 6 digits\nand last 4 digits)\n(ii) issuing bank\n(iii) country\n(iv) expiry month and year\n(v) Visa or Mastercard\n\n10\n\nOn 17 September 2020, the Organisation discovered during a routine security\n\nreview that there had been unauthorised access to its AWS environment. Further\ninvestigations revealed that there had been unauthorised third-party access to the\nOrganisation’s AWS environment.\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation subsequently engaged a private forensic expert, (“PFE”) to\n\ninvestigate further. The PFE confirmed that the unauthorised access had been carried\nout using the AWS Key. The Organisation conjectured that it was likely that the threat\nactor had obtained the AWS Key from GitHub’s commit history, where the AWS Key\nwas still visible despite the removal of the wrongly committed code from the private\nrepository in GitHub.\n\nRemedial actions\n12\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following remedial\n\nmeasures:\nImmediate remedial steps to contain the Incident\n(a)\n\nPerformed a full deletion of the AWS Key and rotated the other AWS keys;\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nReversed all changes made by the threat actor and triggered a forced\nlogout and password reset of all customers’ accounts;\n\nTo prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n(c)\n\nIncreased monitoring of logs to ensure heightened detection of any\nunauthorised access;\n\n(d)\n\nSeparated development and production accounts, resulting in a smaller\nsubset of engineers having access to the production environment;\n\n(e)\n\nSecured access to systems and data with several measures, including VPN\nand IP address whitelisting and database encryption; and\n\n(f)\n\nCreated a platform for employee security suggestions / breach reporting.\n\nSubsequent sale of personal data on Raidforums\n13\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Organisation’s database was offered for sale on\n\nRaidforums, an online cybersecurity forum commonly used for trading and selling of\nstolen databases. Raidforums’ domain name and content was independently seized\nby authorities from the United States in April 2022.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n14\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control, by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fdisclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). The Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\nObligation in two respects.\n\nLack of sufficiently robust processes for AWS key management\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to ensure that processes to manage the AWS keys\n\nthat granted access to the Customer Storage Servers were sufficiently robust.\n\n16\n\nWhile the Organisation admitted that it could have done more to ensure that its\n\nemployees were performing their AWS key rotation duties properly, the Organisation\nclaimed that the compromise of the AWS Key arose from human error, and not\nbecause of any systemic issue with the Organisation’s security practices. According\nto the Organisation, there was no reason to doubt the capabilities of the SRE team\nmember in question, because (i) he was a senior member of the SRE team, (ii) his\nresponsibilities included key security and rotation, and (iii) he had dutifully rotated /\ndeleted all other keys assigned to him in the out-of-cycle key rotation. The SRE team\nmember’s inadvertent commit, and an incomplete rotation/deletion were in direct\ncontravention of the Organisation’s security practices. The Organisation accordingly\nsought to frame the Incident as a one-off case of human error.\n\n17\n\nThis position is not accepted. As explained in Re DataPost Pte Ltd,\n\nOrganisations cannot place sole reliance on their employees to perform their duties\nproperly as a security arrangement to protect personal data. There must be some\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\fprocesses to ensure that the step required from the employee is taken, such as\nindependent verification by another checker1.\n\n18\n\nFor example, a precaution the Organisation could have taken to ensure that the\n\nout-of-cycle key rotation was complete would have been to have a supervisor or\nanother SRE team member test either all or a reasonable sample of the old keys\n(depending on the number of keys being rotated) to verify that they had been disabled.\nThere was no such verification or testing practice put in place by the Organisation; the\nOrganisation relied wholly on the SRE team member’s seniority and experience.\n\n19\n\nWhen a high-risk task (e.g. rotation of an AWS key that gives access to the\n\nwhole of the AWS environment) is concerned, it is all the more important that there\nmust be additional verifications and checks.\n\nFailure to conduct periodic security review\n20\n\nSecond, specific security review by the Organisation on AWS keys could have\n\ncovered and detected whether the AWS Key remained active or had been used after\nthe out-of-cycle key rotation, and during the 15 months preceding the Incident. The\nOrganisation failed to conduct regular security review on whether the AWS keys had\nbeen properly rotated/deleted. In the course of investigations, the Organisation\nacknowledged that it could have done more to ensure that the SRE team was\nperforming their AWS key rotation duties properly. Following the Incident, the\n1 Re DataPost Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 10, at [13] – [16]\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\fOrganisation implemented a more secure process for temporary, time-limited keys to\nbe issued to SRE team members whenever access to the AWS environment was\nrequired. The Organisation also developed a specific IT security policy concerning the\nsecure sharing of keys internally.\n\nObservation on the incident management processes\n21\n\nFollowing discovery of the inadvertent committal of the AWS Key to GitHub, the\n\nOrganisation took 15 days to conduct a key rotation. Regardless of whether this had\nbeen an out-of-cycle rotation, the Organisation should review its incident management\nprocesses to determine whether it was reasonable to have taken 15 days to remediate\ncompromise of a full administrative privilege AWS access key.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n22\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, including the following aggravating and mitigating\nfactors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation lacked sufficiently robust processes to monitor its incident\nmanagement response to ensure reasonable remediation speed, which led\nto 15 days passing before the Organisation responded to the exposure of\nthe AWS Key;\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe AWS Key was exposed for a long period of 15 months;\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the\naffected individuals;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily acknowledged that its failure to ensure proper\nrotation and deletion of the AWS Key constituted a breach of the Protection\nObligation.\n\n23\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 15 February 2023 and was invited to make representations\non the same. The Organisation made representations on 22 March 2023, albeit not on\nits liability for breaches of the Protection Obligation or on the proposed financial\npenalty. Where accepted by the Commission, these representations have been\nincorporated into this decision.\n\n24\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $74,400\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f25\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 and $10,000 was imposed on Fullerton Healthcare and Agape CP Holdings respectively for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data belonging to Fullerton Healthcare’s corporate clients and direct patients.

DP-2110-B9054 / DP-2110-B9060\n23 March 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 19 October 2021 and 21 October 2021, Fullerton Healthcare Group Pte\n\nLimited (“FHG”) and Agape CP Holdings Pte. Ltd. (“Agape”) respectively notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that the personal data of\nFHG’s customers had been accessed, exfiltrated, and offered for sale on the dark web\n(the “Incident”). The Commission commenced investigations to determine whether\nthe Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by FHG and Agape.\n\n2\n\nOn 11 January 2022 and 12 January 2022 respectively, FHG and Agape\n\nrequested for the investigations to be handled under the Commission’s Expedited\nDecision Procedure. In this regard, FHG and Agape voluntarily provided and admitted\nto the facts set out below and admitted that they had failed to implement reasonable\n\n2\n\n\fsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data accessed and exfiltrated in the\nIncident in breach of section 24 of the PDPA (the “Protection Obligation”).\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nFHG is an enterprise healthcare service provider which provides healthcare\n\nservices to individuals and employees of its corporate clients. In 2018, FHG engaged\nAgape, a business process outsourcing provider and social enterprise, to provide call\ncentre and appointment booking services for its customers (the “Services”). As part\nof its social enterprise initiatives, Agape engaged inmates from Changi Women’s\nPrison (the “Agents”) to assist in provision of the Services for FHG’s customers.\n\n4\n\nIn order to carry out the Services, FHG provided Agape with access to the\n\npersonal data of its customers via Microsoft SharePoint, a cloud-based document\nmanagement system. A single Agape personal computer (the “Computer”) was\nauthorised to access FHG’s SharePoint platform via an FHG-assigned SharePoint\naccount.\n\n5\n\nIn order to facilitate Agents’ access to FHG’s customer data from within Changi\n\nWomen’s Prison, Agape downloaded FHG’s customer data onto the Computer, and\nre-uploaded the customer data onto an internet-facing file server (“the Online Drive”).\nThe Online Drive was then white-listed for access by the Agents from within Changi\nWomen’s Prison.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Incident\n6\n\nOn 15 October 2021, FHG became aware that its customer data was being\n\noffered for sale on a dark web forum. FHG engaged cybersecurity consultants to\ninvestigate. On 18 October 2021, FHG’s cybersecurity consultants made contact with\nthe purported seller who claimed that he had exfiltrated FHG’s customer data from\nAgape’s Online Drive. By 22 October 2021, the post on the dark web forum advertising\nthe sale had been removed.\n\n7\n\nFHG’s cybersecurity consultants confirmed that the Incident solely involved and\n\naffected Agape’s Online Drive. FHG’s own systems and servers were not affected in\nthe Incident.\n\n8\n\nThe personal data of 156,900 FHG customers (133,866 direct patients and\n\n23,034 employees of FHG’s corporate clients) was accessed without authorisation in\nthe Incident, although the exact volume of exfiltrated personal data was unknown. The\naffected personal data comprised the following datasets:\nDirect patients\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number / FIN;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(d)\n\nGender;\n\n(e)\n\nEmail address;\n4\n\n\f(f)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(g)\n\nFinancial information (Bank account numbers and bank codes);\n\n(h)\n\nHealth information (International Classification of Diseases codes that pertain\n\nto an individual’s diagnosis information, and codes for surgical procedures done in\nhospitals);\nEmployees of FHG’s corporate clients\n(i)\n\nName;\n\n(j)\n\nNRIC number / FIN / Passport number;\n\n(k)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(l)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(m)\n\nFinancial information; and\n\n(n)\n\nHealth, and other information (Information relating to the utilisation of health\n\nbenefits by individual members, which include details of clinic names and claim\namount\n(collectively, the “Customer Data”).\n\nRemedial actions\n9\n\nAs part of remedial measures following the Incident, FHG informed affected\n\nclients and individuals promptly via SMS, email, and an FAQ page on its website,\nadvising on appropriate steps which could be taken to guard against potential risks.\nFHG also engaged Credit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd to provide free credit monitoring\nservices to affected individuals for 6 months.\n\n5\n\n\f10\n\nAgape suspended use of the Online Drive with effect from 19 October 2021,\n\nand, with the assistance of a forensic team, conducted internal checks on the\nComputer and Online Drive for other indicators of compromise.\n\n11\n\nFHG in coordination with Agape also:\n\n(a)\n\nrestricted Agape’s access to its SharePoint to “view-only”;\n\n(b)\n\ndeleted SharePoint files and folders that Agape did not need as part of data\n\nminimisation efforts;\n(c)\n\nceased synchronisation of data between SharePoint and the Computer;\n\n(d)\n\nchanged all passwords for Agape’s access to FHG’s SharePoint; and\n\n(e)\n\ndeleted the Customer Data from the Online Drive upon completion of Agape’s\n\ninvestigations into the Incident.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether Agape had contravened the Protection Obligation\n12\n\nAs a data intermediary of FHG, Agape is subject to the Protection Obligation\n\npursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA. For the reasons set out below, Agape was\ndetermined to have breached the Protection Obligation in relation to the Customer\nData affected in the Incident.\n\n6\n\n\fFailure to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews\n13\n\nIn previous enforcement decisions, the Commission has emphasised the need\n\nfor organisations to conduct periodic security reviews of their IT systems. Such reviews\nenable organisations to detect vulnerabilities, assess security implications and risks,\nand ensure that reasonable security arrangements are implemented to eliminate or\nmitigate such risks. Periodic security reviews should be scoped based on the\norganisation’s assessment of its data protection needs, for example, taking into\naccount the type of personal data to be protected.1\n\n14\n\nIn Quoine Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 2 (“Quoine”), while the organisation had\n\nconducted periodic security reviews, these security reviews were improperly scoped\nand failed to include a particular account. The organisation explained that its current\nstaff were not aware of the reasons for the affected account’s set-up and security\narrangements, as the account had been created “at some time in the past (so legacy)”.\nThis explanation did not excuse the organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation.\nThe Commission found that it was incumbent on the organisation to have implemented\nthe necessary systems and processes to ensure that critical information about its\nsystems, including legacy systems, survived the turnover of its staff (Quoine at [23]).\n\n15\n\nSimilarly, while Agape had carried out periodic security reviews, these reviews\n\nfailed to cover the Internet-facing Online Drive. Agape admitted that this omission was\n\n1\n\nEverlast Projects Pte Ltd and others [2020] SGPDPC 20 (at [21]).\n\n7\n\n\fbecause the use of the Online Drive had been a legacy feature unique to Agape’s\nengagement by FHG, which was not implemented for any of Agape’s other clients. As\na result of this omission, Agape failed to review and assess the Online Drive’s security\nimplications and risks.\n\n16\n\nWhen the Online Drive was installed in December 2017, it was protected by a\n\npassword which met Agape’s password complexity policy (i.e. 8 to 10 characters with\na mix of upper and lower-case characters, numbers and symbols). However, at the\ntime of the Incident, the password for Agape’s Online Drive had been inadvertently\ndisabled for an estimated 20 months (since December 2019), the cause of which could\nnot be established. Agape admitted that this caused the Online Drive to become an\nopen directory listing on the Internet with no password protection, and highly\nvulnerable to unauthorised access, modification and similar risks over an excessive\nperiod of time.\n\n17\n\nIf Agape’s periodic reviews had been properly scoped to cover all of the IT\n\ncomponents under its Services rendered to FHG (including the Online Drive), this\nlapse could have been detected and rectified timeously.\n\nInadequate password policy and management\n18\n\nIn the course of investigations, Agape also admitted that prior to the password\n\nbeing disabled in December 2019, it had been shared by Agents to access the Online\n\n8\n\n\fDrive. In Terra Systems Pte. Ltd. [2021] SGPDPC 72, the Commission highlighted the\ndata protection risks associated with multiple users sharing a common password,\nincluding greater risks of unauthorised access by ex-staff and inadvertent disclosure\nto threat actors through social engineering, among others.\n\n19\n\nThe use of a common password among all Agents was exacerbated by the fact\n\nthat there was no expiry date set for the password. The failure to implement and\nenforce reasonable password management policies increased the vulnerability of the\nCustomer Data on the Online Drive to unauthorised access and other similar risks,\neven before the password had been disabled.\n\n20\n\nFor the above reasons, Agape was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation.\n\nWhether FHG had contravened Section 24 of the PDPA\nFailure to exercise reasonable oversight of vendor\n21\n\nUnder Section 4(3) of the PDPA, an organisation that engages a data\n\nintermediary to process personal data on its behalf, bears the same obligations under\nthe PDPA as if the personal data was processed by the organisation itself. This is so,\neven where the organisation engages the data intermediary to implement the\n\n2\n\nThis decision was subsequently subjected to reconsideration by the Commission. In Terra Systems\nPte Ltd [2022] SGPCPCR 1, the Commissioner affirmed the finding of the organisation’s breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA and the financial penalty imposed.\n\n9\n\n\fnecessary data protection measures in relation to the personal data (Social Metric Pte\nLtd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at [15]).\n\n22\n\nThe Commission has reiterated in past decisions, such as SCAL Academy Pte.\n\nLtd. [2020] SGPDPC 2, that the Protection Obligation requires organisations to\nexercise reasonable oversight of their vendors.\n\n23\n\nSpecifically in the context of an organisation’s relationship with its data\n\nintermediary, the organisation (i.e. the data controller) has a supervisory or general\nrole for the protection of the personal data, while the data intermediary has a more\ndirect and specific role in the protection of personal data arising from its direct\npossession or control over the personal data. This means that a data controller may\nbe found in breach of the Protection Obligation, even though its data intermediary may\nnot be found in breach, and vice versa (Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at\n[16]).\n\n24\n\nIn this case, FHG engaged Agape as its data intermediary to carry out the\n\nServices using the personal data provided by FHG. Under the Protection Obligation,\nFHG was required to exercise reasonable oversight of Agape’s data processing\nactivities.\n\n25\n\nIn SCAL Academy Pte. Ltd. [2020] SGPDPC 2 (at [8]), even though the\n\norganisation in question had instructed its vendor to prevent certain documents from\n10\n\n\fbeing ‘leaked’ online, it did not check what security arrangements the vendor had\nimplemented to ensure this. This hindered the organisation and vendor from being\nable to identify any data protection risks and agree on the measures to be implemented\nto protect against unauthorised disclosure of the personal data in the documents.\n\n26\n\nIn this case, due consideration is given to the fact that FHG had conducted a\n\nhigh-level IT due diligence review of Agape prior to its decision to onboard Agape as\na vendor, and that FHG’s written agreement with Agape required the latter to comply\nwith the PDPA including, among others, obligations to take all appropriate and\nreasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards, and security\narrangements. Nevertheless, FHG’s failed to exercise reasonable oversight through\nregular monitoring of Agape’s personal data handling processes throughout the\nengagement, including how Agape stored and granted Agents’ access to the\nCustomer Data.\n\n27\n\nIn this regard, there was a point of contention between the parties over whether\n\nFHG was aware of and permitted the uploading of the Customer Data from Agape’s\nComputer to the Internet-facing Online Drive.\n\n28\n\nAccording to FHG, its understanding with Agape was that the local copy of the\n\nCustomer Data on the Computer was only to be used for emergency or exceptional\nsituations such as when Agape was unable to connect to FHG’s SharePoint during\nany system downtime or disruptive event. No other copies of the Customer Data were\n11\n\n\fto be made by Agape, whether from the SharePoint or the local copy on the Computer.\nFHG stated that it did not provide Agape with permission to upload the Customer Data\nfrom Agape’s Computer to the Online Drive.\n\n29\n\nIn contrast, Agape asserted that FHG was aware that the Agents were inmates\n\noperating from inside Changi Women’s Prison, and that there were IT restrictions\npreventing them from accessing the Customer Data directly from FHG’s Sharepoint.\nAs such, Agape had downloaded and uploaded the Customer Data onto its Online\nDrive for the Agents to access and use. Agape asserted that FHG was aware of\nAgape’s process of sharing Customer Data with the Agents as FHG’s representatives\nhad been present during “dry runs”.\n\n30\n\nWhile there was insufficient contemporaneous evidence to support either\n\nparty’s version of events, the fact remains that FHG was aware that Agape was\nengaging inmates from inside Changi Women’s Prison to carry out the Services, and\nthe Commission’s findings regarding FHG’s breach of the Protection Obligation are\nnot dependent on whether FHG permitted Agape to upload the Customer Data to the\nOnline Drive or not.\n\n31\n\nGiven that FHG was aware that access to the Customer Data would have to be\n\ngranted to a third party that was offsite for the provision of the Services, FHG should\nhave made reasonable enquiries to ascertain how the Customer Data was to be stored\nand transmitted, and how access to the Customer Data would be controlled. Had FHG\n12\n\n\fmade these enquiries and discovered the true state of affairs, they would have no\ndoubt required Agape to implement stricter controls to regulate Agents’ access and\nuse of the Customer Data. By failing to make such enquiries, FHG failed to appreciate\nthe reality of how Agape was storing, transmitting, and retaining the Customer Data,\nand failed to exercise reasonable oversight over Agape’s data processing activities.\n\nUnnecessary disclosure of sensitive personal data\n32\n\nSeparately, FHG inadvertently disclosed personal data only intended for its\n\nemployees’ internal use, onto the SharePoint system shared with Agape. This included\nsensitive financial information such as bank account numbers and bank codes, and\nhealth information such as ICD codes and codes for surgical procedures done in\nhospitals. These datasets were not required by Agape for the performance of the\nServices, and this inadvertent disclosure ultimately led to a greater loss of personal\ndata during the Incident.\n\n33\n\nWhen an organisation discloses more personal data than is needed for its\n\npurposes, this creates unnecessary data security risks, particularly where such data\nis more sensitive in nature3.\n\n3\n\nHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 9 (at [19]-[20])\n\n13\n\n\f34\n\nIn the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems4 (at\n\npage 11), data minimisation has been encouraged as a good way for organisations to\nexamine what personal data is really needed. It should be a basic data protection\npractice for organisations to collect, use, or disclose only the least sensitive types of\npersonal data if different types of personal data can be used to achieve the same\npurpose.\n\n35\n\nFHG should have implemented robust measures to ensure that only personal\n\ndata necessary for performance of the Services was shared with Agape, and in\nparticular, that sensitive personal data was not inadvertently disclosed.\n\n36\n\nIn view of the above, FHG was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation in respect of the Customer Data.\n\nVoluntary measures implemented by FHG and Agape\n37\n\nFollowing the Incident, FHG and Agape have voluntarily taken or will be taking\n\nthe following steps to prevent a recurrence of the Incident or similar events:\n\nFHG\n(a)\n\nAgents will now access FHG’s customer data directly from FHG’s SharePoint\n\nvia individual user accounts with multi-factor authentication;\n\n4\n\nPublished on 14 September 2021. The Guide compiles data protection practices from past Advisory\nGuidelines, Guides and data breach cases that should be adopted by organisations in their ICT policies,\nsystems and processes.\n\n14\n\n\f(b)\n\nFHG’s SharePoint has been reconfigured to grant “view-only” access to only\n\nthe specific files required by vendors for the services to be provided, with clear\nsegregation between the vendor’s SharePoint files and FHG’s internal SharePoint\nfiles;\n(c)\n\nFHG will formally communicate its internal personal data protection policies and\n\nprocesses to vendors in order for them to be applied to the vendors’ processing of\npersonal data on FHG’s behalf;\n(d)\n\nFHG will enhance its contracts with vendors to include additional data\n\nprotection obligations, such as the requirement for vendors to undergo regular\nvulnerability assessments and penetration testing, rights for FHG to audit the vendor’s\ndata processing practices, and requirements for vendors to have in place reasonable\ndata breach response management processes;\n\nAgape\n(e)\n\nWith the assistance of external cybersecurity consultants, Agape has refreshed\n\nits data protection and IT policies; and\n(f)\n\nAgape has increased data protection awareness by requiring employees to go\n\nthrough the assessment tools provided on the Commission’s website, enrolling\nemployees in Workforce Skills Qualifications PDPA courses for certification, and\nregularly conducting internal communications to maintain cybersecurity vigilance.\n\n15\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n38\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on FHG and Agape\n\nunder Section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether they should be required to pay a\nfinancial penalty under Section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at Section 48J(6)\nof the PDPA and the following mitigating factors were taken into account:\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nFHG and Agape were cooperative during the investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nFHG and Agape voluntarily admitted to their breaches of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nFHG and Agape took prompt remedial actions following discovery of the\n\nIncident.\n\n39\n\nWhile Agape’s breaches of the Protection Obligation were more causally\n\nproximate to the unauthorised access and disclosure of personal data in the Incident,\nFHG’s inadvertent disclosure of financial and health related data resulted in the impact\nof the Incident being amplified. As the data controller, FHG also bore the ultimate\nresponsibility to exercise due diligence and reasonable supervision over Agape. For\nthe purposes of assessing what amount of financial penalty would be proportionate\nand effective as a deterrent, it was also taken into consideration that FHG’s annual\nturnover based on its latest available audited accounts, was almost 50 times higher\nthan that of Agape’s.\n16\n\n\f40\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant circumstances, the Commissioner\n\nhereby requires that:\n(a)\n\nFHG pay a financial penalty of $58,000; and\n\n(b)\n\nAgape pay a financial penalty of S$10,000;\n\nwithin 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n41\n\nIn quantifying the financial penalties imposed, no weight was placed on Agape’s\n\nstatus as a social enterprise. The standard of security arrangements expected under\nthe Protection Obligation will depend on the volume and nature of personal data in the\norganisation’s possession or control, regardless of whether the organisation is a forprofit business, a charity, or a social enterprise5.\n\n42\n\nIn addition to the financial penalties imposed, FHG and Agape are also directed\n\nto do the following:\n\n5\n\nSee Singapore Red Cross Society [2020] SGPDPC 16 at [10]\n\n17\n\n\fFHG\n(a)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nReview processes and contractual obligations with Agape and existing\nvendors processing personal data on behalf of FHG, to ensure that such\nvendors have sufficiently robust data handling processes to protect\npersonal data in their possession and/or control;\n\nii.\n\nReview existing internal processes to ensure that only personal data\nnecessary for fulfilling contractual obligations is disclosed to vendors via\nsecured channels and with reasonable access controls considering the\ntype and volume of personal data being disclosed; and\n\n(b)\n\nNotify the Commission within 14 days of the completion of the reviews above,\n\nwith an outline of their scope.\n\nAgape\n(c)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nEnsure that the scope of its periodic security reviews and any security\naudits include the protection of personal data handled in all of Agape’s\nsystems and processes;\n\nii.\n\nResolve and record in writing with FHG the data protection requirements\nand job specifications for the processing of personal data on behalf of\nFHG, including arrangements for the exercise of regular oversight by\nFHG to verify that the requirements and specifications are being met;\nand\n18\n\n\f(d)\n\nNotify the Commission within 14 days of the completion of the reviews above,\n\nwith an outline of their scope.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n19\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Kingsforce Management Services to ensure the implementation of regular patching, updates and upgrades for all software and firmware supporting its website(s) and application through which personal data in its possession may be accessed.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Employment","Protection","Patching"],"date":"11 May 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_kingsforcemanagementservicespteltd_100323.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Kingsforce Management Services","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-kingsforce-management-services","timestamp":"2023-05-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2023] SGPDPCS1\n\nCase No. DP-2202-B9480\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nKingsforce Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 31 January 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified by Kingsforce Management Services Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) of the sale on RaidForums, on or about 27 December 2021, of\ndata from its jobseeker database (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The affected database held approximately 54,900 jobseeker datasets, comprising\nname, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, job qualifications,\nlast and expected salary, highest qualification and other data related to job\nsearches.\n\n3. External cyber security investigators identified outdated website coding\ntechnology, with critical vulnerabilities, as the cause of the Incident.\n\n\f4. The Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for handling under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. The Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision, and to\nbreach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“the PDPA”).\n\n5. The Organisation admitted work had not been completed on the website at launch\nowing to contractual disputes with the developer. The Organisation subsequently\nengaged IT maintenance vendors in an effort to ensure the security of the website.\nHowever, maintenance had been ad-hoc and limited to troubleshooting\nfunctionality issues from bugs, glitches and/or when a page failed to load.\n\n6. In breach of the Protection Obligation, the Organisation failed to provide sufficient\nclarity and specifications to its vendors on how to protect its database and personal\ndata. In Re Civil Service Club, the Commission had pointed out that organisations\nthat engage IT vendors can provide clarity and emphasize the need for personal\ndata protection to their IT vendors by a) making it part of their contractual terms,\nand b) reviewing the requirements specifications to ensure that personal data\nprotection is reflected in the design of the end-product.1 Further, post-execution of\nthe contract, an organization is also expected to exercise reasonable oversight\nover its vendor during the course of the engagement to ensure that the vendor is\nprotecting the personal data by adhering to the stipulated requirements.2\n\n1 Re Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15.\n2 Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 317 at [16] and [17].\n\n\f7. Another breach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation was failure to\nconduct reasonable periodic security reviews, including vulnerability scans, since\nthe launch of its website. The requirement for and scope of reasonable periodic\nsecurity reviews had long been established in the published decisions of the\nCommission.3 The PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems\nalso emphasized the need to periodically conduct web application vulnerability\nscanning and assessments, post deployment, as a basic practice to ensure\ncompliance with the Protection Obligation under the PDPA.4\n\n8. The Organisation is therefore found to have breached the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n9. In deciding the enforcement action in this case, the Commission considered the\nOrganisation’s efforts towards website security, cooperation throughout the\ninvestigation, voluntary admission of breach of the Protection Obligation and the\nprompt remediation taken. The last included immediate suspension of its website,\nand the engagement of a new developer to develop a new and enhance web\napplication. The Commission also notes that the affected personal data was no\nlonger or accessible following the shutdown of RaidForums. In the circumstances,\nthe Commission directs the Organisation to do the following:\n\na. To submit to the Commission, within twenty-one (21) days from the date of\nissue of this Direction, a plan to ensure regular patching, updates and upgrades\n\n3 See, eg, Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 317; Re Bud Cosmetics Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] PDP Digest 351; and Re Watami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 221.\n4 Pages 21 and 22 of the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems.\n\n\ffor all software and firmware supporting its website(s) and applications through\nwhich personal data in its possession may be accessed.\n\nb.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 24 December 2021, Fortytwo Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”), an online\n\nfurniture\n\nstore,\n\nnotified\n\nthe\n\nPersonal\n\nData\n\nProtection\n\nCommission\n\n(the\n\n“Commission”) of malicious code injections on its website which led to the capturing\nof the email address and password of 6,241 individuals when they logged in to its\nwebsite (the “Incident”). The name, credit card number, expiry date and CVV/CVN\nnumber of another 98 individuals’ were also affected.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This means that the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision;\nand admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n(the “PDPA”).\n\n1\n\n\f3.\n\nAn issue that arose in this case is whether fictitious names or pseudonymous\n\npersonal particulars form part of the personal data under the possession or control of\nthe Organisation. The importance of this lies in how it may potentially reduce the size\nof the dataset that was at risk. In their addendum to the Written Statement, the\nOrganisation stated that it does not verify the names provided by the users, and\nsuggested that the impact of the Incident might be more limited as some of the users’\nnames may be incomplete, fictitious or pseudonymous.\n\n4.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” to be data, whether true or\n\nnot (emphasis added), about an individual who can be identified from that data; or\nfrom that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\naccess. The PDPA caters for the situation where not every record of personal data\nthat is under the possession or control of an Organisation is verified. It takes a practical\napproach, as the accuracy of personal data records will change with the passage of\ntime (e.g. information becomes outdated) or individuals may intentionally provide\ninaccurate information (e.g. users hiding their age or using fictitious residential\naddresses to bypass restriction of services by age or geolocation). What matters is\nthat the Organisation, having collected the information, takes steps to comply with their\nobligations under the PDPA, such as to protect them and to ensure that they are used\nin accordance with the purpose of their collection.\n\n5.\n\nThe situation is different when the organisation, as a data security or data\n\nmanagement measure, applies pseudonymisation or anonymisation techniques on\npersonal data that is in their possession or under their control. In such circumstances,\nif the risk of reidentification is adequately addressed and managed, the resulting\ndataset may be treated as anonymised. The key difference is the intention of the\n2\n\n\forganisation and its ability to direct and control the data processing activities required\nto achieve the resultant anonymised dataset.1\n\n6.\n\nIn this case, the Organisation was collecting data from its customers. Their\n\ncustomer database contained names, email addresses and additional details such as\ntheir shipping address, billing address, and date of birth. It also contained credit card\ndetails of 98 customers. Even if some customers had provided incomplete, fictitious or\npseudonymous personal particulars or payment details, the Organisation had\ncollected personal data. For the purpose of this investigations, it matters not that some\nof these customers may have provided inaccurate information. The Organisation’s\nobligations under the PDPA applies to the entire customer database.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the Incident occurred because the threat actor\n\nhad successfully exploited vulnerabilities present in the Magento open-source version\n1.9.x.x which the Organisation had employed for its online store. These vulnerabilities\nwere present because the Organisation failed to apply four Magento security patches\nreleased on 28 Nov 2017, 25 June 2019, 8 October 2019 and 28 April 2020 by Adobe.\n\n8.\n\nCompounding the above, support for Magento version 1 had ended on 30 June\n\n2020. The Organisation admitted that it should have upgraded to Magento opensource version 2.0 after Adobe ended the support for Magento 1 on 30 June 2020.\nThe Organisation had planned to upgrade to Magento version 2 in early 2020, but its\nplans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having said that, Adobe had\nannounced in November 2015 that it will end support for Magento 1.x in 36 months,\n\n1 See Personal Data Protection Commission, Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act\n\nfor Selected Topics, at paras 3.5, 3.8 and 3.13.\n3\n\n\fi.e. by November 2018. In September 2018, Adobe then announced that it would\nextend the support to 30 June 2020. Given the ample notice given by Adobe to the\nOrganisation of the need to upgrade the version of Magento Open Source which it was\nusing in order to continue receiving support and security patches from Adobe, it is\ndifficult to look past the Organisation’s prolonged failure to do the needful and perform\nthe necessary upgrades.\n\n9.\n\nThe Commission had consistently advised organisations on the importance of\n\napplying software patches. In our Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems,\nthe Commission had highlighted that organisations should perform system patching\npromptly to fix security vulnerabilities. If software patches are not updated as\nrecommended by the software provider, they may not contain the latest cybersecurity\nupdates and may compromise the organisation’s defence against cyber-attacks.\n\n10.\n\nWe note that the Organisation had considered and evaluated the four patches\n\nbut decided to hold back on installing them. However, these four patches were\nreleased by Adobe to address several high severity risk issues and critical bugs,\nincluding the injection of malicious codes. The Organisation’s failure to patch had\nincreased the risks of a malicious code injection capable of capturing users’ personal\ndata.\n\n11.\n\nIn light of the above, the Organisation is found to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation under section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\f12.\n\nThe Commission notes that after the Incident, the Organisation took prompt\n\nremedial actions, including notifying affected individuals and various technical\nmeasures to improve its security. The Organisation is also taking steps to upgrade to\nMagento version 2.\n\n13.\n\nIn deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered\n\nthe Organisation’s cooperation throughout the investigation, the voluntary admission\nof breach of the Protection Obligation, and the prompt remedial actions taken.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the issuance of the Commission’s preliminary decision, the\n\nOrganisation represented that it was unfair to state that was a prolonged failure to\nperform the necessary upgrade. This is because there was a lead time of 6 months\nbefore the end of support when it made the decision to upgrade, before the COVID19 pandemic disrupted its plans. The Organisation’s representation is not accepted\nas, notwithstanding the disruptions caused by the pandemic, the Organisation had\nbeen given ample notice of the impending end of support but took no action to perform\nthe necessary upgrade from November 2015 to early 2020.\n\n15.\n\nHaving considered the circumstances set out above, the factors listed at section\n\n48J(6) of the PDPA and the representations made by the Organisation, the Deputy\nCommissioner for Personal Data Protection hereby finds the Organisation in breach\nand directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$8,000 within 30 days from\nthe notice accompanying date of this decision, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgement debts shall accrue and be\n\n5\n\n\fpayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty\nis paid in full.\n\n16.\n\nThe Organisation is also directed to:\na.\n\nComplete the upgrading of its website to a supported software version,\nincluding vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, within 6\nmonths of the direction.\n\nb.\n\nInform the Commission with 14 days of the completion of the above.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"}]
