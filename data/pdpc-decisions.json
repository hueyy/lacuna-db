On 11 December 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a complaint against Century Evergreen Private Limited\n(the “Organisation”) that images of identification documents (which includes the\nNational Registration Identity Card) submitted by jobseekers to the Organisation\nwere publicly accessible on the Organisation’s website (“Incident”). The\nOrganisation is a manpower contracting services company and required\njobseekers to submit their identification documents to verify the identity of and\nsuitability of the jobseeker in question.\n\n2. Following the complaint received, the Commission commenced investigations to\ndetermine the Organisation’s compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”). The Organisation requested that the investigation be handled\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fthe Organisation voluntarily provided and admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. The Organisation also admitted that it failed to implement reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and control,\nand was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n3. The Organisation admitted that the Insecure Direct Object References (“IDOR”)\nvulnerability on its website, which allowed the complainant to manipulate the URL\nhad existed from the time the website was launched on 9 November 2015. As a\nresult of this vulnerability, 96,889 images of identification documents belonging to\n23,940 individuals were downloaded from the Organisation’s website from 10 to 12\nDecember 2022.\n\n4. The Organisation admitted that it was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA as it\nfailed to include any security requirements to protect personal data in its contract\nwith the vendor who first developed and subsequently maintained the website. In\nthis regard, even though the Organisation had engaged an IT vendor from the time\nthe website was developed and launched, the Organisation remained solely\nresponsible for protecting the personal data in its possession and control at all\nmaterial times.\n\n5. What is expected from organisations who engage professional services to build\ntheir websites and other online portals is explained in the Commission’s Guide on\nBuilding Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) (the “Guide”). The Commission\nhad consistently advised organisations of the need to emphasise the protection of\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\fpersonal data to their IT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms.1 The\ncontract should clearly state the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the\nPDPA. In this regard, the Commission noted that there was a glaring omission of\nclauses to protect personal data in the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor.\n\n6. The Organisation also admitted that apart from conducting functionality testing\nwhen the website was first launched, the Organisation had no arrangements with\nits IT vendor to conduct any security tests prior to the launch of the website, or\nthereafter. The Organisation had also failed to impose any security requirements\non the IT vendor to protect personal data, via contract.\n\n7. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner found that the Organisation had\ncontravened section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n8. In deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered that\na financial penalty ought to be imposed as the personal data affected included not\njust the identification numbers, but the images of the identification documents.\nFurthermore, there was a long period of non-compliance. The vulnerability was not\naddressed since 2015.\n\n9. In deciding on the appropriate amount of financial penalty, the circumstances set\nout above and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were considered,\nspecifically the impact of the personal data breach on the individuals affected and\nthe nature of the Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA. In the\ncircumstances, this was not an insignificant breach given the number of individuals\n\n1\n\nSee Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1] and Re EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 38.\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\faffected (ie 23,940) and the nature of personal data exfiltrated: 96,889 images of\nidentification documents.\n10. The Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA was also not simply one of\nmere negligence but that of gross negligence. There was a long period of noncompliance on the facts of this case. As set out above, the Commission had issued\nthe Guide to assist SMEs, and consistently cautioned the need for organisations\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA even when they engage an IT vendor in our\nprevious decisions.2\n\n11. In deciding on the appropriate amount of the financial penalty, the following factors\nwere considered – the Organisation’s turnover and profitability, its cooperation\nthroughout the investigation, its voluntary admission of breach of the Protection\nObligation under the EDP, and the prompt remedial actions taken after the\nOrganisation became aware of the IDOR vulnerability. This included rectifying the\nIDOR vulnerability, making server configuration changes to improve security,\nimplementing vulnerability scans, migrating its backup server to an encrypted\nremote server, deploying additional security software and subscription to security\nservices, and securing a new contract with its vendor to manage the security of its\nwebsite. In addition to its prompt remedial actions, its poor performance in the most\nrecent financial year was also taken into consideration. Finally, the organisation\nhad admitted to its culpability at an early stage and elected to proceed under the\nEDP.\n\n2\n\nRe EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 38 and Re Vhive Pte Ltd (Case No. DP-2013-B8138).\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f12. For the reasons above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and directs the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of S$9,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date of\nthis decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgement debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount\nof such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on Autobahn Rent A Car for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1\n\nOn 21 October 2022, Autobahn Rent A Car Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal\ndata breach (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates a car-sharing service, Shariot, in Singapore. On 24\n\nSeptember 2022, the Organisation received customer feedback that a photograph on\nits mobile application had been replaced with a pornographic photograph. The\nOrganisation discovered that the pornographic photograph had been uploaded\nthrough an unrevoked administrator account belonging to an ex-employee, who had\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\fleft the Organisation in May 2022. The ex-employee received an email from an\nunknown sender on 10 September 2022 stating that his personal laptop had been\nhacked and demanding Bitcoins as ransom payment. The threat actor was able to log\ninto the Shariot’s mobile application administrator portal through the administrator\naccount belonging to the ex-employee, and used the export CSV function to download\na copy of the Shariot’s users personal data.\n\n3\n\nSubsequently, on 21 October 2022, a cybersecurity solutions provider alerted\n\nthe Organisation of a cybercrime forum post offering the sale of a Shariot database\ncontaining personal data. The Commission commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by the Organisation.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision.\nIt admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s internal investigations discovered that compromise of the\n\ndormant administrator account credentials enabled the unauthorised access to Shariot\nbackend admin web portal, leading to the exfiltration of 53,000 personal data sets of\nShariot users. The personal data that were affected in the Incident included names,\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\femail addresses, mobile phone numbers, NRIC numbers and general location data\n(e.g. Bishan, Toa Payoh or Orchard).\n\n6\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n(a)\n\nImmediately conducted an internal audit of its administrator accounts to\n\nensure that any employee access that was not required was revoked;\n(b)\n\nEnhanced its software code and admin panel user interface to mask\n\ndisplayed or exported NRIC numbers to show only the last 4 characters; and\n(c)\n\nConducted cyber hygiene and awareness training for all staff handling\n\npersonal data.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had failed to ensure it had reasonable security\n\narrangements in place to prevent the unauthorized access or disclosure of the\npersonal data in its possession or control, as it failed to implement and ensure\nreasonable access control to its backend admin web portal. First, the Organisation\nfailed to revoke the login credentials of an administrator account belonging to an exemployee once the employment relationship came to an end in May 2022. As a result,\nthe ex-employee’s administrator login credentials remained active, which – when\ncompromised – enabled the malicious actor access into its network.\n\n8\n\nSecond, the Organisation also admitted that the Incident would not have\n\nhappened if it had implemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) as an additional\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\faccess control for its administrator accounts that had access to its sizeable user\ndatabase. In Re Lovebonito [2022] SGPDPC 3, the Commission had highlighted the\nneed for organisations to strengthen access control, through the use of a one-time\npassword (“OTP”) or 2FA/MFA, to such accounts. Indeed, regardless of whether an\naccount is an administrative account, once an account is granted access rights to a\ndatabase containing sensitive personal data records or a significant volume of\npersonal data that would adversely impact the affected individuals in the event of a\npersonal data breach, we would encourage organisations to consider implementing\nenhanced access controls to the account such as through the use of a OTP or\n2FA/MFA to better safeguard the personal data.\n\n9\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n10\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate as the personal data breach was not insignificant.\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA. In this regard, while the NRIC numbers and general\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\flocation data was affected, this is less serious than if the NRIC images and specific\nGPS location had been disclosed.\n\n11\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter non-compliance\nwith the PDPA. On the facts of this particular case, the organisation’s turnover has\nbeen taken into consideration to arrive at a proportionate and effective financial\npenalty. I also considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $3,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\f13\n\nIn addition to the financial penalty imposed, the Organisation is also directed to\n\ndo the following:\n(a)\n\nImplement processes for systems and applications revocation within a\n\nreasonable window of cessation of need for access by an employee;\n(b)\n\nStrengthen access controls measures to administrator accounts with\n\naccess to databases holding personal data;\n(c)\n\nConduct reasonable security review of technical and administrative\n\narrangements for the protection of personal data in possession or under control\nof the Organisation within 60 days of the date of this Direction;\n(d)\n\nRectify any security gaps identified in the security review directed above;\n\nand\n(e)\n\nInform the Commission within 1 week of the completion on the steps\n\ndirected above.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal or similar risks\nand;\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was administered to a registered salesperson of an estate agency for failing to (i) obtain clear and unambiguous consent; or (ii) check the Do Not Call Register before sending specified messages to individuals registered on the Do Not Call Register.","tags":["Do Not Call Provision(s)","Warning","Real Estate"],"date":"2023-08-16","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_Leon-Wee_11072023-(004).pdf","nature":"Do Not Call Provision&#40;s&#41;","title":"Breach of Duty to Check the Do Not Call Register by a Registered Salesperson","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/08/breach-of-duty-to-check-the-do-not-call-register-by-a-registered-salesperson","timestamp":"2023-08-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 8\n\nCase No. ENF-DNC-221129-0007 & Others\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nWee Jing Kai Leon\n\n… Person\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fWee Jing Kai Leon\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. ENF-DNC-221129-0007 &\nOthers\n\n11 July 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nThe Do Not Call Registry (“DNC Registry”) is a national database kept and\n\nmaintained by the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\npursuant to section 39 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Persons\nmay register their Singapore telephone numbers with the DNC Registry so as to not\nreceive unsolicited telemarketing calls and messages. The DNC Registry comprises\nof 3 separate registers (i) the No Text Message Register, (ii) the No Voice Call\nRegister, and (iii) the No Fax Message Register.\n\n2\n\nBetween November 2022 and March 2023, the Commission received ten (10)\n\ncomplaints that one Wee Jing Kai Leon (“Individual”) had sent unsolicited\ntelemarketing messages to telephone numbers registered on the No Text Message\nRegister of the DNC Registry (the “Complaints”).\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether there had\n\nbeen any breaches of the “Do Not Call” provisions in Part 9 and 9A of the PDPA (“DNC\nProvisions”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n4\n\nThe Individual is a real estate salesperson registered with Propnex Realty Pte\n\nLtd since 2006. Over the years, the Individual collated a list of 2,918 Singapore\ntelephone numbers (the “Marketing List”).\n\n5\n\nOf the 2,918 telephone numbers in the Marketing List, 1,224 were registered\n\nwith the No Text Message Register of the DNC Registry on or around 31 March 2023.\n\n6\n\nThe Individual did not send any marketing messages to the telephone numbers\n\non his Marketing List before November 2022 and only admitted to sending a short\nmessaging service message each month from November 2022 to March 2023 (the\n“SMS Messages”) to the telephone numbers on the Marketing List to offer, advertise\nand/or promote his services as a real estate salesperson. According to the Individual,\nby November 2022, the challenging business environment had made it more difficult\nfor him to get leads. He therefore opted to rely on the numbers in the Marketing List to\nprospect for leads.\n\n7\n\nGiven that the Marketing List included 1,224 telephone numbers registered on\n\nthe DNC Registry, the Individual had sent approximately 6,120 SMS Messages to\n\n3\n\n\ftelephone numbers registered on the DNC Registry from November 2022 to March\n2023.\n\n8\n\nThe SMS Messages bore the sender ID “Propnex LW”, which is registered\n\nunder the SMS Sender ID Regime (“SSIR”)1 by DGK Global Pte Ltd (“DGK Global”),\na company owned by the Individual. During investigations, the Individual clarified that\nDGK Global was not involved in his real estate business, and that he used DGK Global\nto register the sender ID under SSIR because he needed a UEN number to do so.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Duty to check DNC Registry under section 43(1) of the PDPA\n9\n\nThe Commission’s investigation focused on whether the Individual had\n\nintentionally or negligently breached section 43(1) of the PDPA by:\n(a)\n\nsending “specified messages” addressed to Singapore telephone\nnumbers,\n\n(b)\n\nwithout having valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone numbers\nwere not listed in the DNC Registry at the time the specified messages\nwere sent.\n\n1\n\nThe SSIR was set up in March 2022 to enable organisations to protect their customers from receiving fraudulent\nSMS messages that spoofed the organisations’ SMS Sender IDs. Organisations intending to send SMS messages\nto Singapore mobile numbers can register any alphanumeric Sender IDs under the SSIR. The Full SSIR Regime\ncame into effect from 31 January 2023, upon which all non-registered Sender IDs will be marked as “LikelySCAM” for a transition period of 6 months. Thereafter, messages with non-registered Sender IDs will be blocked\nand not delivered to end-users.\n\n4\n\n\f“Specified message”\n10\n\nA message is a “specified message” if one of its purposes is for: 2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nAdvertising, promoting, or offering to supply or provide:\n(i)\n\ngoods or services;\n\n(ii)\n\nland or an interest in land;\n\n(iii)\n\nbusiness opportunity or an investment opportunity;\n\nAdvertising or promoting a supplier or provider (or a prospective supplier\nor provider) of the items listed in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) above.\n\n11\n\nWhether a “specified message” has one of the above purposes is determined\n\nwith regard to the following:3\n(a)\n\nthe content of the message;\n\n(b)\n\nthe presentational aspects of the message;\n\n(c)\n\nthe content that can be obtained using the numbers, URLs or contact\ninformation (if any) mentioned in the message; and\n\n(d)\n\nif the telephone number from which the message is made is disclosed to\nthe recipient (whether by calling line identity or otherwise), the content\n(if any) that can be obtained by calling that number.\n\n12\n\nThe SMS Messages were “specified messages” within the meaning of the DNC\n\nProvisions, as they were sent for the purpose of advertising and/or promoting the\nIndividual’s real estate services. The SMS Messages contained statements such as,\n2\n3\n\nTenth Schedule to the PDPA.\nSection 37(1) of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\n\f“Engage Professional & Committed Agent to Sell/Rent your Home.”, and “Whatsapp\nLeon Wee directly at https://chatwith.io/s/enquire to rent/sell your property”. They also\nincluded links to the Individual’s website and social media profiles.\n\n13\n\nThe Individual admitted that the SMS Messages were addressed to Singapore\n\ntelephone numbers, as also evidenced by the complaints received by the Commission.\n\nValid confirmation\n14\n\nA person can obtain valid confirmation that a Singapore telephone number is\n\nnot listed in the DNC Registry by doing the following:4\n(a)\n\nWithin 21 days before sending the specified message,5 the person can\napply for and receive confirmation from the Commission that the\nSingapore telephone number is not listed in the relevant register of the\nDNC Registry;6 or\n\n(b)\n\nThe person can obtain confirmation that the Singapore telephone\nnumber is not listed in the relevant register of the DNC Registry from a\n“checker”,7 but must not have reason to believe that, or be reckless as\nto whether the checker’s information was obtained more than 21 days\nago, or is false or inaccurate.\n\n4\n\nSection 43(2) of the PDPA.\nSection 15 of the Personal Data Protection (Do Not Call Registry) Regulations 2013 (the “DNC\nRegulations”).\n6\nUnder section 40(2) of the PDPA\n7\nA “checker” refers to a person that, for a reward, provides to another person (P) information on whether a\nSingapore telephone number is listed in the relevant register for the purpose of P’s compliance with Section 43(1)\nof the PDPA. A “checker” is a person other than the Commission, an employee of P, and an employee or agent\nof a checker.\n5\n\n6\n\n\f15\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Individual did not obtain valid confirmation that\n\nthe telephone numbers on his Marketing List were not listed in the DNC Registry.\n\nWhether the Individual received clear and unambiguous consent\n16\n\nEven if a specified message is sent to a Singapore telephone number without\n\nvalid confirmation that the number is not listed in the DNC Registry, a person does not\ncontravene section 43(1) of the PDPA if:\n(a)\n\nthe subscriber or user of the Singapore telephone number gave clear\nand unambiguous consent to the sending of the specified message; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe consent is evidenced in writing or other form so as to be accessible\nfor subsequent reference8. This means that the consent must be\ncaptured in a manner or form which can be retrieved and reproduced at\na later time in order to confirm that such consent was obtained. Possible\nforms include an audio or video recording of the consent given9.\n\n17\n\nIn the course of investigations, the Individual represented to the Commission\n\nthat he was under the impression that since he had obtained the telephone numbers\nprior to the enactment of the PDPA, he could use them for marketing purposes.\n\n18\n\nThe Commission recognises that a subscriber of a Singapore telephone\n\nnumber is deemed to have given his consent to a person to send a specified message\nto that Singapore telephone number if the subscriber consents to the sending of the\n8\n9\n\nSection 43(4) of the PDPA.\n[8.3] of the Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions (revised 1 February 2021)\n\n7\n\n\fspecified message before 2 January 2014 (i.e. before the DNC Provisions came into\neffect), and that consent has not been withdrawn.10 Even if the subscriber\nsubsequently adds his telephone number to the DNC Registry, this would not amount\nto withdrawal of consent.11\n\n19\n\nHowever, this does not relieve the Individual of his obligations under section\n\n43(4) to obtain the consent of the subscribers or users of the Singapore telephone\nnumber to which a specified message is sent to him. In other words, if the Individual\nintended to rely on section 43(4) of the PDPA, he should have obtained clear and\nunambiguous consent to the sending of the SMS Messages to the telephone numbers\nin his Marketing List from the subscribers of the Singapore telephone numbers\ncontained therein evidenced in written or other forms. The Commission sets out, at\n[8.5] of the Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions (revised 1 February 2021),\nvarious methods through which such consent can be obtained from the subscribers or\nusers:\n“For example, persons may seek to obtain consent by asking individuals to:\na) respond to a pop-up on a webpage;\nb) respond to pop-ups or other form of notifications within mobile applications;\nc) fill out and submit a web form;\nd) fill out and submit a physical form;\ne) indicate their choice by signing or ticking against a check box printed on a\nletter or service agreement; or\n10\n11\n\nSection 47(4) of the PDPA.\nSection 47(5) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\ff) call or send an SMS to the person.”\n\n20\n\nThe Commission found no evidence of the Individual obtaining such clear and\n\nunambiguous consent from any of the subscribers of the Singapore telephone\nnumbers on the Marketing List, in written or other forms before or after 2 January 2014.\n\n21\n\nAccordingly, the Individual failed to obtain valid confirmation that the telephone\n\nnumbers in the Marketing List are not listed in the DNC Registry before sending the\nSMS Messages, and has negligently contravened section 43(1) of the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Individual is an employee acting in the course of employment\n22\n\nFor completeness, the Commission assessed whether the defence under\n\nsection 48 of the PDPA was available to the Individual, and concluded that it was not.\nSection 48(2) provides that section 43(1) does not apply to an employee who sends a\nspecified message to a Singapore telephone number if he can prove that he did so in\ngood faith in the course of his employment or in accordance with instructions given to\nhim by or on behalf of his employer in the course of his employment. The Commission\nconsidered the following:\n(a)\n\nIn accordance with industry practices, real estate salespersons such as\nthe Individual are not in an “employer-employee relationship” with their\nagencies.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Individual confirmed that he is not an employee of Propnex Realty\nPte Ltd (“Propnex”) despite being registered with them. He does not\n\n9\n\n\freceive salary from Propnex, nor does Propnex provide the Individual\nwith medical benefits, CPF contributions, or annual leave benefits. The\nIndividual is self-employed and does not report to Propnex on the\nconduct of his business.\n(c)\n\nThe contents of the SMS Messages related to the services of the\nIndividual specifically, and not Propnex.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n23\n\nIn determining whether any financial penalties or directions should be imposed\n\non the Individual, the Commission took the following into consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Individual was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Individual had otherwise made efforts to ensure his compliance with\nother DNC Provisions, in particular the requirement under section 44 of\nthe PDPA to include clear and accurate information identifying the\nsender of the SMS Messages and how he can be readily contacted. He\nhad also provided recipients the option to unsubscribe from the SMS\nMessages, and would remove a recipient’s telephone number from the\nMarketing List if so requested; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Individual’s efforts to register the sender ID “Propnex LW” showed\na willingness to comply with regulatory regimes, in particular the SSIR.\n\n24\n\nHaving considered all the factors listed above, the Individual is hereby\n\nadministered a warning in respect of his breach of section 43(1) of the PDPA.

Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2009-B7056\n16 May 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 25 September 2020, E-Commerce Enablers Pte. Ltd. (“Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) and its customers of an\nincident involving unauthorised access to its customer data servers (the “Incident”).\nPDPC subsequently received 2 complaints from the Organisation’s customers in\nrelation to the Incident. On 12 November 2020, the Organisation's customer database\nwas offered for sale on an online forum indicating that personal data was exfiltrated\nduring the Incident.\n\n2\n\nPDPC commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s compliance\n\nwith the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the Incident.\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation runs an online platform offering cashback for purchases\n\nmade through affiliated merchant programs. The platform also provides coupons,\nvoucher codes, and comparison features with discounts for users.\n\n4\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation hosted its customer database on\n\nvirtual servers in an Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud environment (“Customer\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fStorage Servers”). The Organisation employed a 12-man Site Reliability Engineering\n(“SRE”) team whose responsibilities included maintaining the Organisation’s\ninfrastructure, providing, and managing the Organisation’s cloud environment on\nAWS, and ensuring security of the AWS keys. The SRE team made use of an AWS\naccess key with full administrative privileges (the “AWS Key”) for the purposes of its\nwork, including infrastructure deployment. Only SRE team members had access to,\nand were authorised to use, the AWS Key. On 4 June 2019, the AWS Key was\ninadvertently committed to software code in a private repository in GitHub, by a senior\nmember of the SRE team. This was discovered by another SRE team member on 6\nJune 2019, and the AWS Key was removed from GitHub on the same day. However,\nit remained viewable in GitHub’s ‘commit history’, which records all changes and\nprevious versions of code uploaded on GitHub.\n\n5\n\nOn 21 June 2019, the AWS Key was to be deleted and replaced by a new key\n\nas part of an out-of-cycle key rotation. The member of the SRE team in charge of the\nkey rotation informed the SRE team (via email) that he had created a new key to\nreplace the AWS Key, and that he would be deleting the AWS Key. However, after\ncreating the replacement key, he failed to fully disable and remove the AWS Key.\n\n6\n\nAs a result, the AWS Key continued to be usable to access the Organisation’s\n\nAWS environment (and consequently the Customer Storage Servers) until shortly after\nthe time of the Incident, about 15 months later.\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fThe Incident\n7\n\nOn 9 September 2020, a malicious threat actor accessed the Organisation’s\n\nAWS environment utilizing the AWS Key. The AWS Key was likely found by the threat\nactor in the commit history of the GitHub private repository.\n\n8\n\nHaving gained privileged access to the AWS environment, the threat actor (i)\n\nconducted reconnaissance to identify the Organisation’s data repositories, (ii) modified\nsecurity settings including to allow remote internet access to the Organisation’s\ndatabase instances (i.e. its virtual servers hosting data), and (iii) generated a fresh\ndatabase instance to stage its data exfiltration.\n\n9\n\nThe threat actor then proceeded to exfiltrate data from the Customer Storage\n\nServers. The data items, and the corresponding number of individuals affected, are\nset out below:\n\nTypes of personal data\nEmail Address\n\nNumber of affected users\n1,457,637\n\nName\n\n840,210\n\nMobile number\n\n447,076\n\nAddress\n\n138,327\n\nGender\n\n23,278\n\nNRIC numbers\n\n9,961\n\nDate of birth\n\n202,634\n\nBank Account number\n\n299,381\n\nPartial credit card information, including:\n\n378,531\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f(i) partial credit card number (first 6 digits\nand last 4 digits)\n(ii) issuing bank\n(iii) country\n(iv) expiry month and year\n(v) Visa or Mastercard\n\n10\n\nOn 17 September 2020, the Organisation discovered during a routine security\n\nreview that there had been unauthorised access to its AWS environment. Further\ninvestigations revealed that there had been unauthorised third-party access to the\nOrganisation’s AWS environment.\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation subsequently engaged a private forensic expert, (“PFE”) to\n\ninvestigate further. The PFE confirmed that the unauthorised access had been carried\nout using the AWS Key. The Organisation conjectured that it was likely that the threat\nactor had obtained the AWS Key from GitHub’s commit history, where the AWS Key\nwas still visible despite the removal of the wrongly committed code from the private\nrepository in GitHub.\n\nRemedial actions\n12\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following remedial\n\nmeasures:\nImmediate remedial steps to contain the Incident\n(a)\n\nPerformed a full deletion of the AWS Key and rotated the other AWS keys;\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nReversed all changes made by the threat actor and triggered a forced\nlogout and password reset of all customers’ accounts;\n\nTo prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n(c)\n\nIncreased monitoring of logs to ensure heightened detection of any\nunauthorised access;\n\n(d)\n\nSeparated development and production accounts, resulting in a smaller\nsubset of engineers having access to the production environment;\n\n(e)\n\nSecured access to systems and data with several measures, including VPN\nand IP address whitelisting and database encryption; and\n\n(f)\n\nCreated a platform for employee security suggestions / breach reporting.\n\nSubsequent sale of personal data on Raidforums\n13\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Organisation’s database was offered for sale on\n\nRaidforums, an online cybersecurity forum commonly used for trading and selling of\nstolen databases. Raidforums’ domain name and content was independently seized\nby authorities from the United States in April 2022.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n14\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control, by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fdisclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). The Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\nObligation in two respects.\n\nLack of sufficiently robust processes for AWS key management\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to ensure that processes to manage the AWS keys\n\nthat granted access to the Customer Storage Servers were sufficiently robust.\n\n16\n\nWhile the Organisation admitted that it could have done more to ensure that its\n\nemployees were performing their AWS key rotation duties properly, the Organisation\nclaimed that the compromise of the AWS Key arose from human error, and not\nbecause of any systemic issue with the Organisation’s security practices. According\nto the Organisation, there was no reason to doubt the capabilities of the SRE team\nmember in question, because (i) he was a senior member of the SRE team, (ii) his\nresponsibilities included key security and rotation, and (iii) he had dutifully rotated /\ndeleted all other keys assigned to him in the out-of-cycle key rotation. The SRE team\nmember’s inadvertent commit, and an incomplete rotation/deletion were in direct\ncontravention of the Organisation’s security practices. The Organisation accordingly\nsought to frame the Incident as a one-off case of human error.\n\n17\n\nThis position is not accepted. As explained in Re DataPost Pte Ltd,\n\nOrganisations cannot place sole reliance on their employees to perform their duties\nproperly as a security arrangement to protect personal data. There must be some\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\fprocesses to ensure that the step required from the employee is taken, such as\nindependent verification by another checker1.\n\n18\n\nFor example, a precaution the Organisation could have taken to ensure that the\n\nout-of-cycle key rotation was complete would have been to have a supervisor or\nanother SRE team member test either all or a reasonable sample of the old keys\n(depending on the number of keys being rotated) to verify that they had been disabled.\nThere was no such verification or testing practice put in place by the Organisation; the\nOrganisation relied wholly on the SRE team member’s seniority and experience.\n\n19\n\nWhen a high-risk task (e.g. rotation of an AWS key that gives access to the\n\nwhole of the AWS environment) is concerned, it is all the more important that there\nmust be additional verifications and checks.\n\nFailure to conduct periodic security review\n20\n\nSecond, specific security review by the Organisation on AWS keys could have\n\ncovered and detected whether the AWS Key remained active or had been used after\nthe out-of-cycle key rotation, and during the 15 months preceding the Incident. The\nOrganisation failed to conduct regular security review on whether the AWS keys had\nbeen properly rotated/deleted. In the course of investigations, the Organisation\nacknowledged that it could have done more to ensure that the SRE team was\nperforming their AWS key rotation duties properly. Following the Incident, the\n1 Re DataPost Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 10, at [13] – [16]\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\fOrganisation implemented a more secure process for temporary, time-limited keys to\nbe issued to SRE team members whenever access to the AWS environment was\nrequired. The Organisation also developed a specific IT security policy concerning the\nsecure sharing of keys internally.\n\nObservation on the incident management processes\n21\n\nFollowing discovery of the inadvertent committal of the AWS Key to GitHub, the\n\nOrganisation took 15 days to conduct a key rotation. Regardless of whether this had\nbeen an out-of-cycle rotation, the Organisation should review its incident management\nprocesses to determine whether it was reasonable to have taken 15 days to remediate\ncompromise of a full administrative privilege AWS access key.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n22\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, including the following aggravating and mitigating\nfactors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation lacked sufficiently robust processes to monitor its incident\nmanagement response to ensure reasonable remediation speed, which led\nto 15 days passing before the Organisation responded to the exposure of\nthe AWS Key;\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe AWS Key was exposed for a long period of 15 months;\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the\naffected individuals;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily acknowledged that its failure to ensure proper\nrotation and deletion of the AWS Key constituted a breach of the Protection\nObligation.\n\n23\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 15 February 2023 and was invited to make representations\non the same. The Organisation made representations on 22 March 2023, albeit not on\nits liability for breaches of the Protection Obligation or on the proposed financial\npenalty. Where accepted by the Commission, these representations have been\nincorporated into this decision.\n\n24\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $74,400\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f25\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 and $10,000 was imposed on Fullerton Healthcare and Agape CP Holdings respectively for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data belonging to Fullerton Healthcare’s corporate clients and direct patients.

DP-2110-B9054 / DP-2110-B9060\n23 March 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 19 October 2021 and 21 October 2021, Fullerton Healthcare Group Pte\n\nLimited (“FHG”) and Agape CP Holdings Pte. Ltd. (“Agape”) respectively notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that the personal data of\nFHG’s customers had been accessed, exfiltrated, and offered for sale on the dark web\n(the “Incident”). The Commission commenced investigations to determine whether\nthe Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by FHG and Agape.\n\n2\n\nOn 11 January 2022 and 12 January 2022 respectively, FHG and Agape\n\nrequested for the investigations to be handled under the Commission’s Expedited\nDecision Procedure. In this regard, FHG and Agape voluntarily provided and admitted\nto the facts set out below and admitted that they had failed to implement reasonable\n\n2\n\n\fsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data accessed and exfiltrated in the\nIncident in breach of section 24 of the PDPA (the “Protection Obligation”).\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nFHG is an enterprise healthcare service provider which provides healthcare\n\nservices to individuals and employees of its corporate clients. In 2018, FHG engaged\nAgape, a business process outsourcing provider and social enterprise, to provide call\ncentre and appointment booking services for its customers (the “Services”). As part\nof its social enterprise initiatives, Agape engaged inmates from Changi Women’s\nPrison (the “Agents”) to assist in provision of the Services for FHG’s customers.\n\n4\n\nIn order to carry out the Services, FHG provided Agape with access to the\n\npersonal data of its customers via Microsoft SharePoint, a cloud-based document\nmanagement system. A single Agape personal computer (the “Computer”) was\nauthorised to access FHG’s SharePoint platform via an FHG-assigned SharePoint\naccount.\n\n5\n\nIn order to facilitate Agents’ access to FHG’s customer data from within Changi\n\nWomen’s Prison, Agape downloaded FHG’s customer data onto the Computer, and\nre-uploaded the customer data onto an internet-facing file server (“the Online Drive”).\nThe Online Drive was then white-listed for access by the Agents from within Changi\nWomen’s Prison.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Incident\n6\n\nOn 15 October 2021, FHG became aware that its customer data was being\n\noffered for sale on a dark web forum. FHG engaged cybersecurity consultants to\ninvestigate. On 18 October 2021, FHG’s cybersecurity consultants made contact with\nthe purported seller who claimed that he had exfiltrated FHG’s customer data from\nAgape’s Online Drive. By 22 October 2021, the post on the dark web forum advertising\nthe sale had been removed.\n\n7\n\nFHG’s cybersecurity consultants confirmed that the Incident solely involved and\n\naffected Agape’s Online Drive. FHG’s own systems and servers were not affected in\nthe Incident.\n\n8\n\nThe personal data of 156,900 FHG customers (133,866 direct patients and\n\n23,034 employees of FHG’s corporate clients) was accessed without authorisation in\nthe Incident, although the exact volume of exfiltrated personal data was unknown. The\naffected personal data comprised the following datasets:\nDirect patients\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number / FIN;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(d)\n\nGender;\n\n(e)\n\nEmail address;\n4\n\n\f(f)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(g)\n\nFinancial information (Bank account numbers and bank codes);\n\n(h)\n\nHealth information (International Classification of Diseases codes that pertain\n\nto an individual’s diagnosis information, and codes for surgical procedures done in\nhospitals);\nEmployees of FHG’s corporate clients\n(i)\n\nName;\n\n(j)\n\nNRIC number / FIN / Passport number;\n\n(k)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(l)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(m)\n\nFinancial information; and\n\n(n)\n\nHealth, and other information (Information relating to the utilisation of health\n\nbenefits by individual members, which include details of clinic names and claim\namount\n(collectively, the “Customer Data”).\n\nRemedial actions\n9\n\nAs part of remedial measures following the Incident, FHG informed affected\n\nclients and individuals promptly via SMS, email, and an FAQ page on its website,\nadvising on appropriate steps which could be taken to guard against potential risks.\nFHG also engaged Credit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd to provide free credit monitoring\nservices to affected individuals for 6 months.\n\n5\n\n\f10\n\nAgape suspended use of the Online Drive with effect from 19 October 2021,\n\nand, with the assistance of a forensic team, conducted internal checks on the\nComputer and Online Drive for other indicators of compromise.\n\n11\n\nFHG in coordination with Agape also:\n\n(a)\n\nrestricted Agape’s access to its SharePoint to “view-only”;\n\n(b)\n\ndeleted SharePoint files and folders that Agape did not need as part of data\n\nminimisation efforts;\n(c)\n\nceased synchronisation of data between SharePoint and the Computer;\n\n(d)\n\nchanged all passwords for Agape’s access to FHG’s SharePoint; and\n\n(e)\n\ndeleted the Customer Data from the Online Drive upon completion of Agape’s\n\ninvestigations into the Incident.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether Agape had contravened the Protection Obligation\n12\n\nAs a data intermediary of FHG, Agape is subject to the Protection Obligation\n\npursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA. For the reasons set out below, Agape was\ndetermined to have breached the Protection Obligation in relation to the Customer\nData affected in the Incident.\n\n6\n\n\fFailure to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews\n13\n\nIn previous enforcement decisions, the Commission has emphasised the need\n\nfor organisations to conduct periodic security reviews of their IT systems. Such reviews\nenable organisations to detect vulnerabilities, assess security implications and risks,\nand ensure that reasonable security arrangements are implemented to eliminate or\nmitigate such risks. Periodic security reviews should be scoped based on the\norganisation’s assessment of its data protection needs, for example, taking into\naccount the type of personal data to be protected.1\n\n14\n\nIn Quoine Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 2 (“Quoine”), while the organisation had\n\nconducted periodic security reviews, these security reviews were improperly scoped\nand failed to include a particular account. The organisation explained that its current\nstaff were not aware of the reasons for the affected account’s set-up and security\narrangements, as the account had been created “at some time in the past (so legacy)”.\nThis explanation did not excuse the organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation.\nThe Commission found that it was incumbent on the organisation to have implemented\nthe necessary systems and processes to ensure that critical information about its\nsystems, including legacy systems, survived the turnover of its staff (Quoine at [23]).\n\n15\n\nSimilarly, while Agape had carried out periodic security reviews, these reviews\n\nfailed to cover the Internet-facing Online Drive. Agape admitted that this omission was\n\n1\n\nEverlast Projects Pte Ltd and others [2020] SGPDPC 20 (at [21]).\n\n7\n\n\fbecause the use of the Online Drive had been a legacy feature unique to Agape’s\nengagement by FHG, which was not implemented for any of Agape’s other clients. As\na result of this omission, Agape failed to review and assess the Online Drive’s security\nimplications and risks.\n\n16\n\nWhen the Online Drive was installed in December 2017, it was protected by a\n\npassword which met Agape’s password complexity policy (i.e. 8 to 10 characters with\na mix of upper and lower-case characters, numbers and symbols). However, at the\ntime of the Incident, the password for Agape’s Online Drive had been inadvertently\ndisabled for an estimated 20 months (since December 2019), the cause of which could\nnot be established. Agape admitted that this caused the Online Drive to become an\nopen directory listing on the Internet with no password protection, and highly\nvulnerable to unauthorised access, modification and similar risks over an excessive\nperiod of time.\n\n17\n\nIf Agape’s periodic reviews had been properly scoped to cover all of the IT\n\ncomponents under its Services rendered to FHG (including the Online Drive), this\nlapse could have been detected and rectified timeously.\n\nInadequate password policy and management\n18\n\nIn the course of investigations, Agape also admitted that prior to the password\n\nbeing disabled in December 2019, it had been shared by Agents to access the Online\n\n8\n\n\fDrive. In Terra Systems Pte. Ltd. [2021] SGPDPC 72, the Commission highlighted the\ndata protection risks associated with multiple users sharing a common password,\nincluding greater risks of unauthorised access by ex-staff and inadvertent disclosure\nto threat actors through social engineering, among others.\n\n19\n\nThe use of a common password among all Agents was exacerbated by the fact\n\nthat there was no expiry date set for the password. The failure to implement and\nenforce reasonable password management policies increased the vulnerability of the\nCustomer Data on the Online Drive to unauthorised access and other similar risks,\neven before the password had been disabled.\n\n20\n\nFor the above reasons, Agape was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation.\n\nWhether FHG had contravened Section 24 of the PDPA\nFailure to exercise reasonable oversight of vendor\n21\n\nUnder Section 4(3) of the PDPA, an organisation that engages a data\n\nintermediary to process personal data on its behalf, bears the same obligations under\nthe PDPA as if the personal data was processed by the organisation itself. This is so,\neven where the organisation engages the data intermediary to implement the\n\n2\n\nThis decision was subsequently subjected to reconsideration by the Commission. In Terra Systems\nPte Ltd [2022] SGPCPCR 1, the Commissioner affirmed the finding of the organisation’s breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA and the financial penalty imposed.\n\n9\n\n\fnecessary data protection measures in relation to the personal data (Social Metric Pte\nLtd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at [15]).\n\n22\n\nThe Commission has reiterated in past decisions, such as SCAL Academy Pte.\n\nLtd. [2020] SGPDPC 2, that the Protection Obligation requires organisations to\nexercise reasonable oversight of their vendors.\n\n23\n\nSpecifically in the context of an organisation’s relationship with its data\n\nintermediary, the organisation (i.e. the data controller) has a supervisory or general\nrole for the protection of the personal data, while the data intermediary has a more\ndirect and specific role in the protection of personal data arising from its direct\npossession or control over the personal data. This means that a data controller may\nbe found in breach of the Protection Obligation, even though its data intermediary may\nnot be found in breach, and vice versa (Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at\n[16]).\n\n24\n\nIn this case, FHG engaged Agape as its data intermediary to carry out the\n\nServices using the personal data provided by FHG. Under the Protection Obligation,\nFHG was required to exercise reasonable oversight of Agape’s data processing\nactivities.\n\n25\n\nIn SCAL Academy Pte. Ltd. [2020] SGPDPC 2 (at [8]), even though the\n\norganisation in question had instructed its vendor to prevent certain documents from\n10\n\n\fbeing ‘leaked’ online, it did not check what security arrangements the vendor had\nimplemented to ensure this. This hindered the organisation and vendor from being\nable to identify any data protection risks and agree on the measures to be implemented\nto protect against unauthorised disclosure of the personal data in the documents.\n\n26\n\nIn this case, due consideration is given to the fact that FHG had conducted a\n\nhigh-level IT due diligence review of Agape prior to its decision to onboard Agape as\na vendor, and that FHG’s written agreement with Agape required the latter to comply\nwith the PDPA including, among others, obligations to take all appropriate and\nreasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards, and security\narrangements. Nevertheless, FHG’s failed to exercise reasonable oversight through\nregular monitoring of Agape’s personal data handling processes throughout the\nengagement, including how Agape stored and granted Agents’ access to the\nCustomer Data.\n\n27\n\nIn this regard, there was a point of contention between the parties over whether\n\nFHG was aware of and permitted the uploading of the Customer Data from Agape’s\nComputer to the Internet-facing Online Drive.\n\n28\n\nAccording to FHG, its understanding with Agape was that the local copy of the\n\nCustomer Data on the Computer was only to be used for emergency or exceptional\nsituations such as when Agape was unable to connect to FHG’s SharePoint during\nany system downtime or disruptive event. No other copies of the Customer Data were\n11\n\n\fto be made by Agape, whether from the SharePoint or the local copy on the Computer.\nFHG stated that it did not provide Agape with permission to upload the Customer Data\nfrom Agape’s Computer to the Online Drive.\n\n29\n\nIn contrast, Agape asserted that FHG was aware that the Agents were inmates\n\noperating from inside Changi Women’s Prison, and that there were IT restrictions\npreventing them from accessing the Customer Data directly from FHG’s Sharepoint.\nAs such, Agape had downloaded and uploaded the Customer Data onto its Online\nDrive for the Agents to access and use. Agape asserted that FHG was aware of\nAgape’s process of sharing Customer Data with the Agents as FHG’s representatives\nhad been present during “dry runs”.\n\n30\n\nWhile there was insufficient contemporaneous evidence to support either\n\nparty’s version of events, the fact remains that FHG was aware that Agape was\nengaging inmates from inside Changi Women’s Prison to carry out the Services, and\nthe Commission’s findings regarding FHG’s breach of the Protection Obligation are\nnot dependent on whether FHG permitted Agape to upload the Customer Data to the\nOnline Drive or not.\n\n31\n\nGiven that FHG was aware that access to the Customer Data would have to be\n\ngranted to a third party that was offsite for the provision of the Services, FHG should\nhave made reasonable enquiries to ascertain how the Customer Data was to be stored\nand transmitted, and how access to the Customer Data would be controlled. Had FHG\n12\n\n\fmade these enquiries and discovered the true state of affairs, they would have no\ndoubt required Agape to implement stricter controls to regulate Agents’ access and\nuse of the Customer Data. By failing to make such enquiries, FHG failed to appreciate\nthe reality of how Agape was storing, transmitting, and retaining the Customer Data,\nand failed to exercise reasonable oversight over Agape’s data processing activities.\n\nUnnecessary disclosure of sensitive personal data\n32\n\nSeparately, FHG inadvertently disclosed personal data only intended for its\n\nemployees’ internal use, onto the SharePoint system shared with Agape. This included\nsensitive financial information such as bank account numbers and bank codes, and\nhealth information such as ICD codes and codes for surgical procedures done in\nhospitals. These datasets were not required by Agape for the performance of the\nServices, and this inadvertent disclosure ultimately led to a greater loss of personal\ndata during the Incident.\n\n33\n\nWhen an organisation discloses more personal data than is needed for its\n\npurposes, this creates unnecessary data security risks, particularly where such data\nis more sensitive in nature3.\n\n3\n\nHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 9 (at [19]-[20])\n\n13\n\n\f34\n\nIn the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems4 (at\n\npage 11), data minimisation has been encouraged as a good way for organisations to\nexamine what personal data is really needed. It should be a basic data protection\npractice for organisations to collect, use, or disclose only the least sensitive types of\npersonal data if different types of personal data can be used to achieve the same\npurpose.\n\n35\n\nFHG should have implemented robust measures to ensure that only personal\n\ndata necessary for performance of the Services was shared with Agape, and in\nparticular, that sensitive personal data was not inadvertently disclosed.\n\n36\n\nIn view of the above, FHG was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation in respect of the Customer Data.\n\nVoluntary measures implemented by FHG and Agape\n37\n\nFollowing the Incident, FHG and Agape have voluntarily taken or will be taking\n\nthe following steps to prevent a recurrence of the Incident or similar events:\n\nFHG\n(a)\n\nAgents will now access FHG’s customer data directly from FHG’s SharePoint\n\nvia individual user accounts with multi-factor authentication;\n\n4\n\nPublished on 14 September 2021.

As the data controller, FHG also bore the ultimate\nresponsibility to exercise due diligence and reasonable supervision over Agape. For\nthe purposes of assessing what amount of financial penalty would be proportionate\nand effective as a deterrent, it was also taken into consideration that FHG’s annual\nturnover based on its latest available audited accounts, was almost 50 times higher\nthan that of Agape’s.\n16\n\n\f40\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant circumstances, the Commissioner\n\nhereby requires that:\n(a)\n\nFHG pay a financial penalty of $58,000; and\n\n(b)\n\nAgape pay a financial penalty of S$10,000;\n\nwithin 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n41\n\nIn quantifying the financial penalties imposed, no weight was placed on Agape’s\n\nstatus as a social enterprise. The standard of security arrangements expected under\nthe Protection Obligation will depend on the volume and nature of personal data in the\norganisation’s possession or control, regardless of whether the organisation is a forprofit business, a charity, or a social enterprise5.\n\n42\n\nIn addition to the financial penalties imposed, FHG and Agape are also directed\n\nto do the following:\n\n5\n\nSee Singapore Red Cross Society [2020] SGPDPC 16 at [10]\n\n17\n\n\fFHG\n(a)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nReview processes and contractual obligations with Agape and existing\nvendors processing personal data on behalf of FHG, to ensure that such\nvendors have sufficiently robust data handling processes to protect\npersonal data in their possession and/or control;\n\nii.\n\nReview existing internal processes to ensure that only personal data\nnecessary for fulfilling contractual obligations is disclosed to vendors via\nsecured channels and with reasonable access controls considering the\ntype and volume of personal data being disclosed; and\n\n(b)\n\nNotify the Commission within 14 days of the completion of the reviews above,\n\nwith an outline of their scope.\n\nAgape\n(c)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nEnsure that the scope of its periodic security reviews and any security\naudits include the protection of personal data handled in all of Agape’s\nsystems and processes;\n\nii.\n\nResolve and record in writing with FHG the data protection requirements\nand job specifications for the processing of personal data on behalf of\nFHG, including arrangements for the exercise of regular oversight by\nFHG to verify that the requirements and specifications are being met;\nand\n18\n\n\f(d)\n\nNotify the Commission within 14 days of the completion of the reviews above,\n\nwith an outline of their scope.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n19\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Kingsforce Management Services to ensure the implementation of regular patching, updates and upgrades for all software and firmware supporting its website(s) and application through which personal data in its possession may be accessed.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Employment","Protection","Patching"],"date":"2023-05-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_KingsforceManagementServicesPteLtd_100323.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Kingsforce Management Services","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-kingsforce-management-services","timestamp":"2023-05-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2023] SGPDPCS1\n\nCase No. DP-2202-B9480\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nKingsforce Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 31 January 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified by Kingsforce Management Services Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) of the sale on RaidForums, on or about 27 December 2021, of\ndata from its jobseeker database (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The affected database held approximately 54,900 jobseeker datasets, comprising\nname, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, job qualifications,\nlast and expected salary, highest qualification and other data related to job\nsearches.\n\n3. External cyber security investigators identified outdated website coding\ntechnology, with critical vulnerabilities, as the cause of the Incident.\n\n\f4. The Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for handling under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. The Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision, and to\nbreach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“the PDPA”).\n\n5. The Organisation admitted work had not been completed on the website at launch\nowing to contractual disputes with the developer. The Organisation subsequently\nengaged IT maintenance vendors in an effort to ensure the security of the website.\nHowever, maintenance had been ad-hoc and limited to troubleshooting\nfunctionality issues from bugs, glitches and/or when a page failed to load.\n\n6. In breach of the Protection Obligation, the Organisation failed to provide sufficient\nclarity and specifications to its vendors on how to protect its database and personal\ndata. In Re Civil Service Club, the Commission had pointed out that organisations\nthat engage IT vendors can provide clarity and emphasize the need for personal\ndata protection to their IT vendors by a) making it part of their contractual terms,\nand b) reviewing the requirements specifications to ensure that personal data\nprotection is reflected in the design of the end-product.1 Further, post-execution of\nthe contract, an organization is also expected to exercise reasonable oversight\nover its vendor during the course of the engagement to ensure that the vendor is\nprotecting the personal data by adhering to the stipulated requirements.2\n\n1 Re Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15.\n2 Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 317 at [16] and [17].\n\n\f7. Another breach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation was failure to\nconduct reasonable periodic security reviews, including vulnerability scans, since\nthe launch of its website. The requirement for and scope of reasonable periodic\nsecurity reviews had long been established in the published decisions of the\nCommission.3 The PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems\nalso emphasized the need to periodically conduct web application vulnerability\nscanning and assessments, post deployment, as a basic practice to ensure\ncompliance with the Protection Obligation under the PDPA.4\n\n8. The Organisation is therefore found to have breached the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n9. In deciding the enforcement action in this case, the Commission considered the\nOrganisation’s efforts towards website security, cooperation throughout the\ninvestigation, voluntary admission of breach of the Protection Obligation and the\nprompt remediation taken. The last included immediate suspension of its website,\nand the engagement of a new developer to develop a new and enhance web\napplication. The Commission also notes that the affected personal data was no\nlonger or accessible following the shutdown of RaidForums. In the circumstances,\nthe Commission directs the Organisation to do the following:\n\na. To submit to the Commission, within twenty-one (21) days from the date of\nissue of this Direction, a plan to ensure regular patching, updates and upgrades\n\n3 See, eg, Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 317; Re Bud Cosmetics Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] PDP Digest 351; and Re Watami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 221.\n4 Pages 21 and 22 of the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems.\n\n\ffor all software and firmware supporting its website(s) and applications through\nwhich personal data in its possession may be accessed.\n\nb.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 24 December 2021, Fortytwo Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”), an online\n\nfurniture\n\nstore,\n\nnotified\n\nthe\n\nPersonal\n\nData\n\nProtection\n\nCommission\n\n(the\n\n“Commission”) of malicious code injections on its website which led to the capturing\nof the email address and password of 6,241 individuals when they logged in to its\nwebsite (the “Incident”). The name, credit card number, expiry date and CVV/CVN\nnumber of another 98 individuals’ were also affected.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This means that the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision;\nand admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n(the “PDPA”).\n\n1\n\n\f3.\n\nAn issue that arose in this case is whether fictitious names or pseudonymous\n\npersonal particulars form part of the personal data under the possession or control of\nthe Organisation. The importance of this lies in how it may potentially reduce the size\nof the dataset that was at risk. In their addendum to the Written Statement, the\nOrganisation stated that it does not verify the names provided by the users, and\nsuggested that the impact of the Incident might be more limited as some of the users’\nnames may be incomplete, fictitious or pseudonymous.\n\n4.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” to be data, whether true or\n\nnot (emphasis added), about an individual who can be identified from that data; or\nfrom that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\naccess. The PDPA caters for the situation where not every record of personal data\nthat is under the possession or control of an Organisation is verified. It takes a practical\napproach, as the accuracy of personal data records will change with the passage of\ntime (e.g. information becomes outdated) or individuals may intentionally provide\ninaccurate information (e.g. users hiding their age or using fictitious residential\naddresses to bypass restriction of services by age or geolocation). What matters is\nthat the Organisation, having collected the information, takes steps to comply with their\nobligations under the PDPA, such as to protect them and to ensure that they are used\nin accordance with the purpose of their collection.\n\n5.\n\nThe situation is different when the organisation, as a data security or data\n\nmanagement measure, applies pseudonymisation or anonymisation techniques on\npersonal data that is in their possession or under their control. In such circumstances,\nif the risk of reidentification is adequately addressed and managed, the resulting\ndataset may be treated as anonymised. The key difference is the intention of the\n2\n\n\forganisation and its ability to direct and control the data processing activities required\nto achieve the resultant anonymised dataset.1\n\n6.\n\nIn this case, the Organisation was collecting data from its customers. Their\n\ncustomer database contained names, email addresses and additional details such as\ntheir shipping address, billing address, and date of birth. It also contained credit card\ndetails of 98 customers. Even if some customers had provided incomplete, fictitious or\npseudonymous personal particulars or payment details, the Organisation had\ncollected personal data. For the purpose of this investigations, it matters not that some\nof these customers may have provided inaccurate information. The Organisation’s\nobligations under the PDPA applies to the entire customer database.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the Incident occurred because the threat actor\n\nhad successfully exploited vulnerabilities present in the Magento open-source version\n1.9.x.x which the Organisation had employed for its online store. These vulnerabilities\nwere present because the Organisation failed to apply four Magento security patches\nreleased on 28 Nov 2017, 25 June 2019, 8 October 2019 and 28 April 2020 by Adobe.\n\n8.\n\nCompounding the above, support for Magento version 1 had ended on 30 June\n\n2020. The Organisation admitted that it should have upgraded to Magento opensource version 2.0 after Adobe ended the support for Magento 1 on 30 June 2020.\nThe Organisation had planned to upgrade to Magento version 2 in early 2020, but its\nplans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having said that, Adobe had\nannounced in November 2015 that it will end support for Magento 1.x in 36 months,\n\n1 See Personal Data Protection Commission, Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act\n\nfor Selected Topics, at paras 3.5, 3.8 and 3.13.\n3\n\n\fi.e. by November 2018. In September 2018, Adobe then announced that it would\nextend the support to 30 June 2020. Given the ample notice given by Adobe to the\nOrganisation of the need to upgrade the version of Magento Open Source which it was\nusing in order to continue receiving support and security patches from Adobe, it is\ndifficult to look past the Organisation’s prolonged failure to do the needful and perform\nthe necessary upgrades.\n\n9.\n\nThe Commission had consistently advised organisations on the importance of\n\napplying software patches. In our Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems,\nthe Commission had highlighted that organisations should perform system patching\npromptly to fix security vulnerabilities. If software patches are not updated as\nrecommended by the software provider, they may not contain the latest cybersecurity\nupdates and may compromise the organisation’s defence against cyber-attacks.\n\n10.\n\nWe note that the Organisation had considered and evaluated the four patches\n\nbut decided to hold back on installing them. However, these four patches were\nreleased by Adobe to address several high severity risk issues and critical bugs,\nincluding the injection of malicious codes. The Organisation’s failure to patch had\nincreased the risks of a malicious code injection capable of capturing users’ personal\ndata.\n\n11.\n\nIn light of the above, the Organisation is found to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation under section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\f12.\n\nThe Commission notes that after the Incident, the Organisation took prompt\n\nremedial actions, including notifying affected individuals and various technical\nmeasures to improve its security. The Organisation is also taking steps to upgrade to\nMagento version 2.\n\n13.\n\nIn deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered\n\nthe Organisation’s cooperation throughout the investigation, the voluntary admission\nof breach of the Protection Obligation, and the prompt remedial actions taken.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the issuance of the Commission’s preliminary decision, the\n\nOrganisation represented that it was unfair to state that was a prolonged failure to\nperform the necessary upgrade. This is because there was a lead time of 6 months\nbefore the end of support when it made the decision to upgrade, before the COVID19 pandemic disrupted its plans. The Organisation’s representation is not accepted\nas, notwithstanding the disruptions caused by the pandemic, the Organisation had\nbeen given ample notice of the impending end of support but took no action to perform\nthe necessary upgrade from November 2015 to early 2020.\n\n15.\n\nHaving considered the circumstances set out above, the factors listed at section\n\n48J(6) of the PDPA and the representations made by the Organisation, the Deputy\nCommissioner for Personal Data Protection hereby finds the Organisation in breach\nand directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$8,000 within 30 days from\nthe notice accompanying date of this decision, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgement debts shall accrue and be\n\n5\n\n\fpayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty\nis paid in full.\n\n16.\n\nThe Organisation is also directed to:\na.\n\nComplete the upgrading of its website to a supported software version,\nincluding vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, within 6\nmonths of the direction.\n\nb.\n\nInform the Commission with 14 days of the completion of the above.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

The\nCommission commenced investigations to determine whether the circumstances\nbehind the Incident disclosed any breaches by the Organisation of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a body corporate established under the Legal Profession\n\nAct 1966 and represents members of the legal profession in Singapore. Every\nadvocate and solicitor called to the Singapore bar is a statutory member of the\nOrganisation as long as they have a practising certificate in force. At the material time,\nthe Organisation stored the personal data of its current and former members\n(“Members”) in one of its servers for the purposes of carrying out its statutory\nfunctions.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Organisation had implemented an off-the-shelf secure VPN solution,\n\nFortiOS, to manage remote access to its servers (the “VPN System”). The\nOrganisation also engaged a vendor (the “Vendor”) to provide IT support services,\nincluding maintenance of the VPN System. For completeness, the Vendor was not the\nOrganisation’s data intermediary as it did not access or process the personal data of\nthe Members in the course of carrying out its IT support services.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation also implemented antivirus / malware detection software at\n\nthe servers, and password complexity requirements for its users’ accounts. In\nparticular, account passwords had a maximum lifespan of 3 months before a\ncompulsory change was required.\n\n5\n\nAdditionally, the Organisation had in place a written data protection policy and\n\nconducted data protection training for its staff highlighting cybersecurity threats such\nas phishing and ransomware. Periodic emails on data protection awareness and\nreminders were also sent to staff.\n\nThe Incident\n6\n\nOn 27 January 2021, a threat actor gained access to the account of the\n\nOrganisation’s IT administrator (“compromised admin account”) and used this to\ncreate a new account with full administrative privileges. Using this new account, the\nthreat actor moved through the Organisation’s network without detection and located\nthe Organisation’s servers. The threat actor then executed a ransomware attack on\nthe servers, encrypting their contents.\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nA total of 16,009 Members’ personal data was affected in the Incident, including\n\neach Member’s full name, residential address, date of birth, and NRIC number. Other\ndata items were also affected but they are either in the nature of business contact\ninformation or publicly available information.\n\n8\n\nThe attack was detected on the same day by antivirus / malware detection\n\nsoftware deployed by the Organisation. The Organisation took immediate steps to\nremove the new administrator account created by the threat actor and restored the\nservers to their original state from secured back-ups.\n\nRemedial actions\n9\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation also took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a)\n\nRemoved unused administrator accounts and initiated password resets for\nall administrator accounts;\n\n(b)\n\nReduced privileged access for the compromised admin account (to create\nnew administrator accounts);\n\n(c)\n\nHired an in-house cybersecurity professional to take charge of the\nOrganisation’s IT security matters;\n\n(d)\n\nImplemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for all VPN access; and\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented VPN IP location whitelisting to allow only Singapore-based IP\naddresses.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n4\n\n\f10\n\nThe Commission’s investigation centred on whether the Organisation had\n\nbreached its obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). As the Vendor was not the\nOrganisation’s data intermediary, the Protection Obligation in this case was borne\nsolely by the Organisation.\n\nFindings from the investigations\n11\n\nInvestigations disclosed that there could have been multiple threat actors\n\ntargeting the Organisation or the same group of threat actors targeting the\nOrganisation through multiple channels – through brute force attacks, phishing email,\nand exploiting the unpatched VPN vulnerability of the VPN System.\n\n12\n\nBrute-force attacks. Around ten days before the Incident, multiple\n\nunsuccessful login attempts using a “guest” account were found since 18 January\n2021. There were also further unsuccessful attempts made using random accounts.\nHowever, investigations did not surface evidence that the initial entry by the threat\nactor had been via a successful brute force attack on the compromised admin account.\n\n13\n\nPhishing emails. Investigations also revealed that the Organisation was\n\nattacked by the Netwalker ransomware, most commonly introduced via phishing\nemails. From the Vendor’s explanations, the administrator of the compromised admin\naccount could have received a phishing email with a link and entered his credentials.\nHowever, investigations did not surface evidence of any phishing email relevant to this\n5\n\n\fransomware; neither was there evidence that the compromised admin account’s\ncredentials was obtained by a threat actor through phishing.\n\n14\n\nVulnerability of the VPN System. At the material time before the Incident,\n\nMFA was not implemented for the Organisation’s administrator access to its servers.\nThis meant that once authenticated, an admin user had rights to create new accounts,\nassign privileged security groups, and access all of the Organisation’s servers without\nthe need for a second factor.\n\n15\n\nInvestigations revealed that there was a vulnerability in the VPN System which\n\ncould be exploited to gain access credentials if left unpatched (the “Vulnerability”).\nThis was assessed to be a possible way in which the threat actor obtained the\ncredentials of the compromised admin account:\n(a)\n\nAround November 2020, a file containing more than 45,000 session links\nand IP addresses for the VPN System of affected organisations (including\nthe Organisation) was found posted in online forums by someone who had\nobtained the information by exploiting the Vulnerability.\n\n(b)\n\nWithout patching the VPN System’s firmware, each session link would\ndisclose the credentials of users in plain text, including passwords.\n\n(c)\n\nThe date/time of the online publication (i.e. November 2020) was sufficiently\nproximate to the threat actor’s successful intrusion in January 2021 using\nthe compromised admin account.\n\n6\n\n\f16\n\nFrom the foregoing, it would appear that of the three possible attack vectors,\n\nthe vulnerability in the VPN System could have given the threat actor entry into the\nOrganisation’s environment.\n\nNo breach of the Protection Obligation for omission to patch the Vulnerability\n17\n\nThe developer of the VPN System, Fortinet, had disclosed the Vulnerability as\n\nearly as 24 May 2019. It released an Operating System (“OS”) upgrade to remedy the\nissue, which contained the updates to remedy the issue. The VPN System had a user\ninterface (“UI”) through which the OS upgrade availability could be notified. According\nto the Vendor, the Vendor had regularly checked the UI if OS upgrades were available\nbut there were no prompts of updates available for download prior to the Incident.\nAccording to the Organisation, it was only after it communicated the issue to the\ndeveloper, after the incident, that the UI subsequently prompted availability of some\npatches that included the OS upgrade remedying the Vulnerability.\n\n18\n\nThe Commission recognises that organisations may rely on vendors engaged\n\nto provide IT security maintenance to obtain and apply needed software upgrades and\npatches. If so, the Protection Obligation requires organisations to stipulate such\nrequirements clearly in writing as part of the job specifications of such vendors. In this\ncase, patching of the VPN System had been a specific obligation explicitly outsourced\nby the Organisation to the Vendor via contract.\n\n19\n\nIn addition to clearly stipulating the vendor’s scope of IT maintenance and/or\n\ndevelopment work, organisations are expected to exercise reasonable oversight over\nthe vendor’s performance of the subcontracted services, including patching – Re\n7\n\n\fSmiling Orchard (S) Pte Ltd and Ors [2016] SGPDPC 191. There should be a clear\nmeeting of minds as to the services the service provider has agreed to undertake and\norganisations must follow through with procedures to check that the outsourced\nprovider is delivering the services.\n\n20\n\nThe Commission appreciates that the technical nature of information on\n\nsoftware patching and upgrades limits the degree of oversight that many organisations\ncan exercise on vendor performance in this regard. The Commission notes that the\nOrganisation had put in place a process to ensure that there were maintenance logs\nin respect of the Vendor’s activities. Thus, the Organisation, to its credit, had put in\nplace a system to monitor its Vendor’s activities. In technical areas where the\nOrganisation depends on its Vendor’s technical expertise, this is reasonably adequate.\nThe situation may be different if there was a very well-publicised issue with a wellknown commercial solution (e.g. vulnerabilities affecting a network router) that the\nOrganisation ought to know that it uses. In such situations, the Organisation might be\nat least expected to query its Vendor about whether it is exposed and ask for a\nremediation plan. But this is probably limited to well-known and well-publicised issues\nin mass media.\n\n21\n\nCarefully weighing the above circumstances, the Commission has decided that:\n\n(a) it had been reasonable for the Organisation to rely on the Vendor to perform\nsoftware security patching, including of the Vulnerability, and (b) that the Organisation\n\n1\n\nSee also Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd and Integrated Health Information Systems Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC\n3.\n8\n\n\fhad in this case discharged its duty of oversight of the Vendor’s patching function.\nTherefore the Organisation has not breached the Protection Obligation.\n\nBreach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation in other aspects\n22\n\nInvestigations revealed that the password for the compromised admin account\n\nwas “Welcome2020lawsoc”. Despite this password complying with the Organisation’s\nown password complexity rules, the Organisation acknowledged that this was a weak\npassword and vulnerable to dictionary attacks due to the use of a full word and the\nOrganisation’s name. As highlighted in Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1, a\npassword that meets complexity rules in form could still be regarded as a weak\npassword if it was easily determined and vulnerable to brute force attacks. In that case,\nthe password “Chi!zzle@2018” incorporated the organisation’s name and was\ndetermined to be a weak password. Further, the Organisation informed that the\ncompromised admin account’s password had been used for more than 90 days and\nhad not been changed every 3 months, as required by the Organisation’s password\npolicy. In the circumstances, the Organisation failed to enforce its password policy in\nrelation to the compromised admin account.\n\n23\n\nIn the Commission’s recent Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\n\nsystems2, it has been observed that unauthorised access is one of the most common\ntypes of data breaches. This can happen, for example, through the use of a weak\npassword which is easily guessed by hackers. To remediate this, it may be practical\nto look into implementing processes in ICT systems to minimise risk of brute force\n\n2\n\nPublished on 14 September 2021, replacing the Guide to Data Protection by Design for ICT systems published\non 31 May 2019, after the Incident.\n9\n\n\fattacks (e.g. a pre-defined number of failed login attempts) and ensure information is\naccessed only by the authorised/authenticated persons performing the intended\nactivities. Additionally, as 2FA or MFA becomes more broadly available, the adoption\nof these tools should become the norm for accounts with administrative privileges, for\nsystems managing sensitive data or large volumes of personal data3.\n\n24\n\nNext, the Organisation also did not conduct a review of its security\n\narrangements within the last 3 years prior to the Incident. Regular assurance checks\nhelp organisations ensure that ICT security controls developed and configured for the\nprotection of personal data are properly implemented and practised4. In Re WTS\nAutomotive Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 265, the Commission emphasised (at\n[18]) for the need for regular review of security arrangements and tests to detect\nvulnerabilities.\n\n25\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation is found to have negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by (i) using an easily guessable password for the\ncompromised admin account, (ii) failing to change the password for the compromised\nadmin account at reasonable intervals, and (iii) failing to conduct any periodic security\nreviews in the three years leading up to the Incident.\n\n3\n\nSee the Commission’s recent release of the handbook on common causes of data breaches in How to Guard\nagainst Common Types of Data Breaches published on 24 May 2021 (at page 13), after the Incident; See Love\nBonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3.\n4\nSee the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems.\n5\nSee also Jigyasa [2020] SGPDPC 9.\n10\n\n\fThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n26\n\nNotwithstanding that the Organisation’s breaches of the Protection Obligation\n\nwere not directly related to the Incident, the Commission’s role is not limited to\ninvestigating only the immediate or proximate causes of a data breach incident 6. In\ndetermining whether directions (if any) should be given to the Organisation pursuant\nto Section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether a financial penalty ought to be imposed\npursuant to Section 48J of the PDPA, the Deputy Commissioner took into\nconsideration the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, and in particular the\nfollowing factors:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s breaches of the Protection Obligation were not the most\nproximate cause of the Incident (which was the VPN Vulnerability);\n\n(b)\n\nThe datasets affected in the Incident were not of a higher sensitivity (e.g.\npersonal data of a financial or medical nature);\n\n(c)\n\nThe risk of unauthorised access to the Members’ personal data was limited\ndue to early detection of the unauthorised access, which also allowed\nprompt containment and restoration of the servers to its original state;\n\n(d)\n\nThere was no evidence of any exfiltration or misuse of the personal data of\nthe Members; and\n\n(e)\n\n27\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions in response to the Incident.\n\nFor the above reasons, it is adequate for directions to be issued in this case.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to:\n(a)\n\nEngage qualified security service providers to conduct a thorough security\naudit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the security,\n\n6\n\nSee Love Bonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3.\n11\n\n\fmaintenance, creation and removal of accounts with administrative\nprivileges that can access directly and/or create access to personal data in\nthe possession or control of the Organisation;\n(b)\n\nFurnish to the Commission within 14 days a schedule stating the scope of\nthe security audit;\n\n(c)\n\nProvide the full security audit report to the Commission, by no later than 60\ndays from the date of the issue of this direction;\n\n(d)\n\nRectify any security gaps identified in the security audit report, review and\nupdate its personal data protection policies as applicable, and\n\n(e)\n\nInform the Commission within 1 week of completion of rectification and\nimplementation in response to the security audit report.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n12\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $37,000 was imposed on OrangeTee & Tie for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect users' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Real Estate"],"date":"2023-04-17","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_OrangeTee_210223.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by OrangeTee & Tie","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-orangetee-and-tie","timestamp":"2023-04-17","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 3\n\nCase No. DP-2108-B8712\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nOrangeTee & Tie Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fOrangeTee & Tie Pte Ltd\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2108-B8712\n21 February 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 4 August 2021, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”)\n\ncontacted OrangeTee & Tie Pte Ltd (“Organisation”) after receiving information\nindicating that a threat actor had managed to exfiltrate databases in the Organisation’s\npossession, which were believed to contain personal data.\n\n2\n\nSubsequently, on 6 August 2021, the Organisation notified the Commission of\n\nan incident involving unauthorised access to its IT network (the “Incident”). The\nOrganisation also gave a media statement on the same day informing members of the\npublic about the Incident and inviting any concerned customers to contact the\nOrganisation’s call centre for clarification.\n\n3\n\nThe\n\nCommission\n\nthen\n\ncommenced\n\ninvestigations\n\nto\n\ndetermine\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in\nrelation to the Incident.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation is a real estate enterprise based in Singapore and has been\n\nin operation since 2000.\n\n\f5\n\nFour servers maintained by the Organisation were involved in the Incident,\n\nnamely: the Production Web Server, the Production Database Server, the\nDevelopment Web Server, and the Development Database Server. The Production\nWeb Server and the Development Web Server (collectively the “Web Servers”) were\ninternet-facing, in that they were directly accessible from the internet. The Production\nWeb Server was linked to the Production Database Server, while the Development\nWeb Server was linked to the Development Database Server.\n\n6\n\nThe personal data of employees and customers of the Organisation was stored\n\non the Production Database Server and the Development Database Server\n(collectively the “Database Servers”). The personal data had not been encrypted.\n\n7\n\nThe Databases Servers were running Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Standard\n\nversion 11.0.6251.0 (Service Pack 3) at the time of the Incident, which Microsoft had\nceased support for on 9 October 2018. Additionally, the version of Microsoft SQL\nServer the Organisation used was also not updated, as the most current Service Pack\n4 was not installed.\n\nThe Incident\n\n8\n\nOn 3 August 2021, the Organisation received a ransom demand email from an\n\norganisation which identified themselves as ‘ALTDOS’. The email was sent from an\nemail address which is known to be used by the ALTDOS group. The threat actor\nclaimed that they had been hacking the Organisation’s network since June 2021 and\n\n\fhad stolen “hundreds of databases”, some of which were claimed to contain sensitive\ninformation. The ransom demand also contained video footage of five databases\npurported to have been stolen, which showed that sensitive data might have been\nexfiltrated from the Organisation’s servers.\n\n9\n\nIn the same email, the threat actor demanded a ransom of 10 Bitcoins for the\n\nsafety and non-disclosure of the exfiltrated databases and threatened disclosure if the\nransom was not paid. The Organisation filed a police report and reported the Incident\nto the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team, a division of the Cyber\nSecurity Agency of Singapore.\n\n10\n\nOn 4 August 2021, having not received the demanded ransom, ALTDOS\n\ncarried out a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack which brought down the\nOrganisation’s network, and sent an additional ransom demand via email and\nWhatsApp to some of the Organisation’s employees.\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation engaged a private forensic expert (“PFE”) to ascertain the\n\ncause and extent of the Incident. PFE’s investigations disclosed that, contrary to their\nclaims, the threat actor exfiltrated personal datasets from eleven databases,\ncontaining personal data set out in the table below:\n\nCategory of\n\nNumber of\n\nIndividuals\n\nIndividuals\n\nEmployees\n\n305\n\nTypes of Personal Data Affected\n\nName, full NRIC/FIN/passport number and bank account\nnumber\n\nCustomers\n\n245,752\n\nName, full NRIC/FIN/passport number and property\ntransaction amount\n\n\fAgents\n\n10,526\n\n1. Name, full NRIC/FIN/passport number and bank\naccount number (2,301 individuals)\n\n2. Name, full NRIC/FIN number, bank account number\nand commission amount (4,763 individuals)\n\n3. Name, full NRIC/FIN number, commission amount\n(286 individuals)\n\n4. Name, full NRIC/FIN number (3,176 individuals)\nTOTAL\n\n12\n\n256,583\n\n-\n\nThe PFE’s investigations found that the threat actor had carried out certain web-\n\nbased attacks and exploited vulnerabilities on the Web Servers to successfully\nexfiltrate databases from the outdated Database Servers. The following observations\nwere made by the PFE:\n(a)\n\nProduction Web Server – the PFE concluded that the threat actor used\n\nSQL injection attacks on the Production Web Server. SQL injections are a way\nof exploiting vulnerable website code and forms to return data from a SQL\ndatabase that should not be available to a user. The PFE also found that the\nthreat actor had likely used a malicious tool known as ‘SQL Map’ on vulnerable\nwebpages in the Production Web Server, to automate the systematic probing of\nwebpages for SQL injection vulnerabilities. Once the vulnerabilities were\ndiscovered, the threat actor then proceeded to exploit the vulnerabilities to\naccess and exfiltrate data from four databases within the Production Database\nServer at some point(s) between 24 June 2021 and 3 August 2021.\n\n(b)\n\nDevelopment Web Server – the PFE could not locate forensic artefacts\n\nto confirm the mode of attack by the threat actor. However, the PFE identified\n\n\fevidence of cross-site scripting attacks. Cross-site scripting attacks involve the\ninjection of malicious scripts into trusted websites which are then executed on\nend-users’ browsers. In this case, malicious code had been injected into the\nDevelopment Web Server. This led the PFE to believe that the Development\nWeb Server was compromised. The threat actor is believed to have exploited the\ncompromised Development Web Server to access and exfiltrate data from seven\ndatabases on the Development Database Server, although it was unclear how\nand when this had occurred.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n13\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following remedial\n\nmeasures:\n\nImmediate remedial steps to contain the Incident\n\n(a)\n\nShut down and isolated the affected servers from the rest of the IT network;\n\n(b)\n\nUpdated its servers with the latest security patches;\n\nTo prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n\n(c)\n\nTested the affected servers for vulnerabilities and deployed enterprisegrade anti-malware software across the IT network;\n\n\f(d)\n\nCarried out security hardening activities, including the removal of redundant\nservices, restricting access and services, and ensuring the server is secure\nto ‘Center for Internet of Security’ (CIS) benchmarking standards;\n\n(e)\n\nCarried out detailed analysis of intrusion prevention logs;\n\n(f)\n\nReviewed and secured the firewall configuration;\n\n(g)\n\nSeparated the public-facing website from the internal agent portal and\nensured that the former was securely hosted;\n\n(h)\n\nImplemented a web application firewall to protect the network; and\n\n(i)\n\nLiaised with the PFE on the recovery process as well as improving IT\nsecurity.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n14\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). The Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\nObligation in the following two respects.\n\n\fUse of production data in Development Servers for testing purposes\n\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation used ‘live’ production data for development and testing\n\npurposes without sufficiently robust processes to protect the personal data through\nproper safeguards.\n16\n\nThe ‘live’ production data used included personal data and had been stored in\n\nthe development environment (i.e. the Development Servers) from which the datasets\nhad been exfiltrated by the threat actor. The Organisation explained the use of ‘live’\nproduction data as being necessary in order for the testing computations to be\naccurately derived, and for the actual business process flow to be effectively tested.\n\n17\n\nThe Commission has advised in its Handbook on How to Guard Against\n\nCommon Types of Data Breaches (the “Handbook”) at page 11 that use of ‘live’\nproduction personal data for testing creates a security risk. 1 The safer practice would\nbe to use anonymised data for testing purposes. Synthetic data, which is fake data\nthat contains similar characteristics as the real data, is a form of anonymised data.\nAnother way is to use pseudonymised data where direct identifiers have been replaced\nwith pseudonyms. The Commission has explained the rationale for anonymisation of\npersonal data for development and business study in the Advisory Guidelines on the\nPDPA for Selected Topics:\n\nHandbook on How to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches (“Handbook”), page 11: “Out of convenience, many\norganisations use production data for system testing in their test environments. But as test environments tend to be much less\nsecured, there is a high risk of data breach in a test environment.” (https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/news-andevents/announcements/2021/05/handbook-on-how-to-guard-against-common-types-of-data-breaches-now-available)\n1\n\n\f“3.14 Anonymisation of personal data enables businesses to tap on data\nfor insights and innovation while at the same time provides protection to\nindividuals. It also reduces the impact of harm to individuals in the event of a\ndata breach. Where possible, Organisations should adopt such practices for\nexternal sharing of data. It can even be adopted when sharing data internally,\nparticularly where individuals need not be identified for the purposes of\nprocessing.\n\n3.15 In the event of a data breach, the level of data anonymisation,\ncorresponding\n\nsafeguards\n\nimplemented\n\nand\n\nproper\n\nassessment\n\nby\n\norganisations in considering the harms of the anonymised data would be taken\ninto consideration to assess if data has been properly anonymised.”2\n(emphasis in bold added)\n\n18\n\nThe Commission’s position on this issue had been reiterated in Re PINC\n\nInteractive Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 1, in which it was held that the organisation had\nbreached the Protection Obligation by using a synthetic dataset that contained\npersonal data belonging to real users. It should have used 100% synthetic data.3\n\n19\n\nHowever, where the use of ‘live’ personal data is operationally necessary,\n\nsufficiently robust processes should be implemented to safeguard the personal data.\nTesting or development environments are usually not as secured as production\nenvironments. The Organisation in this case had failed to implement sufficiently robust\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics, page 14, paragraphs 3.14 – 3.15 (https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelinesand-consultation/2020/02/advisory-guidelines-on-the-personal-data-protection-act-for-selected-topics)\n3\nRe PINC Interactive Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 1, [10] – [12]\n2\n\n\fprocesses in the form of a security assessment of the risk from using, and storing,\n‘live’ personal data in a testing environment. Such a security assessment could\nconsider, for example, whether to restrict access to a smaller group of testers and limit\nthe duration when live data is loaded in the testing environment. If the testing\nenvironment is accessible from the Internet, security assessment ought to also be\ncarried out of the risk of unauthorised web entry.\n\n20\n\nWithout such an assessment, the Organisation was not positioned to make an\n\ninformed decision on whether the security arrangements to protect the personal data\nhad been reasonable or had needed to be enhanced. The lack of sufficiently robust\nprocesses to protect personal data through proper safeguards, such as the conduct of\na reasonable security assessment, amounted to a breach of the Protection Obligation\nby the Organisation.\n\nFailure to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews prior to the Incident\n\n21\n\nSecond, the Organisation failed to conduct reasonable periodic security\n\nreviews for its servers.\n\n22\n\nThe Commission’s previous decisions4 and the Guide5 have established that\n\nperiodic security reviews should be conducted to a reasonable standard to identify and\nremedy any vulnerabilities. Such scheduled reviews should be in place as a basic\npractice as it would likely have resulted in the detection of the vulnerabilities arising\nfrom the outdated software and the risk of SQL injection techniques. The Organisation\n\n4\n5\n\nWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 26 and Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11\nGuide, page 21, paragraph (g)\n\n\fadmitted in its submissions to the Commission that it had not considered the need for\nsuch security reviews in its IT security policy.\n\n23\n\nBoth Web Servers were internet-facing and were connected to production data\n\nstored in both Database Servers, thereby exposing the ‘live’ production data contained\ntherein (containing personal data) to security risks. However, owing to its failure to\nconduct periodic security reviews for the Web and Database Servers, the Organisation\ndid not recognise the risks engendered by the outdated software and did not take steps\nto assure itself that all internet-facing servers were adequately protected. Had the\nOrganisation conducted reasonable periodic security reviews prior to the Incident, the\nvulnerabilities to SQL injection techniques in the Web Servers would have been known\nand remedied. The Incident could then very likely have been avoided.\n\n24\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation by (i) using personal data belonging to real users in a\ndevelopment environment (i.e. the Development Servers) without a sufficiently robust\nprocess for a reasonable security assessment of the risk, and (ii) failing to conduct\nreasonable security reviews prior to the Incident.\n\nOrganisation’s position on the failure to update Microsoft SQL Server 2012\n\n25\n\nThe Organisation explained its failure to update the Database Servers’\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2012 version and install Service Pack 4 as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s IT team relied on Microsoft’s own auto-scan function\n\nto be alerted to available updating patches as a prompt for installation. This\n\n\fMicrosoft tool ran once a month before the Incident. The tool, however, failed to\ndetect that the installed version of Microsoft SQL Server 2012 in the servers\nrequired patching, and that the required patch in the form of Service Pack 4 had\nbeen available.\n\n(b)\n\nThe tool had not previously failed to detect and alert about required\n\nupdates.\n\n(c)\n\nThe alternative option of requiring the IT team to conduct a manual\n\nreview of all updates released by Microsoft every month had not been practical\nor reasonable as compared to relying on the auto-scan function.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation’s IT team did not use third-party scanning software to\n\nmonitor and detect available patches because even these might not have\nidentified the need to patch Microsoft SQL Server 2012 with Service Pack 4.\n\n26\n\nThe Commission’s investigation revealed no known issues relating to the\n\navailability or installation of Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 4 updates. The\nProtection Obligation required the Organisation to have sufficiently robust processes\nto protect personal data through regular patching / updates / upgrades of important\nsoftware. The question is whether the Organisation’s reliance on system prompts in\nthe form of alerts from the Microsoft auto-scan function had amounted to a sufficiently\nrobust process for patching in the circumstances of this case.\n\n\f27\n\nService Packs are significant collations of updates and patches that have been\n\nreleased. When released, Service Packs effectively provide a new baseline of updates\nand patches. On the question above, the Commission noted that the Microsoft\nKnowledge Base site indicated that the Service Pack 4 update had been available\nthrough the usual Windows Update auto-scan function since October 2017. This\nmeans that it would have been available for almost 4 years at the time of the Incident.\nConsidering that an important software patch in the form of the Service Pack 4 had in\nthis case been available for almost 4 years, the Organisation’s reliance on system\nprompts such as alerts through the auto-scan function had not been a sufficiently\nrobust process to patch important software for the security of personal data. The\nOrganisation should be aware of significant Service Packs and consciously decide\nwhether to upgrade.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n28\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1), and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, including the following mitigating factors:\n\nMitigating Factors\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the\naffected individuals;\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted that it had breached the Protection\nObligation in Section 24(a) of the PDPA in failing to protect personal data\nin its possession by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission further notes that names and property transaction amounts\n\nwere among the categories of personal data which was exfiltrated.

The Commission commenced\ninvestigations to determine whether the circumstances relating to the calls disclosed\nany breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Individual is an insurance director with a large and well-known insurance\n\ncompany managing a team of 25 insurance agents. In an effort to conduct marketing\ncalls more efficiently, the Individual sought to engage the services of 2 companies\nhereinafter referred to as the “Call Automation Vendor” and the “Checker”.\n\n3\n\nThe Call Automation Vendor provides software to facilitate the making of\n\nautomated calls using customised scripts. The Checker’s service comprises the\nprovision of telephone numbers (from which automated calls could be made), and the\nprovision of software to check whether the telephone numbers of intended recipients\n\n\fwere registered with the Do Not Call Registry (“DNCR”). The systems / software of the\nCall Automation Vendor and the Checker were intended to work in tandem as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nthe telephone numbers of intended recipients would be uploaded onto the Call\nAutomation Vendor’s software;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Checker’s software would check the DNCR for such telephone numbers;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nthe Call Automation Vendor’s software would then avoid making any calls to the\ntelephone numbers which appeared in the DNCR.\n\n4\n\nAs the Call Automation Vendor and the Checker do not contract directly with\n\nindividuals, the Individual caused LongSheng to enter into contracts with the Call\nAutomation Vendor and the Checker on 17 March 2021 and 20 May 2021 respectively,\nto provide the services outlined at paragraph 3 above. The Individual used LongSheng\nas a corporate vehicle by which to procure the services of the Call Automation Vendor\nand the Checker.\n\n5\n\nFollowing the engagement of the Call Automation Vendor and the Checker, and\n\npursuant to instructions from the Individual, the Call Automation Vendor provided 10\nchannels in its software, while the Checker subscribed for 10 telephone numbers in\nthe name of LongSheng from which to make the automated marketing calls.\n\n6\n\nThe Individual wished to test the systems provided by the Call Automation\n\nVendor and the Checker, for which recipient telephone numbers were required. One\nof the Individual’s staff suggested to generate recipient telephone numbers by:\n\n\f(a)\n\nusing commonly seen telephone numbers for the first 4 digits of each telephone\nnumber; and\n\n(b)\n\nrandomly generating the last 4 digits of the telephone number by automated\nmeans.\n\n7\n\nThe Individual authorised this method of generating the telephone numbers,\n\nand his staff proceeded to use Microsoft Excel to do so.\n\n8\n\nThe Individual’s staff generated a total of 18,809 telephone number (“Subject\n\nNumbers”), which included 400 telephone numbers beginning with the digits “995”.\n“995” is the SCDF emergency line.\n\n9\n\nThe Subject Numbers were contained in 3 lists, which were uploaded onto the\n\nCall Automation Vendor’s software by a member of the Individual’s staff. The Individual\nthen clicked “send/call” in the Call Automation Vendor’s software to commence the\nautomated marketing calls.\n\n10\n\nBetween 25 and 28 June 2021, a total of 22,268 automated marketing calls\n\nwere made (the “Subject Calls”), of which 433 were to the SCDF emergency line (the\n“Incident”). Such calls were not blocked as the SCDF emergency line was not\nregistered in the DNCR.\n\n11\n\nOn 28 June 2021, while reviewing the call recordings, the Individual discovered\n\nthe calls made to the SCDF emergency line and immediately instructed his staff to\nstop using the Call Automation Vendor’s software. He also contacted the Call\n\n\fAutomation Vendor to stop making further automated marketing calls; and deleted the\nlists containing the Subject Numbers.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe prohibition under Section 48B of the PDPA\n12\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation focused on whether the Individual had breached section 48B(1) of the\nPDPA by sending, causing to be sent, or authorising the sending of “applicable\nmessages” - namely, (i) messages with a Singapore link to (ii) telephone numbers\ngenerated by a dictionary attack or address harvesting software (\"Section 48B\nProhibition\").\n\n13\n\nThe Section 48B Prohibition and other provisions of the PDPA setting out\n\nrelevant definitions are reproduced below:\nTerm and definition\n(…) a person must not send, cause to be sent or\n\nPDPA provision\ns48B(1)\n\nauthorise the sending of an applicable message.\n“applicable message” means a message with a\n\ns48A(1)\n\nSingapore link that is sent to any applicable telephone\nnumber;\n“message” means any message, whether in sound, text,\n\ns36(1)\n\nvisual or other form;\n(2) In this Part, an applicable message has a Singapore\nlink in any of the following circumstances:\n\ns48A(2)\n\n\f(a)\n\nthe message originates in Singapore;\n\n(b)\n\nthe sender of the message —\n(i)\n\nwhere the sender is an individual — is\n\nphysically\n\npresent\n\nin\n\nSingapore\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nmessage is sent; or\n(ii)\n\nin any other case —\n(A)\n\nis formed or recognised under the\n\nlaw of Singapore; or\n(B)\n\nhas an office or a place of business\n\nin Singapore;\n(c)\n\nthe telephone, mobile telephone or other device\n\nthat is used to access the message is located in\nSingapore;\n(d)\n\nthe recipient of the message —\n(i)\n\nwhere the recipient is an individual — is\n\nphysically\n\npresent\n\nin\n\nSingapore\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nmessage is accessed; or\n(ii)\n\nin any other case — carries on business or\n\nactivities in Singapore when the message is\naccessed;\n(e)\n\nif the message cannot be delivered because the\n\ntelephone number to which the message is sent has\nceased to exist (assuming that the telephone number\nexisted), it is reasonably likely that the message would\n\n\fhave been accessed using a telephone, mobile\ntelephone or other device located in Singapore.\n“applicable telephone number” means a telephone\n\ns48A(1)\n\nnumber that is generated or obtained through the use of\n—\n(a)\n\na dictionary attack; or\n\n(b)\n\naddress‑harvesting software;\n\n“dictionary attack” means the method by which the\n\ns48A(1)\n\ntelephone number of a recipient is obtained using an\nautomated means that generates possible telephone\nnumbers\n\nby\n\ncombining\n\nnumbers\n\ninto\n\nnumerous\n\npermutations;\n“address‑harvesting software” means software that is\n\ns48A(1)\n\nspecifically designed or marketed for use for —\n(a)\n\nsearching the Internet for telephone numbers; and\n\n(b)\n\ncollecting, compiling, capturing or otherwise\n\nharvesting those telephone numbers\n\n14\n\nThe Section 48B Prohibition was introduced as part of the 2020 amendments\n\nto the PDPA and came into effect on 1 February 2021. It was intended to supplement\nthe existing “Do Not Call” provisions in Part 9 of the PDPA in striking the correct\nbalance between safeguarding consumer interest and permitting legitimate business\ninterests in direct marketing by:\n\n\f(a)\n\nestablishing clear guardrails for sending unsolicited commercial messages; 1\nand\n\n(b)\n\naddressing consumer annoyance and deterring spammers who use\ntechnologies that make it easier to indiscriminately send unsolicited commercial\nmessages (including robocalls) to a large number of recipients.2\n\n15\n\nThe Section 48B Prohibition operates by targeting the indiscriminate manner\n\nby which recipient telephone numbers may be generated and targeted, usually by\nautomated means. It does not serve as a blanket prohibition on the sending of\nunsolicited commercial messages, and leaves room for legitimate direct marketing.\n\nWhether the Individual had contravened the s48B Prohibition\n16\n\nFor the Individual to have breached the Section 48B Prohibition, he must have:\n\n(a)\n\nsent, cause to be sent or authorized the sending of;\n\n(b)\n\na message;\n\n(c)\n\nwith a Singapore link;\n\n(d)\n\nto telephone numbers generated or obtained through use of:\n\n17\n\n(i)\n\na dictionary attack; or\n\n(ii)\n\naddress harvesting software.\n\nBased on the facts of the Incident as set out above, the elements for breach of\n\nthe Section 48B Prohibition are made out:\n\n1\n\nSingapore Parliamentary Debates (2 November 2020) vol 95, at page 36 (S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and\nInformation)\n2 Public Consultation Paper issued by the Ministry of Communications and Information and the Personal Data Protection\nCommission dated 14 May 2020, at paragraphs 53 54(b)\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Individual specifically authorised and caused the making of the Subject\nCalls to the Subject Numbers.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Subject Calls were automated calls based on a customised script provided\nby the Call Automation Vendor. The Subject Calls were therefore messages in\nsound form, and “messages” as defined by s36(1) of the PDPA.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Subject Calls were made in Singapore. As such, the Subject Calls had a\n“Singapore link” within the meaning of s48A(2) of the PDPA.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Subject Numbers were generated by using commonly seen telephone\nnumbers for the first 4 digits, then randomising the remaining 4 digits. Strings\nof numbers were combined and resulted in the creation of 18,809 different\npermutations – i.e. unique telephone numbers – and the process was\nperformed using automated means via Microsoft Excel. This was therefore a\n“dictionary attack” within the meaning of s48A(1) of the PDPA.\n\n18\n\nAccordingly, the Individual is determined to have contravened the Section 48B\n\nProhibition.\n\nThe Commission’s Decision\n\n19\n\nBy using a “dictionary attack” to generate the Subject Numbers and then\n\ncausing and/or authorising the Subject Calls to be made to the Subject Numbers, the\nIndividual failed to stay within the “clear guardrails” of the PDPA to safeguard\nconsumer interests.\n\n\f20\n\nTo make matters worse, numerous calls were made to the SCDF emergency\n\nline. The importance of keeping the SCDF emergency line open and unobstructed for\ngenuine emergencies cannot be over-emphasised. That said, the fact that automated\nmarketing calls were made to the SCDF is not itself relevant to the Individual’s breach\nof the Section 48B Prohibition. The issue is with the method used to generate the\nSubject Numbers, and the Individual’s role in authorising the Subject Calls.\n\n21\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Individual was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Individual has not previously contravened the PDPA;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Individual had made efforts to ensure that he complied with his obligations\nunder Part 9 of the PDPA relating to the DNCR when making the Subject Calls;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nthe Individual voluntarily took action to cease the Subject Calls upon discovery\nthat the SCDF had been called.\n\n22\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby\n\nadministers a warning to the Individual in respect of his breach of the Section 48B\nProhibition. No other directions are necessary in view of the remedial actions already\ntaken by the Individual.\n\nLEE TI-TING\nASSISTANT COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Sembcorp Marine was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident whereby threat actor(s) exfiltrated personal data by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability present in an application.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Others","Ransomware","No breach"],"date":"2023-03-10","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_Sembcorp-Marine-Ltd_070223.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No breach of the PDPA by Sembcorp Marine","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/03/no-breach-of-the-pdpa-by-sembcorp-marine","timestamp":"2023-03-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 2\nCase No. DP-2206-B9934\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nSembcorp Marine Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 25 July 2022, Sembcorp Marine Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal data\nbreach that had occurred through the exploitation of the Log4J zero-day\nvulnerability (the “Incident”).\n\n2. As a result of the Incident, the personal data of 25,925 individuals was\nexfiltrated. The personal data affected included their name, address, email\naddress, NRIC number, telephone number, passport number, photograph, date\nof birth, bank account details, salary, and medical screening results.\n\n1\n\n\f3. The Organisation engaged an external cybersecurity company, Sygnia, to\ninvestigate the Incident. Its investigations found that the threat actor had\nexploited three Log4J vulnerabilities present in an application (the\n“Application”) to gain unauthorised access to a server as early as on 4 January\n2022. The threat actor also deployed the “Cobalt Strike” beacon, conducted\nreconnaissance, and made lateral movements across several machines, before\nexfiltrating data between 10 and 23 June 2022, and deploying a ransomware\non 28 June 2022.\n\n4. Threat intelligence research revealed that the ransomware campaign which\naffected the Organisation began targeting users of the Application in January\n2022. Given that reports of the Log4J vulnerability were first made in December\n2021, it would have been difficult for the Organisation to detect and prevent the\ninfiltration when it was one of the early targets, having been infiltrated as early\nas 4 January 2022.\n\n5. After finding out about the Log4J vulnerability, the Organisation took prompt\nactions to identify instances of Log4J vulnerabilities across all the software\napplication it was using. The Organisation started identifying instances of Log4J\nvulnerabilities across its systems on 14 December 2021. It applied the security\npatches immediately when they were made available by the respective software\nvendors. The Organisation also implemented workarounds recommended by\nthe vendors, for systems which patches were not available or had not been\nreleased. Additional measures such as blocking incoming and outgoing Log4J\ntraffic were also taken.\n2\n\n\f6. We are satisfied that the Organisation had made reasonable security\narrangements to protect personal data in its possession and/or control in\nrelation to the Incident. The Organisation had in fact adopted good practices in\nrelation to its Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems. This\nincluded a cybersecurity testing programme, regular vulnerability assessment\nand penetration testing, and cyber security monitoring.\n\n7. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection is\nsatisfied that the Organisation had met its Protection Obligation under section\n24 of the PDPA. No enforcement action therefore needs to be taken in relation\nto the Incident.\n\nThe following provision(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in\nthe above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal\nor similar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\n3\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $62,400 was imposed on Eatigo International for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect users' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Accommodation and F&B"],"date":"2023-03-10","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_Eatigo-International-Pte-Ltd_211222.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Eatigo International","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/03/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-eatigo-international","timestamp":"2023-03-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 9\n\nCase No. DP-2010-B7267\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nEatigo International Pte.

Ltd.\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2010-B7267\n\n21 December 2022\nIntroduction\n1.\n\nFor an organisation to effectively safeguard the personal data in its possession or\n\ncontrol, it must first know what its personal data assets are. The surest way to ensure such\nvisibility is to maintain a comprehensive personal data asset inventory. This case is, amongst\nother things, a cautionary tale of the consequences of not maintaining a proper personal data\nasset inventory.\n\n2.\n\nOn 29 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nwas notified by a third party about a possible data leak by Eatigo International Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”). A cache of personal data that was suspected to be from the Organisation’s\ndatabase was being offered for sale on an online forum (the “Incident”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n3.\n\nThe Organisation provides an online restaurant reservation platform which offers\n\nincentives such as discounts to its users. In its daily operations, it regularly collects and\nprocesses the personal data of its users in order to facilitate restaurant reservations and the\nprovision of incentives.\n\n4.\n\nAfter the Commission was notified of the Incident, it informed the Organisation on 30\n\nOctober 2020 of an online forum purportedly selling the personal data from various ecommerce\nwebsites, including a database containing personal data that were suspected to have been\nobtained from the Organisation. Separately, the Organisation was also notified of the Incident\nPage 2 of 22\n\n\fon the same day by a user and a Channel News Asia journalist. The Organisation proceeded to\ncarry out investigations.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation’s investigations revealed that the personal data for sale on the online\n\nforum did not match any current databases in use by the Organisation at the time of the Incident,\nbut matched the structure of a legacy database which contained user data as of late 2018, when\nthe database was last updated (the “Affected Database”). The Affected Database was hosted\non the infrastructure of a Cloud Service Provider located in Singapore, and was previously in\nuse by the Organisation until 2018. Thereafter, the Organisation migrated to its current online\nplatform, which entailed a complete redevelopment of data storage and infrastructure. Whilst\nthe Organisation did not intend to continue to utilise the personal data contained in the Affected\nDatabase, it was nevertheless retained to support the migration of data to the new platform.\nAfter the migration, the Affected Database was not included in the Organisation’s Virtual\nPrivate Network (“VPN”) infrastructure. Unfortunately, as the Organisation transitioned to the\ncurrent engineering team, knowledge of the Affected Database was lost.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation was unable to ascertain exactly when the threat actor gained\n\nunauthorised access to the Affected Database. However, since the Affected Database was last\nupdated in late 2018, the Incident was likely to have occurred some time between 2018 and\n2020 (when the Affected Database was put up for sale on an online forum). Investigations\nrevealed the following:\n\n(a)\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Affected Database was accessible from the internet and\naccessible by anyone who had the requisite credentials;\n\n(b)\n\nNone of the Organisation’s employees at the material time had knowledge of the\nAffected Database or possessed the credentials to access the Affected Database;\n\nPage 3 of 22\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe databases inside the Cloud Service Provider’s Relational Database Services\n(“RDS”) were intended to have randomly generated alphanumeric passwords of a\nminimum 13-character length. However, there had been no such password rotation rules\nimplemented for the Affected Database;\n\n(d)\n\nThere was no security review conducted on the protection provided to the personal data\ncontained in the Affected Database;\n\n(e)\n\nThere was no system in place to monitor the exfiltration of large volumes of data from\nthe Affected Database; and\n\n(f)\n\nNo personal data asset inventory or access logs were maintained, and the Organisation\nwas unable to establish how or when the threat actor gained unauthorised access to the\nAffected Database.\n\n7.\n\nThe Affected Database held the personal data of approximately 2.76 million of the\n\nOrganisation’s users. Because the Organisation had effectively lost track of a database of that\nsize, network security and access control measures deployed by the Organisation were not\napplied to the Affected Database.\n\n8.\n\nConsequently, the Affected Database was accessed and likely exfiltrated in the Incident\n\nand put up for sale on an online forum. A sample of 154 personal data sets were also posted on\nthe online forum. The types of personal data affected (the “Dataset”) were as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nEmail;\n\n(c)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(d)\n\nGender;\n\n(e)\n\nPasswords in MD5 Hash; and\n\nPage 4 of 22\n\n\f(f)\n\nFacebook ID number and tokens of around 10 users, which can provide access to the\nFacebook accounts of users and their accounts with the Organisation’s online platform.\n\n9.\n\nThe personal data of a total of 154 of the Organisation’s users were displayed in the\n\nforum post, and appeared to have been randomly selected from the Affected Database. As of\n13 November 2020, the post on the online forum no longer lists the Organisation’s personal\ndata for sale.\n\n10.\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the Organisation implemented, or has been in the\n\nprocess of implementing, the following remedial actions:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Affected Database was securely backed-up and then deleted;\n\n(b)\n\nAll databases were ensured to be accessible only inside VPN (i.e. no direct internet\naccess);\n\n(c)\n\nAll passwords to access databases were changed as of 30 October 2020;\n\n(d)\n\nAffected individuals were notified;\n\n(e)\n\nSecurity Settings on Systems Infrastructure were upgraded;\n\n(f)\n\nDifferent VPN for different categories of staff were created:\n\n(g)\n\nAccess security for data storages and cloud services was improved, including increasing\nthe password rotation and strengthening the password rules.\n\n(h)\n\nAll personal data in all non-production was anonymised;\n\n(i)\n\nThe logging and monitoring systems was reviewed to detect data access anomalies and\ntrace access;\n\n(j)\n\nAccess for external services used with the Organisation’s platform was reviewed;\n\n(k)\n\nPenetration Testing was conducted;\n\n(l)\n\nAll staff were updated on policies relating to network security, and subject to Data\nprotection and social engineering prevention training;\nPage 5 of 22\n\n\f(m)\n\nAll internal users in the Organisation’s cloud infrastructure and data storage were\nsubject to review;\n\n(n)\n\nAccess and error logging for all databases were added;\n\n(o)\n\nThe entire infrastructure, including which servers are currently inside vs. outside\ndemilitarized zone (DMZ), was subject to review; and\n\n(p)\n\nAccelerated implementation of recommendations of security audit completed by an\nexternal consultant in September 2020.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n11.\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigations centred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to protect personal data in its possession\nor under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (“the\nProtection Obligation”).\n\n12.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, it is determined that the Organisation failed to implement\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Affected Database from the risk of\nunauthorised access. This includes a failure to ensure that the Affected Dataset was properly\naccounted for in the Organisation’s personal data asset inventory, and a failure to implement\nreasonable data protection processes.\n\n13.\n\nIn determining what constitutes reasonable security steps or arrangements, an\n\norganisation should have regard to the nature of the personal data in its possession and control,\nas well as the impact that the disclosure of the data might have on the affected persons. As\n\nPage 6 of 22\n\n\fstated in the Commission’s Advisory on Key Concepts in the PDPA (the “Advisory”)1 at\n[17.2]:\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for organisations to comply with the Protection\nObligation. Each organisation should consider adopting security arrangements that are\nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, for example, taking into consideration\nthe nature of the personal data, the form in which the personal data has been\ncollected (e.g. physical or electronic) and the possible impact to the individual\nconcerned if an unauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the\npersonal data. For example, in the employment context, it would be reasonable to\nexpect a greater level of security for highly confidential employee appraisals as\ncompared to more general information about the projects an employee has worked on.”\n\n14.\n\nThe Affected Database contained personal data relating to approximately 2.76 million\n\nindividuals, encompassing personal data such as passwords, access IDs and Facebook tokens.\nGiven the high volume of personal data contained in the Affected Database, it was incumbent\non the Organisation to implement policies and practices to meet such security needs to\ndischarge its obligation under the Protection Obligation.\n\nLapses in managing of personal data asset inventory\n15.\n\nFor organisations with substantial personal data assets, the maintenance of an accurate\n\nand up-to-date personal data asset inventory is a pre-requisite for complying with the Protection\nObligation. The personal data asset inventory should catalogue all personal data assets in the\norganisation’s possession or control, so as to ensure that such personal data is covered by the\norganisation’s security measures. Maintaining such an inventory ensures that the organisation\n\n1\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 February 2021)\nPage 7 of 22\n\n\fretains the necessary institutional memory of the personal data assets that is or was previously\nunder its possession or control even if there is turnover of staff. Any significant lapse in an\norganisation’s inventory management and maintenance would impair the organisation’s ability\nto know whether the data protection processes it implemented are sufficient to cover all its\npersonal data assets.\n\n16.\n\nThis requirement to maintain a personal data asset inventory is not novel. As stated in\n\nRe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [13]:\n“In addition, it is important for an organisation to be aware of and track its\npersonal data assets. The creation and maintenance of a personal data asset\nregister (i.e. a record identifying all personal data in the organisation’s possession\nor control) is a good practice that would assist organisations to comply with the\nProtection Obligation. An up-to-date personal data asset register provides the\norganisation with an accurate record of all the personal data in its possession or\ncontrol, and enables the organisation to ensure its periodic security reviews covers\nthe personal data assets. It also enables the organisation to more effectively review\nthe implementation of its data protection policies, for example, the access control\nlist setting out the employees who have access to the IT systems the personal data asset\nis stored in, whether the internal business owner of the personal data asset has reviewed\nit for data quality issues, and initiating the process for disposing personal data that have\nreached the end of its life cycle within the organisation.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n17.\n\nSimilarly, it was stated in Re Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15 at [15]:\n\nPage 8 of 22\n\n\f“From the Appointed Day, the Organisation’s failure to take any reasonable steps to\nensure sufficient obligations are imposed on the Vendor (when developing and\ntroubleshooting the CMS, Membership Portal and Virtual Cards) to protect the\nMembers Data was a breach of its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA. A period\nof about five years had elapsed since 2 July 2014 to 2 July 2019. The Organisation, as\nowner of the CMS, should have included it as part of its personal data asset\ninventory and ensured that its data protection policies covered personal data held\nin the CMS. Had this been done, the Organisation would have identified these gaps\nin the business requirements for the CMS, which would have set it down the path\nto rectifying these gaps through one or both of the options discussed in the\npreceding paragraph. The Organisation, as owner of the CMS, is responsible for\nidentifying the omission and articulating its business requirements relating to the\nprotection of personal data stored in the CMS. This would have led to action by the\nVendor in recommending technical fixes to enhance the CMS. It is the failure to identify\nthe omission and articulate business requirements, and for a not-trivial period of five\nyears, that is the gravamen of the Organisation’s breach of the PDPA.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n18.\n\nIn this connection, the Commission’s Guide to Developing a Data Management\n\nProgramme (the “Guide”) states that an organisation should establish a personal data asset\ninventory as part of Data Protection Impact Assessment (“DPIA”), and sets out the information\nthat should be recorded by the organisation at pages 13 and 23:\n“By conducting a DPIA, an organisation would be in a better position to assess if the\nhandling of personal data complies with the PDPA or data protection best practices,\nand to implement appropriate policy, technical or process measures. For more\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\n\finformation on the DPIA, please refer to the Guide to Data Protection Impact\nAssessments.\n\nAs part of a DPIA, it is recommended to establish a data inventory (see Data\nInventory Maps, Data Flow Diagrams and Other Registers on page 23) and classify the\nrisk level of the data in the context that it is collected, used and disclosed\nthroughout the data life cycle, from creation, distribution, storage, to disposal.\nThis may be mapped onto a risk matrix for assessment and implementation of\nappropriate control for the identified risk levels.\n\n...\nData Inventory Maps, Data Flow Diagrams and Other Registers\n\nKnown risks should be managed through a good understanding of the life cycle and\nflow of personal data in your organisation. This can be done through documenting the\npersonal data handled using diagrams and charts such as data inventory maps or data\nflow diagrams, as illustrated in Annex C.\n\nThe data inventory map and data flow diagram should also include information\non the business purposes for collection, use and disclosure of personal data, the\nindividuals and third parties who handle personal data under the organisation’s\npossession or control, as well as the classification of the data to manage user access.\nThey should also deal with when and how the organisation should dispose of or\nanonymise the personal data for long-term archival. As good practice, it is important\nthat employees and third parties access personal data on a need-to-know basis. Different\nsets of data may be accessed by different parties.”\n(emphasis added)\n\nPage 10 of 22\n\n\f19.\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation’s oversight in failing to maintain the Affected\n\nDatabase in its personal data asset inventory resulted in the omission to extend its extant\nsecurity arrangements to the Affected Database. This resulted in the following:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation did not maintain proper records of the Affected Database and was\nunable to locate documentation related to user permission for the Affected Database.\nThere was a dearth of records of the details of the data lifecycle of the personal data in\nthe Affected Database from collection to disposal.\n\n(b)\n\nAfter the re-development and migration of the Organisation’s online platform, the\nOrganisation did not conduct a proper handover of the Affected Database despite the\nturnover in staff. This led to the Organisation’s engineering team in 2020 having no\nknowledge of the existence of the Affected Database or its access credentials.\n\n(c)\n\nSince the Organisation lacked visibility of the Affected Database, it was omitted from\nthe Organisation’s periodic security review. The Organisation thus did not have the\nopportunity to assess whether the Affected Database needed to be retained, or whether\nits security arrangements should be updated. During the Commission’s investigations,\nthe Organisation indicated that the Affected Database should not have been retained\nfollowing the successful migration of the Organisation’s online platform in 2018. It\nstands to reason that if the Organisation had covered the Affected Database in its\nperiodic security reviews and assessed that it should be deleted, the Incident could have\nbeen prevented.\n\n(d)\n\nSince the Affected Database was effectively forgotten about, the Organisation also did\nnot put in place any systems to monitor the exfiltration of data from the Affected\nDatabase, thus impeding its ability to react swiftly to mitigate the effects of the Incident.\nPage 11 of 22\n\n\f20.\n\nThe Organisation’s negligence in this regard left an internet-accessible database\n\ncontaining the personal data of approximately 2.76 million individuals (i.e. the Affected\nDatabase) outside its data protection architecture, creating a clear vulnerability that was\nexploited by threat actors.\n\n21.\n\nThe Organisation’s poor knowledge management often led to it providing inconsistent,\n\nextraneous and dilatory responses to the Commission’s notices to produce specified\ninformation and documents (“NTPs”) relating to the Organisation’s access models, causing the\nCommission to expend substantial time and resources to seek various rounds of clarifications\nwith the Organisation. This includes, but is not limited to, the following responses to the\nCommission’s NTPs:\n\n(a)\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Organisation stated that the Affected Database was only\naccessible through VPN via certificates. After the Commission sought further\nclarifications, the Organisation stated on 14 December 2020 that it was in fact not\nincluded in the Organisation’s VPN structure;\n\n(b)\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Organisation stated that only 14 users had VPN access, but\nsubsequently stated on 14 December 2020 that a total of 29 users with access without\nVPN; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation also gave conflicting information about its password policies\nregarding the Affected Database. On 16 November 2020, it purported to have put in\nplace a password policy for the Affected Database prior to the Incident. However, on\n10 February 2021, it indicated that no specifically predefined password rules applied to\nthe Affected Database. On 4 March 2021, after further clarifications were sought, the\nOrganisation stated that it no longer had the username and password for the Affected\n\nPage 12 of 22\n\n\fDatabase, and that nobody from its engineering team had any knowledge of the\nusername and password.\nOther lapses in the Organisation’s data protection policies and processes\n22.\n\nBesides failing to adequately maintain its personal data asset inventory, investigations\n\nalso revealed other lapses and shortcomings in the Organisation’s data protection policies and\nprocesses. As referenced in paragraph 18, the Guide states that by establishing a personal data\nasset inventory as part of an organisation’s DPIA, it would be better positioned to assess if the\nhandling of personal data complies with the PDPA or data protection best practices, and to\nimplement appropriate policy, technical or process measures. In this regard, aside from its\nlapses in its management of its personal data asset inventory, the Organisation also did not\nimplement some other basic data protection processes.\n\n23.\n\nFirst, organisations that have a high volume of personal data within their possession\n\nand / or control should implement sufficiently robust processes to protect personal data through\nreasonable security monitoring. This ensures that organisations have sufficient situational\nawareness of its network security, enabling it to react timeously to data breaches. This step is\nembedded into the responsibilities of a data protection officer, as stated in the Advisory at\n[21.4]:\n“An organisation’s DPO plays an essential role in how the organisation meets its\nobligations under the PDPA. The responsibilities of the DPO often include working\nwith senior management and the organisation’s business units to develop and\nimplement appropriate data protection policies and practices for the organisation. In\naddition, the DPO would undertake a wide range of activities, which may include\nproducing (or guiding the production of) a personal data inventory, conducting data\nprotection impact assessments, monitoring and reporting data protection risks,\nPage 13 of 22\n\n\fproviding internal training on data protection compliance, engaging with stakeholders\non data protection matters and generally acting as the primary internal expert on data\nprotection.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n24.\n\nExamples of such security monitoring measures are provided in the Commission’s\n\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium at [4.1(j)] and [9.1] applicable at the\nmaterial time2:\n“Conduct periodic checks for personal data stored in ICT systems. For personal\ndata that is not required in any form anymore, securely dispose the data (refer to\nsection 8). If there is a need to retain the data but not in identifiable form, e.g. for\nperforming data analytics, consider anonymising the data.\n….\nComputer networks allow communication between computers and devices that are\nconnected to them. Internal corporate computer networks may be connected to external\nnetworks, such as the Internet. It is important for an organisation to ensure that its\ncorporate computer networks are secure. Vulnerabilities in the network may allow\ncyber intrusion, which may lead to theft or unauthorised use of electronic personal data.\nDefences that may be used to improve the security of networks include:\n•\n\nIntrusion prevention systems (“IPS”) - a device or software application that\nmonitors network or system activities and prevents malicious activities or\npolicy violations;\n\n2\n\nThe guide has been replaced by the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems (updated 14\nSeptember 2021), which recommends similar security monitoring measures at pages 10 and 17.\nPage 14 of 22\n\n\f•\n\nIntrusion detection systems (“IDS”) – a network security appliance that monitors\nnetwork and system activities for malicious activities and may raise alerts upon\ndetecting unusual activities;\n\n•\n\nSecurity devices that prevent the unauthorised transfer of data out from a computer\nor network;\n\n•\n\nFirewalls; and\n\n•\n\nWeb proxies, anti-virus and anti-spyware software.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n25.\n\nIn this case, the high volume of personal data in the Affected Database necessitated a\n\nhigher level of security awareness through robust security monitoring. However, the\nOrganisation’s monitoring system extended only to performance and latency monitoring. The\nOrganisation did not implement security monitoring for exfiltration of sizeable volumes of data\nbased on pre-set limits. Given the considerable volume of personal data in the Organisation’s\npossession and / or control, including the personal data of the approximately 2.76 million\nindividuals contained in the Affected Database, this is a reasonable security arrangement that\nthe Organisation should have implemented.\n\n26.\n\nSecond, given the volume of personal data under the Organisation’s possession and /\n\nor control, the Organisation also should carry out periodic security audits which should include\na reasonable vulnerability assessment of its IT infrastructure. This would entail the discovery\nand mapping of all parts of the Organisation’s network, including the Affected Database. If\nthis had been carried out, it might have led to the re-discovery of the Affected Database, which\nwould have allowed the Organisation to take the necessary steps to either improve the security\nof the Affected Database or delete it entirely. However, based on the Commission’s\n\nPage 15 of 22\n\n\finvestigations, the Organisation conducted no such security audits in relation to the Affected\nDatabase.\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n27.\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation under\n\nsection 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\nconsidered, with particular emphasis on the following factors:\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had implemented the remedial measures set out in paragraph\n10 swiftly to address the Incident.\n\nAggravating Factors\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was grossly negligent in its failure to keep proper records or\ndocumentation of the Affected Database and to effect a proper handover to new\nemployees vis-à-vis the Affected Database. Most egregiously, there was no\ninstitutional memory amongst the Organisation’s employees of the Affected\nDatabase by late 2020, or of the access credentials.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation had left the Affected Database exposed to a risk of\nunauthorised access and exfiltration for a protracted period of time, from\nOctober 2018 to late 2020.\n\n(d)\n\nAs stated in paragraph [21], the Organisation’s dilatory responses to the\nCommission’s NTPs resulted in delays in the investigations.\n\nPage 16 of 22\n\n\f28.\n\nAdditionally, the Organisation also impeded the Commission’s investigations by\n\nresponding in an uncooperative and evasive manner to the Commission’s NTPs:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation objected to the Commission’s request for information about the\naccess models implemented for current production databases, giving the excuse that it\nmight create “additional security risks”; and\n\n(b)\n\nSimilarly, objecting to provide information regarding access to the Affected Database,\nciting the reason that this was against their policy and might create “additional security\nrisks” even though the Affected Database had already been deleted on 3 November\n2020.\n\n29.\n\nOrganisations that are uncooperative and that throw up objections will only prolong\n\ninvestigations. The Commission will not be deterred by such tactics. If, as is possible in this\ncase, the Organisation did not have the information or needed more time to recover the\ninformation, honesty is the best policy. Hiding behind vague notions like “additional security\nrisks” without providing details can and will be interpreted as cavalier and obstructive, and will\nbe taken as an aggravating factor when the eventual outcome is determined.\n\n30.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Commission made a preliminary decision to impose a\n\nfinancial penalty on the Organisation for its breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\n31.\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s\n\nletter dated 26 November 2021 and was invited to make representations. On 10 December\n2021, the Organisation made the following representations to the Commission urging the\nCommission to impose a warning in lieu of a financial penalty, or to reduce the financial\npenalty to be imposed:\nPage 17 of 22\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Organisation had not intended to frustrate the Commission’s investigation.\n\nInstead, the Organisation’s internal investigations and responses to the Commission’s\nNTPs were hampered due to diminished corporate knowledge of the Affected Database\nat the material time and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its management and\noperations. In support, the Organisation stated that:\ni. On July 2018, the Organisation’s former Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”)\nresigned, with the various back-end engineers that he recruited following suit.\nConsequently, the new CTO and team of back-end engineers lacked corporate\nmemory and had no knowledge of the Affected Database;\nii. The internal investigations on the Incident were hampered by turbulence in the\nCompany's organisation during the Covid-19 pandemic, and despite the steps\ntaken to maintain system documentation, the Affected Database was not\nuncovered; and\niii. The conduct cited in [21] and [28] above stemmed from a misunderstanding of\nthe Commission’s queries and the new CTO, being from a different cultural\nbackground, being reluctant to provide sensitive data to the Commission;\n(b)\n\nThe contemplated financial penalty in the preliminary decision would be\n\ncrushing on the Organisation and would likely lead to financial distress and the closure\nof its business. As the Organisation operates in the food and beverages industry, its\nbusiness suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic and left it in a risky financial position\nfrom which is it has yet to recover from. Any financial penalty imposed would\nadversely affect the Organisation’s business, and deter any further investors or lenders\nfrom providing any further loans or investments to the Organisation; and\n\nPage 18 of 22\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe impact of the Incident was limited. The Organisation raised the following\n\npoints in support:\ni. The Organisation did not collect NRIC numbers, birth dates and sensitive\nfinancial data such as credit card information. The login passwords that were\ncollected were encrypted using MD5 Hash ;\nii. As of 10 December 2021, the Company received less than 100 requests from\nusers to delete their accounts following the Incident; and\niii. The online forum post initially offering personal data from the Affected\nDatabase for sale appears to have been taken down as of 13 November 2020.\nDiminished corporate knowledge and conduct during the Commission’s investigations\n\n32.\n\nThe Organisation’s representations in [31(a)] do not merit a waiver or reduction in the\n\nfinancial penalty imposed. Staff turnover is no excuse for a lack of corporate knowledge, and\nit is incumbent on organisations to take reasonable steps to bolster institutional memory to\nmanage any security risks arising thereof. This includes the implementation of practices such\nas the maintenance of a personal data asset inventory as detailed in [16] to [18], which would\nhave enabled it to conduct proper handovers to new staff.\n\n33.\n\nAs for the difficulties experienced by the Organisation during its own internal\n\ninvestigations and any misunderstandings it may have had in relation to the Commission’s\nNTPs, it should have been candid with the Commission about its difficulties and sought\nclarifications and extensions of time to respond to the NTPs. Instead, its lack of transparency\nduring the investigation stage caused the Commission to expend substantial time and resources\nin engaging the Organisation. In its representations, the Organisation has also admitted that it\n\nPage 19 of 22\n\n\fshould have substantiated its position during the NTP stage to avoid giving the Commission\nthe impression that it was being uncooperative and evasive.\n\nLikely impact of a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\n34.\n\nOne of the considerations in the imposition of a financial penalty is the likely impact of\n\nthe imposition of such penalty on an organisation, including the ability of the organisation to\ncontinue its usual activities: see section 48J(6)(i). When determining the appropriate financial\npenalty, the Commission has consistently considered the financial circumstances of the\norganisation or person involved, bearing in mind that financial penalties imposed should avoid\nimposing a crushing burden or cause undue hardship on the organisation or person3.\n\n35.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Commission accepts the Organisation’s representation\n\nat [31(b)] that the imposition of the financial penalty proposed would likely lead to financial\ndistress and the closure of its business. However, a mere warning is inappropriate in view of\nthe egregiousness of the Organisation’s breach of the PDPA and the impact of the Incident.\nHence, the imposition of a reduced financial penalty, to be paid out in instalments, would be\nmore proportionate and appropriate in ensuring the Organisation’s compliance with the PDPA.\n\n36.\n\nIn arriving at its decision, the Commission had regard for the following factors\n\nconcerning the Organisation’s financial situation, and the likely impact that the proposed\nfinancial penalty in the preliminary decision would have on it:\n(a)\n\nIn the Organisation’s audited financial statements for the financial year ending\n\n31 December 2020, its independent auditor stated that there was significant doubt on\n\n3\n\nRe Jigyasa [2021] SGPDPCR 1; Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11; and Neo Yong Xiang (trading as\nYoshi Mobile) [2021 SGPDPC 12\nPage 20 of 22\n\n\fthe ability of the Organisation to continue as a going concern and to realise its assets\nand discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation’s monthly income statements from 2021 indicated that it was\n\nincurring heavy net losses on a month-to-month basis (with the exception of one\nmonth); and\n(c)\n\n37.\n\nThe Organisation had various substantial short-term loans due in the near future.\n\nThe above evinces a clear picture of an organisation in a parlous financial situation\n\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with various debts and liability (some incurred to keep\nthe business afloat) coming due in the near future. In view of this situation, the Commission\nshall refrain from imposing a financial penalty that might push the Organisation’s business\neven closer to the brink.\n\nImpact of the Incident\n\n38.\n\nThe Commission had already taken into account the impact of the Incident when\n\ncalibrating the financial penalty in the preliminary decision. At the same time, the Commission\nalso took into consideration the fact that the Affected Database contained the personal data of\na very high number (2.76 million) of individuals, which necessitated the implementation of\nmore robust security measures by the Organisation. The impact of the Incident should not be\nminimised, and the financial penalty imposed should reflect this.\n\nAcceptance of the Commission’s findings\n\n39.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission notes that the Organisation voluntarily accepted the\n\nCommission’s findings in the preliminary decision that it had failed to comply with the\nProtection Obligation and explicitly indicated that it would not seek to challenge these findings.\nPage 21 of 22\n\n\fThe Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of liability (even at this late stage) ought to be\nreflected in the financial penalty. Had the Organisation accepted responsibility for the Incident\nat an earlier stage of the investigation, it could have significantly shortened the time for\ninvestigations and resolution of this case through the expedited breach procedure and also\nbenefited from greater mitigatory considerations. Nonetheless, an organisation that voluntarily\naccepts responsibility for its non-compliance with the PDPA should be recognised as an\norganisation that demonstrates its commitment to the Accountability Obligation and shows that\nit can be responsible for the personal data in its possession or under its control4: see [46] of\nFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 6.\n\n40.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case including the representations\n\nmade by the Organisation, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of $62,400 in 12 monthly instalments by the due dates as set out in the notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n41.\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no further\n\ndirections need be issued to the Organisation\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n4 Refer to section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 22 of 22\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to CPR Vision Management Pte Ltd to conduct a security audit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the protection of personal data in its possession or control and rectify any security gaps identified in the audit report.

The Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received data\nbreach notification reports from (i) L’Oreal Singapore Pte Ltd (“L’Oreal”) on 29\nOctober 2021 and (ii) L’Occitane Singapore Pte Ltd (“L’Occitane”) on 1 November\n2021 respectively of a ransomware attack on their customer relationship\nmanagement (“CRM”) system vendor, CPR Vision Management Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”). The Organisation is a data intermediary that helped to process\npersonal data collected by L’Oreal and L’Occitane.\n\n2. The ransomware attack affected a server and three network attached storage\n(“NAS”) devices in the Organisation’s office (“office network”), and led to the\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\fencryption of the personal data belonging to 83,640 L’Occitane’s customers and\n35,079 L’Oreal’s customers, which included their name, address, email address,\nmobile number, NRIC number, date of birth, age, gender, race, nationality, loyalty\npoints and amount spent.\n\n3. The Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. It also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24\nand the Retention Limitation Obligation under Section 25 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n4. The Organisation’s internal investigations found the threat actor had first gained\naccess to the office network via a compromised user account VPN connection on\n13 October 2021 before executing the ransomware attack on or about 15 October\n2021. However, due to the limited data logs available on the Organisation’s\nFortiGate firewall and VPN appliance, the Organisation was not able to determine\nhow the threat actor gained access to the compromised user account VPN. As part\nof the immediate remediation efforts, the Organisation reset the credentials of the\ncompromised user account VPN and the password credentials of all VPN accounts\nacross the Organisation.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\f5. The Organisation admitted that its endpoint security solution would have been able\nto detect and block the unauthorised entry attempts to the office network affected\nin the Incident. However, the Organisation failed to extend the deployment of this\nprotection solution to the affected office network. This could have been because\nthe domain controller server within the affected office network had been earmarked\nto be decommissioned after the data was copied to MS365 Sharepoint. Another\nreason for the omission may have been the fact that the Organisation set up the\naffected office network for business continuity purposes, when it shifted to its new\npremises, sometime between 6 – 9 April 2020, on the eve of the nation-wide\nCOVID-19 circuit breaker in Singapore.\n\n6. The Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation as it\nfailed to have reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal\ndata in its possession and control. As a CRM system vendor, the Organisation\nprocesses and processed a high volume of web traffic containing personal data on\nbehalf of many e-commerce retailers, including L’Oreal and L’Occitane, and would\nordinarily be held to a higher standard. The Organisation’s omission to deploy its\nendpoint security solution to the affected office network suggests that the\nOrganisation failed to maintain an inventory of its data assets.\n\n7. Even if there were extenuating circumstances in April 2020 which could have partly\nexcused the Organisation’s omission to include the affected office network in its\ndata inventory, it was inexcusable for the Organisation to let this state of affairs\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\fpersist for more than one and-a-half years, from April 2020 until October 2021. We\nshould add however, that as part of its remediation efforts, the Organisation has\nsince ensured that its endpoint security solution was deployed to all office and enduser devices.\n\n8. The Organisation also admitted to being in breach of the Retention Limitation\nObligation. The Organisation admitted that the affected personal data in the\nIncident had been legacy content, which should have been deleted together with\nthe domain controller server earmarked for decommissioning, and for which no\nbusiness or legal purpose existed for retention. The Organisation highlighted\nhowever, that this lapse was not in accordance with its own data retention policy.\nHad the Organisation complied with the Retention Limitation Obligation and\ndeleted the personal data in question, the Incident would not have amounted to a\nbreach of the Retention Limitation Obligation under the PDPA.\n9. In the course of our investigations, L’Oreal furnished documentary evidence which\nshowed that L’Oreal had specifically instructed the Organisation, pursuant to its\ndata retention policies, to delete the affected personal data on 26 March 2021. This\nwas duly acknowledged by the Organisation, and the Organisation furnished a\npurported Certificate of Destruction dated 17 May 2021 stating that the personal\ndata had been deleted on 6 May 2021.\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\f10. Similarly, L’Occitane also raised its concerns that the Organisation failed to seek\nits prior written consent before duplicating the personal data to other nonproduction environments.\n11. The Commission is satisfied that neither L’Oreal nor L’Occitane had any knowledge\nof the retention and storage of the legacy personal data by the Organisation on the\naffected NAS device; and neither had any control over the NAS device used by the\nOrganisation to store the personal data affected by the ransomware attack. Both\nL’Oreal and L’Occitane had also adequately provided in their contracts with the\nOrganisation to ensure compliance with the Protection and Retention Limitation\nObligations under the PDPA. The Commission is therefore of the view that despite\nthe personal data breach incident, L’Oreal and L’Occitane had acted consistently\nwith and complied with the relevant obligations under the PDPA.\n12. Having considered the circumstances set out above, including the Organisation’s\nupfront admission of liability, and the fact that data analysis conducted by the data\nsecurity team of the Organisation’s parent company did not uncover any evidence\nto suggest that data exfiltration or modification had occurred, the Commission\nconsidered that it would be most appropriate in lieu of imposing a financial penalty,\nto direct the Organisation to comply with the following action:\na. Conduct a thorough security audit (with report) of its technical and\nadministrative arrangements for the protection of personal data in its possession\nor control;\nb. Rectify any security gaps identified in the security audit report;\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\fc. Conduct a comprehensive review of all of the Organisation’s databases\ncontaining personal data to ensure full compliance with the Retention Limitation\nObligation under Section 25 PDPA;\nd.

The Warehouses were regularly\nvisited by suppliers delivering goods and produce (“Visitors”), and the Organisation\nimplemented measures to regulate such Visitors’ access to the Warehouses. Security\ncheckpoints at the Warehouses used an Organisation-issued tablet computer\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\f(“Tablet”) to take photographs of Visitors’ NRIC or other identification documents (“ID\nPhotographs”). The Organisation said it collected ID Photographs to Visitors seeking\naccess to areas where food safety risks had to be managed. The Organisation\nexplained that these measures are intended to deter acts that could compromise food\nsafety and facilitate investigations of food safety incidents.\n\n3\n\nPrior to the Incident, there were no notices at the Warehouses’ security\n\ncheckpoints informing Visitors of the purpose for collection of ID Photographs. After\nbeing notified by the Commission of the Incident, the Organisation put up notices at\nthe Warehouses’ security checkpoints to inform Visitors of the purpose of collection of\nID Photographs.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n4\n\nConsidering that the Tablets remained in the possession of the Organisation’s\n\nsecurity team at all times, and that there was no evidence of misuse of the ID\nPhotographs collected, the impact of the Incident was limited. Having collected the ID\nPhotographs, the Organisation is obliged to protect these and associated personal\ndata to a standard commensurate to the risks that unauthorised access, use or\ndisclosure might pose to respective individuals. The nub of the issue in this case is the\nlegal basis upon which these ID Photographs were collected. The Organisation could\nhave relied on two possible grounds.\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\f5\n\nFirst, Visitors may have volunteered their IDs to be photographed on request.\n\nHowever, the Organisation’s failure to inform Visitors of the purpose for collecting the\nID Photographs was contrary to sections 14(1)(a) and 18(b) of the PDPA read with\nsection 20. Further, the collection of a photographic image of their IDs was a condition\nfor entry. Visitors enter the Warehouses to make deliveries as part of their employment\nor business. It is not a product or service that they chose to access, as contemplated\nby section 14(2)(a) of the PDPA. Hence, even if the requirement of notification of\npurpose had been met, this is not a situation where persons making deliveries as part\nof their employment or business could be said to have consented to allowing a\nphotographic image of the IDs to be taken as a condition for a product or service\nprovided by the Organisation which such persons wanted access to. Consent is not\nthe most appropriate basis for collection and use of the ID Photographs. Accordingly,\nthe Organisation did not obtain valid consent from the Visitors for collecting the ID\nPhotographs, and would have breached section 13 of the PDPA if this ground was\nrelied on.\n\n6\n\nThere was an alternate ground available to the Organisation. The purpose of\n\npublic food hygiene and safety, cited by the Organisation in the present case, is a\nlegitimate interest of the Organisation, and also of its business partners and ultimately,\nconsumers. Ensuring good public hygiene and safety benefits all downstream food\nand beverage businesses, supermarkets and diners who eventually consume food\nthat was stored in the Warehouses. The Organisation may therefore rely on the\nexception at Paragraph 1, Part 3 of the First Schedule of the PDPA (“Legitimate\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\fInterests Exception”) to collect the ID Photographs without Visitors’ consent. The\nLegitimate Interests Exception was introduced in the PDPA effective 1 February 2021,\nand could have been invoked by the Organisation any time after this date.\n\n7\n\nTo rely on the Legitimate Interests Exception, prior to collecting the ID\n\nPhotographs, the Organisation would have had to conduct and document an\nassessment determining whether the Organisation’s interests in collecting the ID\nPhotographs outweighed the adverse effect to Visitors. For any adverse effects\nidentified, the Organisation would have had to implement reasonable measures to\neliminate, mitigate or reduce the likelihood of occurrence. The Organisation would also\nhave had to provide Visitors with reasonable access to information about the\nOrganisation’s collection of the ID Photographs, which could have been done by way\nof disclosure in the Organisation’s public data protection policy.\n\n8\n\nThe Commission accepts that the Organisation implemented access controls to\n\nregulate how the ID Photographs were collected and stored, which in turn reduced the\nrisk of misuse of the ID Photographs. Notwithstanding, based on the reasons provided\nby the Organisation, the collection had been solely or primarily to deter acts that could\ncompromise food safety and facilitate investigations into food safety incidents. The\ncollected ID Photographs contained full NRIC / ID numbers together with other\npersonal information that, in combination, had identified Visitors to a high degree of\nfidelity. The Commission noted that the collection of ID Photographs or full NRIC\nnumbers had not been required by law in this case, and it is incumbent on the\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fOrganisation to justify why the collection of ID Photographs had been a reasonable\npractice in these circumstances.\n\nThe Commission’s Preliminary Decision\n\n9\n\nIn view of the above, bearing in mind that the Organisation had taken some steps\n\nto remediate the Incident, the Commission’s preliminary decision was to give the\nfollowing directions to the Organisation:\n\n(a)\n\nTo within 60 days of this decision, conduct and document an assessment to:\n\n(i)\n\nevaluate whether the collection of ID Photographs from Visitors is\nreasonably necessary for the Organisation’s interests in deterring and\ninvestigating security incidents at the Warehouses.\n\n(ii)\n\nIf the Organisation intends to rely on the Legitimate Interests Exception for\nsuch collection, to:\n\n(A)\n\nidentify whether the Organisation’s collection of ID Photographs (or\nother personal data) from Visitors is likely to have an adverse effect\non Visitors;\n\n(B)\n\nidentify reasonable measures that could be implemented to eliminate,\nmitigate, or reduce the likelihood of such adverse effects occurring;\nand\n\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\f(C) determine whether the Organisation’s interest in collecting the ID\nPhotographs (or other personal data) outweighs the adverse effect to\nVisitors (if any) after the above measures are implemented.\n\n(iii)\n\nIf the Organisation does not intend to rely on the Legitimate Interests\nException, to identify the basis under which the Organisation intends to\ncollect the ID Photos (or other personal data) from Visitors, and to\nimplement the necessary policies and processes for such collection to be\nin compliance with the PDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nTo provide the Commission with a copy of the Organisation’s above assessment\nwithin 14 days of its completion.\n\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n\n10\n\nThe Commission’s preliminary decision was communicated to the Organisation\n\non 8 July 2022. On 22 July 2022, the Commission received representations from the\nOrganisation in respect of the preliminary decision. The Organisation claimed that it\nhad complied with the PDPA when collecting ID Photographs from Visitors, on the\nfollowing bases:\n\n(a)\n\nIt was in the national interest to collect ID Photographs in order to establish the\nidentities of Visitors to a high fidelity and deter potential food security incidents\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\fat the Warehouses, an exception to the obligation to obtain consent pursuant to\nParagraph 2, Part 2 of First Schedule to the PDPA (“National Interest\nException”);\n(b)\n\nThe collection of ID Photographs was necessary to facilitate investigations into\nfood security incidents at the Warehouses, an exception to the obligation to\nobtain consent pursuant to Paragraph 3, Part 3 of First Schedule to the PDPA\n(“Investigations Exception”); and/or\n\n(c)\n\nThere was deemed consent from Visitors for collection of the ID Photographs, as\nthese were volunteered, and collected for the reasonable purposes as part of\nefforts to ensure food security (pursuant to section 15 of the PDPA).\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation’s representations are not accepted:\n\n(a)\n\nThe National Interest Exception does not apply. The Organisation’s food security\nconcerns, while valid, are limited to its own Warehouses and are not at the level\nof the “national defence or “national security” concerns contemplated by the\ndefinition of “national interest” at section 2 of the PDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Investigations Exception does not apply. In order to rely on the Investigations\nException, the collection of personal data must be for the purpose of an ongoing\ninvestigation and cannot be for a hypothetical future investigation.\n\n(c)\n\nThere was no deemed consent from Visitors for the Organisation’s collection of\nthe ID Photographs. Visitors were not given a choice in the matter and cannot be\nsaid to have voluntarily provided their IDs as contemplated under section 15(1)\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\fof the PDPA. Further, it would not have been obvious to Visitors that fact that\nphotographic images of IDs would be taken and then stored.\n\n12\n\nInsofar as collection and use of ID Photographs from Visitors prior to 8 July 2022\n\nhad been on the bases cited by the Organisation above, the Commission finds that\nthe Organisation had not been in compliance with the PDPA.\n\nReliance on Legitimate Interests Exception\n\n13\n\nHowever, the Organisation also informed the Commission of its intention to rely\n\non the Legitimate Interests Exception as the basis for such collection going forward.\nTogether with its representations, the Organisation provided the Commission with a\ncopy of an internal assessment it had carried out on 22 July 2022 for its reliance on\nthe Legitimate Interests Exception going forward (“LIE Assessment”).\n\n14\n\nIn the LIE Assessment, the Organisation identified that there was a need to\n\nestablish and/or verify the identities of Visitors to the Warehouses to a high degree of\nfidelity, when they were entering areas of the Warehouses containing dry food and\nfresh produce that were susceptible to contamination and tampering. Collection of ID\nPhotographs served the legitimate interests of deterring and investigating potential\nfood security incidents, which could cause harm to the public and damage to the\nOrganisation’s reputation.\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\f15\n\nThe Organisation identified that its collection of the ID Photographs exposed\n\nVisitors to the risks of unauthorised use and disclosure of their personal data, and\ndetailed the measures it had implemented to eliminate or mitigate these adverse\neffects. These included:\n\n(a)\n\nlimiting collection of ID Photographs to only Visitors accessing areas of the\nWarehouses with higher risk of food security incidents;\n\n(b)\n\nrestricting access to the Tablets;\n\n(c)\n\nrestricting the application used to collect ID Photographs on the Tablets to only\nwork when connected to a dedicated Wi-Fi network at the Warehouses;\n\n(d)\n\nimmediately uploading the collected ID Photographs to the Organisation’s\nbackend server (and not storing them locally on the Tablets);\n\n(e)\n\nlimiting access to the ID Photographs (on the backend server) to the\nOrganisation’s DevOps team, and only when such access was on-site at the\nOrganisation’s offices and connected to its internal network; and\n\n(f)\n\nretaining the ID Photographs for a maximum of one year.\n\n16\n\nThe Organisation assessed the benefit in collecting the ID Photographs to be\n\n“significant” considering the potential harm that could be caused to the public by a food\ncontamination incident. The Organisation also assessed that its implementation of the\nabove measures rendered the “adverse impact from users” to be “low”. The\nOrganisation confirmed that it would notify Visitors of its reliance on the Legitimate\nInterests Exception by way of notices posted at the relevant security posts.\n\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f17\n\nThe Commission accepts that the Organisation’s interest in deterring food\n\nsecurity incidents at the Warehouses is legitimate. The Commission also accepts that\nthere may be a legitimate interest served in implementing enhanced identification\nrequirements to regulate access to high risk areas, and that the collection of ID\nPhotographs promote this interest. Most importantly, the Commission recognises that\nthe risks of unauthorised access, use and/or disclosure of the ID Photographs have\nbeen significantly lowered on account of the enhanced access controls implemented\nby the Organisation to protect the ID Photographs.\n\nThe Commission’s Decision\n\n18\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commission is satisfied that the Organisation has\n\nmet the requirements for reliance on the Legitimate Interests Exception in this case.\nAs the Organisation has already complied with the proposed direction (contemplated\nat [9] above) by carrying out the LIE Assessment to the Commission’s satisfaction, it\nis no longer necessary for the direction to be issued.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"No further action"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Thomson Medical to conduct scan of the web to ensure no publication of affected personal data online and to include in the review of its application deployment process, measures such as the arrangements for security testing and the implementation of data retention policy.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 26 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified that the Thomson Medical Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) Health Declaration Portal was not secure, enabling public\naccess to the personal data of visitors (the “Incident”) stored in a CSV (comma\nseparated values) file.\n\n2. Visitor data collected on the Organisation’s Health Declaration Portal had been\nstored concurrently in a publicly-accessible CSV file as well as a secured\n1\n\n\fdatabase from 16 April 2020, when the health declaration portal was first used\nby the Organisation to 8 September 2020, when the storage of the visitor data\nwas changed to only the secured database instead of the CSV file. The CSV\nfile was hosted on the Organisation’s web server.\n\n3. The Organisation admitted that, contrary to the instructions given to the\nemployee to switch the data storage from the CSV file to secured database\nexclusively, and the organisation’s protocols, its in-house developer had\nomitted to remove a software code, causing the visitor data to be stored in the\nCSV file and the same in-house developer had omitted to change the default\nweb server configuration, thereby allowing public access to the hosted CSV file.\nThe switch to storage in a secured database would have ensured access\ncontrols by requiring user login ID and secure password protection, as well as\nencryption of data transfers using SSL certificates. The access controls would\nensure that only authorized users would be able to access the data.\n\n4. The Commission’s investigations revealed that the affected CSV file contained\nthe personal data of 44,679 of the Organisation’s visitors, including the date\nand time of visit, temperature, type of visitor (purpose of visit), name of visitor,\nname of newborn, contact number, NRIC/FIN/passport number, doctor/clinic\nname or room visiting, and answers to a health declaration questionnaire (which\nincluded a declaration by the visitor that he/she did not have any symptoms or\nrecent exposure to the Covid-19 virus).\n2\n\n\f5. The Organisation accepted that it was in breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). The\nCommission finds that the Organisation had breached section 24 of the PDPA\nfor two reasons.\n\n6. First, even though the Organisation’s existing policies required the visitor data\ncollected to be stored in a secured database, the Organisation failed to ensure\nthat there were processes in place to ensure these policies and instructions\nwould be complied with. The Organisation stated that the in-house developer\nhad been the only staff in its IT department familiar with the programming\nlanguage used for the health declaration form. This, however, should not have\nprevented the Organisation, as an example, from requiring the in-house\ndeveloper to demonstrate to another staff member, and for that staff member\nto verify that the storage instructions had been complied with. As noted in Re\nAviva Ltd [2017] SPDPC 14, relying solely on individual employees to perform\ntheir tasks diligently, with no oversight or supervision, is not a reasonable\nsecurity arrangement.\n\n7. Second, the Organisation failed to conduct reasonable pre-launch testing\nbefore the Health Declaration Portal went live. While acceptance testing and\nsome technical tests were conducted, there had been no security testing to\nverify that there were access controls to the visitor data collected.\n3\n\n\f8. Having said that, it is a mitigating fact that the Organisation’s in-house\ndeveloper sought to comply with the Organisation’s policies and swiftly rectified\nthe software code on 8 September 2020, when he first discovered the coding\nerror whilst updating the health declaration questionnaire.\n\n9. The forensic investigator engaged by the Organisation did not uncover any\nevidence that the disclosed data had been exported and posted online,\nincluding on the Dark Web. The Organisation’s server logs also revealed that\nthe CSV file was only accessed 4 times from 3 different local IP addresses.\nGiven the timing of the access instances, it is probable that these instances\nwere made by the complainant and by the Commission when investigating this\nmatter, which suggests that the impact of this Incident was limited.\n\n10. The Commission noted a parallel between the facts of this case and Re Spear\nSecurity Force Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 12, in that both cases arose from a\nsingle complaint about a potential breach of the PDPA, with no other evidence\nsuggesting that the personal data had actually been exposed to unauthorised\nthird parties due to the lapses by the Organisation.\n\n11. The personal data exposed here included the clinic or room that the individual\nintended to visit, and the reason for the visit. This could be to seek treatment,\naccompany a patient, or a business visit made by a sales representative of a\npharmaceutical or medical device company. While the personal data exposed\n4\n\n\fincluded some health-related information, this had essentially been health\ndeclaration information for the purpose of containment of the pandemic. The\ninformation did not in fact reveal any potentially sensitive information such as\nwhether the visitor was Covid-19 positive.1\n\n12. The personal data disclosed is also not on par with Re Singapore Health\nServices Pte. Ltd.& Ors. [2019] SGPDPC 3 (“Singhealth”). In the Singhealth\ncase, we recognised the sensitivity involved in the exposure of the affected\nindividuals’ personal data in their “clinical episode information, clinical\ndocumentation, patient diagnosis and health issues and Dispensed Medication\nRecords” as the information and personal data affected may allow one to\ndeduce the condition for which a patient had sought treatment, and may lead\nto the unintended disclosure of serious or socially embarrassing illnesses.2\nWhile there is some personal data in the present case which may reveal the\nclinic which an affected individual had sought treatment, this is of a much more\nlimited scope as compared to the Singhealth case.\n\n13. The Commission accepted that the Organisation took prompt remedial action\nto contain the exposure. This include removing the affected CSV file and\nchanging all the passwords to the database, even though it was not affected by\nthe Incident. To prevent a recurrence of a similar incident, the Organisation also\n\n1\n\nCf Re Terra Systems Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 7.\n\n2 See Re Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd.& Ors. [2019] SGPDPC 3, at [139].\n\n5\n\n\freviewed its application deployment process to take into consideration data\nsecurity, and rectified all potential gaps discovered during a vulnerability scan.\n\n14. Given the lack of evidence suggesting that personal data had actually been\nexposed to unauthorised third parties due to the lapses by the Organisation and\nthe limited impact of the Incident, the Commission considered that it would be\nmost appropriate in lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to impose directions.\n\n15. Another factor which prompted the Commission to impose directions in lieu of\na financial penalty was the fact that at the material time, such health declaration\ninformation was widely collected across the island. There was also a\ncorresponding acceptance and support from members of the public of the need\nfor the collection of such health declaration information in order for the relevant\nauthorities to effectively respond to and control the potential spread of COVID19.\n\n16. Given the above, the Commission directs the Organisation to carry out the\nfollowing within 60 days:\n\na. In relation to the Organisation’s remedial action of reviewing its\napplication deployment process to take into consideration data security,\ni. The Organisation shall ensure that the intended measures\ninclude arrangements for reasonable pre-launch security testing\n6\n\n\fto be conducted before the launch of any new website,\napplication, portal or other online feature for the processing of\npersonal data; and\nii. The Organisation shall ensure that the intended measures\ninclude the development and implementation of a data retention\npolicy to meet the Retention Limitation Obligation under section\n25 of the PDPA.\n\nb. In relation to the Organisation’s remedial action of scanning the Dark\nWeb for evidence of exfiltration of the personal data,\ni. The Organisation shall conduct a scan of the Clear/Surface Web,\nas well as a renewed scan of the Dark Web to confirm that there\nis no evidence of publication of the affected personal data online.\n\nc.

API keys are in turn used to authenticate users seeking to access APIs. If an\norganisation fails to implement reasonable security measures to safeguard the security of their\nAPI keys, this may allow threat actors unauthorised access to large troves of data stored within\nmultiple interconnected environments.\n\n2\n\nOn 29 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”)\n\nwas notified that a database containing personal data of the customers of RedMart Limited (the\n“Organisation”) was being offered for sale on an online forum (the “Incident”). Subsequently,\nthe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether the circumstances relating to\nthe Incident disclosed any breaches by the Organisations of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation operated an online platform selling groceries and fresh produce to\n\nconsumers. In 2016, the Organisation was acquired by Lazada Group (“Lazada”). Thereafter,\n2\n\n\fthe Organisation began to integrate its platform with Lazada’s online platform. The customerfacing website and mobile application ceased operations on 15 March 2019. However, on the\nback end, the migration and integration of the Organisation’s system into Lazada’s system was\nnot completed by that time. It is worth setting out in some detail the Organisation’s information\ntechnology architecture to understand the backdrop against which the Incident occurred.\n\n4\n\nFrom March 2012 until its acquisition by Lazada, the Organisation’s business\n\napplications (including its customer facing website, mobile application, warehouse and\ndelivery back-end applications) were stored in RedMart’s Amazon Web Services Virtual\nPublic Cloud (the “AWS Environment”). The personal data of its customers and sellers were\nin turn, always stored in a MongoDB database within RedMart’s Alibaba Virtual Public Cloud.\nWhilst the MongoDB database is stored within cloud infrastructure that belongs to the Alibaba\nGroup, the Organisation remained responsible for managing its cloud environment (hereinafter,\nthe “RedMart Cloud”). The Organisation did not encrypt the MongoDB database, or\nimplement any password authentication requirement to access the MongoDB database.\n\n5\n\nAfter its acquisition, the Organisation’s intention was to re-design and migrate all the\n\nrelevant databases and applications from the AWS Environment into the RedMart Cloud to\nfacilitate its integration with Lazada’s systems and environment by March 2021. However,\ngiven the substantial time and resources required to complete the re-design and migration, the\nOrganisation opted to carry out the migration in stages. Following the acquisition and as a\nmatter of priority, the Organisation migrated its front end, customer-facing systems to the\nRedMart Cloud to enable a seamless integration into Lazada’s environment and platform for\nits customers. This was completed on 15 March 2019, after which the Organisation shut down\nits public-facing consumer application and website. Additionally, the MongoDB database\nresiding in the RedMart Cloud containing the affected customer and seller data was\n3\n\n\fdisconnected from the application and website (the “Affected Database”), and thereafter\naccess by the Organisation’s customers was disabled.\n\nIn contrast, the Organisation’s back-end business applications and systems (such as\n\n6\n\norder fulfilment, inventory, transport and warehousing) and its seller portal continued to be\nhosted on the AWS Environment and linked to the Affected Database contained in the RedMart\nCloud.\n\n7\n\nConcomitantly, the Organisation’s back-end systems and IT infrastructure during the\n\ninterim period was structured in the following manner:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s GitHub Enterprise repositories (the “GitHub Repositories”), were\naccessible by the Organisation’s employees possessing GitHub user and administrative\naccounts. The Organisation used the GitHub Repositories to store, amongst other\nthings, sensitive source codes including a Chef1 key that functioned as a high privilege\naccess key to the AWS Environment. The Organisation implemented the following\naccess control measures vis-à-vis the GitHub Repositories:\ni.\n\nFor GitHub user accounts, the Organisation followed GitHub’s password policy,\nwhich required the use of passwords which were either eight characters long if it\nincluded a number and a lowercase letter, or 16 characters long with any\ncombination of characters; and\n\nii.\n\nFor GitHub administrator accounts, two-factor authentication (“2FA”) was\nrequired on top of the password requirements above.\n\n“Chef” is an orchestration tool used for automated provisioning and management purposes within an AWS\nenvironment.\n1\n\n4\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe AWS Environment was accessible through the Chef key, and contained various\nprivate Simple Storage Service (“S3”) buckets 2 , one of which contained another\nsensitive API key – the Hubot3 key.\n\n(c)\n\nLastly, the AWS Environment was connected to the RedMart Cloud through an\nOpenVPN4 connection. The Affected Database was stored within the RedMart Cloud.\n\nThe Incident\n\n8\n\nSometime in September 2020, an unidentified threat actor (“TA”) gained unauthorised\n\naccess to the GitHub user account of a member of the Organisation’s DevOps (i.e. software\ndevelopment and IT operations) team. The TA utilised the compromised GitHub user account\nto search through the GitHub Repositories and found the Chef key. Thereafter the TA used the\nChef key to access the AWS Environment, whereupon he scanned through the Organisation’s\nprivate S3 buckets and located the Hubot key.\n\n9\n\nUsing the Hubot key, the TA created a rogue Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”)\n\ninstance in the AWS Environment. The TA also created a new firewall rule to enable a\nconnection between the rogue EC2 instance and another part of the Organisation’s network\nhosted by the RedMart Cloud. The TA then traversed the OpenVPN connection (that linked\nthe AWS Environment to the RedMart Cloud) to access the RedMart Cloud.\n\n10\n\nOnce the TA had gained access to the RedMart Cloud, he proceeded to exfiltrate the\n\nAffected Database on 6 September 2020. Subsequently, the Affected Database was found on\nan online forum being offered for sale.\n\n2\n\nS3 buckets are public cloud storage resources in AWS which are similar to file folders.\nHubot is a chat software that can be scripted to interact with an IT environment.\n4\nOpenVPN is a virtual private network system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or\nsite-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities.\n3\n\n5\n\n\f11\n\nThe Affected Database contained the following personal data:\n\nCustomer accounts\n\nSeller business accounts\n\nNumber of affected\n898,791\nindividuals\nTypes of personal a. Name\na. Partial credit card number\ndata\nb. Email address\ncomprising first 6 and last\nc. Contact number\n4 digits\nd. Residential address\ne. Partial credit card details b.

A media\nstatement was also issued at the same time.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the Incident or similar incidents\n(k)\n\nImplemented database authentication for all databases containing personal data.\nRestricted access to sensitive database from only authorised source IP addresses\ninstead of network ranges.\n\n(l)\n\nImplemented 2FA for all GitHub accounts and removed unnecessary GitHub\naccounts and developer access keys.\n\n(m)\n\nScanned for vulnerabilities in AWS critical Virtual Private Cloud instances.\n\n7\n\n\f(n)\n\nPerformed a security architecture review of the Organisation’s multiple cloud\nnetwork and intra-cloud micro-segmentation.\n\n(o)\n\nReviewed all AWS Identity and Access Management user permissions to ensure\nno “create instance” permission.\n\n(p)\n\nSet up identity access management rules to restrict geographical locations from\nwhich API keys could be used to access the Organisation/Lazada cloud\nenvironments.\n\n(q)\n\nReviewed all user identities and access privileges for all systems and\napplications used. Removed access privileges of all inactive accounts.\n\n(r)\n\nImplemented network traffic logging between the AWS Environment and\nRedMart Cloud.\n\n(s)\n\nImplemented network Access Control list and endpoint detection and response\nfor windows instances for RedMart Cloud.\n\n(t)\n\nImplemented security monitoring to detect creation of any new cloud instance\n\n(u)\n\nEnabled Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) logs for security monitoring.\n\n(v)\n\nRequired all of the Organisation’s employees to complete an online training\ncourse on privacy management and responsibilities in handling personal data.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n8\n\n\f13\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation focused on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable\nsecurity steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised access and disclosure (“the Protection\nObligation”).\n\n14\n\nIn determining what constitutes reasonable security steps or arrangements, an\n\norganisation should have regard to the nature of the personal data in its possession and control,\nas well as the impact that the disclosure of the data might have on the affected persons. As\nstated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (the “Advisory\nGuidelines”)5 at [17.2]:\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for organisations to comply with the Protection\nObligation. Each organisation should consider adopting security arrangements that are\nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, for example, taking into consideration\nthe nature of the personal data, the form in which the personal data has been\ncollected (e.g. physical or electronic) and the possible impact to the individual\nconcerned if an unauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the\npersonal data. For example, in the employment context, it would be reasonable to\nexpect a greater level of security for highly confidential employee appraisals as\ncompared to more general information about the projects an employee has worked on.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n15\n\nGiven the high volume of personal data contained in the Affected Database\n\n(approximately 898,791 individuals, encompassing personal data such as names, email\n\n5\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelines-and-consultation/2020/03/advisory-guidelines-on-key-concepts-in-thepersonal-data-protection-act\n\n9\n\n\faddresses, residential addresses, contact numbers and partial credit card details), it was\nincumbent on the Organisation to implement policies and practices that were commensurate\nwith the Organisation’s higher-level security needs to discharge its obligation under the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n16\n\nFor the reasons set out below, it is determined that the Organisation failed to implement\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Affected Database from the risk of\nunauthorised access.\n\nWhether the Organisations had contravened the Protection Obligation\n\n17\n\nBased on the Organisation’s IT architecture as detailed above, the Affected Database\n\nwas placed behind various levels of security controls within RedMart Cloud. This meant that\na threat actor had to get through various access points to access the Affected Database. The\nimplementation of network segmentation as part of layered defence is a reasonable strategy for\ndefence-in-depth. However, a complex IT architecture can be defeated by simple errors,\nespecially when the high-value data embedded within such complex systems are so often the\ntarget of sophisticated threat actors. The complexity of the Organisation’s network architecture\ndoes not paper over the cracks in its security arrangements – at every level of defence, the\nOrganisation’s systems presented clear vulnerabilities that should have been addressed.\n\n18\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to implement reasonable access control on its employers’\n\nuser GitHub accounts, which allowed the TA access to the GitHub Repositories. As stated in\nparagraph [7(a)], the access control measures were more stringent for GitHub administrative\naccounts than for GitHub user accounts. While this adequately dealt with the differentiation of\nability to make configuration and other changes to the Organisation’s GitHub Repositories, it\ndid not make any distinction to the type of data stored within the repositories. This disparity in\n10\n\n\faccess controls was not sensitive to the fact that both types of accounts had equal abilities to\naccess important files within the GitHub Repositories including the Chef key, which provided\naccess to the AWS Environment. Data with higher security implications (such as the Chef Key)\nought to be secured to a higher degree than other types of data. It is, of course, open to the\nOrganisation to secure all data in its GitHub Repositories at the higher level. Indeed, as stated\nin paragraph 12(l), the Organisation and Lazada, as part of their remedial measures postIncident, implemented 2FA for all its GitHub accounts.\n\n19\n\nSecond, the Organisation did not implement sufficient access controls to protect and\n\nlimit access to the Chef and Hubot keys, which enabled highly privileged access to various\nenvironments within the Organisation’s systems. Not all accounts need access to the Chef and\nHubot keys; and even for accounts that had access to them, they ought to be periodically\nreviewed to determine whether continued access were necessary. At an organisation-wide\nlevel, investigations revealed that the Organisation did not conduct periodic management\nreviews to ensure that the access to Chef and Hubot keys were limited to the GitHub accounts\nthat required such access, or to remove access from accounts that no longer needed it (including\nremoving unnecessary GitHub accounts altogether). This is a fundamental data security\npractice. As suggested in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection by Design for ICT\nSystems6:\n“12. Regularly review user accounts\nThis ensures that all user accounts are legitimate. There should be processes to update\nor remove user accounts, for instance, when a user has left the organisation. Test\naccounts should also be removed after test activities have been completed.\n\n6\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Guide-to-Data-Protection-by-Designfor-ICT-Systems-(310519).ashx?la=en\n\n11\n\n\fSeparately, there should also be a process to review user accounts regularly. The review\nshould include ensuring all the rights assigned are indeed necessary.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n20\n\nIn this connection, best practice dictates that the principle of least privilege should apply\n\ni.e. each employee be given only the minimum level of access rights or privileges necessary\nfor that employee to complete an assigned operation. This would limit the damage in case a\nvulnerability is exploited, as in this case where the TA gained unauthorised access to a GitHub\nuser account. This principle was also espoused in GitHub’s own Secure Design Principles7.\nThe Organisation’s failure to limit access to the Chef and Hubot keys at the material time\nallowed the TA to access the Chef key, and consequently the AWS Environment, through a\nGitHub user account.\n\n21\n\nOn a more granular level, insufficient security measures were implemented to protect\n\nthe Chef and Hubot keys, as both were stored in plain text files that were not encrypted or even\npassword-protected. Specifically:\n(a)\n\nThe Chef key was hardcoded in source code and stored in the GitHub repositories, and\nwas accessible to a large group of developers from the Organisation, Lazada and\nAlibaba for the purpose of knowledge sharing. By allowing so many accounts to access\nthe Chef key in such a manner, the risk of exposure and exploitation was heightened.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Hubot key was stored in plain text in an AWS private S3 bucket. Therefore, any\naccount that accesses the AWS Environment was able to access the Hubot key as a\n\n7\n\nhttps://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/blob/master/02Design/01Principles%20of%20Security%20Engineering.md\n\n12\n\n\fconduit from which to access the RedMart Cloud and the Affected Database stored\ntherein.\n\n22\n\nThe manner in which the Chef and Hubot keys were stored in the GitHub Repositories\n\nand AWS Environment were manifestly inadequate in view of the circumstances, and this\nvulnerability was exploited by the TA to access the keys after he gained access to the GitHub\nRepositories and AWS Environment respectively. Ideally, such keys ought to be stored in a\nseparate location such as Secrets Manager within the AWS Environment (i.e. a dedicated key\nvault). The Organisation should not have embedded the Chef and Hubot keys directly in the\nsource code. This is also reflected in AWS Access Keys best practices8, which the Organisation\nshould have been aware of given its usage of the AWS Environment since 2012:\n\n“Observe these precautions when using access keys:\n• Don't embed access keys directly into code. The AWS SDKs and the AWS\nCommand Line Tools enable you to put access keys in known locations so that\nyou do not have to keep them in code.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n23\n\nSuch best practices applies to of all platforms that use APIs, and are not confined to\n\nAWS. They are echoed in Google’s best practices for securely using API keys9, which are\nmeant to apply to Google Cloud but are nevertheless apposite here:\n\n8\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html\nhttps://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6310037?hl=en#:~:text=Delete%20unneeded%20API%20keys%\n3A%20To,use%20the%20newly%2Dgenerated%20keys\n9\n\n13\n\n\f“Best practices for securely using API keys\n\nWhen you use API keys in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) applications, take care\nto keep them secure. Publicly exposing your credentials can result in your account\nbeing compromised, which could lead to unexpected charges on your account. To\nkeep your API keys secure, follow these best practices:\n•\n\nDo not embed API keys directly in code: API keys that are embedded in code\ncan be accidentally exposed to the public, for example, if you forget to remove\nthe keys from code that you share. Instead of embedding your API keys in\nyour applications, store them in environment variables or in files outside\nof your application's source tree.\n\n•\n\nDo not store API keys in files inside your application's source tree: If you store\nAPI keys in files, keep the files outside your application's source tree to help\nensure your keys do not end up in your source code control system. This is\nparticularly important if you use a public source code management system such\nas GitHub.\n\n•\n\nRestrict your API keys to be used by only the IP addresses, referrer URLs, and\nmobile apps that need them: By restricting the IP addresses, referrer URLs,\nand mobile apps that can use each key, you can reduce the impact of a\ncompromised API key. You can specify the hosts and apps that can use each\nkey from the GCP Console Credentials page and then create a new API\nkey with the settings you want, or edit the settings of an existing API key.\n\n•\n\nRestrict your API keys to be usable only for certain APIs: If you have multiple\nAPIs enabled in your project and your API key should only be used with some\nof them, restrict usage of that key to those APIs. You can specify the allowed\n\n14\n\n\fAPIs for each key from the GCP Console Credentials page and then create a\nnew API key with the settings you want, or edit the settings of an existing API\nkey.\n•\n\nDelete unneeded API keys: To minimize your exposure to attack, delete any\nAPI keys that you no longer need.\n\n•\n\nRegenerate your API keys periodically: You can regenerate API keys from\nthe GCP Console Credentials page by clicking Regenerate key for each key.\nThen, update your applications to use the newly-generated keys. Your old keys\nwill continue to work for 24 hours after you generate replacement keys.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n24\n\nThe Organisation claimed that it was constrained from implementing password\n\nprotection and encryption for the Chef and Hubot keys by technical issues, and that the\nimplementation of password protection or encryption was not feasible or practical given the\nkeys’ core administrative and automating technical functions. The mere existence of technical\nissues does not exculpate the Organisation, or justify the Organisation’s decision to embed the\nChef and Hubot keys into source code. Technical issues are not insurmountable, and it is open\nto the Organisation to expend the necessary time, effort and resources to troubleshoot and\nresolve them. However, investigations revealed that the Organisation did not make sufficient\nefforts to resolve the technical issues in a timely manner, and were thus responsible for its\ndifficulties in implementing access controls for the Chef and Hubot keys. More broadly, even\nif the Chef and Hubot keys were not compatible with password protection or encryption, there\nwere a variety of other methods available to safeguard the security of the keys as set out in the\nbest practices set out above, such as removing unnecessary GitHub accounts, restricting access\nto only certain GitHub administrative accounts or storing the keys separately in a configuration\n\n15\n\n\ffile or a key vault. Nothing prevented RedMart from adhering to such best practices, as is\nevident by the fact that all these measures were implemented after the Incident occurred.\n\n25\n\nLastly, the Organisation also did not implement separate authentication requirements,\n\nfor the Affected Database. Once the TA accessed the RedMart Cloud, this enabled the TA to\naccess and exfiltrate the Affected Database. Instead, the only measures implemented to\nsafeguard the Affected Database were the access requirements for the RedMart Cloud\nenvironment in general, which was circumvented by the TA through his possession of the\nHubot key. This reflects a failure of the Organisation’s attempt to deploy a reasonable “defence\nin depth” strategy (despite its multiple layers of access) to safeguard the security of the Affected\nDatabase, as it should have implemented separate authentication requirements for the Affected\nDatabase to prepare for the contingency of someone gaining unauthorised entry into the\nRedMart Cloud.\n\n26\n\nAt a basic level, this should have included access controls such as password protection.\n\nFurther, given the high volume of personal data contained in the Affected Database, the\nOrganisation should also have taken steps to implement more stringent access controls, such\nas limiting access only to certain authorised network connections / interfaces. The Center for\nInternet Security MongoDB 5 Benchmark10 recommends requiring authentication of, amongst\nothers, users and servers before allowing access to a MongoDB database on the following basis:\n\n“2 Authentication\n\nThis section contains recommendations for requiring authentication before allowing\naccess to the MongoDB database.\n\n10\n\nhttps://cissecurity.org/benchmark/mongodb\n\n16\n\n\f…\n\nRationale:\n\nFailure to authenticate clients, users, servers can enable unauthorized access to\nthe MongoDB database and can prevent tracing actions back to their sources.\n\nIt's highly recommended that password length and complexity also be in-place. When\nperforming the traditional user/password authentication against MongoDB there is not\nin-place intrinsic password complexity check and there is no LOCKING mechanism\nwith multiple failure logins. So, MongoDB is prone to brute force attacks compared\nto other database systems.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n27\n\nThe Organisation, again, cited technical difficulties for why separate authentication\n\nrequirements were not implemented for the Affected Database. Again, such technical\ndifficulties could have been overcome if the Organisation had expended the effort and\nresources to do so.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n28\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation under\n\nsection 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\nconsidered, with particular emphasis on the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations,\n\nresponding to the Commission’s queries in a prompt and forthcoming manner;\n\n17\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe Organisation had put in place some good data de-identification practices for\n\nthe credit card numbers in its possession by redacting part of the data and storing only\npartial credit card details. This reduced the sensitivity and harm that might be caused\nwhen personal data within its control are disclosed in a data breach; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation swiftly implemented effective measures to mitigate the effects\n\nof the incident and prevent recurrences.\n\n29\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s\n\nletter dated 2 August 2022 and was invited to make representations.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n30\n\nOn 23 August 2022, the Organisation made the following representations to the\n\nCommission seeking a reduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had voluntarily notified the Commission and affected\n\nindividuals of the Incident even though it was not legally obliged to do so at the material\ntime, as the Data Breach Notification Obligation under Part 6A of the PDPA only came\ninto effect on 1 February 2022;\n(b)\n\nAs of the date of the representations, the Organisation was not aware of any\n\npersonal data of the affected individuals being misused as a consequence of the\nIncident. In support, the Organisation stated that the data in the Affected Database\nrelates to data used on its previous application and website which is no longer in use.\nMoreover, the data was more than 18 months out of date, and was not linked to any\ncurrent Lazada databases. Although the Organisation’s account passwords had been\nsecurely encrypted at the time of the Incident, it had conducted a forced logout and\n\n18\n\n\fpassword reset on every affected current Lazada account upon discovery of the Incident\nto ensure that no third party could misuse the leaked passwords by logging into a current\nLazada account; and\n(c)\n\nThe Incident was the Organisation’s first breach of the PDPA. To the best of\n\nthe Organisation’s knowledge and belief, the Incident was its first experience of a data\nbreach.\n\nVoluntary notification\n\n31\n\nThe Commission had already taken into account the Organisation’s voluntary\n\nnotification of the Incident into account in determining the quantum of the financial penalty in\nthe preliminary decision. Hence, this factor does not warrant a further reduction in the financial\npenalty imposed.\n\nLack of misuse of the affected personal data\n\n32\n\nThe fact that the Organisation was not aware of any misuse of the affected personal\n\ndata is neither here or there, and does not merit a further reduction in the financial penalty.\nWhilst evidence of exploitative use may be a relevant factor of harm that may be relevant for\nenhancing the financial penalty, the inverse is not necessarily true.\n\n33\n\nIn support of its representations, the Organisation cited the case of Learnaholic Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31 (“Learnaholic”), in which the Commissioner had taken into account the\nfact that “while there was actual exfiltration of the Personal Data…there was no evidence of\nfurther exploitation, use or disclosure of the Personal Data by the attacker”.11 It suffices to\n\n11\n\nLearnaholic at [34].\n\n19\n\n\fsay that the Commission has explained Learnaholic in Farrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd [2022]\nSGPDPC 6 at [35 to 36] as follows:\n\n“35\n\nIn the case of Learnaholic the main factors taken into account when deciding to\n\nreduce the preliminary financial penalty imposed were:\n(a)\n\nA reduction in the total number of affected individuals due to a recalculation of\n\nfigures; and\n(b)\n\nThe benefit of doubt given to Learnaholic as to the period of time the\n\nvulnerability in its system existed.\n36\n\nThe lack of evidence of further exploitation, use or disclosure is not, ipso facto,\n\na factor meriting a reduction of the financial penalty. The Organisation’s\nrepresentations are not accepted as the lack of an aggravating factor (i.e. subsequent\nexploitation, use or disclosure of personal data) is not in itself a mitigating factor.”\n34\n\nThe explanation in Farrer Park Hospital that is cited above is equally applicable in the\n\npresent case.\n\nLack of antecedents\n\n35\n\nIn calibrating the financial penalty in the preliminary decision, the Commission had\n\nalready taken into account the fact that this was the Organisation’s first non-compliance with\nthe PDPA, and no further reduction is merited. In support of its representations, the\nOrganisation also cited Aviva Ltd and Toh-Shi Printing Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 15\n(“Aviva\"), where the Commission had taken into account the fact that the breach of the\nProtection Obligation by the organisation was its second breach in approximately one year, and\nboth data breach incidents involved similar fact patterns and causes. 12 In Aviva, the\nCommission had considered the organisation’s previous non-compliance as a contributory\n\n12\n\nAviva at [38(c)].\n\n20\n\n\ffactor that justifies an increase in the financial penalty meted as the organisation had failed to\nimprove its data protection practices. In contrast, the lack of antecedents in this instance means\nthat the Commission did not increase the financial penalty imposed on the Organisation. To be\nclear, the absence of an antecedent does not, ipso facto, merit a reduction in the financial\npenalty imposed.\n\nAcceptance of the Commission’s findings\n\n36\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission notes that the Organisation voluntarily\n\naccepted the Commission’s findings in the preliminary decision, that it had failed to comply\nwith the Protection Obligation and explicitly indicated that it would not seek to challenge these\nfindings. The Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of liability (even at this late stage) ought to\nbe reflected in the financial penalty. Had the Organisation accepted responsibility for the\nIncident at an earlier stage of the investigation, it could have significantly shortened the time\nfor investigations and resolution of this case through the expedited breach procedure and also\nbenefited from greater mitigatory considerations. Nonetheless, an organisation that voluntarily\naccepts responsibility for its non-compliance with the PDPA should be recognised as an\norganisation that demonstrates its commitment to the Accountability Obligation and shows that\nit can be responsible for the personal data in its possession or under its control.13\n\n37\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby requires\n\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $72,000 within 30 days from the date of the\ndirections, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n13\n\nRefer to section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\n21\n\n\f38\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no further\n\ndirections need be issued to the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n22\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to both Shopify Commerce Singapore and Supernova to put in place a process to ensure compliance with the Transfer Limitation Obligation following a data breach incident of Shopify Inc's database.","tags":["Transfer Limitation","Directions","Others","Data Intermediary"],"date":"2022-11-18","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_Supernova-Pte-Ltd_06102022.pdf","nature":"Transfer Limitation","title":"Breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation by Shopify Commerce Singapore and Supernova","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/11/breach-of-the-transfer-limitation-obligation-by-shopify-commerce-singapore-and-supernova","timestamp":"2022-11-18","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 7\n\nCase No: DP-2103-B8147 / DP-2206-B9935\nIn the matter of an investigation under\nsection 50(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\n(1) Supernova Pte Ltd\n(2) Shopify Commerce Singapore Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 12\n\n\fSupernova Pte Ltd & Anor\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2103-B8147/ DP-2206-B9935\n\n6 October 2022\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 8 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by Supernova Pte Ltd (“SNPL”) of a data breach incident\nof Shopify Inc’s database affecting the personal data of certain Singapore-based\ncustomers (the “Incident”). The Commission commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the circumstances relating to the Incident disclosed any breaches of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nBackground\n\n2\n\nShopify Inc (“Shopify”) is a company based in Canada that operates an e-\n\ncommerce platform for online retailers to conduct sales (the “Platform”). SNPL is an\nonline retailer that began using the Platform in 2018 to sell its products to customers.\nShopify provided payment processing and other services (the “Services”) to SNPL\npursuant to the Shopify Plus Agreement, executed by Shopify and SNPL on 4\nDecember 2018. Shopify Commerce Singapore Pte Ltd (“Shopify SG”) acted as the\nPage 2 of 12\n\n\fAsia-Pacific data sub-processor of Shopify pursuant to the Shopify Data Processing\nAddendum to the Shopify Plus Agreement, and its role was confined to collecting\ncustomer personal data (including SNPL’s) via the Platform and transferring the data\nout of Singapore to Shopify for both Purchase Processing and Platform Processing.\n\n3\n\nThe Platform collected personal data from customers of its online retailers for\n\ntwo broad sets of purposes. First, to facilitate billing, payment and shipping on behalf\nof the Platform’s online retailers (“Purchase Processing”). Second, for Shopify’s own\ncommercial and administrative purposes. This mainly included the collection of\nconsumer personal data through the Platform’s own consumer-facing applications and\nservices e.g. Shop Pay (collectively, “Platform Processing”). Granted, for Platform\nProcessing, users of the Platform included customers of merchants who are on the\nPlatform, such as SNPL’s customers. Nevertheless, customer personal data was\nbeing collected and processed by Shopify for its own purposes, and not on behalf of\nmerchants.\n\n4\n\nOn 1 July 2019, the Shopify Plus Agreement (including the Shopify Data\n\nProcessing Addendum) was assigned to Shopify SG (the “Assignment”). At the\nmaterial time, SNPL had no knowledge of the Assignment as no notice of assignment\nwas required. Consequently, the relationship between the parties was reconfigured in\nthe following manner:\n(a)\n\nFor Purchase Processing, Shopify SG became the data intermediary of\nSNPL, and was responsible for processing personal data on behalf of SNPL.\nPage 3 of 12\n\n\fThe flow of SNPL’s customer personal data did not change - Shopify SG\ncontinued to collect SNPL’s customer personal data and transferred this to\nShopify to carry out Purchase Processing on its behalf.\n(b)\n\nFor Platform Processing, Shopify SG became the data controller of the\ncustomer personal data collected through the Platform and its customer-facing\napplications, including the personal data of the customers of merchants who\nuse the Platform (such as SNPL). In such circumstances, personal data from\nsuch users are collected by Shopify SG and processed for its purposes and not\non behalf of the merchants. The flow of customer personal data also did not\nchange, as Shopify SG continued to transfer personal data of users of its\nPlatform to Shopify to carry out Platform Processing.\n\nThe Incident\n\n5\n\nBetween June to September 2020, two Philippines-based service contractors\n\nof Shopify that were engaged through a third party, illegally accessed and exfiltrated\ncertain customer personal data stored in Shopify’s systems, which had been collected\nvia the Platform for Purchase Processing (the “Incident”). This included customer\npersonal data of SNPL. Shopify became aware of this on 15 September 2020 and\ninformed SNPL on 18 September 2020.\n\n6\n\nThe customer personal data affected in the Incident included full names, email\n\naddresses, billing addresses, shipping addresses, phone numbers, bank identification\n\nPage 4 of 12\n\n\fnumbers, IP addresses, last 4 digits of the customer payment cards, and purchase\nhistories of 23,928 individuals.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n7\n\nNeither SNPL nor Shopify SG were responsible for the security of Shopify’s\n\nsystems in Canada holding the personal data affected in the Incident. Nevertheless,\nboth organisations were bound by section 26 of the PDPA.\n\nTransfer limitation obligation under section 26 of the PDPA\n\n8\n\nSection 26(1) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall not transfer any\n\npersonal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with\nrequirements prescribed under the PDPA to ensure that organisations provide a\nstandard of protection to personal data so transferred that is comparable to the\nprotection under the PDPA (the “Transfer Limitation Obligation”). The requirements\napplicable to the aforementioned transfers of personal data from SNPL and Shopify\nSG to Shopify were those prescribed in Part III of the Personal Data Protection\nRegulations 2014 (“PDPR 2014”)1. In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nRegulation 9(1)(b) of the PDPR 2014 requires an organisation that transfers\npersonal data to a country or territory outside of Singapore to take appropriate\nsteps to ensure that the recipient of the personal data is bound by legally\n\n1\n\nThe PDPR 2014 governs the transfers of personal data prior to 1 February 2021. Transfers of personal data after\n1 February 2021 are governed by the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021.\nPage 5 of 12\n\n\fenforceable obligations to provide to the transferred personal data a standard\nof protection that is at least comparable to that under the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\nRegulation 10(1)(b) and 10(1)(c) provide that such legally enforceable\nobligations include may be imposed on the recipient by contract or binding\ncorporate rules (subject to Regulation 10(2) and 10(3) respectively).\n\nBreach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation by SNPL\n\n9\n\nWhen SNPL entered into the Shopify Plus Agreement on 4 December 2018, it\n\nwas aware that by using the Platform its customer personal data would be transferred\nto Shopify, which was outside Singapore, for Purchase Processing. Shopify was\nSNPL’s data intermediary, whilst Shopify SG was Shopify’s data sub-processor as\nexplained in paragraph 2.\n\n10\n\nSNPL (as the data controller of its customers’ personal data) had been notified,\n\nin the Shopify Plus Agreement, that its customer personal data may be transferred out\nof Singapore for the purpose of Purchase Processing, and was obligated to comply\nwith the Transfer Limitation Obligation vis-à-vis the personal data collected by Shopify\n/ Shopify SG for Purchase Processing. Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an\norganisation shall have the same obligation under the PDPA in respect of personal\ndata processed on its behalf and for its purposes by a data intermediary as if the\npersonal data were processed by the organisation itself. Such obligations include the\n\nPage 6 of 12\n\n\fTransfer Limitation Obligation. As stated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on\nKey Concepts in the PDPA2:\n\n“Considerations for organisations using data intermediaries\n\n6.20\n\nSection 4(3) provides that an organisation has the same obligations\nunder the PDPA in respect of personal data processed on its behalf by\na data intermediary as if the personal data were processed by the\norganisation itself. As such, it is good practice for an organisation to\nundertake an appropriate level of due diligence to assure itself that\na potential data intermediary is capable of complying with the\nPDPA.\n\n…\nOverseas transfers of personal data\n\n6.22\n\nWhere an organisation engages a data intermediary to process personal\ndata on its behalf and for its purposes, the organisation is responsible\nfor complying with the Transfer Limitation Obligation in respect of any\noverseas transfer of personal data. This is regardless of whether the\npersonal data is transferred by the organisation to an overseas data\nintermediary or transferred overseas by the data intermediary in\n\n2\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 October 2021)\nPage 7 of 12\n\n\fSingapore as part of its processing on behalf and for the purposes\nof the organisation.\n\n6.23\n\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation requires that an organisation ensures\nthat personal data transferred overseas is protected to a standard\ncomparable with the Data Protection Provisions. The onus is on the\ntransferring organisation to undertake appropriate due diligence\nand obtain assurances when engaging a data intermediary to\nensure that it is capable of doing so. In undertaking its due\ndiligence,\n\ntransferring\n\norganisations\n\nmay\n\nrely\n\non\n\ndata\n\nintermediaries’ extant protection policies and practices, including\ntheir assurances of compliance with relevant industry standards or\ncertification.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n11\n\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation required SNPL to ensure, prior to\n\ntransferring customer personal data for processing by Shopify, that Shopify provided\na standard of protection to transferred personal data that was comparable to the\nprotection under the PDPA. This obligation did not abate by virtue of the Assignment\non 1 July 2019, even though SNPL claimed that it was not made aware of the\nAssignment. At all times, SNPL was responsible for complying with the Transfer\nLimitation Obligation for its transfer to Shopify (initially) and Shopify SG (latterly). Even\nthough Shopify SG assumed legal responsibility as SNPL’s data intermediary\nPage 8 of 12\n\n\fsupposedly without informing SNPL, the flow of SNPL’s customer personal data was\nnot altered, as Shopify SG continued to transfer SNPL’s customer personal data\noutside of Singapore (i.e. to Shopify) for Purchase Processing.\n\n12\n\nIn connection with this, the onus laid with SNPL to put in place the relevant\n\ncontractual clauses to ensure the protection of its personal data to a standard\ncomparable to the PDPA. However, investigations revealed that SNPL did not do so.\nThe omission to put in place contractual clauses to ensure such comparable protection\nbegan with the start of their commercial arrangement. SNPL stated that, in 2018, it\ncarried out a due diligence assessment of Shopify’s approach to data protection before\nentering into the Shopify Plus Agreement and migrating its online retail activities to the\nPlatform (“2018 Due Diligence Exercise”). However, this assessment was\ninadequate as it failed to ensure that there were binding contractual clauses requiring\npersonal data transferred between them to be protected to a standard comparable to\nthe PDPA.\n\n13\n\nAccordingly, SNPL failed to comply with the Transfer Limitation Obligation.\n\nBreach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation by Shopify SG\n\n14\n\nFor the Purchase Processing of customer personal data discussed in the\n\npreceding paragraphs, Shopify SG acted as SNPL’s data intermediary and was thus\nnot bound by the Transfer Limitation Obligation.\n\nPage 9 of 12\n\n\f15\n\nHowever, Shopify SG must also comply with the Transfer Limitation Obligation\n\nin relation to the personal data collected for Platform Processing. This is because\nShopify SG was processing customer personal data for its own purposes, and was\nthus the data controller, while Shopify is the data intermediary.\n\n16\n\nIn connection with this, investigations revealed that there were no legally\n\nbinding obligations, in the form of contracts or binding corporate rules within the\nShopify group, requiring Shopify to provide PDPA-comparable protection to personal\ndata transferred from Shopify SG to Shopify for processing. While the Shopify Data\nProcessing Addendum makes references to certain data protection legislation\napplicable to the European Union and the State of California, it did not cover the PDPA.\nDuring the course of investigations, Shopify indicated that it would “be putting in place\nbinding corporate rules governing the transfer of merchants’ customers’ data between\ngroup entities” and furnished a draft APAC Cross-Border Whitepaper to the\nCommission. Whilst this was a step in the right direction, it did not retrospectively allow\nShopify SG to regularise its intra-group data transfers to ensure compliance with the\nTransfer Limitation Obligation at the material time.\n\n17\n\nIn view of the foregoing, Shopify SG failed to comply with the Transfer Limitation\n\nObligation in respect of Platform Processing of personal data.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n\n18\n\nIn determining what directions (if any) should be given to the organisations\n\npursuant to section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be\nPage 10 of 12\n\n\frequired to pay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at\nsection 48J(6) of the PDPA were considered. In particular, the Commission placed\nemphasis on the fact that SNPL and Shopify SG had been highly cooperative with the\nCommission’s investigations.\n\n19\n\nOn 18 July 2022, SNPL made representations to the Commission requesting\n\nfor additional time to comply with the above direction. In consideration of SNPL’s\nlimitations as a small and medium enterprise, SNPL’s deadline to comply with the\ndirection is extended from 60 days to 6 months.\n\n20\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, SNPL is hereby directed\n\nto take the following actions:\n(a)\n\nSNPL is to put in place within 6 months a process to ensure compliance\n\nwith the Transfer Limitation Obligation under section 26 of the PDPA in any\nfuture engagement of services that may involve the processing of personal data\noutside of Singapore on behalf of SNPL; and\n(b)\n\nShopify SG is to put in place within 60 days a process to ensure\n\ncompliance with the Transfer Limitation Obligation under section 26 of the\nPDPA in any future engagement of its services that may involve the processing\nof personal data outside of Singapore.\n\n21\n\nSpecific to SNPL’s transfer of personal data for the purpose of Purchase\n\nProcessing to Shopify in Canada, the following observations may be helpful. The\nPage 11 of 12\n\n\fAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (“ASEAN”) adopted and endorsed the Model\nContractual Clauses (“ASEAN MCCs”), which are meant to facilitate cross-border\ntransfers of personal data. These provide a standard for business-to-business (B2B)\ntransfers that can be used by enterprises of any scale, but are especially helpful for\nsmall and medium enterprises. When using them, businesses may adapt these\nclauses as necessary for their commercial arrangements.\n\n22\n\nThe Commission recognises the ASEAN MCCs as meeting the requirements\n\nof the Transfer Limitation Obligation under the PDPA: see PDPC’s Guidance for the\nUse of ASEAN Model Contractual Clauses for Cross Border Data Flows in Singapore\n(published 22 January 2021). Using the ASEAN MCCs can ease B2B transfers\nbetween Singapore and other jurisdictions such as Canada. In carrying out the\ndirections, SNPL may therefore wish to consider relying on and adapting, as\nnecessary, the ASEAN MCCs.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 12 of 12\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 was imposed on Farrer Park Hospital for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Healthcare"],"date":"2022-11-18","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GD_Farrer-Park-Hospital-Pte-Ltd_15092022.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Farrer Park Hospital","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/11/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-farrer-park-hospital","timestamp":"2022-11-18","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 6\n\nCase No. DP-2007-B6646\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under\nsection 50(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2007-B6646\n15 September 2022\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 23 July 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a data breach notification from Farrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n(the “Organisation”). The Organisation discovered that between 8 March 2018 and\n25 October 2019, 9,271 emails had been automatically forwarded from two\nemployees’ (the “Employees”) Microsoft Office 365 work email accounts (the “Email\nAccounts”) to a third-party’s email address (the “Third Party”), thereby disclosing the\npersonal data of 3,539 unique individuals (the “Incident”).\nBackground\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a private tertiary healthcare institute that provides a range\n\nof healthcare services. The nature of the Organisation’s operations requires its\nemployees to regularly handle highly sensitive personal data of past, present, and\nprospective patients. At the material time, the Employees were part of the\nOrganisation’s marketing department which, inter alia, processes requests for the\nOrganisation’s medical services via email. The email requests received by the\nOrganisation’s marketing department contain personal data pertinent to the medical\ntreatment(s) requested by individuals including:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nGender;\n\n1\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n(c)\n\nNationality;\n\n(d)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(e)\n\nNRIC Number (full and partial);\n\n(f)\n\nPassport details (including Passport numbers);\n\n(g)\n\nContact number;\n\n(h)\n\nPhotograph; and\n\n(i)\n\nMedical information, including the following (the “Medical Information”):\n(i)\n\nMedical Condition(s) – namely, patient’s health condition(s),\n\nincluding doctor’s diagnosis, brief description of the health condition\nprovided by the patient or an appointment with a specialist for a specific\ncondition mentioned;\n(ii)\n\nMedical History – namely, more than one record of a patient’s\n\nhealth condition(s).\n(iii)\n\nMedical Results/Reports – namely, documents containing a\n\nmedical procedure or analysis (for example, X-Rays).\n(collectively, the “Affected Data Types”)\nSecurity measures prior to discovery of the Incident\n3\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had implemented various IT and\n\ndata protection policies regulating the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of\npersonal data, including:\n\n2\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n(a)\n\nA ‘Data Protection Handbook’ to provide awareness and assistance to\n\nits employees in complying with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”);\n(b)\n\nA ‘Personal Data Protection Policy for Patient Records’ to outline the\n\nOrganisation’s protocol for managing patients’ medical records as well as the\nrelevant retention period of medical records;\n(c)\n\nAn\n\n‘IT\n\nSecurity\n\nManagement\n\nStandards’\n\npolicy\n\ndetailing\n\nthe\n\nestablishment, implementation, and management of the Organisation’s\ninformation security program to ensure the prevention, detection, containment,\nand correction of security breaches;\n(d)\n\nAn ‘Access Control Standards’ policy setting out the Organisation’s\n\nstandards relating to user accounts and password security settings; and\n(e)\n\nAn ‘Acceptable Use Policy’ stipulating the Organisation’s rules governing\n\nthe acceptable use of its IT resources, including access to emails, websites, the\ninternet, and other types of organisational information, and which mandated\nthat user passwords be at least 8 characters long, and contain characters from\nat least 3 of the below 4 categories\n\n4\n\n(i)\n\n“English upper-case letters (e.g., A, B, C, …Z)”;\n\n(ii)\n\n“English lower-case letters (e.g., a, b, C, …Z)”;\n\n(iii)\n\n“Alphanumeric (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …9)”; and\n\n(iv)\n\n“Special characters) (e.g., ?, !, %, $, #)”.\n\nThe Organisation had also implemented various IT security measures and\n\nvendor-based solutions including:\n3\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n(a)\n\nStaff training sessions on medical confidentiality, and periodic email\n\nupdates on developments to the PDPA and guidelines issued by the\nCommission;\n(b)\n\nRegular phishing exercises on employees to continually inculcate\n\nawareness on the techniques that malicious actors might deploy to undermine\nthe organisation’s IT security;\n(c)\n\nA cloud-based filtering service to protect the Organisation against spam,\n\nmalware, and other email threats;\n(d)\n\nSignature-based and behaviour-based endpoint protections to protect\n\nendpoints from known and unknown malicious files;\n(e)\n\nUser and entity behaviour analytics utilising deep learning algorithms to\n\nidentify anomalies based on the Organisation’s usual network traffic;\n(f)\n\nWebpage whitelisting solutions to only allow users to access permitted\n\nsites and/or category of sites based on the Organisation’s defined policies;\n(g)\n\nFirewalls to prevent unauthorised access into FPH’s private network;\n\nand\n(h)\n\nA network intrusion prevention system to analyse network traffic to\n\nprevent known malicious activities from occurring within the Organisation’s\nnetwork.\n5\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the work email accounts of the Organisation’s\n\nemployees were hosted on Microsoft Office 365 (“Office 365”), and the Organisation’s\nemployees were able to access their work email accounts through the internet via a\nweb-browser (i.e. web-mail). In June 2019, the Organisation implemented multi-factor\n4\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nauthentication (“MFA”) for all of its employees’ work email accounts as part of its\nplanned initiatives. The MFA implemented by the Organisation required its employees\nto key in a one-time password sent to their registered mobile number when accessing\ntheir work email accounts from a new device (the “OTP Process”). Upon successfully\naccessing their work email account on that device, employees had the option of\nchoosing to “stay signed in” to their work email account on that authenticated device.\nWhere this option was chosen, employees would not be required to undergo the OTP\nProcess when subsequently accessing their work email accounts on that same\nauthenticated device.\n6\n\nThe Organisation represented that the above security solutions did not detect\n\nany anomalies and/or unusual activities in the Organisation’s email traffic before 24\nOctober 2019.\nThe Incident\n7\n\nOn 24 October 2019, the Organisation’s IT helpdesk received a complaint that\n\none of the Email Accounts was not able to send outgoing emails. In conducting checks\nto address this complaint, the Organisation’s IT helpdesk discovered that Office 365\nhad automatically imposed restrictions on the Email Accounts. This is a security\nfeature of Microsoft’s Exchange Online Protection which indicated unauthorised\naccess to the Email Accounts. Further investigations by the Organisation confirmed\nthat the Email Accounts had been configured to automatically forward all incoming\nemails to the Third Party. This auto-forwarding of emails occurred between 8 March\n2018 to 25 October 2019 for one of the Email Accounts, and between 1 April 2018 to\n25 October 2019 for the other.\n8\n\nIn total, 9,271 emails were forwarded from the Email Accounts to the Third\n\nParty. This resulted in the unintended disclosure of personal data belonging to 3,539\n5\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nunique individuals, of which 1,923 unique individuals also had their Medical\nInformation disclosed. The Affected Data Types were disclosed in different\npermutations and not all affected individuals had all of the Affected Data Types\ndisclosed through the various forwarded emails.\n9\n\nFor completeness, the MFA and OTP Process had been not implemented at\n\nthe time when the Incident first occurred on 8 March 2018.\nRemedial Measures\n10\n\nAfter discovering the Incident, the Organisation carried out the following\n\nremedial measures:\n(a)\n\nDisabled the auto-forwarding feature for end-users;\n\n(b)\n\nIncreased the frequency of internal cybersecurity training and exercises;\n\n(c)\n\nImplemented additional technical email and network security measures;\n\nand\n(d)\n\nRefreshed and upgraded various of its existing network security\n\nmeasures.\n11\n\nThe Organisation has advised that it will by 2022, upgrade, refresh and/or\n\nenhance its existing solutions for its:\n(a)\n\nNetwork security measures; and\n\n(b)\n\nEndpoint security measures.\n\n6\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n12\n\nIn view of the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\nfocused on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”).\n13\n\nIn deciding what constitutes reasonable security arrangements and/or controls,\n\norganisations should take into consideration the nature of the personal data in\nquestion, as well as the impact that disclosure of that personal data might have on\naffected person(s). This is a fact-specific assessment that organisations should\nundertake when developing and/or implementing its security arrangements, policies,\nand controls. As stated in the Commission’s Advisory on Key Concepts in the PDPA1:\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for organisations to comply with the\nProtection Obligation. Each organisation should consider adopting security\narrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, for\nexample, taking into consideration the nature of the personal data, the form in\nwhich the personal data has been collected (e.g. physical or electronic) and the\npossible impact to the individual concerned if an unauthorised person obtained,\nmodified or disposed of the personal data. For example, in the employment\ncontext, it would be reasonable to expect a greater level of security for highly\nconfidential employee appraisals as compared to more general information\nabout the projects an employee has worked on.\n\n1 See sections 17.2 – 17.3 of Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 February 2021)\n\n7\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nIn practice, an organisation should:\na)\n\ndesign and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the\npersonal data held by the organisation and the possible harm that might\nresult from a security breach;\n\nb)\n\nidentify reliable and well-trained personnel responsible for ensuring\ninformation security;\n\nc)\n\nimplement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels\nof security for personal data of varying levels of sensitivity; and\n\nd)\n\nbe prepared and able to respond to information security breaches\npromptly and effectively.\n\nIn addition, it might be useful for organisations to undertake a risk assessment\nexercise to ascertain whether their information security arrangements are\nadequate. In so doing, the following factors may be considered:\na)\n\nthe size of the organisation and the amount and type of personal data it\nholds;\n\nb)\n\nwho within the organisation has access to the personal data; and\n\nc)\n\nwhether the personal data is or will be held or used by a third party on\nbehalf of the organisation.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n8\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n14\n\nFor the reasons set out below, it is determined that the Organisation failed to\n\nimplement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in the Email\nAccounts from the risk of unauthorised access and disclosure.\nFailure to put in place reasonable security arrangements to meet its needs\n15\n\nWhere the personal data in question is sensitive and/or may cause damage to\n\naffected individuals if compromised, organisations should implement stronger access\nand security measures. The Commission has issued guidance on this issue in its\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium2 (the “Guide”) In particular,\nparagraphs 7.3 and 7.4 of the Guide state that:\n“7. 3. The strength of authentication, such as password requirements or other\nmechanisms for access to personal data, should depend on the potential\ndamage to the individual, such as potential damage to reputation or finances, if\nsuch personal data is compromised…\n7.4\n\nMore secure authentication methods include two-factor or multi-factor\n\nauthentication. These involve the use of a combination of information that the\nuser knows, such as a password or PIN, and an object that only the user\npossesses, such as a digital key, token or smart card, or a unique physical trait,\nsuch as the use of fingerprints in biometric technology. The use of multi-factor\nauthentication increases confidence in the identity of the user accessing the\nsystem.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n2 Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised Jan 2017)\n\n9\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n16\n\nThe Commission’s latest Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems3\n\nalso recommends two tiers of (i) basic and (ii) enhanced data protection practices for\norganisations to adopt in different circumstances. The guidance remains that larger\nquantities and more sensitive personal data call for enhanced data protection\npractices:\n“…For organisations that hold large quantities of different types of personal data\nor data that might be more sensitive to the individuals or organisations, they\nshould additionally implement the relevant enhanced practices suggested....\nThe design and implementation of these protection measures should always\ntake into consideration the extent of the sensitivity of the data based on the\nnature of business and types of services offered.”4\n17\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation ought to have implemented stronger\n\nsecurity arrangements, policies and/or controls to manage its marketing department’s\nOffice 365 work email accounts, for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s marketing department routinely (on a daily basis)\nreceived and processed sensitive personal data, namely, the Medical\nInformation of past, present and prospective patients.\n\n(b)\n\nThe volume of sensitive personal data processed by the Organisation’s\nmarketing department was not insignificant (1,923 individuals’ Medical\nInformation processed over 18 months).\n\n3 Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems (2021)\n4 Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems (2021), page 8\n\n10\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n(c)\n\nThe marketing department’s Office 365 work email accounts were\naccessible from the Internet (i.e. web-mail) which taken together with the\nabove factors, exacerbated their vulnerability to unauthorised access.\n\n18\n\nWithout prescribing the specific measures that would have been appropriate for\n\nthe Organisation’s circumstances, stronger security arrangements, policies and/or\ncontrols could have included:\n(a)\n\nImplementing enhanced access controls for the marketing department’s\n\nweb-mail access (e.g. MFA, IP address based white-listing);\n(b)\n\nImplementing policies and/or processes for the marketing department to\n\ncollect Medical Information via a more secure platform (e.g. a separate webportal);\n(c)\n\nImplementing policies and/or processes for Medical Information to be\n\nregularly moved and purged from the marketing department’s Office 365 email\naccounts, and stored in a more secure system (e.g. a non-Internet facing\nmedical records or customer relationship management system); and/or\n(d)\n\nImplementing policies and/or processes for Medical Information\n\ndisclosed via the marketing department’s email accounts to be better protected\n(e.g. password protecting email attachments).\n19\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, it is accepted that web-mail may be an appropriate\n\nand cost-effective way for organisations to provide their employees with out-of-office\nemail access, and that it may not be necessary for organisations to implement\nenhanced controls to regulate the use of all types of web-mail accounts. It is incumbent\non organisations to assess whether enhanced controls should be implemented to\n\n11\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nregulate the use of web-mail accounts, considering factors such as the volume and\nsensitivity of the personal data processed using such accounts.\n20\n\nIn the present case, while MFA was eventually implemented for the marketing\n\ndepartment’s Office 365 work email accounts as an enhanced access control\nmeasure, this was unfortunately only after the Incident had occurred. Web-mail\naccounts are exposed to modes of attack that may defeat or circumvent 8-character\nalphanumeric password protection. Given that the marketing department was routinely\nprocessing personal data of a sensitive nature, it was incumbent on the Organisation\nto implement stronger security arrangements, policies and/or controls in conjunction\nwith its adoption of web-mail.\n21\n\nIn the premises, the Commission finds that the Organisation breached the\n\nProtection Obligation by failing to implement stronger security arrangements, policies\nand/or controls in respect of the Email Accounts.\nRisks arising from Email Auto-Forwarding\n22\n\nThe automatic forwarding of emails to external domains (“Email Auto-\n\nForwarding”) is a known security risk. In March 2018, it was reported that the Office\nof the Australian Information Commissioner was investigating a data breach incident\nnotified by a member of the Maersk Group involving the auto-forwarding of 50,000\nemails sent to 3 employees’ accounts to external parties5. More recently, in a Private\nIndustry Notification dated 25 November 2020, the United States of America’s Federal\nBureau of Investigations warned that cyber-criminals have been exploiting autoforwarding rules on web-based email clients to perpetuate business email compromise\n\n5 https://www.zdnet.com/article/oaic-received-31-notifications-in-the-first-three-weeks-of-data-breach-scheme/\n\n12\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nscams and recommended, amongst other mitigation measures, that Email AutoForwarding be prohibited by default6.\n23\n\nLocally, in Singapore Medical Association [2020] SGPDPCS 13, an\n\nunauthorised user gained access to an email account and created an email rule to\nforward emails to an external email address. 137 emails were forwarded without\nauthorisation, resulting in the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of 68\nindividuals. The danger of allowing Email Auto Forwarding is clear, but there is an\neasy fix – organisations can simply disable this function and ensure that it remains\ndisabled.\n24\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation conducted a ‘Business Impact\n\nAssessment’ in 2013 on the use of Office 365 to assess the risks involved from the\nuse of corporate email and instant messaging. The Organisation also subsequently\nconducted regular reviews and assessments of security risks arising from the use of\nOffice 365 within the Organisation. Unfortunately, these steps did not include an\nassessment of the risks arising from Office 365’s default setting which allowed Email\nAuto-Forwarding.\n25\n\nThe Organisation, on its part, stated that it had not specifically examined\n\ndisabling the default Email Auto-Forwarding feature in Office 365 because there had\nbeen no guidelines, standards, or benchmarks at the material time prior to the Incident\nrecommending disabling of or management of risks from default Email AutoForwarding. Neither had it been a common industry practice to do so prior to the\nIncident. In this regard, it is noted that Microsoft only released specific guidance on\n\n6 https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2020/201204.pdf\n\n13\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nrestricting or controlling Email Auto-Forwarding in Office 365 around July / August\n20207.\n26\n\nIt is recognised that Email Auto-Forwarding may be a useful function that serves\n\nvaluable needs in relation to some email accounts. The Protection Obligation requires\norganisations, as part of their periodic security review, to assess the frequency and\nmanner of use of Email Auto-Forwarding, and to weigh and counter the attendant risks.\nIn particular, it is incumbent on organisations to apply their minds and make their own\nassessments of the risks and implications of adopting the default settings of “out-ofthe-box” software solutions (see COURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 17 at\n[14] and DS Human Resource Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 16 at [9]).\n27\n\nOn balance, and on the facts of this case, the Organisation is given the benefit\n\nof the doubt that the lack of guidelines, standards or benchmarks at the material time\nmay have affected its assessment of the risks arising from the Office 365 default Email\nAuto-Forwarding rule. This omission will therefore not be factored in determining the\nenforcement action to be taken in this case. However, there must be no doubt that\nfailure to make reasonable assessment of the risks from Email Auto-Forwarding within\nan organisation is breach of the Protection Obligation that would, in future cases, be\nmet with the appropriate enforcement action.\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n28\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty,\n\n7 See https://www.vansurksum.com/2020/08/25/microsoft-is-making-changes-related-to-automatic-email-\n\nforwarding-for-atp-customers-here-is-what-you-need-to-know/ referencing Microsoft’s MC 218984 published July\n2020 and MC220853 published August 2020.

The Organisation’s voluntary\nnotification of the Incident was taken into account when the Commission determined\nthe preliminary financial penalty, and does not merit a further reduction of the same.\n32\n\nLikewise, the Organisation’s representations that it had not committed any\n\nbreaches of the PDPA prior to the Incident are not accepted. The Organisation’s lack\nof antecedents had already been taken into account in calibrating the preliminary\nfinancial penalty.\nRepresentations on the lack of misuse of the affected personal data\n33\n\nThe Organisation represented that its private forensic expert had monitored the\n\nInternet and dark web from 25 February 2020 to 24 April 2020 and not found any\ninformation or data (including personal data of the affected individuals) relating to the\nIncident disclosed during that period. The Organisation further stated that it had not\nreceived any complaints from any affected individual as of the date of the\n16\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nrepresentations in relation to misuse of their personal data. The Organisation therefore\nrepresented that no individuals had been harmed or had suffered loss as a result of\nthe Incident.\n34\n\nIn support of its representations, the Organisation cited the case of Learnaholic\n\nPte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 31 (“Learnaholic”), in which the Commissioner had taken\ninto account the fact that “while there was actual exfiltration of the Personal\nData…there was no evidence of further exploitation, use or disclosure of the Personal\nData by the attacker.”8\n35\n\nIn the case of Learnaholic the main factors taken into account when deciding\n\nto reduce the preliminary financial penalty imposed were:\n(a)\n\nA reduction in the total number of affected individuals due to a\n\nrecalculation of figures; and\n(b)\n\nThe benefit of doubt given to Learnaholic as to the period of time the\n\nvulnerability in its system existed.\n36\n\nThe lack of evidence of further exploitation, use or disclosure is not, ipso facto,\n\na factor meriting a reduction of the financial penalty. The Organisation’s\nrepresentations are not accepted as the lack of an aggravating factor (i.e. subsequent\nexploitation, use or disclosure of personal data) is not in itself a mitigating factor.9\n\n8 Learnaholic at [34]\n9 See Public Prosecutor v AOM [2011] SGHC 29 at [37] and Edwin s/o Suse Nathen v Public Prosecutor [2013]\n\nSGHC 194 at [24] for the equivalent positions in the criminal sentencing domain.\n\n17\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nRepresentations on the prompt remedial actions taken by the Organisation\n37\n\nThe Organisation represented that the Commission had not taken into\n\nconsideration the immediate nature of the remedial action taken to contain the\nIncident, as well as the success of the immediate post-Incident remediation and\nrecovery efforts. The Organisation further stated that it had not suffered any breaches\nof the same nature since the Incident, which was proof of the effectiveness of its\nremedial actions.\n38\n\nThe Organisation’s prompt remedial actions were already taken into account in\n\ndetermining the preliminary financial penalty. However, this is weighed against the\nlengthy time period during which the Email Auto-Forwarding took place (March 2018\n– October 2019) and long delay in detecting the breach in the first place.\nRepresentations on previous Commission decisions\n39\n\nThe Organisation cited two previous Commission decisions in support of its\n\nrepresentations that the intended financial penalty was excessive for similar or more\nserious breaches of the PDPA. These two cases are The National Kidney Foundation\n[2021] SGPDPC 10 (“NKF”) and Singapore Medical Association [2020] SGPDPCS 13\n(“SMA”).\nNKF\n40\n\nThe breach in NKF concerned a hacker who had gained access to the work\n\nemail account of one of NKF’s employees, thereby gaining access to 23,145 emails\ncontaining the personal data of approximately 500 individuals, including patients,\nemployees, and third parties. The Organisation submitted that both cases were similar\nin the following areas:\n18\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n(a)\n\nTypes of personal data involved (i.e. sensitive medical information);\n\n(b)\n\nSimilar root causes and nature of the incidents;\n\n(c)\n\nFailure by the organisations to implement 2FA/MFA for web-mail access\n\nat the time of the incidents;\n\n41\n\n(d)\n\nIncreased data protection awareness as remedial measures; and\n\n(e)\n\nMitigating factors.\n\nThe Organisation distinguished NKF and submitted that a lower financial\n\npenalty was justified in this case for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Incident was less egregious than NKF because NKF involved:\n(i)\n\nan additional category of sensitive personal data (bank account\n\ninformation), apart from just medical information; and\n(ii)\n\nthe hacker synchronising and downloading contents of the\n\ncompromised email account; while no such synchronising or further use\nof the compromised email accounts was detected in the Incident;\n(b)\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation\n\nhad\n\ncarried\n\nout\n\nfar\n\nmore\n\nsubstantial\n\nand\n\ncomprehensive remedial measures than NKF; and\n(c)\n\nThe number of individuals affected by the Incident was not significantly\n\nhigher than the number of individuals affected by the NKF incident.\n42\n\nThe Organisation’s representations are not accepted for the following reasons:\n\n19\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\n(a)\n\nIn NKF only 8 patients’ medical information was compromised, as\n\nopposed to the disclosure of 1,923 individuals’ medical information due to the\nIncident. The breach in the Incident was therefore of a much larger magnitude.\n(b)\n\nThe length of time that the breach went undetected was much longer in\n\nthe Incident – the first email account was compromised in early 2018 and went\nundetected by the Organisation until October 2019, which was more than a\nyear. This is much longer than the time it took for detection of the breach in\nNKF, where the hacker obtained access around 14 May 2020 and NKF\ndiscovered the breach on 17 May 2020.\n(c)\n\nThe number of individuals affected by the Incident is more than 7 times\n\nhigher (500 in NKF as opposed to 3,539 in the Incident). The two incidents thus\ncannot be considered in the same bracket of egregiousness.\nSMA\n43\n\nThe breach in SMA concerned unauthorised access to an email account by\n\nbrute force attack, and the subsequent forwarding of 137 emails containing the\npersonal data of 68 individuals to an external email address. The Organisation\nsubmitted that both cases were similar in the following areas:\n\n44\n\n(a)\n\nTypes of personal data involved; and\n\n(b)\n\nSimilar root causes and nature of the incidents.\n\nThe Organisation distinguished SMA and submitted that a lower financial\n\npenalty was justified because the Organisation had implemented more comprehensive\nsecurity measures than SMA. In particular, the Organisation highlighted its own\n\n20\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nperiodic changes of email account passwords and limit of the number of failed login\nattempts, in contrast with SMA which did not implement these measures.\n45\n\nThe Organisation’s representations are not accepted as the volume and\n\nsensitivity of personal data affected in the Incident was much higher than in SMA:\n(a)\n\nThe number of affected individuals in the Incident was 3,539; many times\n\nhigher than the 68 affected individuals in SMA.\n(b)\n\nThe following categories of sensitive information were disclosed in the\n\nIncident but not in SMA: passport details, photographs, contact numbers, and\nnotably, specific medical information. As a hospital, the Organisation must be\nheld to a higher standard with regard to safeguarding medical information.\n46\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Commission notes that the Organisation\n\nvoluntarily accepted the Commission’s findings in the preliminary decision, that it had\nfailed to comply with the Protection Obligation and explicitly indicated what it would\nnot seek to challenge these findings. The Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of\nliability (even at this late stage) is accepted to have some mitigating weight, meriting\na small reduction in the financial penalty. Had the Organisation accepted responsibility\nfor the Incident at an earlier stage of the investigation, this may have merited a larger\ndiscount. An organisation that voluntarily accepts responsibility for its non-compliance\nwith the PDPA is an organisation that demonstrates its commitment to the\nAccountability Obligation and shows that it can be responsible for the personal data in\nits possession or under its control.10\n47\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $58,000 within 30 days\n10 S 11(2) of the PDPA\n\n21\n\n\fFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd\n\nfrom the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n48\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n22\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"QCP Capital was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident whereby threat actor(s) exfiltrated personal data via unauthorised access to an employee's account.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Finance and Insurance"],"date":"2022-10-25","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---QCP-Capital-Pte-Ltd---16092022-(002).pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No Breach of the Protection Obligation by QCP Capital","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/10/no-breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-qcp-capital","timestamp":"2022-10-25","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2022] SGPDPCS 16\n\nCase No. DP-2108-B8816\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nQCP Capital Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 30 August 2021, QCP Capital Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal data\nbreach that had occurred through an unauthorised access to employee\naccounts and exfiltration of customer personal data (the “Incident”).\n\n2. As a result of the Incident, the personal data of 675 individuals was exfiltrated.\nThe personal data affected includes name, NRIC number, date of birth,\naddress, passport scan, passport number, photograph, email address, phone\nnumber, Telegram and WeChat ID, whitelisted address and trading records\n(which included the account balances, buy/sell/settlement activities).\n\nPage 1 of 3\n\n\f3. The Organisation engaged an external cybersecurity company, Blackpanda Pte\nLtd, to investigate the Incident. Its investigations found that the threat actor(s)\nhad accessed two accounts, belonging to one employee, to gain unauthorised\naccess to the Organisation systems and subsequently exfiltrated of personal\ndata.\n\n4. Investigations revealed that the Organisation had provided and made\nreasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its possession\nand/or control in relation to the Incident. The Organisation also had an internal\nmonitoring system in place which allowed the Organisation to detect, escalate\nthe anomalous transaction, flag and suspend the trading account affected.\n\n5. Following the Incident, the Organisation took prompt and extensive remedial\naction to mitigate the effects of the Incident and enhance the overall robustness\nof its security measures. This included notifying the affected individuals,\nlayering access controls and introducing mandatory hardware key access\nauthentication.\n\n6.

On 16 June 2021, Cognita Asia Holdings Pte Ltd (the \"Organisation\") notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware\nattack on 13 June 2021. The ransomware incident (the \"Incident\") affected the\nservers of three schools run by the Organisation.\n\n2. The ransomware encrypted the personal data of 1,260 individuals, of which 1,195\nare students. The personal data included copies of identification/passport page,\nsalaries of the affected employees and the bank account details necessary for the\ncrediting of salaries.\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\f3. The Organisation’s internal investigations found that the threat actor gained initial\nentry to one of the school's network in April 2021 through a VPN session. The VPN\nlogs showed no brute-force entry attempts, suggesting the use of compromised\nadministrator account credentials. Investigations disclosed that between 8 and 12\nJune 2021, the threat actor gained broad network access and deployed the\nencrypting ransomware.\n\n4. The Organisation requested that this matter proceed via the Expedited Decision\nBreach Procedure, which the Commission acceded to. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. It also admitted to a breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct (the \"PDPA\"), also referred to as the Protection Obligation.\n\n5. At the time of the Incident, even though the Organisation employed VPN, the\nOrganisation’s existing configuration of VPN required merely a username and\npassword for authentication. However, the personal data collected and processed\nby the Organisation included copies of the photographic identification documents\nof students as well as salary and bank account information of employees. In view\nof the nature of personal data that it holds, the Organisation needed a higher level\nof security and stronger access control for its administrator accounts, such as multifactor authentication for VPN connection to its administrator accounts to protect\nsuch personal data.\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\f6. The Organisation also failed to have reasonable password policies or ensure\ncompliance with their existing password policies. The Organisation did not enforce\ntheir password policies in the following areas:\n(i) Although the Organisation's password policy specified a minimum\nrequirement of 10 characters, in practice the requirement that was enforced by\ntheir IT systems was only 8 characters; and\n(ii) Its password policy of requiring the default password to be changed after the\nfirst usage was not enforced.\n\n7. The Commission's Handbook on \"How to Guard Against Common Types of Data\nBreaches\", which is complemented by the \"Checklists to Guard Against Common\nType of Data Breaches\", has identified poor management of accounts and\npasswords as one of the five common causes and types of data breaches.\nOrganisations must adopt, implement, and enforce a strong password policy as a\nnecessary measure of data protection.\n\n8. Finally, the Organisation also failed to ensure that personal data protection training\nwas conducted for its staff. In this regard, the Commission wishes to reiterate that\nstaff training in personal data protection is an important and necessary component\nof the Protection Obligation of an organisation.\n\n9. In light of the above, the Organisation is found to have breached section 24 of the\nPDPA.\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\f10. The Commission acknowledged that, the Organisation informed the relevant\nstakeholders of the Incident and implemented real time threat monitoring and Deep\nand Dark Web monitoring for potentially exposed personal data.\n\n11. The Organisation also undertook remedial actions to mitigate the effects of the\nIncident and improve the robustness of its security measures. This included the\nengagement of a cybersecurity expert to investigate the cause of the Incident and\nworking together with the said expert to enact a Remediation Plan.\n\n12. The Remediation Plan included measures such as, enforcing multi-factor\nauthentication of all staff accounts, enhancing the password requirements for\nadministrator accounts, and increasing the frequency of security reviews and cyber\nsecurity trainings for its staff.\n\n13. The Organisation also conducted security awareness webinars and offered a 12\nmonths’ personal identity monitoring services to all the staff and parents (who can\nsign up on behalf of the affected students) of these three schools.\n\n14. The Commission’s decision to require payment of a financial penalty, and on the\nquantum of the penalty, took into account sections 48J(1) and 48J(6) of the PDPA,\nand all the relevant circumstances of the case. This included the Organisation's\nadmission of breach of the Protection Obligation, which the Commission considers\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\fis a significant mitigating factor. Having considered all the facts of this case, the\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\nS$26,000.\n\n15. The Organisation must make payment of the financial penalty within 30 days from\nthe date of the notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\n16. In view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, the Commission will not\nissue any directions under section 48I of the PDPA.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

On 1 September 2021, the Organisation\ninformed the Commission that a threat actor had exfiltrated and deleted customers’\npersonal data from its IT systems (the “Incident”).\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested for the investigation to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision procedure. In this regard, the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and admitted to the facts set out below, and admitted that it had\nfailed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data\naccessed and exfiltrated in the Incident in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation is incorporated in Singapore, and is a telecommunications\n\noperator that holds a Facilities-Based Operations licence (“FBO Licence”) under\nSection 5 of the Telecommunications Act 1999.\n4\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation accepted customer orders for\n\nmobile services through its Mobile Order Portal (“Portal”). The Organisation’s\ncustomers who applied for mobile services would submit their customer identity\nverification and number portability documents (the “KYC documents”) through the\nPortal, and the Portal would store the KYC documents in a bucket (the “Bucket”) on\ncloud-storage procured from Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\f5\n\nWhile the Bucket was publicly accessible, its access was restricted through the\n\nuse of an access key (the “Access Key”) in the Amazon Identity and Access\nManagement feature. The Access Key could only be used to access the Bucket and\nno other AWS accounts, systems or bucket used by the Organisation. The Access Key\nwas stored in the source code of the Portal to facilitate the transfer of the KYC\ndocuments submitted through the Portal, to the Bucket.\n6\n\nOn 29 August 2021 (SGT), the Organisation became aware that an external\n\nactor had accessed and exfiltrated the KYC documents submitted by customers\napplying for mobile services. The Organisation received an email from the external\nactor threatening to publish the downloaded customer data unless a ransom was paid.\n7\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation engaged an IT forensic investigator\n\n(among others) to assist in its incident response. Investigations revealed that the\nexternal actor had utilised the Access Key to access the Bucket. Fortunately, the\ncompromised Access Key could not be used by the external actor to access the\nOrganisation’s other AWS accounts, systems or buckets. However, an unusually large\nvolume of data had been downloaded from the Bucket before it was deleted.\n8\n\nWhile the Organisation was unable to determine with certainty how the external\n\nactor had obtained the Access Key, the Organisation determined that the external\nactor had likely obtained the Access Key through two vulnerabilities identified within\nthe Portal, namely:\n(a)\n\nThe disclosure of the Access Key in the Portal’s functionality which\n\ndisplayed technical information; and\n(b)\n\nThe disclosure of the Access Key in the Portal’s source code repository\n\nwhich was available to all the Organisation’s developers, one of whom may\nhave inadvertently disclosed the Access Key.\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\f9\n\nThe personal data of 79,388 of the Organisation’s customers was accessed\n\nand exfiltrated in the Incident, comprising the following:\n(a)\n\nFor 75,026 Singapore citizens and permanent residents: Scanned\ncopies of both sides of NRIC and work pass cards, which included the\ncustomer’s full name, address, date of birth, gender, race, place of birth,\nfull NRIC number, photograph, thumbprint, date of issuance of card, (for\nEmployment Passes only) employer and nationality, and (for\nDependant’s Passes only) nationality;\n\n(b)\n\nFor 4,362 foreigners: Scanned copies of residential address documents\nsuch as utility bill, tenancy agreement or insurance policy, which included\nthe customer’s name, address and other information; and\n\n(c)\n\nFor 3,631 customers porting an existing mobile service: porting form\nwhich included the customer’s full name and mobile phone number.\n\n(collectively, the “Customer Data”).\nRemedial actions\n10\n\nFollowing the Incident, as part of remedial actions, the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nRevoked the Access Key and issued a replacement key for the Bucket;\n\n(b)\n\nRemoved environment configuration files from the Organisation’s Portal\n\nthat exposed the Access Key;\n(c)\n\nReviewed activities across all accounts and buckets to ensure that the\n\ncompromise was isolated to a single bucket;\n(d)\n\nRestricted access to buckets to specific IP addresses through a block-\n\nall-with exception policy;\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f(e)\n\nEnabled version control on buckets that were not previously\n\ncontrolled/managed;\n(f)\n\nReviewed to ensure all buckets are private and in line with AWS’ best\n\npractices;\n(g)\n\nReviewed to ensure all access keys are rotated;\n\n(h)\n\nConsolidated all AWS accounts with central monitoring enabled;\n\n(i)\n\nCleaned up DNS registry across the Organisation’s IT landscape;\n\n(j)\n\nIssued a notification to the affected customers, recommending actions\n\nto minimise the risks of identify fraud and social engineering, and offering the\naffected customers six months of complimentary credit monitoring services;\n(k)\n\nConducted dark web monitoring from 3 September 2021 to 3 October\n\n2021 to verify whether the exfiltrated data have been published; and\n(l)\n\nCommissioned\n\nthe\n\ndevelopment\n\nof\n\na\n\nprogramme\n\nof\n\nsecurity\n\nimprovements for the Organisation’s systems in order to reduce the risk of\nsecurity incidents.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n11\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an\n\norganisation to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). The Organisation is required under the Protection Obligation to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements to prevent the risk of unauthorised\ndisclosure of the Customer Data, notwithstanding that the data was hosted on a\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fvendor’s cloud service. This is because the Organisation retains control over such\ndata. In Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11 (“Commeasure”) at [11], the\nCommission found that even though a vendor was responsible for the security of the\ncloud infrastructure that it provided to the organisation, the organisation bore ultimate\nresponsibility under the Protection Obligation for making reasonable security\narrangements to protect all the customers’ data under its control.\n12\n\nThe reasonableness of the Organisation’s security arrangements to protect the\n\nCustomer Data would be assessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such\npersonal data. As stated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts\nin the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 1 October 2021) (“Advisory Guidelines”)\nat [17.3], an organisation should design and organise its security arrangements to fit\nthe nature of the personal data held by the organisation and the possible harm that\nmight result from a security breach, and implement robust policies and procedures for\nensuring appropriate levels of security for personal data of varying levels of sensitivity.\n13\n\nIn the course of its business, the Organisation collected and retained copies of\n\nits customers’ KYC documents such as NRICs and work passes, which contained their\nCustomer Data, in compliance with its FBO Licence.1 At the time of the Incident, the\nOrganisation had in its control a high volume of sensitive personal data:\n(a)\n\nHigh volume of Customer Data: At the time of the Incident, the\n\nOrganisation had in its control the Customer Data of almost 80,000 individuals.\n(b)\n\nSensitivity of Customer Data: The Customer Data included the\n\ncustomers’ full NRIC numbers, photographs, thumbprints, and dates of\nissuance of their NRIC cards. The sensitivity of such information is heightened\n\n1 Under its FBO Licence, the Organisation is required to (i) maintain a register containing records of its\n\ncustomers, including the customers’ identity number such as NRIC number, (ii) make and keep a\nphotocopy of its customers’ NRIC, passport or employment pass as evidence of the customers’ identity,\nand (iii) keep the register of the customers for at least 12 months from the date of termination of its\nservices to the customers (among others).\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fand there is an increased risk, for example, of identity theft, as the information\ncould enable access to other services provided by the Government.\n14\n\nAccordingly, the Organisation should have implemented stronger security\n\nmeasures to protect the Customer Data.\n15\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Organisation failed to put in place such\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Customer Data and was determined\nto be in breach of the Protection Obligation (as also admitted by the Organisation). In\nparticular, the Organisation failed to implement sufficiently robust processes to\nmanage the Access Key, and also failed to implement reasonable security controls for\nits AWS environment.\nFailure to implement sufficiently robust processes to manage Access Key\n16\n\nThe Organisation’s Protection Obligation required it to protect the Access Key,\n\nwhich allowed access to the Customer Data in the Bucket. As stated in Commeasure\nat [12], AWS has, in its “Reference Guide – AWS security credentials” (“AWS\nReference Guide”), advised users to protect the access keys as “anyone who has the\naccess keys for your AWS account root user has unrestricted access to all resources\nin your AWS account”.2\n17\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to implement sufficiently robust processes to\n\nprotect the Access Key.\n18\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the Access Key could be\n\ndisclosed through the Portal’s functionality to display technical information, at\nhttps://mobile.myrepublic.com.sg/php-info. The functionality, known as “PHP Info”, is\na standard function of the PHP programming environment and helps programmers to\nunderstand the configuration of the environment. The “PHP Info” function is invoked\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html – see “Best\npractices for managing AWS access keys” (last accessed on 5 August 2022).\nPage 7 of 11\n2\n\n\fby executing a PHP script file. Thereafter, if the php-info URL is accessed, the browser\nwill display the Portal’s operating system environment variable values. These values\nincluded the Access Key, which was used by the Portal to access and transfer\ndocuments submitted by customers through the Portal to the Bucket. This was a\nsignificant vulnerability as anyone who knew or could guess the php-info URL could\nobtain the Access Key and use it to access the Customer Data in the Bucket. The\nOrganisation also determined that this was the most likely way in which the external\nactor had obtained the Access Key. The Organisation should not have left the Access\nKey publicly accessible through the php-info URL. Instead, the Organisation could\nhave disabled the “PHP Info” function or moved the Access Key from the Portal’s\nsystem environment variables to configuration files available only to authorised\nparties.\n19\n\nFurther, the Organisation informed the Commission that the Access Key was\n\nembedded in the Portal’s source code available to all the Organisation’s developers\nvia the source code repository. This was another way through which the external actor\ncould have obtained the Access Key or one of the developers with access could have\ninadvertently disclosed it. The Commission has held in Commeasure at [12] that\nembedding AWS access keys into the source code of applications poses a clear\nsecurity risk. In the AWS Reference Guide, AWS has likewise cautioned users not to\n“embed access keys directly into code”. The Organisation could have stored the\nAccess Key in a file that is separate from the source code and secured with separate\naccess controls, or it could have utilised third party solutions for the management of\naccess keys.\n20\n\nIn addition, the Access Key was captured in the clear in mobile order application\n\nlog files made available to employees, including external developers and engineers,\nwho did not require such information for their functions. If the Organisation wanted to\nstore credentials such as the Access Key in its log files (e.g. for development\npurposes), it should have implemented reasonable security measures such as a log\nfile redaction mechanism to prevent disclosure of such credentials.\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\f21\n\nIn view of the above, the Organisation was found in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement sufficiently robust processes to manage the\nAccess Key.\nFailure to implement reasonable security controls for AWS environment\n22\n\nApart from the Organisation’s failures in its management of the Access Key, the\n\nOrganisation also failed to implement reasonable security controls for its AWS\nenvironment.\n23\n\nThe Commission had stated in the Guide to Data Protection by Design for ICT\n\nSystems (2021) (“Guide”) that as a basic practice, organisations should “[e]nsure that\nfiles containing personal data are not accidentally made available on a website or\nthrough a web application”, and “avoid storing personal data in public folders” (at page\n20). In the “Amazon Simple Storage Service – User Guide”, AWS has similarly advised\nits users that “[u]nless [they] explicitly require anyone on the internet to be able to read\nor write to [their] S3 bucket, [they] should ensure that [their] S3 bucket is not public”.3\n24\n\nHowever, as stated at [5] above, the Bucket was publicly accessible. This\n\nsignificantly increased the risk profile of the Bucket as external actors could find the\nBucket and thereafter access, exfiltrate and delete the Customer Data in the Bucket,\nwhich is what occurred in the Incident. Given the high volume and sensitivity of the\nCustomer Data stored in the Bucket, the Bucket should not have been made publicly\navailable. This is especially if the Bucket was meant to interact only with the Portal for\ncustomers to upload KYC documents for retrieval by the Organisation’s back-office\nsystems.\n25\n\nThe Commission had stated in the Guide that organisations should put in place\n\nICT controls to manage data protection risks, including setting appropriate access\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html\n– see\n“Amazon S3 Preventative Security Best Practices” (last accessed on 5 August 2022).\nPage 9 of 11\n3\n\n\fcontrol rules, access rights, and restrictions for specific user roles (at pages 9 and 15).\nAccess to the Bucket should therefore have been restricted to only authorised\napplications or users. In this case, the Organisation sought to restrict access to the\nBucket through the use of the Access Key, but it turned out to be ineffective because\nof the Organisation's handling and inadvertent disclosure of the Access Key, as stated\nabove. The Organisation could also have considered layering its defences, and could\nhave supplemented the Access Key with a “block-all but” exception policy that allows\nonly specific IP addresses to access the Bucket, as implemented by the Organisation\nafter the Incident.\n26\n\nAccordingly, the Organisation was found to be in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for failing to implement reasonable security controls for its AWS\nenvironment.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n27\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, as well as the following mitigating factors:\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt and effective remedial actions, including\n\nnotifying the affected individuals; and\n(b)\n28\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations.\n\nThe Commission also considered the Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of\n\nliability for the Incident.\n\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f29\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $60,000 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n30\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Budgetcars to put in place appropriate contractual provisions, conduct a security audit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the security and maintenance of its website and rectify any security gaps identified in the audit report.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 25 August 2021, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a complaint that the delivery tracking function (the\n“Tracking Function Page”) on the website of Budgetcars Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) could be used to gain access to the personal data belonging to\nanother individual. By changing a few digits of a Tracking ID, the complainant could\naccess the personal data of another individual (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The Organisation is a logistics company delivering parcels to customers\n(“Customers”) on behalf of retailers (“Retailers”).\n\n3. The personal data of 44,357 individuals had been at risk of unauthorised access.\nThe datasets comprised name, address, contact number and photographs of their\nsignatures.\n\n\f4. The Tracking Function Page was set up in December 2020 to allow Retailers and\nCustomers to (i) keep track of the delivery status of their parcels; and (ii) confirm\nthe identity of individuals to collect parcels on their behalf (where applicable). The\nTracking IDs were generated by Retailers and comprised either sequential or nonsequential numbers. Although generated by Retailers, the Organisation adopted\nthe Tracking IDs for use on its own Tracking Function Page that allowed their\ncustomers to track their deliveries, which would disclose personal data listed\nabove. The Protection Obligation therefore required the Organisation to ensure that\nthere were reasonable access controls in its use of the Tracking IDs for giving\naccess to an individual’s personal data.\n\n5. The risk of unauthorised access to personal data from altering numerical\nreferences, both sequential and non-sequential, have featured in the published\ndecisions of the Commission in Re Fu Kwee Kitchen Catering Services [2016]\nSGPDPC 14, and more recently, in Re Ninja Logistics Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC\n39. Insecure direct object reference has long been a well-known security risk to\npersonal data. The Organisation failed to have reasonable access control to the\naffected individuals’ personal data when it simply adopted Tracking IDs generated\nby the Retailers without factoring in this risk.\n\n6. The Organisation also admitted that it did not have in place a process to protect\npersonal data through proper safeguards by archiving personal data relating to a\ncompleted delivery order after a reasonable period of time has lapsed. To reduce\nthe risk of access to personal data through frontend applications, they should be\nremoved and archived within a reasonable time. The Organisation’s failure to do\n\n\fso resulted in more personal data at risk in the Incident than should have been the\ncase.\n\n7. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to be in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n8. Upon being notified by the Commission of the Incident, the Organisation took the\nfollowing remedial measures after the Incident:\na. Removed all personal data from the Tracking Function Page;\nb. Engaged its IT solutions provider to re-examine management of the Tracking\nFunction Page;\nc. Post-delivery expiry of Tracking ID after 14 days; and\nd. Implemented checks to prevent sequential Tracking IDs from being uploaded\nonto the Tracking Function Page.\n\n9. The Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for this matter to be handled\nunder the Commission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This meant that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in\nthis decision. The Organisation also admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of\nthe Personal Data Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n10. In Re Ninja Logistics Pte. Ltd. cited above, the organisation had been aware of the\nrisk from manipulation of Tracking IDs. However, a counter-measure which the\norganisation initially introduced was abandoned due to operational issues and was\nnot replaced. This resulted in a significantly larger dataset (>1.2 million) that was\nexposed to the risk of unauthorised access over a period of close to 2 years. In\n\n\fcomparison, the number of affected individuals in the present case was lower as\nthe Organisation was only handling deliveries for a few Retailers at the time of the\nIncident.\n\n11. Having considered the circumstances set out above and the factors listed in section\n48J(6) of the PDPA, including (i) the Organisation’s upfront voluntary admission of\nliability; and (ii) the prompt remedial action undertaken by the Organisation, the\nCommission considered that it would be appropriate not to require the payment of\na financial penalty but to direct the Organisation to do the following:\na. To put in place the appropriate contractual provisions to set out the obligations\nand responsibilities of both the data controller and data intermediary to protect\nthe Organisation’s personal data, and the parties’ respective roles in protecting\nthe personal data;\nb. To engage qualified security service provider to conduct a thorough security\naudit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the security and\nmaintenance of its website that contains personal data in the Organisation’s\npossession or control;\nc. Provide the full security audit report to the Commission, no later than 60 days\nfrom the date of the issue of this direction;\nd. Rectify any security gaps identified in the security audit report, review and\nupdate its personal data protection policies as applicable within 60 days from\nthe date the security audit report is provided; and\ne. Inform the Commission within 1 week of completion of rectification and\nimplementation in response to the security audit report.\n\n\fThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Crawfort to conduct a security audit of its technical and administrative arrangements for its AWS S3 environment and rectify any security gaps identified in the audit report.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 9 June 2021, Crawfort Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) notified the Personal\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of the sale of the\nOrganisation’s customer data on the dark web (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The personal data of 5,421 customers were affected. The datasets affected\ncomprised NRIC images (front and back), PDF copies of loan contract\n(containing all the information in the NRIC, age, email address, contact number\nand loan amount) and PDF copies of income document (payslip, CPF\nstatements or IRAS Notice of Assessment).\n\n1\n\n\f3. The Organisation engaged external cyber security teams to investigate the\nIncident. The investigation identified an opened S3 server port in the\nOrganisation’s AWS environment as the cause of the Incident.\n\n4. The Organisation explained that it had opened the S3 server port for one week\nduring a data migration exercise sometime on or about 15 April 2020 for\nbusiness continuity purposes. On 3 April 2020, the Singapore government had\nannounced that the country will enter into a Circuit Breaker to contain the\nspread of COVID-19. All non-essential workplaces, including the Organisation,\nhad to be closed from 7 April 2020. In order to continue its business, the\nOrganisation had to pivot its operations so as to allow its staff to work from\nhome and its customers to make loan applications remotely. Within a very short\nperiod, the Organisation had to carry out the data migration exercise and as a\nresult, overlooked conducting a risk assessment prior to conducting the data\nmigration exercise.\n\n5. The opened S3 server port connected directly to the S3 server hosting the S3\nbuckets, which contained the affected personal data. The open remote port\nenabled attempts to connect to the Organisation’s AWS environment from the\ninternet. Furthermore, the S3 bucket containing the affected personal data was\npublicly accessible due to a misconfiguration of the S3 bucket. As a result, the\nthreat actor was able to gain access to the publicly accessible S3 bucket during\nthe one-week period.\n2\n\n\f6. The Organisation the following remedial measures after the Incident:\na. Reset and reconfigured all whitelisted IPs to AWS server;\nb. Reset and reconfigured all VPNs;\nc. Limited the whitelisted IP addresses to its web portal;\nd. Conducted a penetration test;\ne. Monitored the dark web to ensure that data was not circulated;\nf. Engaged independent cyber security consultant to carry out investigation,\nstudy the IT infrastructure and propose improvements to their systems; and\ng. Notified affected individuals.\n\n7. The Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for this matter to be\nhandled under the Commission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This\nmeant that the Organisation had voluntarily provided and unequivocally\nadmitted to the facts set out in this decision. The Organisation also admitted\nthat it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the\n“PDPA”).\n\n8. The Organisation admitted that it failed to conduct a reasonable risk\nassessment before carrying out the data migration exercise. There was no\naccess control to the S3 bucket containing the affected personal data during\nthe week-long migration exercise. This, coupled with the open port, allowed the\nthreat actor to gain access to the affected personal data.\n\n3\n\n\f9. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to be in breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA.\n\n10. Having considered the circumstances set out above and the factors listed in\nsection 48J(6) of the PDPA, including (i) the Organisation’s upfront voluntary\nadmission of liability which significantly reduced the time and resources\nrequired for investigations; and (ii) the prompt remedial actions undertaken by\nthe Organisation, the Commission considered that it would be most appropriate\nin lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to direct the Organisation to comply with\nthe following:\na. To engage qualified security service provider to conduct a thorough security\naudit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the security and\nmaintenance of its AWS S3 environment that contains personal data in the\nOrganisation’s possession or control;\nb.

On 1 June 2021, Audio House Marketing Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware\naffecting its customer database (the “Incident”). Approximately 98,000\nindividuals’ names, addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers, in the\nnature of contact information, were affected.\n\n2. The Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in\n\n1\n\n\fthis decision; and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n3. The Organisation’s internal investigations revealed that PHP files used to develop\na web application on the Organisation’s website contained vulnerabilities that\nallowed the threat actor to carry out a SQL injection attack. The Organisation\nadmitted that it is possible that the vulnerabilities in the PHP files had existed since\nApril 2017, when its website was first launched. Further, even though the\nOrganisation had conducted pre-launch tests prior to the launch of its website, the\nOrganisation admitted that it failed to identify and detect the existing vulnerabilities\nin the PHP files.\n\n4. SQL injection attacks are well-known vulnerabilities: see “Top Ten” list of the Open\nWeb Application Security Project (OWASP). The Commission has consistently\nadvised organisations to take the necessary precautions to guard against the risk\nof injection attacks (see para. 15.3 of the Commission’s Guide to Securing\nPersonal Data in Electronic Medium, published on 8 May 2015, and revised on 20\nJanuary 2017). We note that apart from conducting functionality testing of features\nsuch as the shopping cart and payment on its website, the Organisation did not\nconduct any vulnerability scanning and assessment that would have provided a\nreasonable opportunity to discover the vulnerabilities in the PHP files that were\neventually exploited in the Incident.\n\n5. Compounding the above, the Organisation also did not conduct reasonable\nperiodic security review. A reasonable periodic security review would include\n\n2\n\n\fvulnerability scanning and assessments, which would have offered the\nOrganisation the opportunity to detect any vulnerabilities that were not detected\nduring the pre-launch tests, or any vulnerabilities that may have arisen since.\n\n6. Periodic security reviews is also a practice that the Commission has consistently\nadvised organisations to adopt. In our Checklists to Guard against Common Types\nof Data Breaches, the Commission highlighted that conducting a periodic security\nreview is a basic practice that all organisations ought to embrace. This is also\nreiterated in para. 6.1(a) of the Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in\nElectronic Medium where we stated that it was a good practice for organisations to\n“conduct regular ICT security audits, scans and tests to detect vulnerabilities and\nnon-compliance with organizational standards”, and Table 13(f) of the same Guide\nwhere we encouraged organisations to perform web application scanning and\nsource code analysis to help detect common web vulnerabilities, in particular,\nthose identified in the “Top Ten” list of the OWASP, which includes SQL injection\nattacks.\n\n7. With the use of IT comes the responsibility for data security in IT systems. We urge\norganisations who may be unable to conduct such security reviews on their own to\nengage the necessary expertise from the professionals.\n\n8. Having said that, we note that the Organisation’s website was built by a company,\nwhich the Organisation’s main IT vendor had engaged on the Organisation’s\nbehalf. The Organisation did not have any contract with the company that\ndeveloped the website. As a result, the Organisation failed to stipulate clear job\n\n3\n\n\fspecifications or any data protection requirements on the company that developed\nits website. There was also an absence of any data protection requirements in the\nOrganisation’s contract with its main IT vendor, who it relied upon to manage and\nmaintain its IT systems. The Commission’s published decisions1 have emphasized\nthat organisations engaging IT vendors should – a) stipulate personal data\nprotection requirements on the vendors, b) make clear the job specifications,\nespecially where they include security maintenance and software updates, and,\nlast but not least, c) exercise reasonable oversight over the vendor responsible for\nthe technical capabilities of the organisation so as to offer adequate protection to\nthe types of personal data that may be affected by the engagement of the vendor.\nIn cases where sub-contracting is contemplated, the Organisation should have\nidentified requirements in its main contract that it requires its main IT vendor to\nimpose similar obligations on and exercise adequate oversight over its subcontractor.\n\n9. In light of the above, the Organisation is found to have breached the Protection\nObligation under section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n10. In deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered the\nOrganisation’s cooperation throughout the investigation, the Organisation’s\nvoluntary admission of breach of the Protection Obligation, and the prompt\nremediation actions taken. This included disabling the use of its website on the\nsame day of the Incident, reformatting of its webserver, adding security against\nSQL injections and the implementation of vulnerable assessment and penetration\n\n1\n\nSee Jigyasa [2020] SGPDPC 9 and Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15\n4\n\n\ftesting.

Ltd.\n[2021] SGPDPC 7\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2007-B6670\n6 August 2021\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 14 July 2020 and 21 July 2020, a customer relationship management portal (“the\n\nPortal”) owned and operated by Terra Systems Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) containing the\npersonal data of persons served with “Stay-Home Notices” 1 (“SHNs”) was accessed and\nmodified without the Organisation’s authorisation (the “Incident”).\n2\n\nOn 27 July 2020, the Singapore Police Force notified the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (“Commission”) of the Incident, and the Commission commenced its own\ninvestigations thereafter.\nBackground\n3\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of providing communication solutions and services,\n\nincluding call centre services, to businesses in Singapore and the region. On 17 June 2020, the\nOrganisation was awarded a government contract to provide call centre services to help verify\nthe whereabouts of persons serving SHNs (“the Call Centre”).\n4\n\nTo facilitate the operations of the Call Centre, the Immigration and Checkpoints\n\nAuthority (“ICA”) provided the Organisation with a daily spreadsheet containing the personal\ndata of persons serving SHNs, including their:\n(a)\n\nName\n\n(b)\n\nLast 4 digits of NRIC;\n\n1\n\nLegal notices issued under the Infectious Diseases Act (Cap 137) requiring a person to remain at their place of\nresidence or at a Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility at all times for a stipulated period\n\n1\n\n\f(c)\n\nGender;\n\n(d)\n\nContact Number;\n\n(e)\n\nLast Day of SHN;\n\n(f)\n\nAddress where SHN was served; and\n\n(g)\n\nCOVID-19 Test Appointment dates\n\n(collectively, the “SHN Data”)\n5\n\nThe Organisation created the Portal for the purposes of its internal administration of the\n\nCall Centre. On account of the movement restrictions in force at the time owing to the COVID19 pandemic, the Portal was designed to be accessible by the Organisation’s staff from home\nvia the Internet.\n6\n\nUsers in the Organisation were granted different levels of access to the Portal:\n(a)\n\nDirectors and managers were assigned unique user IDs and passwords and were\n\nable to view all cases in the Portal.\n(b)\n\nTeam leaders were also assigned unique user IDs and passwords and were able\n\nto view all cases assigned to agents in their teams.\n(c)\n\nAgents (i.e. the persons actually contacting the persons serving SHNs) were\n\ntemporary staff assigned simple user IDs based on their respective teams (e.g. the user\nID “D03” referred to agent number 3 in team D). Agents were also given a common\ndaily password which was shared with them during a morning Zoom briefing by the\nOrganisation’s management.\n7\n\nAgents logged in to the Portal were only able to view the cases assigned to them, and\n\ntype in remarks in a specific “remarks” column after a case had been attended to. At the end of\neach day, the SHN Data would be submitted to ICA with the agents’ remarks, and all data in\nthe Portal would be purged.\n8\n\nOn 14 July 2020, crude remarks were found to have been inserted in the remarks field\n\nof 3 cases in the Portal. The two agents assigned to deal with those cases and their team leader\n2\n\n\fdenied inserting the remarks. The Organisation changed the common password for the day and\nbegan informing agents of the new daily common password via Whatsapp instead. The\nOrganisation also implemented a web server logging function to track the actions of users\nlogged in to the Portal. This functionality had not enabled previously.\n9\n\nOn 21 July 2020, another crude remark was inserted in the remarks field of a case\n\nassigned to one of the same agents. The Organisation traced the action to an unauthorized user\nbased on the IP address from which the Portal was accessed and reported the Incident to the\npolice.\n10\n\nThe perpetrator of the Incident is believed to be a disgruntled ex-employee of the\n\nOrganisation. On 14 July 2020, the perpetrator is believed to have obtained the daily common\npassword by attending the morning Zoom briefing, after obtaining the login details for the\nmorning Zoom briefing from other employees. On 21 July 2020, the perpetrator is believed to\nhave directly obtained the daily common password from another employee who was unaware\nthat his employment had been terminated.\n11\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial\n\nactions on ICA’s instructions:\n(a)\n\nThe practice of using common passwords was ceased, and agents were required\n\nto adopt unique passwords,\n(b)\n\nAgents were assigned unique user IDs which were different from the generic\n\nIDs based on their teams;\n(c)\n\nTwo-factor authentication was implemented for all access to the Portal; and\n\n(d)\n\nSecurity scanning was performed on the Portal.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n12\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\n\n3\n\n\funauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks\n(“Protection Obligation”).\n13\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Organisation is found to have failed to implement\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the SHN Data from the risk of unauthorised access.\nFailure to implement reasonable IT access controls\n14\n\nFirstly, the Organisation failed to implement reasonable IT access controls to the SHN\n\nData in the Portal. The use of (i) generic user IDs for agents which were known to all or\nguessable, and (ii) a daily common password for all agents, were poor practices that posed\nserious security risks.\n15\n\nEmploying simple user IDs and a common password defeated the purpose of\n\nsegregating agents’ access to cases in the Portal. Any agent could have accessed another agent’s\ncases by using that agent’s commonly known or guessable user ID and the common password.\nWhile there is only evidence that the perpetrator in this case accessed and modified the SHN\nData of 4 persons (based on the distinct cases in the Portal in which crude remarks were\ninserted), the perpetrator could have accessed the SHN Data of all 125 persons assigned to his\nformer team.\n16\n\nThe Incident could have been prevented had all agents been assigned unique user IDs\n\nand passwords.\nFailure to implement policies to mitigate risks from using common password\n17\n\nSecondly, the Organisation failed to implement adequate policies to mitigate the risks\n\ncreated by the use of a daily common password to access the Portal. Having made the decision\nto use a common password for access to the Portal, the Organisation attempted to identify the\nassociated risks and adopt suitable policies and practices. Unfortunately, their efforts proved\nto be inadequate\n18\n\nThe Organisation clearly recognised some risks associated with use of a common\n\npassword – this was why they adopted the practice of changing the common password daily.\nHowever, it was foreseeable that agents would ask each other for the daily common password,\n4\n\n\ffor example, when they had forgotten the password or had missed the morning Zoom briefing.\nAn agent may not have suspected that anything was amiss if someone they believed to be\nanother agent had asked them for the daily password or the login details for the morning Zoom\nbriefing. This risk was exacerbated by the fact that all of the agents were temporary staff and\nthat personnel changes were to be expected. Thus, on both 14 July 2020 and 21 July 2020, the\nperpetrator is believed to have obtained either the login details for the morning Zoom briefing\nor the common daily password itself from the Organisation’s employees.\n19\n\nIf the Organisation had properly appreciated this risk, it could have implemented\n\npolicies (i) prohibiting agents from disseminating or sharing the daily common password under\nany circumstances, and (ii) requiring any agents who missed the daily morning Zoom briefings\nto obtain the daily common passwords directly from their team leaders or managers, who would\nbe better placed to verify the requestor’s employment status. Admittedly, such policies would\nhave been difficult to police. However, they would have at least reduced the risk of disclosure\nof the common password to unauthorised persons.\n20\n\nIt is acknowledged that the Organisation was under pressure to operationalise the Call\n\nCentre and Portal within a short timeframe to support ICA’s operations in the midst of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Even so, its failures to implement reasonable access controls gave rise\nto the present Incident. The Organisation failed to make reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect the SHN Data from unauthorised access and modification in breach of its obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n21\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation under\n\nsection 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\nconsidered, with particular emphasis on the following aggravating and mitigating factors:\nAggravating Factor\n(a)\n\nThe SHN Data was sensitive in nature considering the climate of the COVID-\n\n19 pandemic and unauthorised disclosure could have caused the individuals to\nexperience discrimination or social stigma;\n5\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n\n22\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had to operationalise the Portal under urgent circumstances;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following the Incident; and\n\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the investigations.\n\nHaving considered the above factors and circumstances, the Commissioner\n\npreliminarily determined that a financial penalty of $12,000 would be imposed in respect of\nthe Organisation’s negligent contravention of the Protection Obligation. On 22 April 2021, the\nOrganisation was notified of the Commissioner’s preliminary decision, including the full\nfindings set out above, and given 14 days to make written representations.\nThe Organisation’s representations\n23\n\nOn 7 May 2021, the Organisation submitted written representations requesting that it\n\nbe issued a warning in lieu of a financial penalty. While the Organisation did not dispute that\nit had breached the Protection Obligation, it claimed that the circumstances of its case were\nsimilar or less egregious to recent enforcement decisions of the Commission in which warnings\nhad been given to organisations for breaches of the Protection Obligation2.\n24\n\nAccording to the Organisation, unlike in the precedent cases cited:\n(a)\n\nOnly 4 individuals’ personal data was affected in the Incident (i.e. a very low\n\nnumber);\n(b)\n\nThe personal data affected (i.e. the SHN Data) was not sensitive;\n\n(c)\n\nThere was no exfiltration or public exposure of the SHN Data;\n\n(d)\n\nPrompt remedial measures were implemented within 48 hours with no loss of\n\npersonal data; and\n\n2\n\nChan Brothers Travel Pte Ltd (DP-1905-B3936, Summary of the Decision); Horizon Fast Ferry Pte Ltd (DP1912-B5464, Summary of the Decision); MRI Diagnostics Pte Ltd (DP-1811-B2975, Summary of the\nDecision); Water+Plants Lab Pte Ltd (DP-2004-B6182, Summary of the Decision); R.I.S.E Aerospace Pte Ltd\n(DP-2007-B6832, Summary of the Decision); Everlast Projects Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 20; Chapel of Christ\nthe Redeemer (DP-2010-B7132, Summary of the Decision); St Joseph’s Institution International Ltd (DP-2010B7196, Summary of the Decision); and ACCA Singapore Pte Ltd (DP-2011-B7385, Summary of the Decision).\n\n6\n\n\f(e)\n\nReports were voluntarily made to the authorities (including ICA and the police)\n\nand the Organisation was not held to ransom or complained about by any members of\nthe public.\n25\n\nThe Organisation also claimed that unauthorised disclosure of the SHN Data would not\n\nhave caused the affected individuals to experience discrimination or social stigma. The\nOrganisation claimed that it was normal for anyone entering Singapore at the time to be subject\nto an SHN, and that many persons had even publicised this fact. With reference to the precedent\ncases cited, the Organisation claimed that the disclosure of (i) students’ grades, (ii) church\nmembers’ marital statuses, and (iii) employees’ salaries, carried a greater risk of the affected\npersons experiencing discrimination or social stigma in the relevant circumstances.\n26\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Organisation’s representations were rejected.\n\n27\n\nWhile there may have been facts in specific domains of the precedent cases which\n\nappeared either similar or more egregious than the Incident, this did not mean that the\nOrganisation was deserving of a warning. Every case is decided based on an evaluation of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances, and in a manner that is fair and appropriate for the\nparticular organisation investigated.\n28\n\nThere are two main distinguishing factors which justifies the imposition of a financial\n\npenalty in the Organisation’s case compared to the precedent cases cited:\n(a)\n\nFirst, contrary to the Organisation’s representations, the SHN Data is considered\n\nto have been sensitive at the material time, during the early days of the COVID-19\npandemic when there was uncertainty about its virulence and high levels of public\nhealth concerns. The Organisation was engaged to help administer the SHN regime as\npart of a national effort to manage the pandemic. While the SHN Data did not include\npositive diagnoses for COVID-19, the fact of being subject to an SHN nevertheless\ndenoted risk of exposure to the virus. The fact that the Incident occurred in July 2020\njust after the end of “circuit breaker” measures and when public concern was high, was\nimportant context.\n(b)\n\nSecond, within the same context of a national health emergency, the\n\nOrganisation’s level of culpability was much higher than that of the organisations in\n7\n\n\fthe cited precedents. The Organisation employed very poor access control measures\nwhich were easily circumvented by an unsophisticated actor. A common password was\nused by over 50 users and shared over an unsecure platform, with no audit trail. While\nthe Organisation’s representations focused solely on the alleged harm caused by the\nIncident and the remedial steps taken afterwards, the extent of the Organisation’s\nnegligence in the Incident was also an important factor which justified the imposition\nof a financial penalty in its case.\n29\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation’s representations also failed to account that the\n\npersonal data of 125 individuals was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access in the Incident,\nnotwithstanding that only 4 records had been modified. In any event, the fact that the Incident\nonly affected a limited number of persons has been taken into account in calibrating the\nquantum of the financial penalty imposed. Other factors raised by the Organisation such as the\nprompt implementation of remedial measures and voluntary reporting have similarly been\naccounted for.\n30\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby\n\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $12,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in\nthe Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n31\n\nIn view of the remedial actions that have already been taken by the Organisation, no\n\nother directions are necessary.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $67,000 was imposed on Quoine for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance"],"date":"2022-07-14","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Quoine-Pte-Ltd---08022022.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Quoine","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/07/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-quoine","timestamp":"2022-07-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 2\n\nCase No. DP-2011-B7409 / DP-2011-B7421\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nQuoine Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fQuoine Pte Ltd\n[2022] SGPDPC 2\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case Nos. DP-2011-B7409 / DP-2011-B7421\n8 February 2022\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 17 November 2020, Quoine Pte Ltd (“the Organisation”) informed the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”) that its domain manager\nhad transferred control of its domain hosting account to an external actor, who\naccessed and exfiltrated the personal data of 652,564 of its customers (“the\nIncident”). The Commission subsequently received a complaint from an individual\nbelieved to have been affected in the Incident.\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested for the investigation to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision procedure. In this regard, the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and admitted to the facts set out below, and admitted that it had\nfailed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data\naccessed and exfiltrated in the Incident in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a company incorporated and based in Singapore, and a\n\nsubsidiary of Liquid Group Inc., which is incorporated in Japan. The Organisation\noperates a global cryptocurrency exchange under the “Liquid” brand, and has\ncustomers around the world.\n4\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation’s back-end IT infrastructure\n\nincluded the following:\n\n\f(a)\n\nIts vendor-procured cloud computing platform (“Cloud Platform”) which\n\nit used to run its cryptocurrency exchange platform, and which hosted its cloud\ncomputing database; and\n(b)\n\nIts additional cloud computing storage procured from another vendor,\n\nwhich it used to store documents such as Know-Your-Client (“KYC”)\ndocuments.\n5\n\nThe Organisation also engaged a third party domain name registrar (“the\n\nDomain Provider”) to register and host the Organisation’s domain (@quoine.com\ndomain). A domain name registrar allows a party to purchase and register domain\nnames, where the domain name translates to a public address of the party’s servers\n(e.g. webserver, email server) for routing purposes.\n6\n\nOn 13 November 2020, a staff member of the Organisation received an email\n\nfrom the Domain Provider stating that changes had been made to the settings of the\nOrganisation’s domain hosting account with the Domain Provider (@quoine.com\ndomain) (“Domain Hosting Account”). Staff members also received password reset\nemails for accounts on the Organisation’s other file-sharing and office productivity\nservices. As the Organisation had not requested for the changes, the Organisation\nfollowed up with the Domain Provider, who acknowledged that the Organisation’s\nemail accounts on its domain with the Domain Provider were no longer routed to the\nOrganisation.\n7\n\nInvestigations revealed that:\n(a)\n\nAs a result of social engineering attacks on employees of the Domain\n\nProvider, an employee of the Domain Provider incorrectly transferred control of\nthe Organisation’s Domain Hosting Account to an external actor. This allowed\nthe external actor to change the registered email address on the Organisation’s\nDomain Hosting Account and subsequently effect a password reset on the\naccount to take control of the Domain Hosting Account.\n\n\f(b)\n\nControl of the Domain Hosting Account allowed the external actor to\n\nknow the number of servers using the domain name, and the IP addresses of\nthese servers.\n(c)\n\nWith control of the Domain Hosting Account, the external actor changed\n\nthe servers to which the Organisation’s email traffic was directed (i.e. via\nchanges to the Organisation’s mail exchanger (MX) records), from the email\nservers used by the Organisation to the external actor’s email servers. This\nredirected all of the Organisation’s emails to the external actor’s email servers.\nAccording to the Organisation, this impacted the Organisation’s security\nmonitoring capability as many alerts and notifications, which were distributed\nvia email, were consequently redirected to the external actor’s email servers.\nThe Organisation’s staff members continued to receive emails notifying of\nchanges to the settings of the Domain Hosting Account (referred to at [6] above)\non alternative recovery options that had been set up.\n(d)\n\nHaving redirected the Organisation’s emails on the Organisation’s\n\ndomain (@quoine.com domain) to itself, the external actor then initiated\npassword resets for several of the services tied to the Domain Hosting Account.\nThe external actor successfully carried out a password reset on an account\n(“DevOps Account”) used by the Organisation for automation tasks and to run\ncodes throughout the day which was not used interactively by humans.\n(e)\n\nThe external actor then used the DevOps Account’s newly reset\n\ncredentials to access the Organisation’s Cloud Platform, which hosted API\nkeys/token to the Organisation’s database hosted within the Cloud Platform as\nwell as a separate cloud computing storage database (collectively, the\n“Databases”). The external actor thereby gained credentials to the Databases,\nand accessed and exfiltrated personal data stored in the Databases.\n8\n\nThe personal data of 652,564 of the Organisation’s customers was accessed\n\nand exfiltrated in the Incident, comprising the following:\n(a)\n\nFirst name and surname;\n\n(b)\n\nAddress;\n\n\f(c)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(d)\n\nTelephone number (optional);\n\n(e)\n\nPhoto-image of documents provided by 362,035 customers for KYC\npurposes before 13 October 2018, namely, NRIC number, passport\nnumber or other identification documents, proof of address document,\nand photograph;\n\n(f)\n\nFinancial information of Japanese customers of Quoine Corporation, a\nJapanese company related to the Organisation;\n\n(g)\n\nTransaction information: fiat deposits and crypto withdrawals, and a\n2018 record of balances prior to the launch of the current “Liquid\nExchange”; and\n\n(h)\n\nFor customers depositing and withdrawing fiat currencies: Bank account\nand other information, namely, name of the bank, account number and\nname of the account holder.\n\n(collectively, the “Customer Data”).\nRemedial actions\n9\n\nFollowing the Incident, as part of remedial actions, the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nNotified its customers to alert them of the Incident, advised them of\n\nactions to take to secure their accounts, and recommended precautionary\nmeasures to monitor any suspicious activities which may have suggested\nimproper use of their personal information;\n(b)\n\nMoved its domains to a more robust service provider that offered\n\nEnterprise level support, strong access control (username, password and\nmandatory two-factor authentication (“2FA”)) and roles-based access controls;\n(c)\n\nMigrated the entire Liquid exchange to a different vendor-provided cloud\n\ncomputing platform, with additional improvements made in the interactions\nbetween the Organisation’s service accounts and the system; and\n\n\f(d)\n\nStrengthened the use of the DevOps Account, and imposed IP whitelist\n\nrestrictions where appropriate.\n10\n\nThe Organisation is also evaluating other services to further harden its\n\ninfrastructure, including cloud security configuration tools.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n11\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an\n\norganisation to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”).\n12\n\nAs a preliminary point, while the Organisation had engaged the Domain\n\nProvider to host the Organisation’s domain, the Domain Provider did not process any\npersonal data on behalf of the Organisation and was not the Organisation’s data\nintermediary. Due consideration is given to the fact that the initial breach occurred with\nthe Domain Provider. The basis of the Commission’s decision is that the Protection\nObligation in respect of the Customer Data was borne solely by the Organisation and\nthere were failures in respect of how it secured access to its Cloud Platform, leading\nto the unauthorised disclosure of Customer Data.\n13\n\nThe Commission has repeatedly highlighted that an organisation should design\n\nand organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal data held by\nthe organisation and the possible harm that might result from a security breach, and\nimplement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of security\nfor personal data of varying levels of sensitivity (see the Commission’s Advisory\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 1 October\n2021) (“Advisory Guidelines”) at [17.3]; see also Credit Counselling Singapore\n[2017] SGPDPC 18 at [25] and PeopleSearch Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 47 at [10]).\nAs stated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines at [17.5], measures that an\norganisation can use to protect personal data include adopting appropriate access\n\n\fcontrols (e.g. considering stronger authentication measures where appropriate) and\ninstalling appropriate computer security software and using suitable computer security\nsettings.\n14\n\nConsidering the Organisation’s business as a global cryptocurrency exchange\n\nthat regularly deals with a large volume of sensitive personal data of a financial nature,\nthe Organisation’s overall data protection and cybersecurity posture should have been\nvery much heightened. The Organisation was in possession of 822,096 individuals’\nCustomer Data, including photo-image of documents and other information provided\nby 362,035 customers for KYC purposes, cryptocurrency transactions and bank\naccount information. Consequently, the Organisation is required under the Protection\nObligation to have implemented strong security arrangements to protect the Customer\nData held in its Databases.\n15\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation has admitted that it failed to implement\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Customer Data, and that it was in\nbreach of the Protection Obligation. In particular, the Organisation (i) failed to review\nand assess the DevOps Account’s security implications and risks, and (ii) failed to\nimplement reasonable ICT controls for the DevOps Account.\nFailure to review and assess the DevOps Account’s security implications and risks\n16\n\nThe Commission has highlighted in previous decisions the importance of\n\ncarrying out correctly-scoped periodic security reviews, so as to detect vulnerabilities\nand assess security implications and risks, and to ensure that reasonable security\narrangements have been put in place to protect personal data in an organisation’s\ndatabase.\n17\n\nIn WTS Automotive Services Pte.

[2018] SGPDPC 26 (“WTS”), the\n\nCommission highlighted the importance of conducting regular reviews to ensure that\nwebsites collecting personal data and electronic databases storing personal data have\n“reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks”, as personal data of\nindividuals may be exposed if a website or database in which it is stored contains\nvulnerabilities (at [18] of WTS).\n\n\f18\n\nLikewise, in Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11 (“Commeasure”), the\n\norganisation had neglected to include the affected application package and access\nkey (which the threat actor had used to access and exfiltrate personal data in the\norganisation’s cloud database) in its inventory of IT assets in production, which had\nresulted in their omission from its periodic security reviews. The organisation was\nfound in breach of the Protection Obligation on this basis, as the vulnerability could\notherwise have been discovered and the incident could have been prevented (at [16][17] of Commeasure). While the organisation explained that its failure to implement\nsufficiently robust processes to manage its inventory of infrastructure access keys was\nattributable to the high turnover of its employees from the time of its inception to the\ndiscovery of the incident, this was unacceptable because the organisation’s\nresponsibility to protect personal data in its control or possession ought not to have\nbeen subjected to staff movement or appointment (at [13] of Commeasure).\n19\n\nAs held in Chan Brothers Travel Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCS 11 (“Chan\n\nBrothers”), organisations must be aware of security implications of software features\nof their IT systems, so as to configure the security settings to enable effective\nprotection of personal data stored in the IT systems (at [5] of Chan Brothers).\n20\n\nDuring the investigations, the Organisation admitted that its periodic reviews of\n\naccess “failed to acknowledge this weakness as they incorrectly focussed on accounts\nused interactively by humans only, and not the automation bot accounts”. According\nto the Organisation, until the Incident, it was not aware of the vulnerability and\nweakness in access control to the DevOps Account, which did not have 2FA enabled.\nAccordingly, similar to the facts of Commeasure as set out above, although the\nOrganisation had conducted periodic security reviews, these security reviews were\nimproperly scoped, and failed to identify this vulnerability present in the DevOps\nAccount.\n21\n\nThe Organisation also admitted that the DevOps Account “was created without\n\nsufficient due diligence being given to the entire security risk profile of this type of\naccount”, and “[t]his is a vulnerability that had not been adequately assessed by\nimplementing alternative security measures to address the lack of 2FA”.\n\n\f22\n\nThe Organisation had therefore failed to review and assess the security\n\nimplications and risks arising from the DevOps Account and its lack of 2FA. The\nOrganisation’s failures in this regard were especially egregious, given that the DevOps\nAccount had privileged access to the Organisation’s Cloud Platform containing API\nkeys/tokens to the Databases, and consequently, the Customer Data stored in the\nDatabases. If the Organisation had included the DevOps Account in its security review\nand detected the vulnerabilities in the lack of 2FA, and/or had assessed and\nappreciated the security implications and risks arising from the DevOps Account and\nits lack of 2FA, it could have taken reasonable security measures to mitigate these\nsecurity risks and to configure the security settings to enable effective protection of the\nCustomer Data in the Databases.\n23\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission during the investigations that its\n\ncurrent staff were not aware of the reasons for the DevOps Account’s set-up and\nsecurity arrangements, as the DevOps Account had been created “at some time in the\npast (so legacy)”. The Organisation explained that there had been internal personnel\nmovement. For instance, its DevOps team had initially been based in and managed\nout of Tokyo, then Quoine Vietnam. However, by mid-2020, the DevOps Tokyo team\nwas no longer with the Organisation, and the DevOps team that remained was in\nQuoine Vietnam. While we are sympathetic to the challenges presented as a result of\nany personnel movements, it was incumbent on the Organisation to implement the\nnecessary systems and processes to ensure that critical information about its IT\nsystems, including legacy systems, survived the turnover of its staff. As the\nCommission has also held in Commeasure and stated above, an organisation’s\nresponsibility to protect personal data in its control or possession ought not to have\nbeen subjected to staff movement or appointment.\n24\n\nThe Organisation suggested that the DevOps Account’s security risk profile had\n\nnot been assessed, probably due to its intended use as an automation account. This\nwas not accepted. The Organisation is not exempted from assessing the security\nimplications and risks of the DevOps Account simply on the basis that it was an\nautomation account, especially considering that the DevOps Account could be used\nto access the Customer Data stored in the Databases.\n\n\f25\n\nIn view of the above, the Organisation was found to be in breach of the\n\nProtection Obligation for its failure to review and assess the DevOps Account’s\nsecurity implications and risks.\nFailure to implement reasonable ICT controls for DevOps Account\n26\n\nAs stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection by Design for ICT\n\nSystems (2021), organisations should put in place ICT controls to manage data\nprotection risks (at page 9). Examples of ICT controls include setting appropriate\naccess control rules, access rights and restrictions for specific user roles, and\nstrengthening database security (at pages 15 and 18).\n27\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that 2FA had not been\n\nimplemented for the DevOps Account, which had privileged access to the Cloud\nPlatform containing API keys/tokens to the Databases, and consequently, the\nCustomer Data stored in the Databases. This meant that the DevOps Account is an\naccount with privileged access. Many of the Organisation’s other systems and services\nhad implemented 2FA for accounts with privileged access, and these were not\nbreached in the Incident as the external actor could not carry out a password reset on\nthese systems and services. In the present case, the external actor had been able to\naccess the Cloud Platform and the API keys/tokens to the Databases stored therein,\nafter carrying out password reset on the DevOps Account.\n28\n\nThe Organisation could have guarded against this risk by strengthening ICT\n\ncontrols for the DevOps Account. The Organisation could have limited access to the\npassword change functions of its DevOps Account. The Organisation could have\nintroduced an additional restriction on the password change function, by requiring 2FA\nwhenever there is a request to change passwords for the DevOps Account. The\nOrganisation had implemented this additional restriction for many of its systems and\nservices, which were not breached in the Incident as the external actor could not carry\nout a password reset where 2FA was required. The Organisation could likewise have\nimplemented a 2FA requirement for effecting password resets for the DevOps\nAccount. This was an existing policy and practice that the Organisation had for other\n\n\faccounts with privileged access, and it ought to also have been extended to the\nDevOps Account which also had privileged access.\n29\n\nAccordingly, the Organisation was found to be in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for failing to implement reasonable ICT controls for the DevOps Account.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n30\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, as well as the following mitigating factors:\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the\n\naffected individuals; and\n(b)\n31\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations.\n\nThe Commission also considered the Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of\n\nliability for the Incident.\n32\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $67,000 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n33\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Both organisations were found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to complaints regarding alleged collection and disclosure of personal data without consent.","tags":["Consent","Not in Breach","Real Estate","No breach"],"date":"2022-06-16","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---SLP-Scotia-Pte-Ltd-and-SLP-International-Property-Consultants-Pte-Ltd---09042022.pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"No Breach of the Consent Obligation by SLP Scotia and SLP International Property Consultants","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/06/no-breach-of-the-consent-obligation-by-slp-scotia-and-slp-international-property-consultants","timestamp":"2022-06-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2007-B6585, DP-2007-B6591, DP-2007-B6594, DP-2007-B6598\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nSLP Scotia Pte. Ltd.\nSLP International Property Consultants Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. Between 10 to 14 July 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received four complaints against SLP International Property\nConsultants Pte Ltd (“SLPIPC”) and its subsidiary SLP Scotia Pte Ltd (“SLPS”)\n(collectively, the “Organisations”). The complainants were property agents\nregistered through SLPS (the “Complainants”).\n\n2. As a merger was due to take place between the Organisations, on 7 July 2020,\nSLPIPC initiated the registration of salespersons in SLPS as salespersons in\nSLPIPC with the Council of Estate Agencies (“CEA”). CEA thereafter emailed the\nComplainants asking them to either initiate a salesperson application to join\nSLPIPC or disregard the email if they were not interested in registering with\nSLPIPC (the “Incident”).\n\n1\n\n\f3. The Complainants alleged that:\na. they had not consented to be contacted for such purposes; and\nb. SLPS had improperly disclosed their personal data (including NRIC number,\ndate of birth, and home address) to SLPIPC, and SLPIPC had in turn\nimproperly disclosed the data to CEA.\n\n4. CEA is the entity which administers the registration of salespersons (such as the\nComplainants) under the Estate Agents Act 2010 (“EAA”). Pursuant to section\n29(1) of the EAA, a person may not act as a salesperson for any estate agent\nunless he or she is registered; the said register is maintained by the CEA pursuant\nto section 36 of the EAA. Further, under section 40(1) of the EAA, a salesperson\nmay not be registered to act as a salesperson for more than one estate agent at\nany one time.\n\n5. SLPIPC disclosed the personal data of the Complainants to CEA for the purposes\nof the change in registration from SLPS to SLPIPC. In doing so, SLPIPC was\ncomplying with its obligations under the EAA. The disclosure by SLPIPC to CEA\nwas therefore not in breach of any of the provisions of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (“PDPA”), as under section 4(6) of the PDPA, obligations of a party under\nother written law take precedence over obligations under the PDPA.\n\n2\n\n\f6. The Commission’s investigation focused on whether the Organisations had\nbreached the Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA in relation to:\na. the disclosure of the Complainants’ personal data by SLPS to SLPIPC; and\nb. the collection of the said data by SLPIPC from SLPS.\n\n7. Investigations revealed that the Complainants had each, individually and\nseparately, signed an agreement with SLPS (“Associate’s Agreement”) in which\nthey had provided their consent for disclosure of their personal data in specific\ncircumstances. Notably:\na. Clause 24 of the Associate’s Agreement provided that the Complainants\nconsented to SLPS collecting, using and/or disclosing their personal data\nfor one or more of the “Company Purposes”.\nb. “Company Purposes” as defined in the Associate’s Agreement included\ndisclosure of the Complainants’ personal data to SLPS’ related\ncorporations, to facilitate and administer the real estate brokerage services\nto be provided by the Complainants under the Associate’s Agreement.\nc. As SLPS was a subsidiary of SLPIPC, both Organisations were “related\ncorporations” for the purposes of the Associate’s Agreement.\n\n8. The disclosure and collection of the Complainants’ personal data had been carried\nout because of an upcoming merger between the Organisations, for business\nreasons. With the move towards merger at the material time, the Complainants had\n\n3\n\n\fthe option of providing their services under SLPIPC after the merger. This was\nfound to fall under the ambit of “Company Purposes” pursuant to Clause 24 of the\nAssociate’s Agreement, because the merger would have affected the\nComplainants’ ability to “facilitate and administer” their real estate brokerage\nservices.\n\n9. Consequently, the disclosure of the Complainants’ personal data by SLPS and the\ncollection and disclosure of the same by SLPIPC as a related corporation was\nfound to be consistent with the purposes for which the Complainants had provided\nconsent in the Associate’s Agreement.\n\n10. In light of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds\nthat the Organisations did not breach the Consent Obligation under section 13 of\nthe PDPA.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nConsent required\n13. An organisation must not, on or after 2 July 2014, collect, use or disclose personal data about an\nindividual unless —\n(a)\nthe individual gives, or is deemed to have given, his or her consent under this Act to the\ncollection, use or disclosure, as the case may be; or\n(b)\nthe collection, use or disclosure (as the case may be) without the individual’s consent is\nrequired or authorised under this Act or any other written law.\n\n4\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"Aman was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident involving unauthorised access to its servers and exfiltration of personal data.

On 5 December 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a notification from SingCERT of a personal data\nbreach involving Aman Group S.a.r.l (“Aman Group”) and/or Amanresort\nInternational Pte Ltd (“Aman SG”). 9 systems in London and 2 systems in\nSingapore were compromised and files containing personal data exfiltrated (the\n“Incident”).\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\f2. As a result of the Incident, personal data of approximately 2,500 individuals\nwhich included their name, date of birth, address, email address, phone number\nand profession were affected.\n\n3. The Aman Group engaged an external cybersecurity company, Ankura\nConsulting, to investigate the Incident. Its investigations found that the threat\nactor(s) had gained unauthorised access into 11 systems, which included 9\nservers based in London and 2 servers based in Singapore.\n\n4. While the investigations did not uncover any evidence of what the initial method\nand point of entry were, the most likely scenario is that the threat actor had\ninitially entered via the London based systems. This is because the suspicious\nactivities were first detected in the London systems. Thereafter, the threat actor\nsubsequently gained access to the 2 Singapore based servers by creating\nadministrator account credentials. There was no evidence that the firewalls in\nthe Singapore based servers were breached.\n\n5. Investigations could not conclusively exclude the possibility that data may have\nbeen exfiltrated from one of the Singapore based servers. However, analysis\nconducted by the Aman Group on four extracts obtained from the threat actor(s)\nfailed to establish any conclusive links between the extracts and the current\ndatabase in the affected Singapore based server.\n\n6. Investigations further revealed that any exfiltrated data would have been\nencrypted and was in a proprietary format. Aman Group’s assessment was that\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\fthe encryption and the proprietary format made it unlikely that the threat actor(s)\nwould be able access and recreate the data in plaintext. Their assessment is\nthat even if there had been exfiltration, there was no evidence that the\nexfiltrated data was in fact compromised. This is because the extracts obtained\nfrom the threat actor(s) do not resemble the current database in the affected\nSingapore based server.\n\n7. Following the Incident, the Aman Group took prompt and extensive remedial\nactions to mitigate the effects of the Incident and enhance the robustness of its\nsecurity measures.\n\n8. Further, based on the facts as disclosed, Aman SG is a regional office. It did\nnot hold the data protection role and was not in possession or control of the\npersonal data in the 2 Singapore based servers. As such, Aman SG could not\nbe held accountable for the Incident and cannot be said to be in breach of the\nProtection obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n9. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection is\nsatisfied of the view that the Aman Group had met its Protection obligation\nunder section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) and that no\nenforcement action needs to be taken in relation to the Incident.\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\n\fThe following provision(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

On 7 September 2021, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified of two incidents involving unauthorised disclosure and\ncollection of personal data by three individuals.\n\n2. Ngian Wen Hao Dennis (“Dennis”) was an Aviva Financial Advisers Pte Ltd\n(“AFA”) representative between December 2017 and February 2019. In March\n2019 and August 2020, Dennis approached two insurance financial advisers, Chua\nPuay Hwa Melissa (“Melissa”) and Winarto, to offer them a list of client leads,\nstating that he was leaving the insurance industry and looking for a reliable agent\n1\n\n\fto take over his clientele. Melissa and Winarto each said they paid $1,000 to Dennis\nfor the list (the “Incidents”).\n\n3. The list contained approximately 1,000 clients’ names, mailing addresses, contact\nnumbers and the names of organisations underwriting the hospitalisation plans\nbought by the clients (“Personal Data Sets”).\n\n4. The PDPA defines “organisations” to include individuals. As held in Re Sharon\nAssya Qadriyah Tang1, individuals who collect, use or disclose personal data\notherwise than in a personal or domestic capacity will be treated as organisations\nwithin the meaning of the Act, and are obliged to comply with the Data Protection\nProvisions. In this case, we are of the view that it is clear that Dennis, Melissa and\nWinarto can be regarded as an “organisation” as defined under the PDPA for a\nnumber of reasons. First, the trio had bought and sold the client leads for work and\nbusiness purposes, with the aim of generating an income or profit, and cannot be\nsaid to have been acting in a personal or domestic capacity.\n5. Second, Dennis, Melissa and Winarto were not employees. In Re Ang Rui Song2,\nthe Commission found that the respondent, a financial consultant with Prudential\nAssurance Company (Pte) Ltd, had been engaged on such terms that he was in\neffect an independent contractor rather than an employee of Prudential. The same\napplies to the trio. The Representative Agreement between AFA and Dennis\n\n1\n2\n\n[2018]SGPDPC 1.\n[2017] SGPDPC 13.\n\n2\n\n\fexpressly provides that “nothing in [the] Agreement shall constitute, or be\nconstrued, or deemed to constitute, any employment…between [Dennis] and\n[AFA]”.\n\nDennis\n\n6. Having found that the PDPA applies, we now turn to consider the data protection\nobligations applicable to the different parties concerned. Dennis conceded that he\napproached Melissa and Winarto to transfer his list of client leads to them. Our\ninvestigations revealed that Dennis’ claim that he had obtained the necessary\nconsent and duly notified the clients on the list regarding the disclosure of their\npersonal data to other insurance financial advisers could not be corroborated.\nNone of the clients verified Dennis’ claim that he had contacted them to seek their\nconsent or notified them of the disclosure of their personal data to other insurance\nfinancial advisers. We are therefore of the view that Dennis has breached the\nConsent and Notification Obligation under the PDPA in that he did not obtain his\nclients’ consent before disclosure of their personal data.\n\nMelissa and Winarto\n7. Both Melissa and Winarto admitted to the collection (purchase) of the client list\nfrom Dennis. They claimed to have relied on the verbal assurances provided by\nDennis that he had informed the clients about the change in their insurance\nfinancial adviser. In Re Amicus Solutions Pte Ltd and Ivan Chua Lye Kiat [2019]\n3\n\n\fSGPDPC 33 (at [49]), we stated that a reasonable person should undertake proper\ndue diligence, such as obtaining from the seller a sample of the written notifications\nand consent. In our view, Melissa and Winarto have failed to take reasonable steps\nto verify from Dennis that there had been proper notification to and consent\nobtained from the clients for the disclosure of their personal data. In collecting (i.e.\nbuying) the client list, we find that Melissa and Winarto are in breach of the\nNotification and Consent Obligations under the PDPA.\n\nAFA\n\n8. The Commission found no evidence of breach of the PDPA by AFA in the Incidents.\nAs stated in [5], Dennis was not an employee of AFA for whose acts AFA may be\nliable through section 53(1) of the PDPA. Dennis claimed that the Personal Data\nSets were not retrieved from AFA’s systems and that he had compiled the list on\nhis own accord to keep track of his clientele during his time as an independent\nfinancial adviser with AFA. This was consistent with AFA’s own investigations. Our\ninvestigations also revealed that AFA had reasonable policies and security\nmeasures in place for personal data protection. These included data leak\nprevention controls and monitoring of AFA corporate network to prevent\nrepresentatives from exporting clients’ data from its systems. Contractual terms\nwere also in place to require representatives to comply with the PDPA. AFA issued\na letter to Dennis, upon the termination of the relationship between them, referring\nto the need to return “all policies, rate books, receipts, manuals, literature, lists and\npersonal information of Customers”.\n4\n\n\fThe Commission’s Decision\n9. The sale of personal data by organisations without obtaining the consent of the\nindividuals involved is a serious breach of the PDPA. In Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah\nTang at [30], we had stated as follows:\nThere are strong policy reasons for taking a hard stance\nagainst the unauthorised sale of personal data. Amongst these\npolicy reasons are the need to protect the interests of the\nindividual and safeguard against any harm to the individual,\nsuch as identity theft or nuisance calls. Additionally, there is a\nneed to prevent abuse by organisations in profiting from the\nsale of the individual’s personal data at the individual’s\nexpense. It is indeed such cases of potential misuse or abuse by\norganisations of the individual’s personal data which the PDPA\nseeks to safeguard against. In this regard, the Commissioner is\nprepared to take such stern action against organisations for the\nunauthorised sale of personal data.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n10. To curb this form of abuse of personal data, the amount of profit made by the\norganisation from the sale may be factored in determining the financial penalty that\nthe organisation may be required to pay. Indeed, had the sale taken place after the\n2020 amendments to the PDPA, this would have been a specific consideration\nunder section 48J(6)(c): “whether the organisation or person (as the case may be),\nas a result of the non‑compliance, gained any financial benefit”.\n\n11. In determining the enforcement action in response to the breach by Dennis, the\nCommission took into account the cooperation extended to the investigation, and\n5\n\n\fthe full refund made by Dennis of the proceeds he made from the sale. The\nCommission also considered that Dennis is in poor health, has been unemployed\nsince 2018, has little savings in his bank account, and is dependent on his aged\nfather for financial support. Having considered the state of Dennis’ health and\nfinancial status, the Commission is of the view that a financial penalty would\nimpose a crushing burden on him and his family, resulting in undue hardship.\nAccordingly, taking into account all relevant factors, the Commission has decided\nto administer a warning in respect of the breach by Dennis of the Consent and\nNotification Obligations. The Commission wishes to emphasize that this\nassessment that undue hardship may occur following the imposition of a financial\npenalty is not a finding that the Commission will make easily and will be reserved\nonly for the most deserving and exceptional cases. Individuals who seek to misuse\npersonal data for profit and are found to be in breach of the PDPA must expect to\npay a heavy financial penalty.\n\n12. Turning to Melissa and Winarto, the Commission has decided to administer\nwarnings to Melissa and Winarto in respect of their breaches of the Consent and\nNotification Obligations. In so deciding, the Commission considered that both of\nthem did not sell the personal data for profit and had been cooperative throughout\nthe investigations. More importantly, neither of them used the personal data they\nobtained without consent from the individuals involved.\n\n6\n\n\fThe following provisions of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (pre-amendment in\n2020) had been cited in the above summary:\nConsent and Notification Obligations (Section 13 read with 20 of the PDPA)\nPursuant to section 13 of the PDPA, unless an exception to consent is applicable,\norganisations are generally required to obtain the consent of an individual before\ncollecting, using and/or disclosing the individual’s personal data (“Consent\nObligation”).\nConsent must be obtained from the individual with reference to the intended purpose\nof the collection, use or disclosure of the personal data. The organisation’s collection,\nuse and disclosure of personal data are limited to the purposes for which notification\nhas been made to the individuals concerned.

This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nin this decision, and admitted that it was in breach of section 24(a) of the Personal\nData Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation’s forensic investigation results revealed that the Organisation’s\nIT infrastructure had been outdated, with multiple vulnerabilities at the time of the\nIncident. The Organisation’s e-commerce server ran on an outdated webserver\nservice. This, together with an unpatched firewall, allowed the threat actor to\n\n1\n\n\fremotely execute unauthorised code on the e-commerce server, and gained\nbackdoor access to the e-commerce server to carry out the ransomware attack.\n\n4.\n\nThe Organisation had engaged an IT vendor to host, manage and maintain the\ne-commerce server and all its other IT systems. However, our investigations\nrevealed that despite the purported “engagement”, there was in fact no written\ncontract between the Organisation and its IT vendor at the time of the Incident.\n\n5.\n\nIn Re Spize Concepts Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 22 at [22], we had stated that\nsection 4(2) of the PDPA imposes on organisations that engage data\nintermediaries to do so “pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in\nwriting”. In that case, we also highlighted that one specific category of policies\nand practices under section 12(a) of the PDPA that an organisation should\ndevelop and implement is the contractual documentation relating to the scope of\nthe data intermediary relationship, and failure to do so would amount to a breach.\nThe raison d’etre is that the outsourcing of data processing activities must be\nclearly scoped, and the respective roles and responsibilities between the\norganization and the data intermediary clearly identified from the outset. In the\nabsence of any written contract and the lack of evidence to show the scope, roles\nand responsibilities of the data processing outsourcing, the Organisation\nremained solely responsible for complying with the obligations under the PDPA,\nincluding the obligation to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in its possession or under its control under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation’s outdated webserver was used to host the Organisation’s\nwebsite and its online storefront. In this regard, the Commission had previously\n2\n\n\fissued a Guide on Building Websites for SMEs in 2016, which was subsequently\nupdated and revised in July 2018. In this Guide, the Commission emphasized\nthe importance of ensuring the protection of personal data and the security of the\nwebsite throughout the life cycle, including ensuring the clear delineation of\nresponsibilities when an organization engages an IT vendor.\n\n7.\n\nWe wish to reiterate our observations in [4.2.1] of the Guide, where we\nhighlighted the need to consider and properly document an IT vendor’s scope of\nwork, and stated as follows:\nOrganisations should emphasise the need for personal data protection to their\nIT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms. The contract should also\nstate clearly the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the PDPA.\nWhen discussing the scope of outsourced work, organisations should consider\nwhether the IT vendor’s scope of work will include any of the following:\n•\n\nRequiring that IT vendors consider how the personal data should be handled\nas part of the design and layout of the website.\n\n•\n\nPlanning and developing the website in a way that ensures that it does not\ncontain any web application vulnerabilities that could expose the personal\ndata of individuals collected, stored or accessed via the website through the\nInternet.\n\n•\n\nRequiring that IT vendors who provide hosting for the website should ensure\nthat the servers and networks are securely configured and adequately\nprotected against unauthorised access.\n\n•\n\nRequiring IT vendors to ensure that all work done is fully documented and\nthat all documentation is handed over to the organisation at the completion\nof the project. Documents should capture the website’s requirements,\ndesign specifications, user test scripts, user test results, as well as server\nand network configurations.\n\n•\n\nWhen engaging IT vendors to provide maintenance and/or administrative\nsupport for the website, requiring that any changes they make to the website\ndo not contain vulnerabilities that could expose the personal data.\nAdditionally, discussing whether they have technical and/or non-technical\nprocesses in place to prevent the personal data from being exposed\naccidentally or otherwise.\n\n3\n\n\f•\n\n8.\n\nRequiring that IT vendors providing maintenance and/or administrative\nsupport to ensure that all changes to the website are secure and\ndocumented, and that the document is kept up to date.\n\nThe Organisation admitted the weakness in its IT infrastructure and its failure to\ngive due attention to the protection of the personal data of its customers had\ncontributed to the Incident.\n\n9.\n\nOn the facts, the Organisation’s failure to ensure that there was a written contract\nwith its IT vendor not only meant that there was a lack of clarity on the scope of\nwork expected from the IT vendor, but also that the Organisation had failed to\nstipulate clear written security maintenance requirements and data protection\nrequirements to its IT vendor to ensure the protection of personal data it was in\ncontrol or in possession of. This ultimately resulted in a lack of system\nmaintenance, including security maintenance by the Organisation.\n\n10. Investigations further revealed that the Organisation did not have a security\nmaintenance policy, which would have made up for the lack of specification of\nthese requirements to its IT vendor, nor did the Organisation conduct any of its\nown scheduled security reviews, through which it could have detected any\nsecurity inadequacy or vulnerabilities within its IT infrastructure.\n\n11. In the above circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached the\nProtection Obligation under section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n12. Following the Incident, the Organisation decommissioned its e-commerce\nwebserver and overhauled its IT infrastructure. Apart from deciding to conduct\nonline sales solely through third party websites, the Organisation also rebuilt its\nERP server in a secure environment with new set of firewalls, updated its\n4\n\n\foperating systems and software, implemented the use of SSL-VPN for remote\naccess, and engaged a new IT vendor with the data security and data protection\nprovisions properly specified in a written contract. The Organisation also\nreviewed and updated all its internal policies relevant to the protection of personal\ndata.\n\n13. In deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission acknowledges\nthe cooperation extended by the Organisation to the Commission throughout the\ncourse of our investigations. The Organisation had also voluntarily admitted to\nits breach of the Protection Obligation, and took prompt remediation actions to\naddress its security gaps. The Organisation was able to restore fully the personal\ndata affected without loss, thereby minimizing any disruptions to its operations.\n\n14. Having considered the circumstances set out above and the factors listed at\nsection 48J(6) of the PDPA, the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and requires the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of $22,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date\nthis decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n15. In view of the remedial action by the Organisation, no directions under section\n48I are necessary.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n5\n\n\f(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks;\nand\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Warnings were issued to Toll Logistics (Asia), Toll Global Forwarding, Toll Offshore Petroleum Services, and Toll (TZ) for breaches of the PDPA in relation to the transfer of employees’ personal data to a human resources software vendor in Ireland.","tags":["Transfer Limitation","Warning","Transport and Storage"],"date":"2022-05-19","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision--Toll-Logistics-Asia-Limited-and-others--180322.pdf","nature":"Transfer Limitation","title":"Breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation by Toll Logistics (Asia) and others","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/05/breach-of-the-transfer-limitation-obligation-by-toll-logistics-and-others","timestamp":"2022-05-19","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 4\n\nCase No. DP-2008-B6707\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\n(1) Toll Logistics (Asia) Limited\n(2) Toll Global Forwarding (Singapore) Pte.

Toll Logistics (Asia) Limited (“Toll Logistics”),\nToll Global Forwarding Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“Toll Forwarding”), Toll Offshore\nPetroleum Services Pte. Ltd. (“Toll Offshore\"), and Toll (TZ) Pte. Ltd. (“Toll TZ”) are\nSingapore-registered entities (collectively, “the Organisations”) that are part of a\nmultinational group of companies headed by Toll Holdings (“the Group”).\n2\n\nOn 11 June 2020, Toll Holdings notified the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (“the Commission”) of a ransomware attack which had affected the\nGroup’s IT systems, including servers in Australia and Singapore containing the\npersonal data of current and former employees of the Organisations (“the Incident”).\nThe Commission subsequently received complaints from 3 former employees of Toll\nLogistics in relation to the Incident. Investigations were commenced to determine\nwhether the circumstances relating to the Incident disclosed any breaches by the\nOrganisations of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nIn July 2013, Toll Holdings contracted with a vendor in Ireland (“the HR\n\nVendor”) for the Group’s use of the HR Vendor’s human resources software platform\n(“the HR Platform”). To facilitate use of the common HR Platform, the respective\nGroup entities (including the Organisations) uploaded the personal data of their\nemployees to the HR Platform. The data uploaded to the HR Platform was hosted by\nthe HR Vendor in data centres in the European Economic Area.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nSubsequently in 2019, a series of Corporate Services Agreements (“CSAs”)\n\nand accession agreements were executed with the net effect that Toll Holdings\nundertook to provide finance, human resources (“HR”), information technology (“IT”),\nlegal, and other corporate services to all the Organisations. Although the CSAs were\ninked in 2019, they took retrospective effect from 1 April 2018.\n5\n\nThe services provided by Toll Holdings to the Organisations under the CSAs\n\nincluded:\n\n6\n\n(a)\n\nDevelopment and maintenance of HR policies and procedures;\n\n(b)\n\nDevelopment and maintenance of IT strategy;\n\n(c)\n\nDevelopment and maintenance of IT policies and procedures; and\n\n(d)\n\nProvision of IT support services.\n\nUnder the terms of the CSAs, Toll Holdings was permitted to appoint\n\nsubcontractors to perform part or all of the services subject of the CSAs but was\nresponsible to the same extent as if it had performed the services itself.\n7\n\nThe scope of IT services to be provided by Toll Holdings under the CSAs\n\nspecifically excluded the “development or implementation of IT systems”, which\nresponsibility presumably remained with the Organisations. To this end, the\nOrganisations maintained ten servers in Singapore to support their operations. Three\nof these servers (“the Singapore Servers”) were used by the Organisations’\ncorporate teams (i.e. finance, legal, HR) in the ordinary course of their work and\ncontained personal data within the email archives and other working documents.\n8\n\nThe Group (including the Organisations) had implemented various industry-\n\nstandard security solutions for its IT systems such as end-point protection software,\nlogging and monitoring software and/ services, firewall and intrusion prevention\nsoftware, security detection and response software, identity access management and\ncontrol software and services, vulnerability scanning software and services, and\npatching software. A Managed Security Service Provider (“MSSP”) was also engaged\nto provide cyber security detection and incident response services for the Group. With\n3\n\n\fthe assistance of the MSSP and other external vendors, the Group carried out regular\nvulnerability scanning and penetration testing of its IT systems.\nTransfer of personal data to Australia\n9\n\nSometime prior to the Incident, Toll Holdings’ Chief Human Resources Officer\n\nextracted personal data relating to 1,748 of the Organisations’ current and former\nemployees from the HR Platform and transmitted them to a server in Australia (“the\nAustralia Server”). Toll Holdings represented that this personal data was transferred\nfor the purposes of performing services for the Organisations pursuant to the CSAs.\n10\n\n11\n\nThe personal data downloaded by Toll Holdings comprised each employee’s:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nAddress\n\n(c)\n\nAge; and\n\n(d)\n\nSalary.\n\n5 employees of Toll Logistics and 2 employees of Toll Forwarding also had\n\nother datasets disclosed including:\n(a)\n\nDriver’s licence number;\n\n(b)\n\nEmergency contact details;\n\n(c)\n\nNational ID;\n\n(d)\n\nFingerprint;\n\n(e)\n\nMedical details; and\n\n(f)\n\nPassport details.\n\n4\n\n\fThe Incident\n12\n\nOn 26 April 2020, a malicious actor gained access to Toll Holdings’ IT\n\nenvironment in Australia using credentials stolen from a third-party vendor. The thirdparty vendor had been granted administrative access to two servers in Toll Holding’s\nIT environment in order to provide support services for a software solution.\n13\n\nHaving gained access to the Group’s IT environment, the malicious actor used\n\nadvanced malware and a range of hacking tools to move through the Group’s network,\nconduct reconnaissance, and escalate account privileges. The malicious actor also\nmade various efforts to bundle and compress data from the Australia Server and stage\nit for exfiltration.\n14\n\nThreat monitoring software deployed by the Group detected events related to\n\nthe malicious actor’s account takeover and privilege escalation during the Incident and\nraised alerts to the MSSP. However, according to Toll Holdings, no alerts were brought\nto its attention. On 3 May 2020, the malicious actor exfiltrated less than 2% (two\npercent) of the data stored on the Australia Server using a web-based file sharing\nservice. The malicious actor then ran scripts to disable various endpoint protections\nacross the Group and executed a ransomware attack. The ransomware attack\nencrypted files on a number of the Group’s servers, including the Australia Server and\nthe Singapore Servers.\n15\n\nWhen subsequently making ransom demands, the malicious actor provided Toll\n\nHoldings a summary of the files exfiltrated from the Australia Server and eventually\nuploaded portions of the exfiltrated files onto the dark web. Based on (i) the summary\nprovided by the malicious actor, (ii) the Group’s review of the available logs and\nrecords on the Australia Server, and (iii) a review of the files eventually published by\nthe malicious actor on the dark web, the Organisations concluded that there was no\nevidence of exfiltration of the personal data of its current or former employees from\nthe Australia Server.\n16\n\nThe Organisations also concluded that there was no evidence of data\n\nexfiltration from the Singapore Servers, or any other servers in the Group’s IT\nenvironment in the Incident, other than the Australia Server. The Organisations were\n5\n\n\fable to restore the encrypted data in the Singapore Servers from securely stored backups.\nRemedial actions\n17\n\nFollowing the Incident, Toll Holdings implemented the following remedial\n\nmeasures on a Group-wide basis:\n(a)\n\nTemporarily disconnected from the Internet, and undertook a rolling\n\nshutdown of IT systems in order to mitigate spread of any infection;\n(b)\n\nIsolated all impacted servers and implemented network restrictions to\n\nprevent spread of the ransomware within the Group’s network;\n(c)\n\nEngaged third-party experts to assist with incident response, including\n\ninvestigation and remediation;\n(d)\n\nUpgraded its user access system and reset all administrator passwords;\n\n(e)\n\nBlocked the malware used in the Incident;\n\n(f)\n\nRemoved access privileges obtained by the malicious actor;\n\n(g)\n\nImplemented additional vulnerability scanning across the Group’s IT\n\nsystems to harden the Group’s network perimeter;\n(h)\n\nStrengthened the Group’s Active Directory infrastructure;\n\n(i)\n\nImplemented additional end point protection, forensic tools, and\n\nmonitoring tools;\n(j)\n\nIntroduced a shadow security operations centre and initiated transition\n\nto a new MSSP;\n(k)\n\nInitiated plans for an asset lifecycle review to identify legacy critical\n\nbusiness applications and treatment required to address cyber risks;\n(l)\n\nCommenced a logging, monitoring and alerting uplift to review existing\n\npolicies and standards;\n6\n\n\f(m)\n\nCompleted the rollout of multi-factor authentication for all remote access;\n\n(n)\n\nUpdated organisational measures such as incident response plans,\n\npolicies, and playbooks; and\n(o)\n\nRolled out a cyber awareness programme containing training and\n\nassignments for its employees\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n18\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisations had breached their respective obligations\n\nunder section 26 of the PDPA to not transfer any personal data to a country or\nterritory outside Singapore except in accordance with requirements prescribed\nunder the PDPA (the “Transfer Limitation Obligation”); and\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisations had breached their respective obligations\n\nunder section 24 of the PDPA to protect personal data in their possession or\nunder their control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\nWhether the Organisations had contravened the Transfer Limitation Obligation\n19\n\nThe HR Platform was implemented on a Group-wide basis on or around July\n\n2013. The Organisations began uploading the personal data of their employees to the\nHR Platform for storage in the HR Vendor’s servers in the European Economic Area\naround this time, and would have continued to do so as part of the normal course of\nHR functions (for example, when new employees joined). Any transfers of personal\ndata by the Organisations out of Singapore after 2 July 2014 would have been subject\nto the Transfer Limitation Obligation and the requirements prescribed in Part III of the\nPersonal Data Protection Regulations 2014 (“PDPR 2014”). For transfers of personal\ndata outside of Singapore which occurred after 1 February 2021, such transfers would\n\n7\n\n\fhave been subject to the requirements in Part 3 of the Personal Data Protection\nRegulations 2021 (“PDPR 2021”).\n20\n\nRegulation 9(1)(b) of the PDPR 2014 and regulation 10(1) of the PDPR 2021\n\nrequire an organisation that transfers personal data outside of Singapore to take\nappropriate steps to ensure that the recipient of the personal data is bound by legally\nenforceable obligations to provide the transferred personal data a standard of\nprotection that is at least comparable to that under the PDPA. Under regulation 10 of\nthe PDPR 2014 and regulation 11(1) of the PDPR 2021, such legally enforceable\nobligations can be imposed on the recipient organisation under (a) any law; (b) any\ncontract between the parties; (c) binding corporate rules; or (d) any other legally\nbinding instrument.\n21\n\nIn gist, the Organisations were required to take appropriate steps to ensure\n\nthat the personal data transferred out of Singapore via the HR Platform for storage in\nthe European Economic Area would be protected to a standard comparable to under\nthe PDPA, before any such transfers were made.\n22\n\nThere was no evidence of any such steps taken by the Organisations. While\n\nthe contract between Toll Holdings and the HR Vendor included data protection\nobligations imposed on the HR Vendor, the Organisations were not party to this\nagreement. The CSAs also did not contain any provisions relating to the protection of\npersonal data or impose obligations on Toll Holdings to protect the personal data of\nthe other Organisations for the purposes of the centralised corporate functions to be\nundertaken pursuant to the CSAs. Accordingly, the Organisations were determined to\nhave contravened the Transfer Limitation Obligation in relation to the personal data\nuploaded on to the HR Platform.\n23\n\nIn the course of investigations, Toll Holdings represented that it had since\n\nreviewed the data transfer arrangements under the CSAs and that the Organisations\nand Toll Holdings have now executed a “Singapore Data Export Agreement” to govern\nintra-group transfers of personal data from the Organisations to Toll Holdings (and\nother members of the Group who may subsequently become party to the agreement)\n\n8\n\n\fto ensure that a standard of protection comparable to the PDPA is provided to any\ntransferred personal data.\nWhether the Organisations had contravened the Protection Obligation\n24\n\nAs held in Everlast Projects Pte Ltd and others [2020] SGPDPC 20, members\n\nof a corporate group may satisfy the Protection Obligation by relying on binding grouplevel written policies or intra-group contracts which specify the respective data\nprotection obligations of the members of the group. In the present case, while the\nOrganisations had entered into the CSAs to centralise various corporate functions with\nToll Holdings, the CSAs did not deal with data protection obligations. In the\ncircumstances, the Protection Obligation remained with the Organisations, and the\nOrganisations cannot rely on the CSAs to say that certain of its data protection\noperations had been centralised with Toll Holdings at the Group-level.\n25\n\nThat being said, under the CSAs, Toll Holdings had undertaken to provide the\n\nOrganisations with IT support services. It has been held in WTS Automotive Services\nPte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26 that organisations can rely on the technical expertise of\ntheir service providers to satisfy the Protection Obligation (subject to clear instructions\nor business requirements being specified). In the case where a member of a group of\ncompanies provides technical support services to others in the group, it is advisable\nthat their respective roles and responsibilities be clearly spelt out.\n26\n\nIn the present case, the CSAs were intended to perform this role: Toll Holdings\n\nwas responsible for IT support services while the Organisations remained responsible\nfor development and implementation of IT systems: see [7] above. As part of the IT\nsupport services provided, Toll Holdings introduced and implemented Group-level IT\nsecurity standards. These were communicated through the Group’s intranet and\nimplemented by Toll Holdings on a Group-wide basis, as part of the IT support services\nthey provided. In accordance with these standards, a number of industry-standard\ntechnical solutions and tools were implemented prior to the Incident to protect the\npersonal data in the Singapore Servers: see [8] above.\n27\n\nHaving considered these security arrangements, we are satisfied that the\n\nOrganisations had not breached their Protection Obligation as the security\n9\n\n\farrangements in place prior to and at the time of the Incident to protect the personal\ndata in the Singapore Servers were reasonable and consistent with existing industry\nstandards. In coming to this decision, we are also of the view that the security lapse\nand privilege escalation that enabled the malicious actor to overcome the\nOrganisations’ endpoint protections in the Incident occurred abroad arising from theft\nof credentials from Toll Holdings’ vendor and was beyond the control of the\nOrganisations.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n28\n\nIn determining what directions (if any) should be given to the Organisations\n\npursuant to section 48I of the PDPA, the Deputy Commissioner took into\nconsideration:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisations’ cooperation with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nthat access to the transferred personal data was limited to entities within\n\nthe same corporate group;\n(c)\n\nthat there was no evidence of any loss or damage resulting from the\n\nOrganisations’ contravention of the Transfer Limitation Obligation; and\n(d)\n\nthat the Group had already implemented intra-group contractual\n\narrangements to govern future transfers of personal data by the Organisations\nto Toll Holdings.\n29\n\nHaving considered all the mitigating factors listed above, the Organisations are\n\nadministered a warning in respect of their breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation.\nNo other directions are necessary in view of the remedial actions already taken by the\nOrganisations.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $2,000 was imposed on Southaven Boutique for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangement to prevent the unauthorised access of its customers' personal data in its Point-Of-Sale system server.

Pursuant to this application, the Deputy\nCommissioner has decided to reduce the financial penalty imposed on the\nOrganisation from $5,000 to $2,000. As the application did not give rise to\nsignificant legal or factual issues, a separate decision on the application will not\nbe published.\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 5 February 2021, Southaven Boutique Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”), a brickand-mortar retailer of clothes and accessories, informed the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware attack that occurred\non or about 4 February 2021 (the “Incident”). A threat actor had gained access to\nthe Organisation’s Point-Of-Sale (the “POS”) system server and encrypted the\npersonal data of 4,709 customers. The personal data affected include names,\naddresses, email addresses, contact numbers and date of birth.\n\n2. Investigations revealed that the Organisation did not implement adequate\nadministrative and technical security arrangements. First, the Organisation failed\nto conduct or schedule any software updates, maintenance and/or security review\nbefore the Incident. Past decisions by the Commission had stressed the need for\nsuch security arrangements. The Organisation’s operating system and anti-virus\nsoftware, for example, were outdated and updated only after the Incident.\n\n3. Second, the Organisation had failed to set out any data protection requirements or\nresponsibilities with the POS vendor whom the Organisation had engaged to\nsupply and install the POS, and relied on for system service issue. This meant that\nthe Organisation did not in fact engage the POS vendor to provide the necessary\nmaintenance support. As the Organisation continued to seek the POS vendor’s\nassistance for any system service issue, it was also not entirely clear to the parties\nconcerned whether the POS vendor remained responsible for ensuring that the\nPOS system server was updated or patched. It should be reiterated that while an\norganisation may engage other third-party service providers to provide the\n2\n\n\fnecessary technical assistance and support, an organisation’s responsibility for\ncomplying with its statutory obligations under the PDPA may not be delegated.1\nGiven the Organisation’s omission to engage any maintenance support prior the\nIncident, the Organisation bore full responsibility for its failure to conduct or\nschedule the necessary software updates, patches and security reviews.\n\n4. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n5. After the preliminary decision was issued, the Organisation submitted\nrepresentations requesting for a waiver of the financial penalty imposed. The\nCommission considered the representations made, and took into account first, the\nremediation efforts taken by the Organisation since the Incident, and its\ncommitment to invest in a better and more secure IT system, and second, the\nadverse impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the Organisation’s business\nrevenue. Nonetheless, as explained above, the onus remained on the Organisation\nto put in place adequate security measures such as regular IT system\nmaintenance, patches and periodic security reviews.\n.\n6.

Ltd.\n[2022] SGPDPC 1\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2002-B5827\n4 February 2022\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 2 February 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the\n\nCommission”) received feedback about a Twitter post dated 31 January 2020 which\nrevealed that the personal data of users of www.pincstyle.com had been exposed. The\ntweet included a snapshot of the data (“the Incident”). The Commission commenced\ninvestigations into the Incident thereafter.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe website www.pincstyle.com was created and managed by PINC Interactive\n\nPte. Ltd. (“the Organisation”) at the material time. Investigations revealed that\nsometime in October 2019, a database comprising 252,813 records was accessed\nand exfiltrated from the Organisation’s staging servers (the “Staging Database”). The\nStaging Database is a synthetic database containing personal data of 3,916 actual\nusers, while the remaining 248,897 records were fake or “dummy” data modelled after\nthe real data. The synthetic database was used to facilitate development and testing\non the staging servers. The personal data from the 3,916 actual users that were\nexposed in the Incident included the name, username, email address, contact number\n(for some users) and a password hash. For completeness, the 3,916 user records in\nthe Staging Database is equivalent to 1.6% of the Organisation’s total database of\n252,813 user records.\n\nPage 2 of 9\n\n\f3\n\nInvestigations revealed two likely causes of the Incident. First, the developers,\n\nwho are the Organisation’s employees, had retained a copy of the Staging Database\non their own personal devices, and the database was exfiltrated when the developers’\ncomputers were compromised. The Organisation stated that while they had instructed\nthe developers to use strong passwords, the developers were left to manage the\nsecurity settings on their own computers, and only had antivirus software installed.\n4\n\nSecond, unauthorised access may have occurred from May 2019 to October\n\n2019 when the Organisation did not require authentication for the Application\nProgramming Interface (“API”) under testing (“Staging API”), which pointed to the\nStaging Database containing the personal data of real users, despite the Staging\nDatabase being accessible over the Internet. The Organisation only implemented\naccess key authentication from October 2019 onwards.\nRemedial actions\n5\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\na.\n\nUpdated the API with new authentication keys;\n\nb.\n\nLimited the access of authentication keys to only the senior developers;\n\nc.\n\nA password reset was initiated for affected users via email; and\n\nd.\n\nDevelopers were instructed to delete their local copy of the Staging\nDatabase and scan their own computers for malware.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation contravened the Protection Obligation\n6\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an\n\norganisation to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\nPage 3 of 9\n\n\fdisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). For the reasons set out below, the Organisation failed to implement\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in the Staging\nDatabase.\n7\n\nFirstly, the Organisation had failed to accord adequate protection to the\n\npersonal data by allowing their employees, i.e. the developers, to store local copies of\nthe Staging Database in their own personal devices, without implementing any\nadditional security requirements. Allowing their employees to store the Staging\nDatabase in their own personal devices constituted a breach of the Protection\nObligation, given that the Staging Database did not merely contain purely synthetic\ndata, but also the personal data of real users.\n8\n\nSecondly, the Organisation was also in breach of the Protection Obligation as\n\nit merely instructed its employees not to use weak passwords on their personal\ndevices, and left it to each individual employee to decide if and what level of security\nmeasures ought to be implemented on their own personal devices to protect the\npersonal data. Indeed, even though the developers had purportedly installed antivirus\nsoftware on their own personal devices, the Organisation was unable to provide the\nproduct name, version, or the frequency of the antivirus updates that the developers\nsupposedly implemented on their end when questioned.\n9\n\nIn Learnaholic Pte. Ltd.1, the Organisation was found in breach of section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA as the personal data affected had been sent to and stored in the work email\naccount belonging to the Organisation’s representative in an unencrypted form. After\ncompleting the task at hand, the representative failed to delete the email containing\nthe personal data that he received. Instead, the representative kept the email\ncontaining the personal data, in case he needed it in future. As a result, the hacker\nhad free rein to the personal data affected once he obtained access to the email\n\n1 [2019] SGPDPC 31.\n\nPage 4 of 9\n\n\faccount. In a similar vein, the Organisation here has failed to adopt adequate security\nmeasures when it simply allowed its employees to retain a copy of the Staging\nDatabase on their own personal devices, without putting any thought to the security\nmeasures that ought to be implemented to protect the personal data.\n10\n\nFinally, while we appreciate that the Organisation wanted the Staging API to\n\nmirror the production environment, it was not a reasonable “protection” measure to\ncommingle synthetic data with the personal data belonging to real users, without\nprocessing the personal data of the real users before doing so, as this meant that the\nStaging Database contained the data of real users. Having decided to use personal\ndata belonging to real users in the Staging Database, the Organisation has breached\nthe Protection Obligation by failing to require authentication before the Staging API\ncould be accessed. If the Organisation’s intention was not to require authentication for\nthe Staging API, the Organisation should have chosen to use only synthetic data in\nthe Staging Database. In How to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches\n(the “Handbook”),2 the Commission identified the five most common gaps in ICT\nsystem management and processes, and observed at page 11 of the Handbook that:\n“Out of convenience, many organisations use production data for system\ntesting in their test environments. But as test environments tend to be much\nless secured, there is a high risk of data breach in a test environment.”\n11\n\nIn the Handbook, the Commission explained that synthetic data can be\n\ngenerated either from scratch using commercial tools or by anonymising production\ndata, and recommended that organisations can create synthetic data (i.e. fake\npersonal data or data anonymised from real data) for development and testing\npurposes in non-production environments instead of using real data.\n\n2 https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/news-and-events/announcements/2021/05/handbook-on-how-to-guard-\n\nagainstcommon-types-of-data-breaches-now-available\n\nPage 5 of 9\n\n\f12\n\nIn this case, the Organisation could have chosen to use 100% synthetic data\n\nor anonymise the personal data before using them if it did not wish to require\nauthentication for the Staging API. In light of the above, we are also of the view that\nthe Organisation breached the Protection Obligation by using personal data belonging\nto real users in the Staging Database, but failing to require authentication before the\nStaging API could be accessed.\nWhether the Organisation contravened the Accountability Obligation\n13\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop and implement\n\npolicies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA (the “Accountability Obligation”).\n14\n\nThe Organisation admitted that they did not have any data protection policies\n\nor practices in place for their “non-technical” employees, who have access to “public\nuser data”. In its reply, the Organisation drew a distinction between its “technical” and\n“non-technical staff”, and stated that for the “technical” staff, the data protection\npolicies in place extended to the Organisation’s team lead providing a briefing to the\n“technical” staff of the system, rules for branch creation and the code standard during\nonboarding. The information provided by the Organisation to its “technical” staff, during\ntheir onboarding, serves merely to facilitate the performance of these employees’ core\nduties, and cannot be equated with or amount to data protection policies or practices.\n15\n\nIndeed, the Organisation’s reply reflects a lack of understanding of what data\n\nprotection policies and processes seek to achieve and implement. We have previously\nstressed the critical role that data protection policies and practices play in increasing\nawareness and ensuring accountability of an organisation’s obligations under the\nPDPA in Re Aviva Ltd3. We also explained in Re Singapore Cricket Association4 that\ndata protection policies and practices ensure that employees will be able to better\n\n3 [2018] PDP Digest 245 at [32].\n4 [2019] PDP Digest 270 at [19].\n\nPage 6 of 9\n\n\fprotect personal data when they are first able to recognise a matter as one involving\ndata protection.\n16\n\nGiven the Organisation’s reply, it follows that the Organisation did not in fact\n\nhave any data protection policies or processes in place to guide their employees on\nhow to comply with the PDPA in carrying out their work functions. The Organisation\nhas therefore breached the Accountability Obligation.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n17\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty,\nthe factors listed at section 48(6) of the PDPA were taken into account, as well as the\nfollowing aggravating and mitigating factors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation allowed its employees to keep local copies of the\n\nStaging Database on their personal devices, without considering and\nundertaking any security measures needed to protect the personal data of real\nusers;\nMitigating Factors\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative in the course of investigations and\n\nhad provided prompt responses to PDPC’s requests for information; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation was implemented remedial actions to address the\n\nIncident.\n18\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations\non the amount of financial penalty that the Commissioner intended to impose.\n\nPage 7 of 9\n\n\fThe Organisation raised the following factors for the Commissioner’s\nconsideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had engaged an external consultancy firm to ensure\n\nthat its obligations under the PDPA are upheld to the highest standards with\nperiodic audits, training and risk assessments; and\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was incorporated in 2018 and is still a relatively young\n\ncompany. Since its inception, it had been suffering significant losses in its\noperation.\n19\n\nHaving considered the Organisation’s representations, as well as all the\n\nrelevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby decided to impose a reduced\nfinancial penalty of $12,500 on the Organisation. The quantum of financial penalty has\nbeen calibrated and reduced after due consideration of the Organisation’s financial\ncircumstances, bearing in mind that any financial penalty imposed should not be\ncrushing or cause undue hardship on organisations.\n20\n\nTaking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances, the Commissioner\n\nhereby:\n(a)\n\nRequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $12,500 within\n\n30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until the financial penalty is paid in full;\n(b)\n\nDirects the Organisation to:\n(i)\n\nDevelop and implement internal data protection policies and\n\npractices to comply with the PDPA within 60 days of the relevant\ndirection accompanying this decision;\n\nPage 8 of 9\n\n\f(ii)\n\nEnsure that no local copies of the database are stored on the\n\npersonal computers of any employees (including both developers and\nsenior\n\ndevelopers)\n\nwithin\n\n60\n\ndays\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nrelevant\n\ndirection\n\naccompanying this decision; and\n(iii)\n\nTo notify the Commission within 1 week of the completion of this\n\ndirection.\n21\n\nAlthough the Commissioner has imposed a lower financial penalty on the\n\nOrganisation in this case, the financial penalty was arrived at after considering the\ndismal state of the Organisation’s finances, and should be confined to the specific\nfacts of this case.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 9 of 9\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $24,000 was imposed on Lovebonito for failing to put in place reasonable security to protect personal data in its possession.

Ltd.\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 3\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-1912-B5484\n21 February 2022\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 12 December 2019, Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd (the “Organisation”)\n\ninformed the Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”) that one of its IT\nsystems had been hacked, and that the personal data of 5,561 of its customers had\nbeen accessed and exfiltrated by a malicious actor (the “Incident”). The Commission\nsubsequently received two separate complaints from individuals affected in the\nIncident.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates an e-commerce platform (the “Website”) retailing\n\nclothing and accessories. At the material time, the Organisation employed, amongst\nothers, two third-party solutions to manage the Website. First, the Organisation\nemployed Magento Cloud, a cloud-based service, to host and run the Website.\nMagento Cloud includes the Magento Content Management System (“Magento\nCMS”), an open-source e-commerce management software, which the Organisation\nused to change and update the Website. Second, the Organisation used a payment\nplatform offered by Adyen N.V. (“Adyen”) to facilitate credit card payments on the\nWebsite. When a customer indicated that they intended to pay for their purchases via\ncredit card, Adyen’s platform would load directly from their servers as a frame within\nthe “checkout” page of the Website (the “Checkout Page”).\n3\n\nCustomers would then input the below details into Adyen’s frame, and Adyen\n\nwould directly collect these details and process the credit card payment:\n(a)\n\nFull credit card number;\n\n(b)\n\nExpiry date of the credit card;\n2\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe CVV number of the credit card; and\n\n(d)\n\nCustomer’s billing address\n\n(collectively, the “Credit Card Data”)\n4\n\nOnce Adyen has processed the credit card payment, it would send some (but\n\nnot all) of the Credit Card Data to the Organisation, namely:\n(a)\n\nThe last 4 digits of the credit card number;\n\n(b)\n\nExpiry date of the credit card;\n\n(c)\n\nAdyen’s payment reference; and\n\n(d)\n\nBilling address.\n\n(collectively, the “Partial Credit Card Data”)\n5\n\nThe Organisation would then store the Partial Credit Card Data together with\n\nother details collected by the Organisation for the purposes of processing the order\n(the “Order Data”). The Order Data comprised the following personal data of the\nOrganisation’s customers:\n(a)\n\nFirst name;\n\n(b)\n\nLast name;\n\n(c)\n\nShipping address;\n\n(d)\n\nDate of birth (optional);\n\n(e)\n\nPhone number;\n\n(f)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(g)\n\nOrder details;\n\n(h)\n\nPayment type: Paypal, credit card (i.e., Visa, Mastercard), bank transfer;\n\nand\n3\n\n\f(i)\n\nIf payment was made via:\n(i)\n\nCredit Card: Partial Credit Card Data; or\n\n(ii)\n\nPaypal: the email address associated with the Paypal account (if\n\nthe customer in question completed the transaction using his/her Paypal\naccount).\n6\n\nOn or around 22 November 2019, the Organisation noted a high drop in credit\n\ncard authorisations for payments via Adyen’s platform and began investigating the\nissue with Adyen. It was discovered that the Checkout Page had been configured to\nload an incorrect form replacing Adyen’s frame on the Checkout Page. This incorrect\nform had not been submitted via Magento CMS or validated by any of the\nOrganisation’s employees, and the Organisation was unable to determine the source\nof the form. The next day, the Organisation implemented a fix to replace the incorrect\nform with the correct one, in order to allow the processing of credit card payments to\nresume through Adyen’s platform, while root cause analysis was undertaken.\n7\n\nSubsequently, on or around 9 December 2019, the same issue resurfaced. As\n\na precaution, the Organisation turned off the credit card payment functionality on the\nCheckout Page, and continued investigations into the issue with Adyen, Magento, and\nsubsequently a private forensic investigator (“PFI”).\n8\n\nBased on these further investigations, it was concluded that:\n(a)\n\nOne of the Organisation’s Magento CMS accounts with administrator\n\nprivileges was likely to have been compromised (the “Compromised\nAccount”);\n(b)\n\nThe Compromised Account was likely used to modify the Checkout\n\nPage to load and execute an unauthorised JavaScript code each time the\nCheckout Page was loaded (“the Unauthorised Code”);\n(c)\n\nThe Unauthorised Code caused the Credit Card Data intended to be\n\nsent to Adyen to be intercepted and exfiltrated to the malicious actor instead\n(explaining the drop in credit card transactions); and\n\n4\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe Compromised Account was also used by the malicious actor to\n\naccess and exfiltrate Order Data from the Website via unauthorised Application\nProgramming Interface (“API”) calls to Magento CMS.\n9\n\nThe personal data of a total of 5,561 customers was accessed and exfiltrated\n\nin the Incident of which:\n(a)\n\n4,817 customers had only their Order Data affected;\n\n(b)\n\n188 customers had only their Credit Card Data affected: and\n\n(c)\n\n556 customers had both their Order Data and Credit Card Data affected.\n\nRemedial actions\n10\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nRemoved the Unauthorised Code from the Website;\n\n(b)\n\nNotified affected customers of the Incident and offered a complimentary\n\ncredit monitoring service;\n(c)\n\nReset the passwords for all Magento CMS user accounts;\n\n(d)\n\nImplemented a new password policy and two-factor authentication for all\n\nMagento CMS user accounts;\n(e)\n\nImplemented session management;\n\n(f)\n\nReviewed its Magento CMS access permissions, refined the scope of\n\nroles, and limited the number of users with Magento CMS accounts;\n(g)\n\nImplemented a remote access virtual private network;\n\n(h)\n\nImplemented endpoint protection;\n\n(i)\n\nImplemented a custom script to monitor for JavaScript injections;\n\n(j)\n\nSet up API “whitelisting” to restrict network access to only approved IP\n\naddresses;\n5\n\n\f(k)\n\nImplemented a monitoring script to trigger alerts whenever there was a\n\nrequest from a non-trusted domain;\n(l)\n\nConducted two external penetration tests;\n\n(m)\n\nUpgraded its version of Magento CMS to fix a security vulnerability found\n\nin the version it was using; and\n(n)\n\nImplemented CAPTCHA on its Website to deter brute-force attacks.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n11\n\nAs a preliminary point, both the Order Data and the Credit Card Data\n\nconstituted personal data as defined by section 2(1) of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (“PDPA”) 1 . In respect of the Order Data, distinct individuals could be\nidentified from such data. In respect of the Credit Card Data, although such data could\nnot identify any individual on its own, it could identify individuals together with other\ndata that the Organisation had access to (viz., the Order Data).\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n12\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). While the Organisation did not\nhave possession of the Credit Card Data (i.e. because it did not collect or store the\nCredit Card Data), the Protection Obligation nonetheless applied, as it had control over\nthe Credit Card Data.\n13\n\nAs highlighted in Re AIG Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 8 at [18]:\n“While there is no definition of “control” in the PDPA, the meaning of control\nin the context of data protection is generally understood to cover the ability,\n\n1 Under section 2(1) of the PDPA, “personal data” is defined as “data, whether true or not, about an\n\nindividual who can be identified (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information to which\nthe organisation has or is likely to have access”.\n\n6\n\n\fright or authority to determine (i) the purposes for; and/or (ii) the manner\nin which, personal data is processed, collected, used or disclosed.”\n14\n\nIn this case, the Organisation made the decision to deploy Adyen’s HTML code\n\nwithin a frame on the Checkout Page, and this decision directed the manner in which\nthe Credit Card Data was collected, processed and disclosed via the Website. Thus,\neven though the Credit Card Data was sent to Adyen directly without first being\ncollected and stored by the Organisation, the Organisation had control over how the\nCredit Card Data was collected, and the additional processing into a format which was\nthen transmitted to Adyen. The Organisation exercised such control by implementing\n(or deploying) Adyen’s HTML code within a frame on its Checkout Page.\n15\n\nThe application of the Protection Obligation to the Order Data is more straight\n\nforward as this dataset was collected and stored by the Organisation. As the\nOrganisation had possession of the Order Data and control over the Credit Card Data,\nthe Protection Obligation applied in respect of both datasets.\n16\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of the Organisation’s security arrangements,\n\nthe fact that the data within its control included personal data of a financial nature (i.e.\nthe Credit Card Data) was considered highly relevant. As highlighted in the\nCommission’s previous enforcement decisions, stronger security measures are called\nfor when protecting sensitive personal data because of the potential harm that may\nbefall an individual from unauthorised use of such data.2\n17\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Organisation failed to put in place such\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Order Data and Credit Card Data.\nInadequate password policy\n18\n\nA robust password policy is a key security measure that an organisation must\n\nhave in place to ensure that its IT systems are not vulnerable to common hacking\nattempts such as brute force attacks. As noted in Re (1) The Cellar Door Pte Ltd; (2)\nGlobal Interactive Works Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 22 (at [30(d)]):\n2 Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [25]; PeopleSearch Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 47\n\nat [10].\n\n7\n\n\f“… The need to have a strong password is fundamental to the security of\nthe database system. Weak passwords increase the chances of an\nintruder cracking the password and gaining full access to the database\nsystem, and, more importantly, the personal data stored therein.”\n19\n\nMagento CMS had several default security settings and the Organisation\n\nconfirmed that it had adopted these default settings as its password policy for its\nMagento CMS accounts (the “Magento Password Policy”). While default settings of\nthe Magento Password Policy on password length, and the implementation of a\nlockout after a number of failed login attempts were in line with good practices\nsuggested in the Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium\n(the “Guide”)3, more robust and stringent measures were required.\n20\n\nFirst, the Magento Password Policy did not mandate periodic changes of\n\npasswords as part of the default settings, despite the availability of this functionality in\nMagento CMS. As stated in paragraph (g) of Table 4 in the Guide:\n“Users are required to change their passwords regularly. The frequency\nshould be based on the risk of damage to the individual if the data is\ncompromised.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n21\n\nSecond, the default settings of the Magento Password Policy did not require\n\nthe Organisation’s employees to refrain from using easily-guessable passwords. As\nhighlighted in Re Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1, a password that complies with\nan organisation’s rules on password complexity in form, could still be regarded as a\nweak password if it incorporated components such as the organisation’s name. In this\nrespect, the Organisation ought to have complemented the technical Magento\nPassword Policy with a written password policy. Both written and technical policies\nreinforce each other. Technical policies alone may not ensure that users refrain from\nincorporating easily-guessable words or phrases such as their user name, real name,\n\n3 Published on 8 May 2015, and revised on 20 January 2017.

In this case, the password of\nthe Compromised Account – “ilovebonito88” – incorporated the Organisation’s name,\nwhich made it easy to guess and vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n22\n\nFor these reasons, the out-of-the-box default settings of the Magento Password\n\nPolicy was not sufficiently robust for the Organisation’s needs and failed to meet the\nstandard of being a reasonable security arrangement under the Protection Obligation.\nWeaknesses in the Organisation’s host, network, remote access, and webpage\nsecurity\n23\n\nThere were other significant weaknesses in the Organisation’s IT systems\n\nidentified by the PFI that could have also been exploited by malicious actors to gain\nprivileged access to Magento CMS:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s system allowed insecure remote access, with no /\n\nlimited system logging and no / limited system hardening;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation’s system was not patched / maintained;\n\n(c)\n\nThere was a lack of security monitoring for the Organisation’s network;\n\n(d)\n\nThere was a lack of network ingress and egress filtering of the\n\nOrganisation’s network to examine network traffic;\n(e)\n\nThere was a lack of monitoring and logging of remote access connection\n\nattempts; and\n(f)\n24\n\nThere was improper access control in respect of Magento CMS.\n\nThe above weaknesses indicated that the IT security measures implemented\n\nby the Organisation were inadequate in managing the risks of unauthorised access\nand exfiltration of the Credit Card Data and Order Data.\n25\n\nThe above security measures did not meet the standard of reasonableness,\n\nand the Commissioner finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation in\nthis regard.\n9\n\n\fThe Preliminary Decision\n26\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty,\nthe factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were taken into account, as well as the\nfollowing mitigating factors:\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident, including notifying affected individuals of the breach; and\n(b)\n27\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the investigations.\n\nIn the preliminary decision, the Organisation’s failure to implement two-factor\n\nauthentication (“2FA”) to secure privileged access to Magento CMS was also\nconsidered as an instance of breach of the Protection Obligation – this is discussed\nfurther below at [33] to [36]. Having considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\npreliminary financial penalty was set at $29,000.\n28\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 21 June 2021 and was invited to make representations on\nthe same.\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n29\n\nOn 12 July 2021, the Organisation made representations that it ought not be\n\nfound in breach of section 24 of the PDPA because:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s measures to safeguard its administrative accounts\n\nwere reasonable; and\n(b)\n\nIt could not be conclusively determined that the weaknesses in the\n\nOrganisation’s IT systems had directly caused the Incident.\n\n10\n\n\fRepresentations on reasonableness of security measures for Magento CMS\n30\n\nThe Organisation represented that its security measures for Magento CMS\n\nwere commensurate with the risks associated with a potential data breach, as:\n(a)\n\nMagento CMS was only intended to collect and store the Order Data,\n\nwhich was less sensitive personal data; and\n(b)\n\nThe risk of compromise to the more sensitive Credit Card Data via\n\nMagento CMS was assessed to be relatively low, where the Credit Card Data\nwas collected directly by Adyen via a frame on the Website’s Checkout Page\nloaded directly from Adyen’s server, without such data being transmitted to the\nOrganisation.\n31\n\nThe Organisation’s representations in this regard are not accepted. While it is\n\naccepted that the Credit Card Data was not transmitted to the Organisation and was\ncollected directly by Adyen via the Checkout Page of the Website, access and\nchanges to the Website were in turn managed and carried out by the Organisation via\nMagento CMS. There was therefore a foreseeable risk that unauthorised access to\nthe Website using one of the Organisation’s Magento CMS administrative accounts\ncould lead to unauthorised changes to the Checkout Page, adversely affecting its\nintended function and performance. Such unauthorised changes could include the\ninsertion of a malicious code to intercept and exfiltrate the Credit Card Data collected\nvia the Checkout Page.\n32\n\nThe Credit Card Data was collected via the Website, and it was for the\n\nOrganisation to secure the Website against unauthorised changes in order to protect\nthe Credit Card Data. Put differently, the Organisation’s Protection Obligation\nextended over the Website in its entirety, including the Checkout Page. The\nOrganisation was therefore incorrect in assessing that there was a low risk of\ncompromise to the Credit Card Data via Magento CMS. The security measures\nimplemented by the Organisation for Magento CMS and in its databases and systems\ndid not constitute reasonable security measures, having regard to the risks in the\ncontext of the sensitivity and volume of the personal data in its possession and/or\ncontrol.\n11\n\n\fRepresentations on failure to enable 2FA for administrative accounts\n33\n\nIn the present case, 2FA was available as an “out-of-the-box” feature in\n\nMagento CMS. In the preliminary decision, the Organisation’s failure to enable 2FA in\nMagento CMS was found to be another instance of its breach of the Protection\nObligation.\n34\n\nThe Organisation represented that 2FA was not an out-of-the-box feature in\n\nMagento CMS version 2.3.2, which the Organisation was using at the time of the\nIncident, and that the option to activate 2FA was only available in Magento CMS\nversion 2.4, via a third-party vendor (GitHub) module “MSP_TwoFactorAuth”.\nHowever, according to publicly available Magento version 2.3.x user guides – and\ncontrary to the Organisation’s representations – 2FA was already a feature available\non Magento CMS version 2.3.2, albeit at that version, 2FA was not enabled by default.\n35\n\nThe Organisation also represented that even if 2FA had been implemented, it\n\nwould not have prevented the Incident as the “2FA functionality in Magento CMS\nversion 2.4 would only have restricted unauthorised access via the graphical user\ninterface (“GUI”) of Magento CMS” and that “(…) 2FA would not have prevented API\ncalls to Magento CMS, which was the actual mechanism by which the Organisation’s\nwebsite was modified during the Incident”. In an investigation summary report\nprepared by Magento in respect of the Incident, Magento did not find any evidence of\nchanges made to the Organisation’s website made via the GUI, and concluded that it\nwas “more likely” that the administrative account belonging to [redacted] was used “to\nmake modifications and access information via API requests”.\n36\n\nAfter careful consideration of the Organisation’s representation, it is decided\n\nthat the benefit of doubt ought to be given to the Organisation on the preliminary\nfindings and its representations concerning the implementation of 2FA for two reasons.\nFirst, the external actor accessed and modified the Organisation’s Website via API\ncalls to Magento CMS (as opposed to via the GUI of Magento CMS), which made the\nattack a sophisticated one. Second, the Organisation’s failure to consider enabling the\nout-of-the-box 2FA functionality within Magento CMS was but one of several instances\n\n12\n\n\fsupporting the finding of its breach of the Protection Obligation. The finding of breach\nis maintained on the basis of other instances of breach.\nRepresentations on other weaknesses in IT systems\n37\n\nThe Organisation’s representation that it cannot be conclusively determined\n\nthat the weaknesses in its IT systems had directly caused the Incident (see [29(b)]\nabove) is rejected. The Commission’s role is not limited to investigating the immediate\nor proximate cause of the data breach although this may have been one of the lines\nof inquiry. The Commission’s investigations found that other weaknesses in the\nOrganisation’s IT systems posed risks to personal data in the Organisation’s\npossession and/or control, including Order Data that it collected and processed. The\nOrganisation ought to have implemented reasonable security measures to manage\nthese risks. In failing to do so, the Organisation breached the Protection Obligation.\nOther representations seeking reduction in financial penalty\n38\n\nThe Organisation also made representations for a reduction in the financial\n\npenalty on the basis that:\n(a)\n\nIt was inaccurate to state the number of affected individuals as 5,561, as\n\nonly 4,474 individuals in Singapore were affected;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had admitted to the Incident at first instance;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation had promptly alerted customers of the Incident and\n\noffered a complimentary credit monitoring service;\n(d)\n\nThere were no other data breach incidents reported apart from the\n\nIncident; and\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation had in place existing security measures to guard\n\nagainst unauthorised access to databases and systems.\n39\n\nThe Organisation’s attempt to confine the number of affected individuals in the\n\nIncident to those in Singapore is misconceived and is rejected. The PDPA requires\norganisations to protect all personal data in their possession or control, and does not\n13\n\n\fdraw distinctions between the personal data of individuals in Singapore and outside of\nSingapore.\n40\n\nAs to the factors raised by the Organisation at [38(b)] to [38(e)] above, these\n\nhad already been taken into account in the assessment of the appropriate financial\npenalty to be imposed.\n41\n\nIn the preliminary decision, the preliminary financial penalty was derived\n\nconsidering, inter alia, the gravity of the Organisation’s breach of the Protection\nObligation in failing to consider implementing 2FA, which was available out-of-the-box.\nAs the Organisation’s representations that 2FA may not have prevented the Incident\nare accepted, the gravity of the Organisation’s breach is lessened, and it follows that\nthe quantum of the financial penalty should also be moderated.\n42\n\nHaving said that, the Organisation’s breach included more fundamental\n\nfailures, such as failing to implement a robust password policy and to refrain the\nOrganisation’s employees from using easily-guessable passwords. Regardless of\nwhether 2FA would have prevented the specific vector of attack adopted by the threat\nactor, the harm caused to data subjects in the Incident remains the same.\n43\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commissioner is of the view that based on the\n\nrepresentations made by the Organisation, the preliminary financial penalty of $29,000\nshould be reduced to $24,000. The Commissioner hereby requires the Organisation\nto pay a financial penalty of $24,000 within 30 days from the date of the notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts would accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n44\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no\n\nfurther directions need be issued to the Organisation.\n\n14\n\n\fTwo- or multi-factor authentication as mandatory baseline standard for\nadministrative accounts with privileged access to systems that host or process\nsensitive personal data\n45\n\nAs 2FA and multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) become more broadly available,\n\nthe adoption of these tools should become the norm, at least for accounts with\nadministrative privileges.\n46\n\nRecently, the Commission released a handbook on common causes of data\n\nbreaches (How to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches4, at page 13) that\nrecommends 2FA / MFA for all administrator access to systems holding large volumes\n/ sensitive personal data:\n“Have stronger requirements for some administrative accounts (e.g.\na complex password or 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) / Multi-Factor\nAuthentication (MFA)). With 2FA/MFA in place, access to administrative\naccounts would involve additional round (s) of authentication, such as a\ntemporary code sent securely to the administrator’s mobile phone. Hence,\nthe use of a stolen password alone will not be enough to breach an\naccount. This is important for administrative accounts to systems\nthat hold large volumes of personal data, or personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature (e.g. financial or health records), where\na breach of such data could result in adverse impact to the affected\nindividuals.”\n[Emphasis added]\n47\n\nThe Commission’s recent Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems5\n\nat page 16 similarly recommends using “a one-time password (“OTP”) or 2FA/MFA for\nadmin access to sensitive personal data records or large volumes of personal data”,\nas part of the authentication and authorisation processes in ICT systems.\n\n4\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/resource-for-organisation/how-to-guard-againstcommon-types-of-data-breaches-handbook.pdf\n5 https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Tech-Omnibus/How-toGuard-Against-Common-Types-of-Data-Breaches-Handbook.pdf\n\n15\n\n\f48\n\nThis is the baseline standard that the Commission will apply in future cases.\n\nThis is not a standard that was adopted lightly, but after industry consultation and\nconsidering developments domestically and internationally.\n49\n\nIn recent domestic cases, the Commission has observed that 2FA was\n\nimplemented by the Organisations involved as part of voluntary remedial measures:\n(a)\n\nIn MSIG Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Globalsign.in Pte Ltd [2019]\n\nSGPDPC 43, an administrative account for the organisation’s email marketing\nsystem was hacked, resulting in spam emails being sent to over 350,000\nindividuals. The organisation was found in breach of the Protection Obligation\nfor not implementing a proper password policy or carrying out periodic security\nscanning. As part of voluntary remedial measures, the organisation\nimplemented 2FA for its administrative accounts.\n(b)\n\nIn Ncode Consultant Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 11, students exploited\n\nvulnerabilities in a school’s administration system (which had been developed\nby the investigated organisation), obtained a teacher’s login credentials, and\nmodified examination results. The organisation was found in breach of the\nProtection Obligation for insecure coding which resulted in the exploited\nvulnerabilities. As part of voluntary remedial measures, the organisation\nimplemented 2FA for the teachers’ accounts.\n(c)\n\nIn Learnaholic Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 31, an employee of the\n\ninvestigated organisation (a school IT vendor) had his email account hacked,\nresulting in unauthorised access to a large number of students’ personal data\nincluding medical information. The organisation was found in breach of the\nProtection Obligation for negligently leaving one of the school’s servers\nexposed to the Internet, leaving credentials to the employee’s email account in\nthe exposed server, and storing students’ personal data in the employee’s email\naccount in an unencrypted form. The organisation implemented 2FA for its\nemployees’ email accounts as part of voluntary remedial measures.\n\n16\n\n\f50\n\nA review of guidance and cases from foreign jurisdictions shows that\n\nimplementing 2FA (or similar arrangements) to secure privileged access to sensitive\ndata is by now a reasonable and industry-standard practice:\n(a)\n\nUnited Kingdom. In two separate guidance notes, i.e. “Multi-factor\n\nauthentication for online services”6 and “10 Steps to Cyber Security – Identity\nand access management”7, UK’s National Cyber Security Centre advises that\nMFA be enabled for all accounts with administrative privileges.\n(b)\n\nCanada. The Privacy Commissioner of Canada (“PCC”) has cited the\n\nfailure to implement MFA to secure all remote administrative access as a\nsignificant data protection failing in the Joint Investigation of Ashley Madison by\nthe\n\nPrivacy\n\nCommissioner\n\nof\n\nCanada\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nAustralian\n\nPrivacy\n\nCommissioner/Acting Australian Information Commissioner 8 , where the\npersonal data of 36 million customers of the investigated organisation (including\nsensitive personal and financial data) was published online. In a subsequent\nnote on takeaways from the investigation 9 , the PCC described MFA as a\ncommonly recommended industry practice for controlling remote administrative\naccess, and recommended that MFA be so implemented in all such cases.\n(c)\n\nAustralia. The “Australian Government Information Security Manual”, a\n\ncybersecurity framework for organisations published by the Australian Cyber\nSecurity Centre 10 , recommends that MFA be used to authenticate all (i)\nprivileged users, (ii) positions of trust, (iii) users of remote access solutions, and\n(iv) users with access to important data repositories. The Office of the\nAustralian Information Commissioner, in its “Guide to securing personal\ninformation”11 recommends that MFA be employed in circumstances that may\n\n6 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/multi-factor-authentication-online-services\n7 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-management\n8 Joint Investigation of Ashley Madison by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the Australian\n\nPrivacy Commissioner/Acting Australian Information Commissioner (PIPEDA Report of Findings\n#2016-005,\n22\nAugust\n2016)\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-anddecisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2016/pipeda-2016-005>\n9\nhttps://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/business-privacy/safeguards-and-breaches/safeguardingpersonal-information/2016_005_ta/\n10 https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/guidance/authentication-hardening\n11 https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/guidance-and-advice/guide-to-securing-personal-information/\n\n17\n\n\fpose a higher security risk, such as remote access to a system or access to\nsensitive or restricted personal information.\n51\n\nHenceforth, the Commission adopts the following tiered approach:\n(a)\n\nFirst, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\n\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a confidential or\nsensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data: see [46]-[47] above. Failure\nto do so can ipso facto amount to a breach, unless the organisation can show\nthat its omission is reasonable or implementation of 2FA is disproportionate.\n(b)\n\nSecond, remote access by privileged accounts to information systems\n\nthat host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large volumes of personal\ndata, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA / MFA. The risks concerning remote\naccess are higher, thus the expectation to implement 2FA / MFA will\ncorrespondingly increase.\n(c)\n\nThird, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or sensitive\n\npersonal data, or large volumes of personal data, are expected to enable and\nconfigure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that is available out-of-the-box.\nOmission to do so may be considered an aggravating factor.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n18\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Royal Caribbean Cruises (Asia) was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to a coding error in a business software which resulted in emails containing personal data being sent to unintended recipients.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Arts, Entertainment and Recreation","Software","Unintended recipient"],"date":"2022-05-19","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision--Royal-Caribbean-Cruises-Asia-Pte-Ltd--130819.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No Breach of the Protection Obligation by Royal Caribbean Cruises (Asia)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/05/no-breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-royal-caribbean-cruises","timestamp":"2022-05-19","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-1804-B1931\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises (Asia) Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1. On 5 April 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”)\ncommenced investigation against Royal Caribbean Cruises (Asia) Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) after receiving a complaint from a member of the public (the\n“Complaint”). The complainant stated that she had received the personal data of\nunrelated individuals in an email payment reminder sent by the Organisation.\n\n2. Investigations revealed that, from 8 February 2018 to 4 April 2018, the personal\ndata of 526 individuals were inadvertently disclosed to other unrelated members of\nthe public via unintended email payment reminders (the “Data Breach Incident”).\nThe personal data disclosed included booking IDs, ship codes, sailing dates,\nnames, net amounts due, amounts paid, balance due and the balance due date\n(the “Affected Personal Data”).\n\n3. The Organisation is part of the Royal Caribbean Group, and is the wholly owned\nsubsidiary and data intermediary of the USA-based Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd\n\n1\n\n\f(Liberia) (“RCL”). It is responsible for the following business functions on behalf of\nRCL:\n(a) Conducting sales and marketing activities on behalf of the cruise ship\noperators of the Royal Caribbean Group, including RCL;\n(b) Taking cruise bookings from Singapore-based customers of RCL;\n(c) Administering a loyalty membership programme on behalf of RCL; and\n(d) Collecting payments from Singapore-based customers of RCL who made their\nbookings via walk-in, roadshows and online bookings at the Royal Caribbean\nGroup’s Singapore website.\n\n4. RCL’s branch office in the Philippines (“RCL Philippines”) provides IT support to\nentities within the Royal Caribbean Group, and does not have a separate legal\nidentity from RCL. On 1 January 2017, the Organisation entered into an operative\nintercompany agreement with RCL Philippines for the provision of IT support and\ncustomer services support. Such services included providing technical support for\nthe business software applications and services used by the Organisation.\n\n5. As part of its business functions, the Organisation would send its Singapore\ncustomers email payment reminders prior to the commencement of their cruises.\nOn 8 February 2020, the Organisation automated this business function through a\nbusiness software enterprise operated by RCL Philippines (the “Hyperion\nSystem”), which would generate pre-programmed emails to individual customers\nto remind them of outstanding bill amounts (the “Direct Payment Reminder”).\nConcurrently, a collated list of the customers (together with other personal data)\nwho received the Direct Payment Reminder would be generated and sent via email\n\n2\n\n\fto the Organisation (“Collated Payment Reminder”). Both the Direct Payment\nReminder and Collated Payment Reminder were automatically generated on a\nscheduled frequency and sent to the customers and Organisation by the Hyperion\nSystem without any manual intervention from the Organisation (the “Automated\nPayment Reminder System”).\n\n6. The Automated Payment Reminder System had been successfully implemented in\nother countries, and RCL Philippines put in place the following process to handle\nrequests from Royal Caribbean Group entities related to the Hyperion System:\n(a) RCL Philippines would receive a request from respective Royal Caribbean\nentity for a new process to be implemented in the Hyperion System;\n(b) RCL Philippines would review the scope of the request and configure the\nHyperion System;\n(c) RCL Philippines would then run a test cycle and a test email would be\ngenerated to RCL Philippines to test for whether the content was in line with\nthe request by the requesting Royal Caribbean entity;\n(d) Thereafter, RCL Philippines would send a sample of the output email to the\nrelevant Royal Caribbean entity to review; and\n(e) The relevant Royal Caribbean entity would sign off on the implementation and\nRCL Philippines would then implement the new process to go live.\n\n7. Investigations revealed that the Data Breach Incident occurred because RCL\nPhilippines made an error in the coding of the email parameters in the Structured\nQuery Language (“SQL”) script when configuring the Hyperion System as\ndescribed in paragraph 6(b), leading to the Collated Payment Reminders being\n\n3\n\n\fsent to the first customers in the mailing lists instead of the Organisation.\nConsequently, the personal data of the Singapore customers contained in the\nCollated Payment Reminders were disclosed to certain unrelated customers.\n\n8. Both the Organisation and RCL Philippines were not aware of this error until they\nwere informed of the Complaint to the Commission referenced in paragraph 1. As\nthe Automated Payment Reminder System was new and unfamiliar to the\nOrganisation at the material time, the Organisation and its employees were also\nnot aware that it was supposed to be receiving the Collated Payment Reminders.\n\n9. The Data Breach Incident happened after the Organisation provided lists of\nSingapore customers with outstanding payments due to RCL Philippines for\nprocessing with the Hyperion System. The Commission is of the view that the\ncoding error that occurred during the configuration of the Hyperion System was\nwholly within RCL Philippines’ operations and that the Data Breach Incident did not\narise from any business functions that the Organisation was conducting as a data\nintermediary on behalf of RCL.\n\n10. In the above circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data\nProtection finds that the Organisation was not in breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\f11. We note that the Organisation had taken the following remedial actions:\n(a) Conducted additional trainings for its employees to be mindful of the\nimportance of data protection in its business processes;\n(b) Reviewed its supervisory framework for new employees so that similar\nincidents would not happen again; and\n(c) Reviewed its communication with RCL Philippines for implementation of any\nnew processes.\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks.\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"Singtel was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident which occurred on or about 20 January 2021 whereby threat actor(s) exfiltrated personal data by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities of a third party file transfer appliance.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Information and Communications"],"date":"2022-05-19","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Singapore-Telecommunication-Limited---101221.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No Breach of the Protection Obligation by Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/05/no-breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-singapore-telecommunications","timestamp":"2022-05-19","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCase No. DP-2102-B7878\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nSingapore Telecommunication Limited\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On\n\n10\n\nFebruary\n\n2021,\n\nSingapore\n\nTelecommunication\n\nLimited\n\n(the\n\n“Organisation”) notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) of a personal data breach that had occurred through the\nexploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in a File Transfer Appliance (“FTA”)\nprovided by a third party system (the “Incident”).\n\n2. As a result of the Incident, 9,921 files containing personal data were exfiltrated.\nThe personal data of 163,370 individuals which included their name, NRIC\nnumber, FIN, UIN, nationality, date of birth, address, email address, mobile\nnumber, photograph, staff, company pass or ID, bank account number, credit\nPage 1 of 3\n\n\fcard information (with expiry date), billing information, and vehicle number were\naffected.\n\n3. The Organisation engaged an external cybersecurity company, FireEye\nMandiant, to investigate the Incident. Its investigations found that the threat\nactors had exploited two (2) zero-day vulnerabilities of the FTA to gain\nunauthorised access to the FTA’s MySQL database and subsequent file\ndownloading.\n\n4. Investigations revealed that the Organisation had a license to use the FTA with\nthe FTA developer, Accellion Pte Ltd (“Accellion”). Accellion was the only party\nthat had access to the proprietary source code to the FTA system. Accordingly,\nthe discovery and rectification of the zero-day vulnerabilities within the FTA\nsystem fell within the sole responsibility and control of the developer. We are of\nthe view that the Organisation could not have detected or prevented the incident\nas it had no control or visibility of the zero-day vulnerability of the FTA.\n\n5. The Organisation had provided and made reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect personal data in its possession and/or control in relation to the Incident.\nThe Organisation maintained the practice of updating and patching the FTA\nwithin five (5) days of patch/update receipt.\n\n6. Following the Incident, the Organisation took prompt and extensive remedial\nboth to mitigate the effects of the Incident and enhance the robustness of its\nsecurity measures. This included shutting down the FTA, conducting thorough\n\nPage 2 of 3\n\n\freview of processes and file sharing protocols to enhance information security\nposture, and offering identity monitoring service to the affected individuals.\n\n7. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection is\nsatisfied that the Organisation had met its Protection Obligation under section\n24 of the PDPA and cannot be held liable for zero-day vulnerabilities on a third\nparty system.

An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control by\nmaking reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"Directions were issued to ACL Construction (S) for breach of the PDPA in relation to failure to appoint a data protection officer and no policies and practices in place to comply with the PDPA.","tags":["Accountability","Directions","Construction","No DPO"],"date":"2022-04-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision--ACL-Construction-S-Pte-Ltd--030222.pdf","nature":"Accountability","title":"Breach of Accountability Obligation by ACL Construction (S)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/03/breach-of-accountability-obligation-by-acl-construction","timestamp":"2022-04-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2107-B8598\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nACL Construction (S) Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.

Thereafter, the ACL staff discovered that the files had been encrypted.\nThe Organisation then sought external IT support.\n\n3. The Organisation informed the Commission that the affected files contained the\nfollowing data related to their projects:\n(i) Quotation folder – quotations (to clients and from suppliers), delivery orders,\ninvoices and other supporting documents;\n(ii) Common folder – project document and photographs; and\nPage 1 of 3\n\n\f(iii) Drawing folder – CAD drawings.\n\n4. Our investigations revealed that the affected files contained the names of the\nOrganisation’s customers, the relevant liaison person, their business contact\nnumber(s) and/or business email(s). As the names, business contact numbers and\nbusiness emails were not provided by the individuals concerned for a personal\npurpose, they would constitute “business contact information” as defined under the\nPersonal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”), and fall outside the scope of the Act by\nvirtue of section 4(5) of the PDPA. Accordingly, while the Organisation may have\nsuffered a data breach, no personal data was in fact affected.\n\n5. This finding alone would have brought the matter to a close. However, in the course\nof our investigations, the Commission found out that the Organisation had failed to\ndesignate one or more individuals, commonly known as a Data Protection Officer\n(“DPO”), to be responsible for ensuring that the Organisation complies with the\nPDPA, as required under section 11(3) of the PDPA. The Organisation’s omission\nto have any data protection policies in place meant that it was also in breach of\nsection 12(a) of the PDPA.\n6. The Commission is cognizant that by virtue of the nature of the Organisation’s\nbusiness, the Organisation primarily deals with business contact information from\nits corporate clients. Having said that, while no personal data may have been\naffected as a result of the Incident, the Organisation still has to comply with the\naccountability obligation, as set out in sections 11 and 12 of the PDPA so as to\nprotect the personal data of its employees, and any other personal data it may\nincidentally process, come into control or possession of.\nPage 2 of 3\n\n\f7. The Commission notes that after the Incident, the Organisation took prompt\nremedial actions and duly appointed a member of its staff to be responsible for\nensuring that the Organisation complies with the PDPA.\n\n8. Nonetheless, bearing in mind the Organisation’s low level of awareness of its\nobligations under the PDPA, the Commission considered that it would be most\nappropriate in lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to direct the Organisation to\ncomply with the following:\na. To develop and implement policies and practices to comply with the provisions\nof the PDPA; and\nb. Put in place a programme of compulsory training for employees of ACL on\ncompliance with the PDPA when handling personal data.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nCompliance with PDPA\n11(3). An organisation must designate one or more individuals to be responsible for ensuring that the\norganisation complies with the PDPA.\nPolicies and practices\n12(a). An Organisation must develop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the\norganisation to meet the obligations of the organisation under the PDPA.\n\nPage 3 of 3\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $35,000 was imposed on GeniusU for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access and exfiltration of individuals' personal data stored in its staging database.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Education"],"date":"2022-04-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---GeniusU-Pte-Ltd--180122.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by GeniusU","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/03/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-geniusu","timestamp":"2022-04-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2101-B7725\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nGeniusU Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 12 January 2021, GeniusU Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of unauthorized\naccess and exfiltration of a staging application database (the “Database”)\nholding personal data (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe personal data of approximately 1.26 million users were affected. The\ndatasets affected comprised first and last name, email address, location and last\nsign-in IP address.\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation’s internal investigations revealed that the likely cause of the\nIncident was compromise of one of its developer’s password, either because the\ndeveloper used a weak password for his GitHub account or the password for his\nGitHub account had been compromised. This allowed the threat actor to enter\n\n1\n\n\fthe Organisation’s GitHub environment. As the Organisation had stored the login\ncredentials to the Database in the codebase in its GitHub environment, the threat\nactor was able to gain access to and exfiltrate personal data stored in the\nDatabase.\n\n4.\n\nThe Organisation took the following remedial measures after the Incident:\na.\n\nRotated the credentials of the Database;\n\nb.\n\nRemoved all hard-coded credentials from the codebase;\n\nc.\n\nPurged all existing website sessions;\n\nd.\n\nRemoved all personal data from non-production environment servers,\n\ne.\n\nImplemented multi-factor authentication on all work-related accounts;\n\nf.\n\nImplemented a standardised cyber security policy and related procedures\nfor all staff; and\n\ng.\n\n5.\n\nNotified users and the GDPR data authority (Ireland) of the Incident.\n\nThe Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for this matter to be\nhandled under the Commission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This\nmeant that the Organisation had voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted\n\n2\n\n\fto the facts set out in this decision. The Organisation also admitted that it was in\nbreach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n6.\n\nBased on its admissions, the Organisation had breached the Protection\nObligation by:\n\na.\n\nStoring credentials for the Database in the codebase in its GitHub\nenvironment. This meant that once the threat actor was able to access\nthe GitHub environment, he was able to discover the credentials to\naccess personal data stored in the Database; and\n\nb.\n\nStoring actual personal data in the Database that was in a nonproduction (testing) environment, which are usually not as secure as\nproduction environments. Actual personal data should not be stored in\ntesting environments, which are known to be less secure.\n\n7.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation is found to be in breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA.\n\n8.\n\nHaving considered the circumstances set out above and the factors listed at\nsection 48J(6) of the PDPA and the circumstances of the case, including (i) the\nOrganisation’s upfront voluntary admission of liability which significantly reduced\n\n3\n\n\fthe time and resources required for investigations; and (ii) the prompt remedial\nactions undertaken by the Organisation, the Organisation is given a notice to pay\na financial penalty of $35,000.\n9.\n\nThe Organisation must make payment of the financial penalty within 30 days\nfrom the notice accompanying date this decision, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\n10.

On 11 March 2021, Trinity Christian Centre Limited (the “Organisation”) notified\nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that its database\nservers containing personal data were infected with ransomware on or around 17\nFebruary 2021 (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. In this regard, the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in\nthis decision. It also admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal\nData Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n1\n\n\fThe Incident\n3. The Organisation runs Trinity Christian Church in Singapore.\n\n4. At the time of the Incident, the database servers contained 72,285 individuals’ data.\nThe types of data affected for each individual varied, and included at times an\nindividual’s name, full identification number, residential address, contact number,\nemail address, photograph, date of birth, age, marital status, education level,\nand/or description of medical condition (if applicable).\n\n5. Investigations by the Organisation revealed that the Organisation maintained an\nopen and publicly exposed remote desktop protocol port. This allowed a threat\nactor with access to compromised administrator account credentials to enter the\nOrganisation’s network and database servers to execute ransomware attack on 17\nFebruary 2021, rendering the databases inaccessible.\n\n6. The Organisation managed to restore the affected databases from its back-up\ncopies. Based on the Organisation’s investigations, there was no evidence to\nsuggest that the threat actor exfiltrated the Organisation’s databases.\n\nThe Organisation’s Admission\n7. The Organisation admitted that it had breached the Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA as:\n2\n\n\fa. It could have implemented separate access controls (i.e. separate logins) to\nprotect the databases containing personal data; and\n\nb. The initial unauthorised entry to the Organisation’s network was through an\nadministrator account that the Organisation had assigned to an IT vendor it had\nengaged to develop and test applications. The Organisation conceded that it\nfailed to stipulate data protection requirements on its vendor.\n\nRemediation\n8. Following the Incident, the Organisation notified its church members on 8 April\n2021. The Organisation changed all user and administrator passwords, closed all\nunused and open ports used for remote access and restricted logon access with\ndomain administrator privileges to servers and workstations. A security review was\nalso conducted and the Organisation implemented real time threat monitoring,\ndetection, and response measures.\n\nThe Commission’s Decision\n9. As noted earlier, the Organisation admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA as it could have implemented separate access controls to protect the\ndatabases containing personal data. In our view, the number and type of personal\ndata sets in the possession or under the control of the Organisation created a\n3\n\n\fsecurity need for stronger access control beyond reliance on frontend password\nprotection. Indeed, with increasingly sophisticated phishing and social engineering\ntechniques, adding another layer of protection to protect backend database\nservers, and manage the risks that frontend login credentials may be compromised\nwas a reasonable security measure, which the Organisation also accepted.\n\n10. The Commission had also previously emphasised in our decisions1 and in the\nCommission’s Guide to Managing Data Intermediaries that organisations that\nengage IT vendors should ensure that their IT vendors are aware of the need for\npersonal data protection by making it part of their contractual terms.\n\n11. The Organisation admitted that its contract with its IT vendor only contained a\ngeneral confidentiality clause not to disclose information obtained without the\nOrganisation’s prior written consent. Even though the Organisation was well aware\nthat its IT vendor would process personal data, the Organisation failed to stipulate\nwithin the contract any requirements on the vendor to protect the church members’\npersonal data, thereby breaching section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n12. In determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation for the breach, the\nCommissioner took into account the following factors:\n\n1\n\nSee examples – Jigyasa [2020] SGPDPC 9, MDIS Corporation Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 11 and Civil Service Club [2020]\nSGPDPC 15.\n\n4\n\n\fAggravating\n(a) The high number of affected individuals of 72,285 which included\napproximately 8,300 minors;\n(b) The nature of the affected data. In particular, the affected databases\ncontained descriptions of medical conditions provided by individuals\ncounselling services and overseas mission applications. Individuals would\nexpect a high level of confidence when they convey such information to the\nOrganisation for handling;\n\nMitigating\n(c) The Organisation’s upfront admission of breach of the Protection Obligation,\nand the prompt remedial actions to mitigate the effects and prevent\nrecurrence of the Incident; and\n(d) There was no evidence of exfiltration of the Organisation’s databases.\n\n13. On account of the above, the Organisation is directed to pay a financial penalty of\n$20,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction. In view of the remedial action\nof the Organisation, the Commission will not be issuing any other directions.\n\n5\n\n\fThe following provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

Unfortunately, this was exactly\nwhat happened to at least 78 individuals who purchased pre-paid M1 SIM cards from\none Mr Neo Yong Xiang (“NYX”) the sole proprietor of Yoshi Mobile (“YM”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission observed that between January 2020 and November 2020,\n\nthere were 3,636 Do Not Call (“DNC”) complaints from persons who received specified\nmessages even though their telephone numbers are registered with the DNC register1.\nFurther analysis revealed that 1,379 of the messages were sent from 98 SIM cards\nregistered at YM. The Commission initiated investigations against NYX (trading as\nYM) for suspected breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n3.\n\nNYX has operated YM since 2013. As an exclusive retailer of M1 SIM cards,\n\nNYX was provided a terminal device installed at YM’s premises for the purposes of\n\n1\n\nUnder Section 43 of the PDPA, a person is not allowed to send specified messages to a Singapore\ntelephone number registered with the DNC register unless the person has, at the time where he sends\nthe specified message, valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone number is not listed in the DNC\nregister.\n\n\fSIM card registration (the “M1 Terminal Device”). SIM card registration had to be\ncarried out in accordance with the conditions of M1’s telecommunications licence\ngranted under Section 5 of the Telecommunications Act (Chapter 323). The typical\nSIM card registration process in YM would be as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the customer’s identity document (e.g. identity card, passport, work pass\netc.) would be scanned using the M1 Terminal Device. The system would\ncapture the customer’s personal data, and state whether the customer had\nreached the permitted limit of 3 prepaid SIM cards.\n\n(b)\n\nNext, the barcode of the SIM card(s) would be scanned so that they could be\ntagged to the registered customer.\n\n(c)\n\nFinally, a mobile application would be used to load credit value to the prepaid\nSIM card(s) to activate them for usage. M1’s policy was for each prepaid M1\nSIM card to have a zero-initial balance, and for retailers to load some or all of\nthe money paid by the customer.\n\n4.\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that NYX exploited the above\n\nregistration process in order to use his customers’ personal data without consent to\nregister for additional prepaid M1 SIM cards that his customers did not intend to\npurchase. NYX would do so by one of two methods:\n\n(a)\n\nMethod 1 – After scanning a customer’s identity documents via the M1\nTerminal Device, NYX would check whether the customer was still entitled to\npurchase more SIM cards (in addition to the SIM card(s) that were intended to\nbe purchased). If so, NYX would proceed to register additional SIM card(s) to\nthe same customer without their knowledge (the “illicit SIM card(s)”).\n\n\f(b)\n\nMethod 2 – Occasionally, customers who had completed the registration\nprocess would not want to continue with their purchase after learning that the\ncredit value of the SIM card would have to be separately loaded. At this\njuncture, instead of cancelling or reversing the registration process, NYX would\nkeep the SIM card(s) and activate them without the customer’s knowledge.\n\n5.\n\nDuring investigations, NYX admitted that his purpose for registering the illicit\n\nSIM cards was to sell them to earn extra money. In his three years of selling such illicit\nSIM cards to anonymous walk-in customers, NYX estimated that he earned\napproximately $15,000 (i.e. around 100 illicit SIM cards per year at a price of $50 per\ncard).\n\n6.\n\nThe affected personal data collected and used by NYX to register the illicit SIM\n\ncards include, at a minimum, the following personal data of 78 individuals (used to\nregister 94 SIM cards):\n(a)\n\nthe customers’ names;\n\n(b)\n\nthe customers’ addresses; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe customers’ NRIC numbers and/or work permit numbers.\n\n7.\n\nAfter registering the illicit SIM cards, NYX would sell them to anonymous buyers\n\nwho occasionally patronised YM from 2018 to 2020. Investigations revealed that illicit\nSIM cards registered at YM were exploited by unknown perpetrators to send\nunsolicited spam and/or scam messages, often also in contravention of the DNC\nprovisions of the PDPA.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n\f8.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines an “organisation” broadly to include “any\n\nindividual, company, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”. YM\nis a sole proprietorship and has no separate legal personality from NYX. Accordingly,\nNYX constitutes an organisation under the PDPA Further, NYX is bound by the\nprovisions of the PDPA (including Part IV) as he was acting in a business capacity in\nselling the SIM cards to make a profit, and not a domestic capacity. As stated in Re\nSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1:\n“9\n\n…Although the PDPA defines “organisation” broadly to include\n\nindividuals, an individual is expressly excluded from the Data Protection\nProvisions in the PDPA if the individual was acting in a personal or domestic\ncapacity. Therefore, when it comes to the application of the PDPA to\nindividuals, it is usually germane to the issue to determine whether the\nindividual was acting in a personal or domestic capacity. If the individual was\nnot acting in a personal or domestic capacity, then she will be treated as an\n“organisation” for the purposes of the PDPA, and obliged to comply with the\nData Protection Provisions.\n\n10\n\nOn the facts, the Respondent was clearly not acting in a personal or\n\ndomestic capacity in respect of the buying and selling of leads. The purchase\nand sales of the leads were not for her own personal use or purposes, but in\norder to make a profit. Under the PDPA, “business” includes an activity of any\norganisation, whether or not carried on for purposes of gain, or conducted on a\nregular, repetitive or continuous basis, but does not include an individual acting\nin his personal or domestic capacity. In this regard, the converse of a person\nacting in a personal or domestic capacity is one that acts in a business capacity.\n\n\fThis was the case for the Respondent in respect of the purchase and sale of\nleads.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n9.\n\nBased on the circumstances set out above, the issues to be determined in this\n\ncase are:\n\n(a)\n\nWhether NYX breached the Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nWhether NYX breached the Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of\nthe PDPA.\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA\n\n10.\n\nUnder Section 13 of the PDPA, organisations are prohibited from collecting,\n\nusing or disclosing an individual’s personal data unless the individual gives, or is\ndeemed to have given, his consent, an exception to the requirement for consent\napplies, or if otherwise authorised under the PDPA or any other written law (the\n“Consent Obligation”). In this connection, Section 14(1) of the PDPA further provides\nthat an individual has not given consent unless he has been notified of the purposes\nfor which his personal data was being collected, used or disclosed. If an organisation\nfails to do so, any consent obtained from an individual is invalid.\n\n11.\n\nOn the facts of this case, NYX breached the Consent Obligation by using his\n\ncustomers’ personal data to register the illicit SIM cards for sale to anonymous buyers.\nWhen NYX used Method 1, NYX’s customer(s) only consented to the collection and\n\n\fuse of their personal data for the purpose of registering the number of SIM cards which\nthey had requested. They did not provide consent to NYX to use their personal data\nfor any other purpose, including the registration of additional SIM cards.\n\n12.\n\nIn the case of Method 2, the customers withdrew their consent to the collection\n\nand use of their personal data to purchase M1 SIM cards, and NYX should have\ncancelled the SIM card registrations. Instead, he went behind his customers’ backs\nand used their personal data without consent to register illicit SIM cards.\n\n13.\n\nIn the premises, NYX is determined to have breached the Consent Obligation\n\nby using his customers’ personal data without their consent.\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under Section 18 of the PDPA\n\n14.\n\nUnder Section 18 of the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances, and where that individual has been\ninformed of the said purposes under Section 20 of the PDPA (the “Purpose Limitation\nObligation”). As set out in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in\nthe PDPA2:\n“The main objective of the Purpose Limitation Obligation is to ensure that\norganisations collect, use and disclose personal data that are relevant for the\npurposes, and only for purposes that are reasonable. Consistent with the\nNotification Obligation, the Purpose Limitation Obligation also limits the\npurposes for which personal data may be collected, used or disclosed to those\n\n2\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 February 2021)\n\n\fwhich have been informed to the individuals concerned pursuant to the\nNotification Obligation (where applicable).\n\nFor the purposes of section 18 (and as stated in that section), whether a\npurpose is reasonable depends on whether a reasonable person would\nconsider\n\nit appropriate\n\nin\n\nthe\n\ncircumstances.\n\nHence\n\nthe\n\nparticular\n\ncircumstances involved need to be taken into account in determining whether\nthe purpose of such collection, use or disclosure is reasonable. For example, a\npurpose that is in violation of a law or which would be harmful to the individual\nconcerned is unlikely to be considered appropriate by a reasonable person.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n15.\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation operates independently from the Consent\n\nObligation. Even if the data subject gave his consent for his personal data to be used\nfor a particular purpose, it does not follow that the said purpose is reasonable in the\ncircumstances. As stated in Re AIA Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 10 at [18]:\n“Section 18 of the PDPA provides, inter alia, that an organisation may collect,\nuse or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a\nreasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. It should\nbe borne in mind that Section 18 of the PDPA is an independent obligation that\norganisations would need to comply with even if it had obtained the consent\nfrom the relevant individual for the collection, use or disclosure of his or her\npersonal data. This is an important aspect of the PDPA as it is effective in\naddressing excesses in the collection, use or disclosure of personal data under\na broadly-worded consent clause, like in the present case.”\n\n\f[emphasis added]\n\n16.\n\nIn this case, NYX has admitted that he had fraudulently used his customers’\n\npersonal data for the purpose of registering illicit SIM cards in order to sell them to\nanonymous buyers. This is plainly not a reasonable purpose under any circumstances,\nas individuals could not have reasonably intended for their personal data to be used\nto register illicit SIM cards purely for NYX’s financial gain.\n\n17.\n\nIn the premises, NYX is determined to have breached the Purpose Limitation\n\nObligation.\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n18.\n\nIn determining whether NYX should be required to pay a financial penalty under\n\nsection 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\nconsidered, with particular emphasis on the following aggravating and mitigating\nfactors:\n\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nNYX’s breaches of the PDPA were difficult to detect as it included a high\n\ndegree of planning and pre-meditation by him to evade detection by authorities;\n(b)\n\nNYX was entrusted by his customers with their personal data for the\n\npurpose of registering prepaid SIM cards, and he abused their trust by misusing\ntheir personal data;\n(c)\n\nNYX’s breaches of the PDPA caused inconvenience to innocent parties,\n\nas the illicit SIM cards sold by him were used to send unsolicited messages to\nphone numbers that were registered with the DNC register;\n\n\f(d)\n\nThrough the sale of the illicit SIM cards for approximately 3 years, NYX\n\nfinancially gained at least $15,000 for his misuse of his customers’ personal\ndata; and\n\nMitigating Factor\n(e)\n\nNYX admitted to liability early in the investigation process, thus reducing\n\nthe time and resources expended on investigations.\n\nNYX’s representations\n19.\n\nOn 7 September 2021, NYX was notified of the Commissioner’s Preliminary\n\nDecision (as set out above) and intention to impose a financial penalty of $35,000. On\n20 September 2021, NYX submitted written representations on the amount of financial\npenalty that was to be imposed. NYX raised the following factors to argue for either a\nwaiver of the imposition of a financial penalty, or (in the alternative) for a lower financial\npenalty:\n\n(a)\n\nNYX was facing a difficult financial situation, as he had low savings / monthly\nincome, and was responsible for servicing several outstanding liabilities (such\nas a vehicle loan, housing loan and renovation loan). Additionally, he was also\nresponsible for paying the medical bills of his parent. NYX claimed that it would\ncause him undue hardship if a high financial penalty was imposed.\n\n(b)\n\nNYX had breached the PDPA for financial gain due to extenuating\ncircumstances, as his business was adversely affected by COVID-19 and the\n\n\flandlord of Yoshi Mobile had refused to pass on the relevant COVID-19 rental\nrelief provided by the Government.\n\n(c)\n\nNYX’s breaches of the PDPA can be distinguished from the breaches\ncommitted by other organisations on the basis that he did not leak or sell the\npersonal data for financial gain. Instead, he had merely used his customers’\npersonal data to register for SIM cards and was not the person who used the\nillicit SIM cards to send unsolicited text messages to telephone numbers on the\nDNC register. In this connection, NYX pointed to other decisions where the\nCommission had imposed a lower financial penalty or a warning on other\norganisations that had breached the PDPA.\n\n20.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we have accepted and taken into account NYX’s\n\nrepresentation at [19(a)] above, but are unable to do the same with respect to the\nrepresentations set out in [19(b)] and [19(c)] above.\n\n21.\n\nWhen imposing financial penalties, the Commission may consider the personal\n\nand financial circumstances of the organisation / individual, bearing in mind that\nfinancial penalties imposed should avoid imposing a crushing burden or cause undue\nhardship on organisations: see Re Jigyasa [2021] SGPDPCR 1. In considering NYX’s\nrepresentations at [19(a)], the Commission gave due consideration to the existing\nfinancial commitments on NYX and accepted that the imposition of a heavy financial\npenalty would cause substantial hardship to NYX.\n\n22.\n\nWe are unable to accept NYX’s representation at [19(b)] that he had breached\n\nthe PDPA due to extenuating financial difficulties that arose due to the COVID-19\n\n\fpandemic. Based on the Commission’s investigations, NYX has been using his\ncustomers’ personal data to register illicit SIM cards for the purpose of selling them to\nthird parties since 2018. NYX’s modus operandi (as described in [4]) predated the\nonset of COVID-19, and it is disingenuous for NYX to attribute his actions to the\nfinancial difficulties that followed the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n23.\n\nWe are also unable to accept NYX’s representation at [19(c)] that his breach of\n\nthe PDPA was less serious than the breaches committed by various other\norganisations. Compared with the decisions that NYX mentioned, NYX’s culpability is\nmore egregious as his breach involved the intentional misuse of personal data from a\nposition of trust, over a protracted period of time, for personal financial gain. While\nNYX did not send any unsolicited text messages or made any unsolicited calls directly\nto telephone numbers on the DNC register, his sale of the unsolicited SIM cards to\nanonymous buyers (that NYX did not verify or identify) facilitated the commission of\nthose offences and the harm caused as a consequence. The anonymous sale of illicit\nSIM cards may also be the catalyst or precursor for other illicit activities.\n\n24.\n\nHaving carefully considered the all the relevant factors of this case including\n\nthe representations made by NYX, the Commissioner has decided to reduce the\nfinancial penalty to $21,000. This decision is made on an exceptional basis, and\nshould not be taken as setting any precedent for future cases. The Commissioner\nhereby requires NYX to pay a financial penalty of $21,000 in 18 monthly instalments\nby the due dates as set out in the notice accompanying this decision, failing which\ninterest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\n\f25.\n\nThe Commission will not be issuing any further directions given that M1 has\n\nbarred NYX from offering the sale of its prepaid SIM cards.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $4,000 was imposed on Tanah Merah Country Club for failing to put in place reasonable security to protect personal data in its possession.

On 24 February 2021, Tanah Merah Country Club (the “Organisation”) notified\nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that an\nemployee’s (the “Employee”) email account had been compromised and 600\nphishing emails had been sent to various individuals on 22 February 2021 (the\n“Incident”).\n\n2. The Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. This meant that the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out within this\ndecision. It also admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n3. The Organisation’s investigations revealed that it was likely that the Organisation’s\nemail accounts had been subjected to password spraying attacks. Password\nspraying is a type of password attack where a threat actor uses a few commonly\nused or default passwords against many different accounts. In contrast to\n\n\ftraditional brute-force attacks, where the targeted account may quickly get lockedout due to account-lockout policies that only allow for a limited number of failed\nattempts, password spraying attacks allow a threat actor to mount an attack against\nmany accounts with a single commonly used password, while remaining\nundetected, before attempting the second password. At the time of the Incident,\nthe Employee was using the password “TMCC@1234”, which the Employee had\nnot changed for a period of nearly 5 years, since 2016 to the time of the Incident\non 22 February 2021.\n\n4. After gaining access to the Employee’s email account, the threat actor accessed\nthe personal data of 467 individuals, including:\na. The email addresses of 155 club members and 284 members of public,\nwhich the threat actor had used to send phishing emails to.\nb. The name, and/or NRIC number, and/or email addresses of a further 28\nindividuals contained within the emails.\n\n5. Prior to the Incident, the Organisation had informed its employees via an email IT\nnewsletter in August 2018 of the need to change their password once every 3\nmonths, and to use passwords which are at least 8 characters, with a combination\nof uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special character, and number. In September\n2019, the Organisation sent another email IT newsletter to inform its employees of\nthe implementation of a domain password policy. This meant that the abovementioned password requirements became system enforced.\n\n\f6. Despite disseminating these email IT newsletters where it referred to its password\nrequirements and the implementation of a system-enforced domain password\npolicy, the Organisation failed to further develop its password requirements into a\nfull-fledged password policy in writing and disseminate it in such a manner whereby\nall its employees, new and old, could easily take reference from the password\npolicy and consult the password policy at any time. It was only on 23 February\n2021, after the Incident had occurred, that the Organisation documented its\npassword policy in writing.\n\n7. We had previously emphasized the importance of organisations having a written\npersonal data protection policy so as to guide its employees and staff in Re\nFurnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7. In that case, the Commission noted at [14] as\nfollows:\n“The lack of a written policy is a big drawback to the protection of personal data.\nWithout having a policy in writing, employees and staff would not have a reference\nfor the organisation’s policies and practices which they are to follow in order to\nprotect personal data. Such policies and practices would be ineffective if passed\non by word of mouth, and indeed, the Organisation may run the risk of the policies\nand practices being passed on incorrectly. Having a written policy is conducive to\nthe conduct of internal training, which is a necessary component of an internal data\nprotection programme”.\n\n8. A properly documented password policy is therefore crucial for the protection of\npersonal data. In this regard, the Organisation admitted that it had breached the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA as it failed to document its\npassword policy in writing.\n\n\f9. The Commission recently issued a “Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\nSystems” on 14 September 2021. In the Guide, we noted that in order to maintain\ngood governance over its personal data and mitigate data breach risks throughout\nthe data lifecycle, organisations should develop and implement ICT security\npolicies for data protection. Key ICT policies would include a password policy.\n\n10. Prior to the issuance of this Guide, the Commission had also released a Handbook\non “How to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches”, which is\ncomplemented by the Checklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data\nBreaches. In the Handbook, the Commission identified poor management of\naccounts and passwords as one of the five common causes and types of data\nbreaches. We noted that the use of default value, weak or easily guessable\npasswords result in accounts being particularly vulnerable to brute force or\ndictionary attacks. We therefore recommended that organisations adopt and\nimplement a strong password policy, with the following good practices:\n\n(i)\n\nEnforcing a password history policy to ensure that employees do not reuse\ntheir previous passwords;\n\n(ii)\n\nEncouraging users to use passphrases such as “Iwant2l@se10kg”, which\nmay be long and complex, yet easy to remember; and\n\n(iii)\n\nDiscouraging users from using the same passwords across different\nsystems.\n\n11. In this regard, we observed that the Organisation’s email IT newsletters to its\nemployees had cited “TMCC_Password_123” as an example of what amounts to\na good password. Unfortunately, we are unable to endorse the Organisation’s\n\n\fchoice of “TMCC_Password_123” as an example of what amounts to a good\npassword. In Re Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1, the Commission highlighted\nthat a password that complies with the recommended password complexity rules\nin form could still be a weak password easily guessable and vulnerable to\npassword attacks if the password incorporates components such as the\norganisation’s name, which is not difficult to guess and crack. In this regard, we\nnote that in the Organisation’s password policy, which it adopted on 23 February\n2021, the Organisation now recommends that its employees refrain from the use\nof the Organisation’s name or abbreviations such as “TMCC”.\n\n12. In addition, the Organisation also admitted that it had failed to provide structured\nand organised training for its staff on how to ensure compliance with the obligations\nunder the PDPA and how personal data should be handled in the course of their\nwork. Only ad-hoc and informal training had been provided. As a result, the\nEmployee lacked the awareness of the need to change her password at more\nregular intervals and of the need to use a strong password. The Employee did not\nreceive system prompts to change her password as the domain password policy\nwas not pushed down to her system due to a domain controller disruption.\n\n13. The Commission wishes to emphasize that staff training is a critical and necessary\ncomponent to ensure that an organisation is well placed to protect the personal\ndata in its possession and/or control. The Protection Obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA extends to and includes the training of all employees who have to\nhandle personal data in the course of their work so that an organisation’s\nemployees can then successfully adopt and implement the policies and best\n\n\fpractices necessary to ensure the protection of personal data in an organisation’s\npossession and/or control.\n\n14. In light of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds\nthe Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n15. Following the incident, the Organisation engaged an IT forensic vendor for\ninvestigation. We note that the Organisation has since implemented the measures\nrecommended by the vendor to improve its cybersecurity. The Organisation has\nalso documented its password policy, implemented regular updates, conducted\nuser awareness training, and other trainings on personal data protection.\n\n16. The Organisation cooperated with the Commission’s investigations, admitted to its\nbreach of the Protection Obligation, and took prompt remedial actions.\n\n17. Having considered the circumstances set out above, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA, and in particular, the Organisation’s voluntary admission to\nbeing in breach of section 24 of the PDPA under the Expedited Breach Decision\nProcedure, which is a significant mitigation factor, the Deputy Commissioner for\nPersonal Data Protection requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\n$4,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n\f18. Finally, in view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, no other\ndirections are necessary.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks;\nand\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on North London Collegiate School (Singapore) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of its student applicants’ personal data residing in a website directory folder.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Education"],"date":"2022-02-18","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---NLCS---01122021.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by North London Collegiate School (Singapore)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2022/02/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-north-london-collegiate-school","timestamp":"2022-02-18","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2107-B8562\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nNorth London Collegiate School (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 July 2021, North London Collegiate School (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) that a parent of a student was able to view and access a student\nreport by the Organisation by performing searches using internet search engines.\n(the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. In this regard, the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nin this decision. It also admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal\nData Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n3.\n\nInvestigations revealed that, from December 2019 to July 2021, parents of\nprospective students could submit documents for admission applications via the\nOrganisation’s website (https://nlcssingapore.sg/).\n\nAll submitted documents\n\nwere stored in a directory/ folder of the website. However, the website directory/\n\n1\n\n\ffolder was not adequately secured from automatic indexing by web crawlers. As\na result, the submitted documents were indexed by search engines and could\nshow up in online search results.\n\n4.\n\nThe table below summarises1 the number of affected individuals for each type of\ndocument accessible in the directory/ folder (the “Compromised Documents”):\nS/N\n\n5.\n\nType of Document\n\nNumber\n\n(Scanned or Electronic Copies)\n\nAffected\n\n1\n\nPassport\n\n1,742\n\n2\n\nIdentity cards (i.e NRICs)\n\n1,714\n\n3\n\nDigital Photographs of applicants\n\n720\n\n4\n\nBirth Certificates\n\n709\n\n5\n\nAcademic Reports\n\n676\n\n6\n\nImmunization Records\n\n670\n\nof\n\nIndividuals\n\nThe documents above contained the following types of personal data (the\n“Personal Data Sets”) at risk of unauthorised access in the Incident - Name,\nAddress, NRIC number, Passport Number, Photograph, Date of Birth,\nimmunization details and academic details.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had only relied on a Robots.txt file deployed on\nits Website to instruct search engines to refrain from indexing the documents in\nthe website directory folder. However, it is well established that the robots\nexclusion protocol is not mandatory, in the sense that it relies on compliance of\n\n1\n\nThis table sets out the documents at risk of unauthorised access in the Incident.

Therefore, Organisations\nstoring personal data in website directory/ folders should instead implement\nproper folder or directory permissions and access controls to prevent unintended\naccess by web crawlers.\n\n7.\n\nIn addition, the Organisation had stated that it relied on a related group company\nto setup and manage its website, including to make the necessary security\narrangements to protect any personal data collected. However, in this case, there\nwere no clear business requirements (e.g. contractual stipulations) specifying\nthat the Organisation was relying on the sister company to recommend and/or\nimplement security arrangements to protect personal data that resides in the\nwebsite directory/ folder.\n\n8.\n\nRe Everlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others [2020] SGPDPC 20 stated the\narrangements to be made when organisations in a group used IT services\nprovided by a group member. An organisation receiving IT services from another\norganisation of the group should ensure that the latter is bound by either written\nagreements or group rules to protect personal data in the course of provision of\nthe services. Absent clear written personal data protection requirements of the\ngroup member managing the Organisation’s website, the responsibility to make\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Affected Personal Data in the\ndirectory/ folder of the website remained squarely with the Organisation.\n\n3\n\n\f9.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nfinds the Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n10. Following the incident, the Organisation ceased the collection of documents via\nits website and would now be utilizing a specialized school admission software\nto manage the application process and the personal data submitted. Additionally,\nthe Organisation would be implementing appropriate binding corporate rules to\ngovern the centralization of corporate functions and the handling of data\nprotection and cybersecurity within its corporate group.\n\n11. The Organisation cooperated with the Commission’s investigations, admitted to\nits breach of the Protection Obligation and took prompt remedial actions to\naddress its inadequacies in its processes. There were also no indications that\nthat the personal data affected in the Incident had been misused in any form.\nHowever, personal data of minors were at risk of unauthorised access.\n\n12.

On 6 November 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received information of an online article reporting about hacked\ndatabases being made available for downloads on several hacking forums and\nTelegram channels. In the article, Nature Society (Singapore) (the \"Organisation\")\nwas named as one of the affected Organisations (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The personal data of 5,131 members and non-members who had created\nmembership and user accounts on the Organisation’s website were affected in the\nIncident. The datasets affected comprised of names, usernames, passwords\n(encrypted), email addresses, telephone numbers, types of membership, gender,\nmailing addresses, dates of births, occupation, company and nationality.\n\n1\n\n\f3. Following the Incident, the Organisation engaged two IT professionals to carry out\nan investigation and analysis of the Organisation's website. The investigation and\nanalysis revealed vulnerabilities in the Organisation's website and suspicious SQL\ninjection activities prior to the Incident. The possible attack vector was identified as\na SQL injection attack which led to personal data on the Organisation's website\ndatabase being accessed and exfiltrated by unknown parties.\n\n4. The Organisation took the following remedial measures after the Incident:\n(a)\n\nEdited the website to stop all online membership sign-ups/renewals and\nlogins to the website;\n\n(b)\n\nRemoved all members' and users' data from the website database;\n\n(c)\n\nBacked up the website database and kept all personal data offline;\n\n(d)\n\nChange all login passwords;\n\n(e)\n\nNotified all affected individuals of the Incident via email;\n\n(f)\n\nAppointed a Data Protection Officer (\"DPO\")\n\n(g)\n\nDeveloped and implemented a personal data policy; and\n\n(d)\n\nEngaging vendors to develop a new website to improve security.\n\n5. In its representations to the Commission, the Organisation admitted to having\nbreached the Accountability Obligation under sections 11(3) and 12(a) and the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(\"PDPA\"), and requested for the matter to be dealt with in accordance with the\nCommission’s Expedited Decision Procedure.\n2\n\n\fBreach of Section 11(3) of the PDPA\n6. First, the Organisation admitted it did not designate one or more individuals\n(typically referred to as a DPO) to be responsible for ensuring that the Organisation\ncomplies with the PDPA. The responsibilities of a DPO includes (a) ensuring\ncompliance with the PDPA, (b) fostering a data protection culture, (c) handling and\nmanaging personal data queries and complaints, (d) alerting management to any\nrisks with regard to personal data and (e) liaising with the Commission if necessary.\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that the DPO plays a vital role in implementing and\nbuilding a robust data protection framework to ensure an organisation’s compliance\nwith its obligations under the PDPA.\n\nBreach of Section 12(a) of the PDPA\n7. Second, the Organisation admitted it did not develop and implement any personal\ndata protection policy prior to the Incident. In this regard, it is important to reiterate\nthat at the very basic level, an overarching personal data protection policy has to\nbe developed and implemented to ensure a consistent minimum data protection\nstandard across an organisation's practices, procedures and activities.\n\nBreach of Section 24 of the PDPA\n\n3\n\n\f8. Third, the Organisation admitted that it did not make reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data on its website database. After the\nOrganisation's website was designed and developed by an external vendor in\n2011, the Organisation did not have any contract/retainer agreement with the\nexternal vendor to maintain the website's security. As a result, the responsibility of\nprotecting its website fell squarely on the Organisation. However, the Organisation\nfailed to carry out any security measures e.g. conducting necessary security\nupdates, patches and penetration tests, thus leaving its website vulnerable to\nattacks.\n\n9. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached sections 11(3),\n12(a) and 24 of the PDPA.\n\nCommission’s Decision\n10. After considering the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA and the\ncircumstances of this case, including (i) the Organisation's upfront voluntary\nadmission of liability which significantly reduced the time and resources required\nfor investigations; (ii) the fact that the Organisation is a non-profit, registered\nsociety and (iii) the Organisation's prompt remedial actions, the Organisation is\ngiven notice to pay a financial penalty of $14,000.\n\n4\n\n\f11. The Organisation must make payment of the financial penalty within 30 days from\n\nthe date of the notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\n12. In view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, the Commission will not\nissue any directions under section 48I of the PDPA.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nCompliance with Act\n11(3). An organisation shall designate one or more individuals to be responsible for ensuring that the\norganisation complies with this Act.\nPolicies and practices\n12(a).

In July 2020, the Grass Valley entities\n(including GVSPL) were acquired by another company. Under the terms of the\nacquisition, Belden Inc. agreed to provide transition services, including administration\nof its information technology and HR systems for a period of time after the acquisition.\nTherefore, the personal data of GVSPL’s employees (and the employees of other\nGrass Valley entities) were transferred to Belden Inc. and stored in Belden Inc.’s\nservers. GVSPL’s parent company, Grass Valley USA, LLC (“GV USA”) (on behalf of\nits subsidiaries and affiliates, including GVSPL) and Belden Inc. entered into a Data\n3\n\n\fSharing Agreement dated 18 June 2020 (“DSA”) to govern the sharing of data\n(including personal data) between the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Belden Group’s information technology team\n\nnoticed anomalies in its systems. Subsequent investigations revealed that, from\nSeptember to November 2020, a threat actor had accessed the Belden Group’s\nservers in the USA and other jurisdictions through the use of malicious software at\nvarious times and exfiltrated the information and data contained therein. The\ncompromise of GVSPL’s Personal Data Sets is taken to have arisen from the\nunauthorised access to the Belden Group’s servers since there was no evidence of\nany unauthorised access directly into the systems of the Grass Valley entities.\n\n7.\n\nThe personal data of 126 individuals related to Belden Singapore (current and\n\nformer employees as well as non-employees such as suppliers / vendors) and 63\nindividuals related to GVSPL (current and former employees) were exfiltrated in the\nIncident (collectively, the “Personal Data Sets”). The types of personal data exfiltrated\nincluded the following:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nAddress;\n\n(c)\n\nEmail Address;\n\n(d)\n\nTelephone Number;\n\n(e)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(f)\n\nIdentification Number;\n\n(g)\n\nMarital Status;\n4\n\n\f(h)\n\nPhotographs;\n\n(i)\n\nSalary Information; and\n\n(j)\n\nIndividual Tax Information.\n\n8.\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, Belden Inc. implemented, or has been in the\n\nprocess of implementing, the following remediation actions:\n\n(a)\n\nThe following security measures:\ni.\n\nConducted an audit of system administrator accounts to confirm that it\nwas for valid users only\n\n(b)\n\nii.\n\nReviewed and developed plan to address incident closure activities\n\niii.\n\nImproved relevancy and frequency of security awareness campaign.\n\nThe following short-term and long-term containment actions:\ni.\n\nRoll out an endpoint security software to all server and client systems\n\nii.\n\nBlock command and control IP addresses on perimeter firewalls\n\niii.\n\nUpdate existing security software definitions\n\niv.\n\nBlock access to Mega (cloud storage file hosting service) on firewalls\n\nv.\n\nDisallow syncing of data from internal systems to unapproved external\ncloud storage services\n\nvi.\n\nRemove unnecessary accounts from privileged security groups\n\nvii.\n\nRebuild compromised systems\n\nviii.\n\nReboot business-critical systems that cannot be rebuilt\n\nix.\n\nExpedite patching of critical and high severity vulnerabilities\n5\n\n\fx.\n\nReset passwords for Domains and Enterprise administrators\n\nxi.\n\nReset passwords for all other privileged users\n\nxii.\n\nReset the password for the Kerberos account\n\nxiii.\n\nPerform enterprise-wide password reset\n\nxiv.\n\nEnsured no direct remote access is available on the systems exposed\nto the Internet\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9.\n\nAs a preliminary point, Belden Inc. is responsible for maintaining the security\n\nand integrity of the Belden Group’s systems (including its servers) and implementing\nthe appropriate safeguards. However, the data protection obligations in the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) does not apply to Belden Inc., as it does not\nprocess personal data in Singapore. It is further noted that Belden Inc. has made\nreports to the relevant authorities in the jurisdictions where the compromised servers\nare located in. Therefore, no findings are made against Belden Inc.\n\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation under section 26 of the PDPA\n\n10.\n\nSection 26(1) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall not transfer any\n\npersonal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with\nrequirements prescribed under the PDPA to ensure that organisations provide a\nstandard of protection to personal data so transferred that is comparable to the\nprotection under the PDPA (the “Transfer Limitation Obligation”). The relevant\n6\n\n\frequirements are prescribed in Part III of the Personal Data Protection Regulations\n2014 (“PDPR”)1 . In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nRegulation 9(1)(b) of the PDPR requires an organisation that transfers personal\ndata to a country or territory outside of Singapore to take appropriate steps to\nensure that the recipient of personal data is bound by legally enforceable\nobligations (in accordance with Regulation 10) to provide to the transferred\npersonal data a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under\nthe PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\nRegulation 10(1)(b) of the PDPR provides for contracts to be one such legally\nenforceable obligation. Regulation 10(2) in turn provides that such contract\nmust require the recipient of the transferred personal data to provide a\ncomparable standard of protection , and must specify the countries and\nterritories to which the personal data may be transferred under the contract;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nRegulation 10(1)(c) of the PDPR provides binding corporate rules to be another\nsuch legally enforceable obligations. Regulation 10(3) in turn provides that such\nbinding corporate rules require every recipient to provide a comparable\nstandard of protection , and must specify (i) the recipients of the transferred\npersonal data to which the binding corporate rules apply; (ii) the countries and\n\n1\n\nAs the Incident occurred on or around September 2020, the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014 apply.\nHowever, from 1 February 2021 onwards, the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021 would apply.\n\n7\n\n\fterritories to which the personal data may be transferred under the binding\ncorporate rules; and (iii) the rights and obligations provided by the binding\ncorporate rules. Further, such binding corporate rules may only be used by\nrecipients that are related to the transferring organisation.\n\n11.\n\nTo comply with the Transfer Limitation Obligation in the context of an intra-\n\ngroup transfer where there is centralisation of corporate functions, group members\ninvolved in ongoing relationships for regular cross-border transfers of personal data\nout of Singapore are required to take reasonable steps to ascertain that the overseas\ntransferee has implemented the appropriate policies, practices and / or technical\nmeasures to ensure that the transferred personal data is provided with the requisite\nlevel of protection. This is no different from an organisation’s obligation to carry out\nthe necessary due diligence vis-à-vis the transfer of personal data to an overseas data\nintermediary, since the overseas transferee is a data intermediary even though they\nare members within the same group of companies. As stated in the Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA2:\n“Overseas transfers of personal data\n6.22\n\nWhere an organisation engages a data intermediary to process personal\ndata on its behalf and for its purposes, the organisation is responsible\nfor complying with the Transfer Limitation Obligation in respect of any\noverseas transfer of personal data. This is regardless of whether the\npersonal data is transferred by the organisation to an overseas data\n\n2\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 February 2021)\n8\n\n\fintermediary or transferred overseas by the data intermediary in\nSingapore as part of its processing on behalf and for the purposes of the\norganisation.\n\n6.23\n\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation requires that an organisation ensures\nthat personal data transferred overseas is protected to a standard\ncomparable with the Data Protection Provisions. The onus is on the\ntransferring organisation to undertake appropriate due diligence and\nobtain assurances when engaging a data intermediary to ensure that it\nis capable of doing so. In undertaking its due diligence, transferring\norganisations may rely on data intermediaries’ extant protection policies\nand practices, including their assurances of compliance with relevant\nindustry standards or certification.”\n\nWhether Belden Singapore complied with the Transfer Limitation Obligation\n\n12.\n\nIt is determined that Belden Singapore had not complied with the Transfer\n\nLimitation Obligation for the reasons explained below.\n\n13.\n\nAt the material time, Belden Inc. and certain other Belden entities had put in\n\nplace a binding intra-group contract called the Global Data Transfer Agreement dated\n1 September 2020 (“GDTA”), which governs the terms on which the various Belden\nentities transfer personal data to each other.\n\n9\n\n\f14.\n\nThe GDTA contained provisions that required Belden Inc. to provide any\n\npersonal data transferred from Singapore a comparable standard of protection to that\nunder the PDPA at the time of the Incident. In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nClause 5.2.2 provided that “Where Belden Data and/or Client Data originating\nin a Non-EEA territory (including in the United Kingdom, if at any time the United\nKingdom is not in the EEA or beyond any transition period) (the Originating\nTerritory”) are Processed in a territory which is different from the Originating\nTerritory (the “Importing Territory”), then the Data Importer will Process such\nBelden Data and/or Client Data to a standard consistent with the Applicable\nPrivacy Law(s) of the Originating Territory…”\n\n(b)\n\nClause 19.5.5 of Schedule 5 required the data importer (i.e. Belden Inc.) to\nensure that any transfer of personal data to a country or territory outside\nSingapore is provided a standard of protection that is comparable to the\nprotection under the PDPA.\n\n15.\n\nIn addition to the above, the GDTA also contained provisions that require the\n\ntransferee (the “Data Importer”) to implement measures aimed at addressing identified\nsecurity risks to the personal data transferred and assisting the transferor (the “Data\nExporter”) to comply with the relevant data protection laws. In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nClause 4.1(c)(ii) required the Data Importer to “comply with any requirements\narising under any Applicable Privacy Law(s) to protect the Belden and/or Client\nData it received including, but not limited to the following:\n10\n\n\f(A)\n\nassistance, taking into account the nature of the Processing, by\nappropriate technical and organisation measures, insofar as this is\npossible, to fulfil any obligations the Data Exporter may have to respond\nto requests from data subjects to exercise their rights under Applicable\nPrivacy Law(s) assistance;\n\n(B)\n\nassisting the Data Exporter as necessary to comply with its obligations\nunder Applicable Privacy Law(s) including (without limitation) to conduct\na data protection impact assessment and/or to consult with a\nSupervisory Authority, in each case taking into account the nature of the\nProcessing and the information available to the Data Importer; and\n\n(C)\n\nnot knowingly performing its obligations under this Agreement in such a\nway as to cause the Data Exporter to breach any of its obligations under\nApplicable Privacy Law(s);\n\n(D)\n\nensuring the reliability of any persons it authorises to access the Belden\nand/or Client Data (including employees, agents and sub-Processors)\nand ensure that they have undergone appropriate training in the care,\nprotection and handling of Belden and/or Client Data;\n\n(E)\n\nit will ensure that any persons authorised to process the Belden and/or\nClient Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under\nan appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\n\n(F)\n\nit will maintain appropriate and sufficient technical and organisational\nsecurity measures to protect such Belden and/or Client Data against a\n\n11\n\n\fSecurity Breach. Such measures will include as a minimum the Belden\nSecurity Measures; and\n(G)\n\nit will permit the Data Exporter such access to its premises, computer\nand other information systems, records, document and agreements as\nthe Data Exporter may reasonably require to satisfy itself that the Data\nImporter is complying with its obligations under the Agreement; and\n\n(H)\n\nit will, at the choice of the Data Exporter, delete or return all Belden\nand/or Client Data to the Data Exporter after the end of the provision or\nservices relating to processing, unless EU law or any EU Member State\nlaw requires storage of the Client Data.”\n\n(b)\n\nClause 6 also required the Data Importer to carry out certain measures in the\nevent of a security breach to investigate the breach, mitigate its effects and\nassist the Data Exporter to fulfill any obligations under the Applicable Privacy\nLaw(s).\n\n16.\n\nIn this connection, the Belden Group has put in place the following policies and\n\nmeasures concerning the treatment of personal data:\n\n(a)\n\nData Handling Standard – Governs the handling of electronic and physical\ndata throughout the Belden Group;\n\n(b)\n\nPersonal Data Handling Standard – Governs the handling of all forms of\npersonal data throughout the Belden Group;\n\n12\n\n\f(c)\n\nData Classification Policy – Sets the standards for protection of information\nassets from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, unauthorised access,\nmodification, compromise, disclosure or other misuse; and\n\n(d)\n\nRecord Creation, Retention, Retrieval and Disposal Policy – Establishes\nrequirements for creating, retaining, retrieving and disposing of records within\nthe Belden Group.\n\n17.\n\nDespite the suite of policies and technical measures adopted by the Belden\n\nGroup, the GDTA and the above policies did not enable Belden Singapore to meet the\nrequirements in Regulation 9(1)(b), read with Regulations 10(1)(b) and 10(2) when the\nIncident occurred:\n\n(a)\n\nThe GDTA was not legally binding on Belden Singapore at the material time as\nBelden Singapore had not acceded to the GDTA. For Belden Singapore to be\nbound by the GDTA, it must have executed a Deed of Accension under Clause\n12.1. However, at the time of the Incident, Belden Singapore had not executed\nsuch a Deed of Ascension.\n\n(b)\n\nSince the Belden Group opted to structure its data governance architecture\naround an intra-group contract (i.e. the GDTA), it is trite that the principle of\nprivity of contracts applies, and only the parties to a contract are able to enforce\nthe rights and obligations arising therein. Although the GDTA did, at the time of\nthe Incident, require Belden Inc. to comply with the applicable standards under\nthe PDPA while importing / processing personal data from Singapore (Clause\n13\n\n\f19.5.5 of Schedule 5), such obligations were not legally enforceable by Belden\nSingapore. Absent such a mechanism, Belden Singapore had no legal means\nto ascertain and ensure that the data transferred outside Singapore was\nafforded the same level of protection as under the PDPA.\n\n(c)\n\nBelden Singapore has acknowledged that this was a lapse. It subsequently\nrectified this oversight by signing a Deed of Accession on 18 June 2021.\n\n(d)\n\nNevertheless, the investigations revealed that, in practice, all the relevant\nBelden group policies, practices and technical measures mentioned in\nparagraphs 14 to 16 were implemented in full to ensure that personal data\ntransferred from Singapore are afforded a level of protection comparable to that\nprovided under the PDPA. Therefore, Belden Singapore’s breach constituted a\nlapse in legal formalities rather than a failure to comply with the substance of\nthe Transfer Limitation Obligation.\n\nWhether GVSPL complied with the Transfer Limitation Obligation\n\n18.\n\nGVSPL was determined to have complied with the Transfer Limitation\n\nObligation for the reasons explained below.\n\n19.\n\nAt the material time, GVSPL (as a subsidiary of GV USA) and Belden Inc. was\n\nbound by a Data Sharing Agreement dated 18 June 2020 (“DSA”), which governed\nthe terms on which GVSPL transferred personal data to Belden Inc. The DSA is in\ncompliance with Regulation 9(1)(b), read with Regulations 10(1)(b) and 10(2) of the\n14\n\n\fPDPR. Clause 10.1 of the DSA provided that, in the case of international transfers of\ndata (including personal data):\n“The Receiving Party shall not process any Data (not permit any Data to be\nprocessed) in a territory outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”) unless\nit has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in\ncompliance with Applicable Data Protection Law3. Such measures may include\n(without limitation); (a) transferring the Data to a recipient in a country that the\nEuropean Commission has decided provides adequate protection for personal\ndata; (b) to a recipient that has achieved binding corporate rules authorisation\nin accordance with Applicable Data Protection Law; (c) to a recipient in the\nUnited States that maintains a valid and up-to-date EU-US Privacy Shield\ncertification or (d) to a recipient that has executed standard contractual clauses\nadopted or approved by the European Commission or by virtue of entering into\nthis Agreement.”\n\n20.\n\nWhilst Clause 10.1 of the DSA does not mention the PDPA specifically, it does\n\nrequire a Grass Valley entity (including GVSPL) to take measures as are necessary\nto ensure the transfer is in compliance with the Applicable Data Protection Law, which\n– in the context of GVSPL – is the PDPA.\n\nDefined to mean “all worldwide data protection and privacy laws and regulations applicable to the personal\ndata in question, including, where applicable, EU Data Protection Law.”\n3\n\n15\n\n\f21.\n\nAdditionally, the DSA also contains several provisions aimed at addressing\n\nidentifiable security risks posed to the transferred personal data as well as ensuring\nthat the Receiving Party assists the Disclosing Party. In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nClause 6.1(c) required the Receiving Party to assist the Disclosing Party as\nnecessary to comply with its obligations under the Applicable Data Protection\nLaw (defined to mean all worldwide data protection and privacy laws and\nregulations application to the personal data in question) including (but not\nlimited to) conducting any data protection impact assessments, consultation\nwith a supervisory authority and fulfilment of any obligations the Disclosing\nParty may have to respond to requests from data subjects to exercise their\nrights under the Applicable Data Protection Law;\n\n(b)\n\nClause 6.1(d) required the Receiving Party to ensure that any persons\nauthorised to process the personal data to have committed themselves to\nconfidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nClause 7.1 provided that the Receiving Party “shall maintain appropriate and\nsufficient technical and organisational security measures to protect the Data\nagainst a Security Incident, taking into account state of the art, the costs of\nimplementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as\nwell as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms\nof the data subject(s)”. Clause 7.2 further stipulates certain actions that the\n16\n\n\fReceiving Party is required to take in the event of a confirmed Security Incident\nto mitigate the effects of the incident and assist the Disclosing Party to fulfill any\nobligations under the Applicable Data Protection Law.\n\n22.\n\nFinally, the group policies and measures concerning the treatment of personal\n\ndata enumerated in paragraph 16 also applied to the transfers from GVSPL within the\nBelden Group.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n23.\n\nIn light of Belden Singapore’s breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation, the\n\nCommission is empowered under section 48I of the PDPA to issue Belden Singapore\nsuch directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include\ndirecting Belden Singapore to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding\n$1 million as the Commission thinks fit.\n\n24.\n\nIn considering whether a direction should be given to Belden Singapore in this\n\ncase, it is noted that:\n\n(a)\n\nIt was an oversight that Belden Singapore did not sign a Deed of Accession\nprior to the Incident, and this lapse has been rectified by the signing of the Deed\nof Ascension.\n\n(b)\n\nBelden Singapore’s breach of the Transfer Limitation obligation was technical,\nand a failure of legal formalities that was not substantive in nature. As stated in\nparagraph 17(d), at the operational level, the suite of Belden group policies,\n17\n\n\fpractices and technical measures implemented were sufficient to ensure that\npersonal data transferred from Singapore to Belden Inc. were afforded a level\nof protection comparable to that provided under the PDPA.\n\n25.\n\nHaving considered all of the above circumstances, Belden Singapore is\n\nadministered a warning in respect of its breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation.\nNo other directions are necessary in view of the remedial actions already taken,\nnamely, Belden Singapore’s accession to the GDTA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n18\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Giordano was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an unauthorised network entry and ransomware infection that affected two of its systems storing personal data.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Wholesale and Retail Trade","Ransomware","Phishing"],"date":"2021-11-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision--Giordano-Originals-S-Pte-Ltd--151021.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No Breach of the Protection Obligation by Giordano","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/11/no-breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-giordano","timestamp":"2021-11-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2011-B7387\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nGiordano Originals (s) Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 3 December 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified by Giordano Originals (S) Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) of an unauthorized network entry and ransomware infection at\nthe OS and server level that occurred on or about 12 July 2020 (the “Incident”).\n2. As a result of the Incident, two of the Organisation’s systems, one which stores\nthe personal data of its employees and second, the personal data of its\nmembers were affected.\n3. The Organisation’s own and independent investigation conducted found no\nsign of suspicious activity in the Singapore network, and no impact beyond the\nSingapore network. The unauthorised entry had most likely occurred through\nthe use of compromised credentials obtained through phishing.\n\n4. Personal data of 790,000 members and 184 employees in encrypted form were\naffected. The personal data of members comprised names (20% of the\nmembers), contact number and partial date of birth (without birth year). The\npersonal data of employees comprised name, NRIC, address, gender, age,\ncontact number, email address, educational and salary information.\n\n\f5. Investigations revealed that the Organisation had in place reasonable security\nmeasures that are consistent with the recommendations that the Personal Data\nProtection Commission had made in our recent Handbook on “How to Guard\nAgainst Common Types of Data Breaches” on how to prevent malware or\nphishing attacks. The Organisation had installed and deployed various endpoint\nsecurity solutions, which was complemented with real-time system monitoring\nfor any Internet traffic abnormalities. Even before the Incident, the Organisation\nalso conducted regular periodic system maintenance, reviews and updates\n(such as vulnerability scanning and patching).\n\n6. More importantly, the Organisation had also ensured that its data was regularly\nand automatically backed-up, which was a key recommendation that the\nCommission made in our Handbook.\n\n7. In addition, the Organisation had also taken steps to better protect the personal\ndata affected by encrypting the personal data using current industry-standard\nRSA algorithm and passphrase. As a result, the personal data affected by the\nransomware was not legible without decryption.\n\n8. The Commission endorses the proper use of industry-standard encryption to\nprotect personal data, and will give due weight to Organisations which have\nimplemented the recommendations we made in our Handbook in determining\nwhether an organisation has complied with its Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”), or as a\nstrong mitigation factor in the event of the Commission finds that there has been\na breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n9. Following the Incident, the Organisation took prompt and extensive remedial\nboth to mitigate the effects of the Incident and enhance the robustness of its\nsecurity measures. This included increased frequency of staff phishing\nsimulation trainings and security reviews as well as additional monitoring\nmeasures. There was no evidence of exfiltration of the personal data or\ndecryption of the personal data. The Organisation was also able to fully restore\nthe personal data from its backups.\n\n\f10. In light of the reasons discussed above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal\nData Protection is satisfied that the Organisation had met its Protection\nObligation under section 24 of the PDPA. In light of our findings, we will not be\nissuing any directions or taking any further enforcement action against the\nOrganisation in relation to the Incident.\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $74,000 was imposed on Commeasure for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access and exfiltration of customers’ personal data hosted in a cloud database.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Accommodation and F&B"],"date":"2021-11-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Commeasure-Pte-Ltd---15092021.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Commeasure","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/11/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-commeasure","timestamp":"2021-11-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 11\n\nCase No. DP-2009-B7057\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal\nData Protection Act 201\n\nAnd\n\nCommeasure Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fCommeasure Pte Ltd.\n[2021] SGPDPC 11\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2009-B7057\n15 September 2021\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 25 September 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”)\n\nreceived a data breach notification from Commeasure Pte Ltd (“the Organisation”) that its\ndatabase containing 5,892,843 customer records had been accessed and exfiltrated (“the\nIncident”). The Organisation first found out about the data breach on 19 September 2020 when\na cybersecurity company based in Atlanta, United States of America, approached the\nOrganisation with an offer to contain the breach and retrieve the data from the hackers. The\nCommission commenced investigations into the Incident thereafter.\nFacts of the Case\nBackground\n2\n\nThe Organisation was incorporated in Singapore in 2014, and operates a hotel booking\n\nplatform www.reddoorz.com which serves customers in the Southeast Asian region, such as\nIndonesia, Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. The Singapore office is primarily\nengaged in sales, finance and administrative activities, while all IT functions (including the\nmanagement of the affected application package in this case) were managed by the\nOrganisation’s subsidiary company, Commeasure Solutions India Pvt Ltd (“CPL India”).\nCause of the Incident\n3\n\nInvestigations revealed that the unknown threat actor(s) had most likely gained access\n\nand exfiltrated the Organisation’s database of customer records hosted in an Amazon RDS\ncloud database, after they obtained an Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) access key. The AWS\n2\n\n\faccess key was embedded within an Android application package (“the affected APK”)\npublicly available for download from the Google Play Store.\n4\n\nThis affected APK was created sometime in 2015, when the Organisation was still a\n\nstart-up, and was last updated in January 2018. Even though the AWS access key had access\nto a “live” or production database, the AWS access key was embedded in the APK, and\nerroneously marked as a “test” key by the then-developers. With the exception of one of the\nOrganisation’s co-founders and Chief Technology Officer, all the developers have since left\nthe Organisation. Most unfortunately, even though the Organisation regarded this APK as\n“defunct”, the APK remained publicly available for download on the Google Play Store until\nthe Organisation became aware of the Incident and removed the affected APK.\n5\n\nThe fact that the Organisation had treated the affected APK as a “defunct” APK meant\n\nthat even though the Organisation had engaged a cybersecurity company to conduct a security\nreview and penetration testing sometime from September 2019 to December 2019, it was not\nwithin the scope of the security review or penetration tests. Consequently, the vulnerability was\nleft undetected and exposed until the Organisation found out about the Incident. Likewise, even\nthough the Organisation used “Proguard” on its current Android apps to prevent reverse\nengineering of APKs, which may have prevented the unknown threat actors from retrieving the\nAWS access key, the Organisation failed to review and deploy “Proguard” on the affected APK\nwhich it regarded as “defunct”.\n6\n\nAs a result of the Incident, the Organisation’s database containing 5,892,843 customer\n\nrecords which included the customer’s name, contact number, email address, date of birth, a\nhashed password (encrypted with one-way BCrypt hash algorithm) used by the customer to\naccess their “RedDoorz” account and their booking information was accessed and exfiltrated\nby unknown threat actor(s). Based on the Organisation’s investigations, the unknown threat\nactor(s) did not gain access or download the customers’ masked credit card numbers.\nRemedial actions\n7\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\na.\n\nCPL India immediately removed the affected APK from the Google Play Store;\n\n3\n\n\fb.\n\nThe old access keys were invalidated and new access keys were created. The\n\ninfrastructure and code repository access credentials were changed;\nc.\n\nIP blocking of suspicious traffic was enabled; and\n\nd.\n\nInformed all the affected customers via email on 26 September 2020 of the data\n\nbreach, advising them to change their RedDoorz account password as an added\nprecautionary measure, and to avoid using the same password on other digital\nplatforms.\n8\n\nTo prevent a recurrence of the Incident or similar incidents, the Organisation also took\n\nthe following remedial actions:\na.\n\nThe Organisation amended its credential policy to clearly prohibit developers\n\nfrom embedding access codes in any code base;\nb.\n\nThe Organisation upgraded their IT infrastructure to a private space for isolation\n\nof the customer database from the Internet. Only whitelisted IP addresses were allowed\nconnection to ‘live’ databases;\nc.\n\nThe Organisation separated the accounts for production and staging\n\nenvironments for all AWS services. Two-factor authentication was enabled for all tools\nand accounts used by developers. VPN-based control was implemented to access\ninfrastructure resources;\nd.\n\nThe Organisation configured alerts to capture mySQL dump query. Web\n\napplication firewalls were set up. An audit of all user access to the AWS environment\nwas conducted; and\ne.\n\nThe Organisation appointed a cybersecurity company to conduct vulnerability\n\nassessment and penetration testing of all its existing applications.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation contravened the Protection Obligation\n\n4\n\n\f9\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation\n\nto protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). For the reasons set out\nbelow, the Organisation failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in its control.\n10\n\nThe Organisation collected the personal data of customers when they created a\n\n“RedDoorz” account through its hotel booking platform www.reddoorz.com. Even though the\nOrganisation’s customer database was hosted using Amazon RDS on cloud, on servers\nphysically located in North Virginia, United States of America, the database remained under\nthe Organisation’s control throughout as the Organisation could access, use and remove the\ndata.\n11\n\nIn Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd,1 we found that even though the organisation was not in\n\ndirect possession of the personal data that was held in the data intermediary’s servers, it was\nstill obliged to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data as it\nhad control over such data. Likewise, even though AWS was responsible for the security of the\ncloud infrastructure that it provided to the Organisation, the Organisation bore ultimate\nresponsibility under section 24 of the PDPA for making reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect all the customers’ data under its control.\n12\n\nThe data breach occurred because the Organisation embedded the AWS access key,\n\nwhich allowed access to the “live” or production database, in the APK. The root cause was\ntherefore in the application, which was clearly within the Organisation’s responsibility. This\npresented a clear security risk. The AWS access key comprises of two parts, first, the access\nkey ID, and second, the secret access key, and was effectively the Organisation’s username and\npassword. In a webpage titled “Best practices for managing AWS access keys”, AWS advised\nusers to protect the access keys as “anyone who has the access keys for your AWS account root\nuser has unrestricted access to all resources in your AWS account” 2. AWS also cautioned\nusers not to “embed access keys directly into code”, which was exactly what the Organisation\n\n1 [2017] PDP Digest 160.\n2 https://docs.aws.amazon.com (last accessed on 6 August 2021).\n\n5\n\n\fhad done in the present case. We therefore find the Organisation in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA for reflecting the AWS access key in the affected APK.\n13\n\nIn the course of investigations, the Organisation explained that its failure to implement\n\nsufficiently robust processes to manage its inventory of infrastructure access keys was\nattributable to the high turnover of its employees from the time of its inception to the discovery\nof the Incident. This explanation is unacceptable, however sympathetic one might be to the\nhuman resource issues that the Organisation had to manage. The Organisation’s responsibility\nto protect personal data in its control or possession commences ought not to have been\nsubjected to staff movement or appointment.\n14\n\nIn Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd,3 we highlighted the importance of conducting\n\na “regular review to ensure that the website collecting personal data and the electronic database\nstoring the personal data has reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks” as the “personal\ndata of individuals may be exposed if the website or database in which it is stored contains\nvulnerabilities”.4 The Commission reiterates that it is necessary for an organisation to\n“[c]onduct regular ICT security audits, scans and tests to detect vulnerabilities”.5\n15\n\nIn this case, the Organisation conducted internal security testing and application\n\narchitecture reviews every quarter and had engaged a cybersecurity company to conduct a\nsecurity review and penetration testing sometime from September 2019 to December 2019.\nThe Organisation admitted however, that it “overlooked” including the affected APK in the\nsecurity review as it was “old”. In addition, the Organisation admitted that the AWS access key\nhad been mistakenly marked as a “test key”. This resulted in its omission from the security\nreview as well as from the Organisation’s periodic review of accounts and login credentials.\n16\n\nIt is important to highlight that the Organisation remained responsible for the affected\n\nAPK. The Organisation’s failure to include the affected APK and the AWS access key within\nthe scope of the security review arose because of the Organisation’s negligence to include them\n\n3 [2019] PDP Digest 317.\n4 Personal Data Protection Commission, Guide to Data Protection Impact Assessments (1 November 2017) at\n\npara. 8.3.\n5 Personal Data Protection Commission, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised 20\nJanuary 2017) at para. 6.1.\n\n6\n\n\fin its inventory of IT assets in production after the Organisation had wrongly labelled the\naffected APK as “defunct” and the AWS access key as a “test” key.\n17\n\nAccordingly, we are not satisfied that the IT security reviews that the Organisation\n\nconducted were sufficiently rigorous, and met the standard required under section 24 of the\nPDPA. We are therefore of the view that the Organisation has breached section 24 of the PDPA\nfor failing to include the affected APK and AWS access key in the Organisation’s security\nreviews. If a security review had examined the affected APK or the AWS access key, the\nvulnerability exposed by the embedded AWS access key would have been discovered, and the\nIncident could have been prevented.\nThe Commission’s Directions\n18\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation pursuant to\n\nsection 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty, we took into\naccount the factors listed at section 48(6) of the PDPA. The Commission notes that the data\nbreach affected 5,892,843 individuals whose personal data was exfiltrated. This is the largest\ndata breach that has occurred since the PDPA came into effect. Further, prior to the exfiltration\nof the data in September 2020, the affected APK with the embedded AWS access key had\nremained publicly available for download on the Google Play Store for a significant duration\nof time. A lengthy period of 2 years and 9 months passed from the time the Organisation made\nits last update to the affected APK in January 2018 to 19 September 2020, when the\nOrganisation finally found out about the data breach.\n19\n\nHaving said that, the Commission also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative in the course of investigations and had\n\nprovided prompt responses to PDPC’s requests for information;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation implemented remedial actions to address the Incident; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation had conducted periodic security reviews which promised to\n\noffer some data protection, albeit their efforts were ultimately futile as these security\nreviews did not include the affected APK.\n\n7\n\n\f20\n\nIn deciding the amount of financial penalty to be imposed, we also considered that the\n\nOrganisation, which operates in the hospitality industry, had been severely impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Having considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $74,000 within\n30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court6 in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid\nin full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6 Cap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on ChampionTutor for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its possession.

(Private Limited)’s (the “Organisation”)\ndatabase, containing personal data of individuals, was being sold on dark web (the\n“Incident”).\n\n2. The Organisation was not aware of the Incident until it was notified by the Commission.\nThe cause of the Incident was suspected to be SQL injection of the Organisation’s website.\nThe Organisation knew about this SQL injection vulnerability when it conducted a\npenetration test in December 2020. The Organisation had instructed its developer, based in\nIndia, to fix the vulnerability. However, the developer did not act on the request and this\nvulnerability was left unfixed until the Incident happened.\n\n\f3. As a result, the personal data of 4,625 students were affected. The personal data included\nname, email address, contact number and address.\n\n4. The Organisation took the following remedial measures after the Incident:\n\na. Engaged a new team of developers to fix all the SQL injection vulnerabilities;\n\nb. Parameterised SQL statements by disallowing data-directed context changes to prevent\nSQL injection attacks from resurfacing; and\n\nc. Is in the process of revamping the entire website source codes to reduce possible\nvulnerabilities.\n\n5. The Organisation admitted to having breached the Protection Obligation under section 24\nof the Personal Data Protection Act (the “PDPA”), and requested for the matter to be dealt\nwith in accordance with the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure.\n\n6. The Organisation admitted it was aware of the SQL injection vulnerability in December\n2020. Yet, the Organisation failed to take active steps to fix the vulnerability even when its\ndeveloper was not responsive, purportedly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the\nOrganisation left the vulnerability unresolved until the Incident happened.\n\n7. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n\f8. On 14 July 2021, the Organisation was notified of the Commission’s intention to impose a\nfinancial penalty based on the Commission’s consideration of the factors listed under\nsection 48J(6) of the PDPA, and the circumstances of this case, in particular (i) the\nOrganisation’s upfront voluntary admission of liability which significantly reduced the\ntime and resources required for investigations; and (ii) the prompt remedial actions\nundertaken by the Organisation. The Organisation was invited to make representations.\n\n9. Having considered the Organisation’s representations dated 28 July 2021, the Deputy\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $10,000 in 12\ninstalments by the due dates as set out in the accompanying notice, failing which the full\noutstanding amount shall become due and payable immediately and interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on\nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n10. In view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, the Commission will not issue\nany directions under section 48I of the PDPA.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to The National Kidney Foundation for failing to put in place reasonable security to protect the personal data in its possession.

Employee A is an executive in\nthe Organisation’s Clinical Operations department. which deals with implementation of\noperations policies, budget planning and working with medical and nursing management team\nto uphold healthcare standards.\nThe Incident\n3\n\nInvestigations revealed that, on 14 May 2020, Employee A received a phishing email\n\ncontaining a hyperlink to a website with a further link to another website seeking his account\ncredentials. The hacker is believed to have obtained Employee A’s account credentials in this\nway. Thereafter, the hacker accessed Employee A’s email account (the “Email Account”) and\nsynchronised the mailbox on 17 May 2020. In doing so, the hacker is believed to have\ndownloaded all the data stored in the Email Account in its entirety. The hacker also used\nEmployee A’s email account to send phishing emails to 1,039 external business contacts of the\nOrganisation, and 9 email accounts belonging to persons within the Organisation. Whilst these\n\n1\n\n\fphishing emails contained a link to a phishing webpage, they did not disclose any personal data\ncollected from the Email Account.\n4\n\nThe Email Account comprised of 23,145 emails containing the personal data of\n\napproximately 500 individuals (i.e. patients, employees and third parties):\n(a)\n\nAge\n\n(b)\n\nArrear sum owed (22 patients affected)\n\n(c)\n\nBank account number\n\n(d)\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\n(e)\n\nDate of birth\n\n(f)\n\nData subject access request form (for 1 Singapore Police Force officer)\n\n(g)\n\nInformation on the patient's family status and any psycho-social issues faced by the\npatient\n\n(h)\n\nDialysis readings\n\n(i)\n\nEmail address\n\n(j)\n\nEmergency contact numbers of nurses\n\n(k)\n\nEducation certificate(s)\n\n(l)\n\nForeign Identification Number\n\n(m)\n\nHeadshot photo\n\n(n)\n\nHealth screening virology report of the Organisation’s nurses (25 nurses affected)\n\n(o)\n\nHousehold income band\n\n(p)\n\nMarriage certificate; and\n\n(q)\n\nMedical condition (8 patients affected)\n(collectively, the “Affected Data”)\n\nSecurity Measures prior to the Incident\n2\n\n\f5\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the work email accounts of the Organisation’s employees\n\nwere hosted on Microsoft Office 365, and the employees were able to access their email\naccounts through the internet via a browser, ie web-accessible email or webmail. The following\nsecurity arrangements were in place to protect the email accounts from unauthorised access:\n(a)\n\nThe password policy requires a minimum of 8 alphanumeric characters, including\nupper and lower cases, and a special symbol.\n\n(b)\n\nA maximum of 3 unsuccessful login attempts before email accounts were locked out.\n\n(c)\n\nDeployed Microsoft’s Advanced Threat Protection (“ATP”) email filtering service,\nwith the ATP anti-phishing feature turned on.\n\n(d)\n\nDeployed Sender Policy Framework (“SPF”) and Domain Keys Identified Mail\n(“DKIM”) email authentication protocols.\n\n6\n\nIn addition, the Organisation also had various storage protection and network protection\n\nmeasures. This included a web isolation tool from Menlo Security, and an appointed Managed\nSecurity Service Provider (“MSSP”) that performs security monitoring round the clock.\n7\n\nIn relation to its employees, the Organisation implemented a range of measures to\n\nincrease data protection awareness, including:\n(a)\n\nIssuing a policy manual which defined the standards for proper usage of all computing\nand network resources by employees, and how employees should handle suspicious\nemails;\n\n(b)\n\nConducted training workshops in 2017 and 2018 in relation to the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) for its internal stakeholders, which included a segment\non cybersecurity covering the topic of suspicious emails;\n\n(c)\n\nConducting a phishing simulation exercise in 2019, which Employee A participated\nin;\n\n(d)\n\nE-learning modules on cyber-security and the PDPA, which Employee A completed\nin March 2020;\n\n3\n\n\f(e)\n\nSending regular emails and alerts targeted at increasing cybersecurity awareness to its\nemployees; and\n\n(f)\n\nDeploying cybersecurity awareness screensavers on all of the Organisation’s\ncomputers.\n\nRemedial Measures\n8\n\nAfter the Incident, the Organisation carried out the following remedial and rectification\n\nmeasures:\n(a)\n\nImplemented additional email account security requirements for webmail access in the\nform of two-factor authentication (“2FA”) on 22 May 2020;\n\n(b)\n\nAppointed a third-party service provider to conduct daily scans for communication\nrelating to the Incident on platforms across all media; and\n\n(c)\n\nNotified affected individuals of the Incident on 24 July 2020 and offered the affected\nindividuals subscription to an identity theft service to identify trading or selling of their\npersonal data on the dark web.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n9\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation centred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable\nsecurity steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks (“Protection Obligation”).\n10\n\nFor the reasons set out below, it is determined that the Organisation failed to implement\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Affected Data from the risk of unauthorised\naccess by failing to implement reasonable access controls to its employees’ webmail accounts.\n11\n\nIn determining what constitutes reasonable security steps or arrangements, an\n\norganisation should have regard to the nature of the personal data in its possession and control,\n4\n\n\fas well as the impact that the disclosure of the data might have on the affected persons. As\nstated in the Commission’s Advisory on Key Concepts in the PDPA1:\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for organisations to comply with the Protection\nObligation. Each organisation should consider adopting security arrangements that are\nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, for example, taking into consideration\nthe nature of the personal data, the form in which the personal data has been collected\n(e.g. physical or electronic) and the possible impact to the individual concerned if an\nunauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the personal data. For example,\nin the employment context, it would be reasonable to expect a greater level of security\nfor highly confidential employee appraisals as compared to more general information\nabout the projects an employee has worked on.\nIn practice, an organisation should:\na)\n\ndesign and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n\nb)\n\nidentify reliable and well-trained personnel responsible for ensuring information\nsecurity;\n\nc)\n\nimplement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of sensitivity; and\n\nd)\n\nbe prepared and able to respond to information security breaches promptly and\neffectively.\n\nIn addition, it might be useful for organisations to undertake a risk assessment exercise\nto ascertain whether their information security arrangements are adequate. In so doing,\nthe following factors may be considered:\na)\n\n1\n\nthe size of the organisation and the amount and type of personal data it holds;\n\nSee sections 17.2 – 17.3 of Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 February 2021)\n\n5\n\n\fb)\n\nwho within the organisation has access to the personal data; and\n\nc)\n\nwhether the personal data is or will be held or used by a third party on behalf of\nthe organisation.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n12\n\nWhere the personal data held by the organisation or particular employees are sensitive\n\nand may cause damage to affected individuals if compromised, strong access control measures,\nincluding robust authentication measures, are important safeguards. On top of basic\nauthentication measures such as implementing a proper password policy and password\nexpiration mechanism, strengthened measures such as two-factor authentication (“2FA”)\nshould be considered for webmail accounts with sensitive personal data, such as personal data\nrelating to health and finances. As stated at paragraphs [7.3] and [7.4] of the Commission’s\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium2:\n“7. 3. The strength of authentication, such as password requirements or other\nmechanisms for access to personal data, should depend on the potential damage\nto the individual, such as potential damage to reputation or finances, if such\npersonal data is compromised…\n7.4\n\nMore secure authentication methods include two-factor or multi-factor\n\nauthentication. These involve the use of a combination of information that the user\nknows, such as a password or PIN, and an object that only the user possesses, such\nas a digital key, token or smart card, or a unique physical trait, such as the use of\nfingerprints in biometric technology. The use of multi-factor authentication\nincreases confidence in the identity of the user accessing the system.”\n[emphasis added]\n13\n\nHaving regard to the nature of personal data handled by the Organisation in its daily\n\noperations, it had higher-level security needs that had to be met when discharging its Protection\nObligation. The Organisation is one of Singapore’s most prominent non-profit health\norganisations and a key provider of subsidised dialysis treatment, with a significant number of\n2\n\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised Jan 2017)\n\n6\n\n\fpatients under its care. Given the nature of its operations, the Organisation’s employees\nroutinely handle the medical data of its patients and financial data relating to the processing of\npatient subsidies. The vulnerability of its employees’ email accounts (including the Email\nAccount) is made more acute by the fact that they are web-accessible. In this regard, the\nOrganisation should have conducted a risk assessment to identify the employee email accounts\nthat warranted a more robust authentication process by virtue of the sensitivity of the personal\ndata expected to be received in or sent from their email accounts.\n14\n\nAs stated at 4 above, the Email Account contained the personal data of approximately\n\n500 individuals. A subset of the Affected Data included sensitive personal data such as the\nmedical conditions of patients, arrears owed and health screening virology reports of some of\nthe Organisation’s nurses. In this regard, even though the Organisation did put in place a host\nof technical measures and processes to address phishing risks prior to the Incident, we are of\nthe view that these security steps and arrangements did not satisfy the standard required under\nsection 24 of the PDPA, , for the reasons set out below, especially when the nature of the\npersonal data routinely handled by the Organisation is considered.\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation did not adopt a risk-based approach to identify employees whose\n\nroles and functions required them to handle sensitive personal data and strengthen the access\ncontrol measures to their email accounts.\n16\n\nSecond, in relation to the email accounts of the employees who handle sensitive\n\npersonal data (in particular, Employee A) in their daily work, the Organisation also did not\nimplement more secure authentication processes access control measures to their email\naccounts prior to the Incident. As stated in paragraph 5, the Organisation’s access control\nrequirements were confined to a password policy and the locking out of email accounts after 3\nunsuccessful login attempts. These measures are too basic and inadequate to safeguard webmail\naccounts from the threat of hackers seeking to access them from the internet, and left the\npersonal data contained therein vulnerable to unauthorised access and exfiltration. Examples\nof more secure authentication methods include 2FA, which the Organisation eventually\nimplemented only after the Incident had occurred. If 2FA had been implemented earlier, this\nwould have ensured that the use of stolen credentials such as passwords would not, per se, be\nsufficient to access the account.\n\n7\n\n\f17\n\nIn the premises, the Organisation has breached the Protection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n18\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation under\n\nsection 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the Commission considered the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA, and gave particular weight to the following mitigating factors:\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had cooperated fully with the Commission during its\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had put in place extensive measures to prevent phishing and\n\neducate its employees about data protection;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following the Incident,\n\nincluding notification of the affected individuals; and\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation had conducted various data protection and cybersecurity\n\ntraining for its employees.\n19\n\nHaving considered all the mitigating factors listed above, the Organisation is\n\nadministered a warning in respect of its breach of the Protection Obligation. No other directions\nare necessary in view of the remedial actions already taken by the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Directions were issued to J & R Bossini Fashion for breaches of the PDPA in relation to the transfer of Singapore-based individuals’ personal data to its parent company in Hong Kong and the protection of its employees’ personal data stored in its servers in Singapore.","tags":["Protection","Transfer Limitation","Directions","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"2021-10-14","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---J--R-Bossini-Fashion-Pte-Ltd---18082021.pdf","nature":"Protection, Transfer Limitation","title":"Breach of the Protection and Transfer Limitation Obligations by J & R Bossini Fashion","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/10/breach-of-the-protection-and-transfer-limitation-obligations-by-j-r-bossini-fashion","timestamp":"2021-10-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 9\n\nCase No. DP-2006-B6440\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nJ & R Bossini Fashion Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fJ & R Bossini Fashion Pte Ltd\n[2021] SGPDPC 9\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2006-B6440\n18 August 2021\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 13 June 2020, J & R Bossini Fashion Pte Ltd (“the Organisation”) notified the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”) of a ransomware attack which had\naffected the IT systems of the Organisation’s group of companies on or around 27 May 2020\n(“the Incident”). The Commission commenced investigations to determine whether the\ncircumstances relating to the Incident disclosed any breaches by the Organisation of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nFacts of the Case\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a company incorporated in Singapore, and a subsidiary of Bossini\n\nInternational Holdings Limited, a company listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong\n(“Bossini Holdings”). Bossini Holdings and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) are in the business\nof garment retail and brand franchising.\n\n3\n\nThe Group’s IT systems and infrastructure across different regions (including\n\nSingapore) are centrally managed by Bossini Holdings from Hong Kong. While most of the\nGroup’s production servers are located in Hong Kong, at the material time, the Organisation\nmaintained two servers and various workstations for its staff in Singapore which were\nconnected to the Group’s network in Hong Kong by way of a virtual private network (“VPN”).\n\n2\n\n\fPersonal data collected by the Organisation\n\n4\n\nSometime prior to 2017, the Organisation collected personal data from customers and\n\nprospective customers in Singapore for the purposes of administering a customer loyalty\nprogramme. The personal data collected comprised of each individual’s:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number,\n\n(c)\n\nPhone number,\n\n(d)\n\nEmail address,\n\n(e)\n\nResidential address,\n\n(f)\n\nDate of birth; and\n\n(g)\n\nGender.\n\n(collectively, “the Customer Data”)\n\n5\n\nThe Customer Data was initially stored locally by the Organisation in its servers in\n\nSingapore. The Organisation transferred the Customer Data out of Singapore to a server in\nHong Kong around July 2017, as part of a Group level consolidation exercise with a view to\nhosting the data in a cloud environment in the future.\n\n6\n\nOther than the Customer Data, the Organisation also collected and stored personal data\n\npertaining to its employees in its Singapore servers. This included each employee’s:\n\n3\n\n\f(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number,\n\n(c)\n\nPhone number,\n\n(d)\n\nEmail address,\n\n(e)\n\nResidential address,\n\n(f)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(g)\n\nGender;\n\n(h)\n\nMarital status;\n\n(i)\n\nSalary details;\n\n(j)\n\nBank account details, and\n\n(k)\n\nMedical claims records.\n\n(collectively, “the Employee Data”)\n\nThe Incident\n\n7\n\nSometime before 27 May 2020, attackers gained access to the Group’s network in Hong\n\nKong by exploiting a vulnerability in the Group’s off-the-shelf VPN software. The\nvulnerability allowed the attackers to extract valid VPN credentials and bypass the Group’s\nperimeter network security measures.\n\n4\n\n\f8\n\nThe vulnerability exploited by the attackers had been fixed by a patch released by the\n\nVPN software developer in September 2019. However, Bossini Holdings had not deployed the\npatch for the Group as at the time of the Incident on 27 March 2020 (i.e. nine months later).\nThe patch was subsequently deployed after the Incident on 3 June 2020.\n\n9\n\nAfter gaining a foothold into the Group’s network in Hong Kong, the attackers moved\n\nlaterally across the Group and compromised various administrative and user accounts to\nconduct reconnaissance and escalate privileges. Eventually, with Group-level administrative\nprivileges, the attackers disabled endpoint security systems across the Group and executed the\nransomware attack.\n\n10\n\nThe personal data of approximately 200,000 of the Group’s customers stored in the\n\nHong Kong server was encrypted and rendered inaccessible in the Incident. Relevantly, this\nincluded the Customer Data of 154,213 customers originally collected by the Organisation in\nSingapore. Of this, the Customer Data of at least 14,082 Singapore customers was exfiltrated\nand exposed on the dark web. The Employee Data of 120 of the Organisation’s employees\nstored in the servers in Singapore was similarly encrypted and rendered inaccessible in the\nIncident.\n\n11\n\nAll backups of the Customer Data and Employee Data maintained by Bossini Holdings\n\nand the Organisation were affected and encrypted in the Incident, and no data restoration was\npossible.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n12\n\nFollowing the Incident, the remedial actions of Bossini Holdings and the Organisation\n\nincluded:\n\n5\n\n\f(a)\n\nAppointing a leading cybersecurity vendor to contain the impact of the Incident\n\nand investigate its causes;\n(b)\n\nPublishing a data breach announcement on the Group’s website and via the\n\nStock Exchange of Hong Kong;\n(c)\n\nNotifying affected customers via the email addresses provided when registering\n\nfor the customer loyalty programme;\n(d)\n\nBlocking the IP addresses used by the attackers in the Incident and restricting\n\noutbound network traffic to limit the ability of any malware in the Group’s network to\n“call back” to the attackers;\n(e)\n\nUpgrading the VPN software to patch the vulnerability;\n\n(f)\n\nEnforcing multi-factor authentication for all remote access via VPN;\n\n(g)\n\nEnforcing a password change for all user account passwords and resetting all\n\ndomain user credentials;\n(h)\n\nPerforming a review to limit and restrict public-facing services on network\n\nperimeters;\n(i)\n\nPerforming vulnerability scanning for critical servers to identify and rectify\n\nimmediate risks;\n(j)\n\nReviewing and enhancing endpoint protection tools;\n\n(k)\n\nImplementing monitoring of perimeter firewalls and planning upgrades to the\n\nserver firewalls; and\n\n6\n\n\f(l)\n\nEngaging a third-party security operations centre to monitor the Bossini group’s\n\nnetwork infrastructure.\n\n13\n\nFor completeness, the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong (“PCPD”)\n\nwas notified of the Incident by Bossini Holdings on 24 June 2020 and conducted its own\ncompliance check. The Commission was informed that the PCPD would not be proceeding\nwith any further investigations after considering the circumstances of the case and the remedial\nmeasures taken by Bossini Holdings.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n14\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation focused\n\non:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 26 of the\n\nPDPA to transfer personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore in accordance\nwith requirements prescribed under the PDPA (the “Transfer Limitation Obligation”)\nin respect of the Customer Data transferred to Hong Kong on 17 July 2017; and\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 24 of the\n\nPDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”) in respect of the Employee Data encrypted in the Organisation’s servers\nin Singapore during the Incident.\n\n15\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Organisation was determined to have breached both\n\nthe Transfer Limitation and Protection Obligations.\n7\n\n\f16\n\nAs a preface to the discussion below, it is relevant to highlight that both of the\n\nOrganisation’s breaches were attributable to its failure to implement policies and practices to\nmeet its obligations under the PDPA, as required by section 12 of the PDPA (“the\nAccountability Obligation”).\n\n17\n\nFor corporate groups which engage in (i) centralisation of corporate functions involving\n\nintra-group dataflows and/or (ii) “outsourcing” of data processing activities to another member\nof the same group, policies and practices ought to be developed and implemented at the group\nlevel for the benefit of all members of the group. As stated in Everlast Projects Pte Ltd and\nothers [2020] SGPDPC 20 (“Everlast”) at [13]:\n\n“(O)rganisations operating as a group of companies may comply with the\nAccountability Obligation through binding group-level written policies or intra-group\nagreements that set out a common and binding standard for the protection of personal\ndata across all organisations in the same corporate group. These binding group-level\nwritten policies or intra-group agreements are akin to binding corporate rules\n(“BCRs”) imposed by an organisation on its overseas recipient of the personal data\n(in compliance with the Transfer Limitation Obligation under Section 26(1) of the\nPDPA), which oblige the overseas recipient to provide a standard of protection to the\ntransferred personal data that is at least comparable to that under the PDPA. When\nthe corporate group is a multinational corporation (“MNC”) and the Contracting\nOrganisation (i.e. a member of a corporate group) transfers personal data to an\noverseas Servicing Organisation (i.e. an overseas member of the same corporate\ngroup), the binding group-level written policies, intra-group agreements or BCRs\nwhich meet the requirements of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n8\n\n\fwould also meet the requirements of section 26(1) of the PDPA (i.e. the Transfer\nLimitation Obligation)”\n\nWhether the Organisation breached the Transfer Limitation Obligation\n\n18\n\nAs the Customer Data was transferred from Singapore to Hong Kong on 17 July 2017,\n\nthe requirements in Part III of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014 (“PDPR”) 1\ngoverned the Organisation’s compliance with the Transfer Limitation Obligation.\n\n19\n\nRegulation 9(1)(b) of the PDPR requires an organisation that transfers personal data\n\noutside of Singapore to take appropriate steps to ensure that the recipient of the personal data\nis bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide the transferred personal data a standard\nof protection at least comparable to that under the PDPA. Under regulation 10 of the PDPR,\nsuch legally enforceable obligations can be imposed on the recipient organisation under (a) any\nlaw (e.g. the law of the recipient country); (b) any contract between the parties2; (c) binding\ncorporate rules3; or (d) any other legally binding instrument.\n\n20\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation transferred the Customer Data to Bossini Holdings\n\nupon instruction and took no steps to ascertain whether the Customer Data would be accorded\na comparable level of protection. In this regard, the transfer of the Customer Data was not made\npursuant to any intra-group contracts, binding corporate rules, or other legally binding\ninstrument. Accordingly, the Organisation failed to comply with regulation 9(1)(b) of the\nPDPR and was determined to have breached the Transfer Limitation Obligation.\n\n1\n\nFor transfers which took place on or after 1 February 2021, the relevant requirements are those prescribed in\nPart 3 of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021.\n2\nFor example, see Cigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V. [2019] SGPDPC 18.\n3\nFor example, see Singapore Technologies Engineering Limited [2020] SGPDPC 21.\n\n9\n\n\fWhether the Organisation breached the Protection Obligation\n\n21\n\nAt the time of the Incident, Bossini Holdings had implemented group-level security\n\narrangements for all of the Group’s IT systems, including the Organisation’s servers in\nSingapore. Notwithstanding, the Employee Data remained in the Organisation’s possession in\nthe servers in Singapore, and the Organisation bore the Protection Obligation in respect of the\nsame.\n\n22\n\nIt is appreciated that a corporate subsidiary in the circumstances of the Organisation,\n\nwhich is subject to group-level security arrangements managed centrally, may not have the\nautonomy or power to respond independently to a multinational data breach incident.\nNevertheless, the standard of conduct expected of such organisations in order to comply with\nthe Protection Obligation is not onerous. The following principles have been established in past\ndecisions.\n(a)\n\nFirst, a subsidiary should not adopt group level data protection policies without\n\nconsidering whether these need to be adapted to their circumstances and contexts: Tiger\nAirways Singapore Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGPDPC 6 at [33]; and\n(b)\n\nSecond, when there is centralisation of corporate functions, group level policies\n\nshould be put in place in order that roles and responsibilities are clear: Everlast.\n\n23\n\nThese twin principles provide the guard rails to guide organisations for establishing\n\naccountability within a group and how this should cascade. In gist, where there is centralisation\nof corporate functions, group level policies establish the scope of centralisation and the\nrespective roles and responsibilities of members within the group. This is not dissimilar to a\nsituation in which a data controller outsources certain data protection responsibilities to an\nexternal vendor. It is the data controller’s obligation to specify and document what\n10\n\n\fresponsibilities the vendor has undertaken, failing which they remain those of the data\ncontroller. Once the group level policies are established, the relevant content then needs to be\ncascaded and adapted in the internal policies implemented by each member of the group at an\norganisational level.\n\n24\n\nAs a subsidiary in a multinational corporate group, it is accepted that the Organisation\n\nhad to implement the Group’s IT policies, including IT security practices. The reality is that its\nability to influence these IT policies and how these practices were implemented was likely to\nalso have been limited. Nevertheless in the present case, the Group had no group level policies,\nintra-group agreements, or binding corporate rules spelling out the data protection\nresponsibilities of the respective members of the Group. This created uncertainty as to whether\nBossini Holdings or the Organisation was responsible for software patching and security testing\nof the Organisation’s IT systems in Singapore.\n\n25\n\nIt was also accepted that the security lapse and privilege escalation that enabled the\n\nattackers to overcome the Organisation’s endpoint protections in the Incident occurred abroad\nout of the control of the Organisation. If the Group had intended for Bossini Holdings to be\ncentrally responsible for developing, implementing, and maintaining security arrangements for\nall of the Group’s IT systems (including those of the Organisation), this should have at least\nbeen documented in a binding group-level written policy. There was no evidence of the same,\nand accordingly, the Organisation continued to bear responsibility in relation to the Employee\nData in its possession.\n\n26\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation.\n\n11\n\n\fThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n\n27\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Deputy Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the Organisation to:\n(a)\n\nwithin 30 days from the date of the direction accompanying this decision, put\n\nin place intra-group agreements, contracts, or binding corporate rules for compliance\nwith sections 24 and 26 of the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\ninform the Commission of the completion of the above within 7 days of\n\nimplementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n12\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $37,500 was imposed on Stylez for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data of its customers and cease retaining data when the purpose of collection no longer exists.

Ltd.\n[2021] SGPDPC 8\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2001-B5645\n4 August 2021\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 25 December 2019, a local newspaper reported that data from a quotation and\n\nservice comparison portal, iCompare.sg (“the Portal”), had been uploaded onto the Dark Web\n(the “Incident”)1 . The Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”)\ncommenced investigations into the Incident thereafter.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Portal was created and operated by Stylez Pte Ltd (“Organisation”) at the material\n\ntime. In July 2016, the Organisation created a new database containing data from the Portal for\nthe purposes of testing a new function for the Portal in a separate test environment (the\n“Testing Database”). The Testing Database was a text file comprising records of the Portal’s\nrenovation and interior design clients from 2009 to 2016 and was hosted on a cloud server\nleased from a cloud storage service provider (“the Server”).\n3\n\nInvestigations revealed that the data exposed in the Incident was accessed and\n\nexfiltrated from the Testing Database some time before December 2019. A total of 9,983\nindividuals’ personal data, comprising their name, email address, and phone number were\nexposed in the Incident.\n4\n\nThe Portal’s production and backup databases were hosted on servers leased from a\n\ndifferent cloud service provider and were unaffected in the Incident.\n1 https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/local-renovation-database-exposed-on-dark-web\n\n2\n\n\fRemedial actions\n5\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\na.\n\nThe Testing Database and the account from which it was hosted were deleted;\n\nb.\n\nA malware scan was run on the Server, and all unnecessary files were removed;\n\nc.\n\nThe operating system of the Server was updated and the root password was\nchanged;\n\nd.\n\nA website security scanning tool was installed to conduct security scanning of the\nPortal; and\n\ne.\n\nThe individuals affected in the Incident were notified.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation contravened the Protection Obligation\n6\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation\n\nto protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). For the reasons set out\nbelow, the Organisation failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in the Testing Database.\n7\n\nFirstly, the Testing Database was stored in a publicly accessible directory in the Server\n\nwithout any access controls. This resulted in the Testing Database being directly accessible\nfrom the Internet and crawled and indexed by search engines. This was a serious breach\nconsidering the volume of personal data contained in the Testing Database.\n8\n\nIn the course of investigations, the Organisation characterised this as a failure to\n\nactivate an anti-indexing function in the Server’s software, which could have prevented the\n3\n\n\fTesting Database’s URL from being indexed by search engines. This is incorrect. Even if the\nanti-indexing function had been activated, this would only have prevented the Server’s\ndirectory contents from being listed. The actual contents of any publicly listed directory on the\nServer could still have been crawled and indexed by search engines. Crucially, anti-indexing\nis not the same as access control and even if the Testing Database’s URL was not indexed, it\ncould have been accessed directly without the need for authentication. This failure to appreciate\nthe difference between anti-indexing and access control is a fundamental failing on the\nOrganisation’s part. Proper authentication measures (e.g. password protection, access\nwhitelisting) should have been implemented to control access to the Testing Database.\n9\n\nSecondly, privileged access to the Server (and in turn the Testing Database) was also\n\nnot adequately secured. Though the password for the IT administrator’s account was strong (16\ncharacters with upper and lower alphabets, numeric and special symbols), there was no limit\nimposed on the number of unsuccessful login attempts which could be made. This made the\naccount vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The password to the IT administrator’s account was\nalso stored in his email account in clear-text without the need for any two-factor authentication.\nThis significantly weakened the protection accorded to the Server by strong login credentials.\n10\n\nThirdly, the Testing Data was stored in the Server in an unencrypted format for more\n\nthan two and a half years (i.e. from July 2016 to December 2019). While the Organisation\nclaimed that the Testing Data was subsequently used for other business purposes, in general,\nproduction data (i.e. actual personal data) should not be held in less secure development\nenvironments for extended periods of time. This is discussed further below in relation to the\nOrganisation’s breach of the Retention Limitation Obligation.\n11\n\nFor the above reasons, it was determined that the Organisation breached the Protection\n\nObligation in respect of the personal data in the Testing Database.\n\n4\n\n\fWhether the Organisation contravened the Accountability Obligation\n12\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop and implement policies\n\nand practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA\n(the “Accountability Obligation”).\n13\n\nWhile the Organisation had developed an external data protection policy which\n\ncommunicated its purported data protection standards to customers and prospective customers,\nit failed to develop and implement any corresponding internal data protection policies to give\neffect to these externally communicated standards.\n14\n\nBy way of illustration, the Organisation’s external data protection policy stated:\n“We have developed guidelines and implemented procedures to govern the destruction\nof personal data that are no longer required to fulfil the identified purposes.”\n\n15\n\nIn fact, no such guidelines or procedures were implemented, and this made what was\n\ncommunicated to the Organisation’s customers and prospective customers effectively an empty\npromise. While the Organisation claimed that it had relied on verbal reminders to inform its\nstaff on the importance of data protection, these reminders were undocumented, and in any\nevent, inadequate.\n16\n\nAn organisation will not be taken to have complied with the Accountability Obligation\n\nmerely because it publishes and communicates a data protection policy to external parties. Any\nexternally communicated data protection policy must be given the weight of the necessary\ninternal policies and documented practices to guide an Organisation’s employees on how to\ncomply with the PDPA in carrying out their work functions.\n17\n\nFor this reason, the Organisation was determined to have breached the Accountability\n\nObligation.\n\n5\n\n\fWhether the Organisation contravened the Retention Limitation Obligation\n18\n\nSection 25 of the PDPA requires an organisation to cease retaining data in a form that\n\ncan identify the individual if the purpose of collection no longer exists, and if no business or\nlegal reason exists for retention (the “Retention Limitation Obligation”).\n19\n\nIn this case, the explicit purpose of creating the Testing Database was to test a particular\n\nnew function for the Portal in a separate environment. That purpose no longer existed once the\ntesting had been completed, and it was for the Organisation to justify why it continued to retain\nthe Testing Database for any legal or business reasons.\n20\n\nThe Organisation claimed that it had continued to retain the Testing Database for the\n\npurposes of business analysis, namely, to analyse (i) users’ requirements to improve the\nOrganisation’s marketing strategy (i.e. specifications listed by users for their renovation or\ninterior design jobs such as property type, room type, budget etc); and (ii) details on when users\nmade enquiries via the Portal in order to optimise the timing of online advertising. The\nOrganisation claimed that it could not have used other sources of data (such as their production\nor regular backup databases) for these purposes as there was a risk of causing inadvertent\ncontamination of those databases if so used.\n21\n\nThis justification was not accepted. Simply put, the business analysis described by the\n\nOrganisation did not require retention of data that could identify individuals. Even if the\nOrganisation wanted to retain the data in the Testing Database for these new business purposes,\nthe data could have been aggregated or anonymised (i.e. with any personal identifiers removed)\nwhich would have taken the data outside the scope of regulated personal data, and allowed it\nto be used as unregulated anonymised data.\n22\n\nIt was also doubted that the Organisation would have relied on historical data from as\n\nearly as 2009 to conduct customer behaviour and preference studies when it would have been\nmore commercially useful to conduct such studies based on more recent data. In any event, no\n\n6\n\n\fweight was placed on this factor in determining that the Organisation had failed to comply with\nthe Retention Limitation Obligation in respect of the personal data in the Testing Database.\n23\n\nHad the Organisation carried out what it claimed that it would do in its external data\n\nprotection policy (see [14] above), it may well have ceased retention of or at least anonymised\nthe data in the Testing Database before the Incident.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n24\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation pursuant to\n\nsection 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty, the factors listed\nat section 48J(6) of the PDPA were taken into account, as well as the following aggravating\nand mitigating factors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe personal data of almost 10,000 individuals was publicly exposed in the\n\nIncident;\n(b)\n\nThe Testing Database contained records that were 10 years old at the time of\n\nthe Incident;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation misrepresented the standard of its internal data protection\n\npolicies and practices to external parties;\nMitigating Factors\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions after being notified of the\n\nIncident; and\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the investigations.\n\n7\n\n\f25\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case including representations made\n\nby the Organisation on 5 July 2021 after being notified of the Commissioner’s Preliminary\nDecision, the Commissioner hereby:\n(a)\n\nRequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $37,500 in 12 monthly\n\ninstalments by the due dates as set out in the notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full;\n(b)\n\nDirects the Organisation to develop and implement internal data protection\n\npolicies and practices to comply with the PDPA within 60 days of the relevant direction\naccompanying this decision, and to notify the Commission within 1 week of the\ncompletion of this direction.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Carousell was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to incidents where threat actor accessed Carousell users' accounts due to credential stuffing.","tags":["Not in Breach","Others","Password"],"date":"2021-09-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Carousell-Pte-Ltd---030821.pdf","nature":"","title":"No Breach of the Protection Obligation by Carousell","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/09/no-breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-carousell","timestamp":"2021-09-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2105-B8350\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCarousell Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 14 May 2021, Carousell Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) informed the Personal Data\nProtection Commission of an unauthorized access to their users’ accounts due to credential\nstuffing.\n\n2. The Organisation was first alerted on 26 April 2021 when a user reported to the\nOrganisation that his account had been hijacked and there were attempts to make\nunauthorised purchases. On 1 June 2021, the Organisation was alerted to another incident\ninvolving the same modus operandi where legitimate credentials were used to log in to\nusers’ accounts and unauthorised purchases were made (collectively, the “Incident”).\n\n3. The Organisation’s investigations indicated that the Incident was due to the threat actor(s)\nobtaining the login details and passwords of some of their users due to an exposure of the\naccount details on another service provider’s platform. The threat actor(s) succeeded in\n\n\fcertain cases where the user used the same login and password for their account with the\nOrganisation and their compromised accounts with other provider’s platforms. After\nsuccessfully logging into the account, the threat actor(s) was able to perform actions as an\nauthorised user. The threat actor(s) would also have access to the data in an individual’s\naccount and modify the account settings.\n\n4. The Organisation’s investigations found that there was no known compromise or\nunauthorised access of information in other accounts that were stored in the same database.\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had in place security arrangements including,\nbut not limited to, the following:\n\na. Users are informed when there is a change to the password, email or phone number\nlinked to their account, or when a new device is used to log in;\n\nb. Training of account takeover model to identify and investigate likely account takeovers;\n\nc. Card transactions that meet a certain fraud score are blocked or reviewed;\n\nd. One Time Password required to complete transactions for all card payments;\n\ne. Regular review of policies and regular testing and review of risk rules based on fraud\ntrends, seasonality, regulation and all related indicators;\n\n\ff. Company-wide training and educational newsletters to increase staff awareness on\nsecurity and data protection requirements; and\n\ng. Conduct annual penetration security assessment.\n\n5. I am of the view that the Organisation had adopted reasonable standards for protecting\npersonal data in their customer accounts on an objective review of the measures that were\nimplemented at the time of the Incident. Further, the Organisation took prompt action to\nmitigate the effects of the breach by suspending the compromised users accounts and force\npassword resets for affected users. Emails were sent to alert affected users of suspicious\nlogin in their accounts. DBS Paylah! Express Checkout was disabled for affected users\nwhose accounts were suspected to have been compromised.\n\n6. The Organisation also reviewed the Incident, and took remedial measures to enhance the\nrobustness of their security measures, including but not limited to the following:\n\na. Blocked suspicious IP addresses;\n\nb. Added rules into third party fraud detection tool to prevent account takeovers;\n\nc. Implemented a mandatory 2FA verification, via email, in the event there is a change\ndetected in the user’s device ID across all platforms; and\n\n\fd. Efforts to educate users and raise awareness to fight against phishing attempts were\nenhanced.\n\n7. Having found that at the time of the Incident, the Organisation had implemented reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data under its control, I conclude that the\nOrganisation did not breach its Protection Obligation under the Personal Data Protection\nAct.\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on Sendtech for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data.

(the “Organisation”) informed the Personal\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach incident. There was\nan unauthorized access to the Organisation’s Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) account\nvia an access key (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation became aware of the Incident on 10 February 2021 when its AWS\naccount was shut down due to unusual account activity. The cause of Incident was a\ncompromised AWS access key. This access key was created in 2015 when the\nOrganisation was developing the backend of its server in its incipient stages. This AWS\naccess key had not been rotated or changed since 2015. The Organisation suspected that\nthe AWS could have been compromised through its former or current employees. First,\nall former developers had access to this key and some could still have the source code on\n\n\ftheir computers. Second, as most of the employees are working from home, it is possible\nthat the AWS access key was compromised if the employees had accessed internet\nthrough a public WiFi connection.\n\n3.\n\nWith this compromised AWS access key, the attacker gained admin privileges, created\nanother admin account and queried the buckets storing personal data. As a result, the\npersonal data of 64,196 customers and 3,401 contractors and the contractors’ employees\nwere accessed. There was no evidence of data exfiltration. For the customers, the\npersonal data included the email address, contact number, home address and last four\ndigits of the debit or credit card. For the contractors and their employees, the personal\ndata included profile photo and copies of the NRIC or work permit (front and back).\n\n4.\n\nThe Organisation took the following remedial measures after the Incident:\n\na. Rotated all access keys;\nb. Changed passwords for all servers;\nc. Enhanced its audit trail on AWS buckets to log all read and write operation at the\nobject level;\nd. Checked and verified that its Github repositories was set to “Private”;\ne. Engaged cybersecurity consultants to carry out assessment of its security setup and\nadvise on improvements to the security measures; and\nf. Developed new cybersecurity policies and processes which specifically include\nmeasures for credentials management.\n\n\f5.\n\nIn its representations to the Commission, the Organisation admitted to having breached\nthe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the\n“PDPA”), and requested for the matter to be dealt with in accordance with the\nCommission’s Expedited Decision Procedure.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation admitted it did not have specific AWS policies for the assignment of\nroles to rotate credentials. There was also a lack of detailed steps to manage credentials\naccess of outgoing staff. Hence, the credentials were not rotated or changed whenever\nthere are staff movement.\n\n7.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n8.\n\nOn 23 June 2021, the Organisation was notified of the Commission’s intention to impose\na financial penalty of $10,000 based on the Commission’s consideration of the factors\nlisted under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, and the circumstances of this case, in particular\n(i) the Organisation’s upfront voluntary admission of liability which significantly\nreduced the time and resources required for investigations; and (ii) the prompt remedial\nactions undertaken by the Organisation.

Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2004-B6180\n30 July 2021\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 1 April 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint that SAP Asia Pte. Ltd. (“the Organisation”) had disclosed the payroll\ninformation of some of its former employees to the wrong email recipients (“the Incident”).\nThe Commission commenced investigations into the Incident thereafter.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nAt the material time prior to the Incident, the Organisation had engaged an external\n\nvendor (“the Vendor”) to provide IT solutions for its human resources and payroll system\n(“the HR System”). The Organisation’s process of issuing payslips to its employees had been\nautomated as part of the HR System. However, when payslips needed to be issued to\nindividuals who had already left the employment of the Organisation (e.g. final payslips,\nreimbursements of expenses etc), this could not be done via the HR System. Such payslips\nneeded to be separately generated by the Organisation’s human resources department and\nemailed to the former employees at their personal email addresses. The Organisation was keen\nto automate the process of issuing payslips to former employees as part of the HR System, and\nsometime around April 2019, requested the Vendor to develop a new programme within the\nHR System for this purpose (“the Programme”).\n3\n\nThe Organisation had intended to use the Programme to generate and email multiple\n\npayslips to multiple former employees simultaneously in one execution of the Programme\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\n(“Multiple Payslip Issuance”). However, as will be discussed below, this intention was not\nproperly communicated to the Vendor, and the Programme was designed on the incorrect\nunderstanding that only a single payslip would need to be issued to a single employee at a time\n(“Single Payslip Issuance”).\n4\n\nThe Organisation executed the Programme for the first (and only) time on 31 March\n\n2020 to generate and deliver payslips to 43 former employees at their personal email addresses.\nBelieving the Programme to be capable of Multiple Payslip Issuance, the Organisation’s\nrepresentative selected all 43 former employees to be issued payslips in one selection screen of\nthe Programme and executed the process. As the Programme had not been designed to be able\nto properly execute Multiple Payslip Issuance, this execution of the Programme resulted in 29\nout of the 43 former employees receiving their own payslip as well as the payslips of other\nemployees. By way of illustration:\n(a)\n\nThe 1st former employee in the selection received only their own payslip.\n\n(b)\n\nThe 2nd former employee in the selection received their own payslip as well as\n\nthe payslip of the 1st former employee.\n(c)\n\nThe 3rd former employee in the selection received their own payslip as well as\n\nthe payslips of the 1st and 2nd former employees.\n5\n\n13 of the 43 former employees had not provided the Organisation with valid email\n\naddresses and did not receive any emails with payslips. However, the payslips of these 13\nformer employees were still generated and disclosed to the 29 other former employees when\nthe Programme was executed on 31 March 2020.\n6\n\nIn all, the personal data of 43 former employees of the Organisation was improperly\n\ndisclosed in the Incident. The disclosed personal data comprised each of the former\nemployees’:\n1\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC or FIN number;\n\n(c)\n\nEmployment number;\n\n(d)\n\nBank account number;\n\n(e)\n\nMonthly basic salary;\n\n(f)\n\nDetailed breakdown of current payment; and\n\n(g)\n\nYear-To-Date earnings and deductions.\n\nRemedial actions\n7\n\nFollowing the Incident, as part of remedial actions, the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nEmailed all 43 former employees on 1 April 2020 informing them about the\n\nerror and requesting each of them to delete the payslips which were not intended to be\nemailed to them;\n(b)\n\nFollowed up with the former employees over phone to confirm deletion of the\n\nother payslips and received confirmation from 39 of the 43 former employees affected;\n(c)\n\nDisabled the Programme and reverted to manually generating and emailing\n\npayslips to former employees; and\n(d)\n\nAgreed on continuous process improvements with the Vendor with clear\n\ncommunicated requirements.\n\n2\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation contravened the Protection Obligation\n8\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation\n\nto protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n9\n\nIn this case, the Organisation, a data controller, engaged the Vendor to develop a new\n\nfeature for its IT systems which processed personal data in its possession (i.e. the Programme).\nThe development of the Programme had obvious implications for the way in which the former\nemployees’ personal data would be processed. However, in developing the Programme, the\nVendor did not process personal data on behalf of the Organisation and was not the\nOrganisation’s data intermediary in this regard. Accordingly, the Protection Obligation in\nrespect of the former employees’ personal data was borne solely by the Organisation.\n10\n\nIn the context of the Programme’s development, the Organisation’s responsibilities\n\nunder the Protection Obligation included ensuring that:\n(a)\n\nThe specifications provided to the Vendor accurately reflected the intended use\n\nof the IT feature being developed; and\n(b)\n\nPre-launch testing of the new feature was accurately scoped to simulate the full\n\nrange of intended use of the new feature.\n11\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Organisation failed both of these responsibilities.\n\n3\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nFailure to adequately specify requirements for the Programme\n12\n\nIt is a data controller’s responsibility to ensure that external vendors who are engaged\n\nto modify its IT systems know the scope of their work. As stated in (1) Smiling Orchid (S) Pte\nLtd; (2) T2 Web Pte Ltd; (3) Cybersite Services Pte Ltd; (4) East Wind Solutions Pte Ltd [2016]\nSGPDPC 19 at [51]:\n“ Data controllers that (engage) outsourced service providers have to be clear about\nthe nature and extent of services that the service provider is to provide. There must be\na clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service provider has agreed to\nundertake, and this should be properly documented.”\n13\n\nThis does not mean that all organisations will be expected to be able to give detailed\n\ntechnical instructions to their IT vendors. As clarified in MDIS Corporation Pte Ltd\n[2020] SGPDPC 11 at [14]:\n“While an organisation may not have — or need to have — the requisite level of\ntechnical expertise, a responsible organisation would have engaged competent service\nproviders and made genuine attempts to give proper instructions. The Organisation is\nonly expected to articulate its business requirements as owner of the system, which\nthe service provider can translate into technical requirements. In addition, as the data\ncontroller, the Organisation is required to exercise reasonable oversight to ensure that\nits instructions are carried out.”\n[emphasis added]\n14\n\nIn previous enforcement decisions, the Commissioner has held organisations in breach\n\nof the Protection Obligation for failing to properly communicate business requirements for\ndesign changes to IT features:\n4\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n(a)\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nIn Singapore Cricket Association and another [2018] SGPDPC 19, the\n\norganisation engaged a vendor to redesign its website, including certain pages featuring\nprofiles of its registered players. The organisation’s requirements were conveyed to the\nvendor piecemeal - in meetings, through phone calls, and over text messages. As a\nresult, the vendor misunderstood the intended contents for the player profile pages and\nincorrectly disclosed around 100 players’ personal data including NRIC numbers and\ncontact information as part of the redesigned website.\n(b)\n\nIn\n\nThe\n\nCentral\n\nDepository\n\n(Pte)\n\nLimited\n\n&\n\nanother\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24, the organisation engaged a vendor to develop software to generate\nand issue notification letters to its customers. However, the organisation failed to\nprovide the vendor with clear specifications and representative test data that covered\nthe full range of data to be processed and the various processing scenarios. As such, the\nvendor incorrectly assumed that a particular dataset would always have 4 lines of data\nto extract for each letter, when in fact, that dataset could have also had 1, 2, or 3 lines\nof data. This resulted in a design error that caused the inadvertent disclosure of 1,358\ncustomers’ personal data to the wrong recipients when the software was deployed.\n(c)\n\nIn Horizon Fast Ferry Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 27, a ferry operator engaged a\n\nvendor to redesign its booking website. There was no written contract between the\nparties, and all instructions and requirements for the redesign were conveyed verbally\nor over text messages. As a result, the vendor misunderstood the scope of the redesign\nand incorrectly imported an auto-population feature from one of the organisation’s\ninternal systems to the redesigned website. This caused the booking form on the\nredesigned website to automatically populate all fields in the form whenever a passport\nnumber that matched an entry in the organisation’s passenger database was entered. As\na result, the personal data of close to 300,000 of the organisation’s passengers was\nexposed to the risk of unauthorised access.\n\n5\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n15\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation failed to make clear to the Vendor that the\n\nProgramme was intended to be used for Multiple Payslip Issuance. This resulted in the Vendor\ndesigning the Programme under the wrong impression that all that was required by the\nOrganisation was Single Payslip Issuance.\n16\n\nThe misunderstanding between the Organisation and Vendor was attributable to the\n\nOrganisation’s instructions in relation to development of the Programme being brief and\nambiguous. The Organisation’s instructions to the Vendor were contained in a short service\nrequest which read as follows:\n“HI Team,\nCan you please enhance the program (…) where by when i key in\nthe employee id, (…) then\nA template of the email with the payslip is send to the selected employee?\nThanks!”\n[emphasis added]\n17\n\nThe request only referred to a payslip to be sent to a “selected employee” (i.e. in the\n\nsingular) and not multiple employees (i.e. plural).\n18\n\nThis reference to using the Programme for a single employee (as opposed to multiple\n\nemployees) was repeated by the Organisation when later responding to clarifications sought by\nthe Vendor as to why payslips needed to be sent to external email addresses:\n“HI (…),\nThe sending of email to private address is necessary as we are require to provide\npayslip to ex employee when ever there is a payment. This is for employee who have\nleft the organization.\nThanks!”\n6\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n19\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nApart from these communications, there was no other documentation of the Multiple\n\nPayslip Issuance requirement. If the Organisation intended to use the Programme to send\npayslips in a single instance to multiple former employees (i.e. Multiple Payslip Issuance) this\nshould have been clearly communicated as a required specification for the Programme. The\nOrganisation’s failure to properly communicate its business requirements to the Vendor\nresulted in the Programme being inadvertently designed in an insecure way.\nFailure to carry out adequate user acceptance testing\n20\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to specify Multiple Payslip Issuance as a required\n\nfunctionality of the Programme was compounded by its failure to include any Multiple Payslip\nIssuance scenarios in its user-acceptance testing (“UAT”) for the Programme (i.e. testing\ncarried out prior to deploying the Programme for use as part of the HR System).\n21\n\nPre-launch testing is an important means of identifying data protection risks before new\n\nIT features are deployed in a live environment, and this has also been emphasised in the\nCommission’s recently published handbook, How to Guard Against Common Types of Data\nBreaches1:\n“Most organisations fail to recognise that proper testing can help them to identify\ndefects in programming before a system is launched. Sufficient resources should be\nallocated for testing, and a comprehensive UAT should ensure good test coverage of\nscenarios including possible user journeys and exception handling. Organisations\nshould also ensure that the planned UAT scenarios match real-world usage. This can\nbe done through a comprehensive gathering of business requirements and identification\nof relevant usage scenarios by potential users. These should be driven by the business\nowner.”\n1\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/news-and-events/announcements/2021/05/handbook-on-how-to-guard-againstcommon-types-of-data-breaches-now-available\n\n7\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\n[emphasis added]\n22\n\nIn previous enforcement decisions, organisations have been held in breach of the\n\nProtection Obligation for failing to properly scope pre-launch testing to simulate real-world\nuse of new IT features:\n(a)\n\nIn Option Gift Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 10, the organisation developed a\n\nprogramme to send email confirmations to persons who had made gift redemption\nrequests. The programme was intended to send a single email confirmation to each\nrecipient. However, a coding error meant that while the first email was sent to the first\nrecipient (as intended), the second email was sent to both the first and second recipient\nand so on (i.e. a similar type of error as in the Incident as described at [4] above). The\norganisation’s UAT was found to be inadequate as the programme had only been tested\nby sending confirmation emails to the same internal email address. There was no testing\nthat simulated the intended use of the programme to send emails to multiple recipients.\n(b)\n\nIn AIA Singapore Private Limited [2019] SGPDPC 20, the organisation\n\nemployed an automated system to generate and send different types of letters to its\ncustomers. A fix had been deployed to correct an earlier programming error but ended\nup introducing a further error. When different types of letters were processed in one\nbatch, the further error caused letters to be sent to the wrong recipients. The\norganisation’s testing prior to deploying the fix had only simulated scenarios in which\none letter was generated at a time. However, this did not replicate the real-world use of\nthe system as letters were ordinarily generated and dispatched in batches.\n(c)\n\nIn Grabcar Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 14, an update deployed for the\n\norganisation’s mobile application inadvertently exposed the personal data of some users\nto the risk of unauthorised access by other users. The error arose because the effect of\nthe update on a particular caching mechanism had not been detected in testing. This\n8\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nwas partly because the organisation failed to test the update in scenarios where multiple\nusers were accessing the application concurrently (which was a foreseeable real-world\nscenario).\n23\n\nSimilar to the above precedents, in the present case, the Organisation’s representative\n\nonly conducted 2 test scenarios as part of UAT, and both only involved Single Payslip Issuance.\nThe failure to test Multiple Payslip Issuance as part of UAT meant that the testing was\ninadequate to simulate the Organisation’s intended use of the Programme, and the\nProgramme’s incapability of handling Multiple Payslip Issuance was not picked up at the\ntesting stage as it should have.\n24\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation in respect of the former employees’ personal data disclosed in the Incident.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n25\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation pursuant to\n\nsection 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty, the factors listed\nat section 48J(6) of the PDPA were taken into account, as well as the following mitigating\nfactors:\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions after being notified of the\n\nIncident; and\n(b)\n26\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the investigations.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby\n\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $13,500 within 30 days from the date of\n9\n\n\fSAP Asia Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 6\n\nthe relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in\nthe Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n27\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures already taken\n\nby the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $8,000 was imposed on Seriously Keto for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data stored in its server.

Ltd.\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1. On 16 June 2020, Seriously Keto Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware\ninfection that occurred on or about 15 June 2020 (the “Incident”). The affected\npersonal data comprised approximately 3,073 individuals’ names, addresses,\nemail addresses and telephone numbers (“the Affected Personal Data”).\n\n2. The Organisation requested that the Commission investigate the Incident under its\nExpedited Decision Procedure. In this regard, the Organisation voluntarily provided\nand unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision. It also admitted that\nit was in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n3. Investigations revealed the presence of an unprotected file in the Organisation’s\nnetwork infrastructure which contained unencrypted login credentials to access the\nserver containing the Affected Personal Data. The unprotected file could be located\nby infrastructure scanning, and this provided a channel for unauthorised access to\nthe server. Server logs retrieved by the Organisation after the Incident indicated\nthat there had been unauthorised access to the file.\n\n\f4. The Organisation admitted that it had failed to conduct any periodic security\nreviews prior to the Incident which could have revealed the existence of the\nunprotected file within its network infrastructure.\n\n5. The Organisation had engaged a vendor to develop its e-commerce and\nmembership website and claimed to have relied on the vendor to make the\nnecessary security arrangements to protect the Affected Personal Data. However,\nin this case, there were no clear business requirements (e.g. contractual\nstipulations) specifying that the Organisation was relying on the vendor to\nrecommend and/or implement security arrangements to protect personal data\nhosted in the e-commerce and membership website that the vendor was engaged\nto develop. Protection of personal data in the possession or under the control lies\nprimarily with the Organisation, although it may contract the operations to a vendor\nwho is more knowledgeable and with expertise. To do so, the Organisation has to\nbe clear about the scope of outsourcing and the vendor has to also agree to do so.\nIn the absence of clear outsourcing, the responsibility to implement reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Affected Personal Data remained squarely\nwith the Organisation.\n\n6. Overall, the Organisation admitted that it had failed to give due attention to\npersonal data protection prior to the Incident and had neglected to implement\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Affected Personal Data.\n\n7. In the above circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data\nProtection finds that the Organisation negligently contravened the Protection\nObligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n8. Following the Incident, the Organisation underwent a full security audit and\nremedied vulnerabilities identified. The Organisation also set up a new website with\na more robust internal security infrastructure, implemented a mandatory password\nchange for all users of its new website, and activated a firewall to safeguard access\nto the new website. It also engaged a cybersecurity vendor to develop further\n\n\fmeasures and policies to strengthen its internal IT infrastructure. Additionally, the\nOrganisation committed to engaging consultants to improve its data protection\npolicies and outsource data protection functions.\n\n9. The Organisation cooperated with the Commission’s investigation, admitted to its\nbreach of the Protection Obligation, and took prompt remedial action. There was\nno evidence of exfiltration of the Affected Personal Data, and the Organisation was\nable to restore the Affected Personal Data from a backup and did not lose any data\nas a result of the Incident. The practice of having regular and separately located\ndata backup(s) is to be encouraged to prevent organisations from losing data to\nransomware.\n\n10. Having considered the above circumstances and the factors listed at section 48J(6)\nof the PDPA, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection requires the\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of $8,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified\nin the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on\nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid\nin full.\n\n11.

This default setting allowed the Application’s network traffic to be\nintercepted and accessed using third-party security testing software that can be acquired\nonline. A member of the public had therefore been able to intercept and access the\npersonal data of the Application’s users by using a free version of such software (the\n\n\f“Incident”). However, the risk of unauthorised access had been limited to parties who\nknew how to use such security testing software to obtain access. This factored in the\nenforcement outcome below (see paragraph 6 below).\n\n3.\n\nThe undetected default privacy setting of “visible” put the personal data of 2,445\nindividuals at risk of unauthorised access. The data affected included names, addresses,\ndates of birth, telephone numbers, email addresses and gender.\n\n4.\n\nRemediation by the Organisation encompassed turning off all access and use of the\nApplication by all external parties, including users, and changing the privacy setting from\n“visible” to “hidden”. The Organisation also engaged a third-party IT security firm to\ntest and address any security and privacy issues relating to the Application, commenced\ndiscussions with its IT application designers and employees involved to adopt ‘privacyby-design’ in future applications development.\n\n5.\n\nThe Protection Obligation in section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 requires\nthat organisations understand the privacy policies and security features of all online tools\nor software they choose to employ. This was established in published cases such as Re\nGMM Technoworld Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGDPDPC 18. Organisations employing online\ntools or other online software must set or reconfigure privacy policies and security\nfeatures to protect the personal data of application or website users. It would not be a\ndischarge of the Protection Obligation for an organisation to simply adopt, vis-à-vis\n\n\fusers, the same default privacy policies of online tools or software that do not protect the\npersonal data of users.\n\n6.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection therefore found the Organisation\nin breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012. Upon consideration of the facts, including the limited exposure of the affected\ndata to those who knew how to use the above-mentioned third party software to access\nsuch information via the default privacy setting, and the Organisation’s commitment to\nimprove its processes, a Warning was issued to the Organisation.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Directions were issued to NUInternational Singapore and Newcastle Research and Innovation Institute for breach of the PDPA in relation to the transfer of Singapore-based individuals’ personal data to their ultimate parent company in the United Kingdom and related company in Malaysia.","tags":["Transfer Limitation","Directions","Education","Ransomware","Consent"],"date":"2021-09-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---NUI-and-NewRIIS--23062021.pdf","nature":"Transfer Limitation","title":"Breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation by NUInternational Singapore and Newcastle Research and Innovation Institute","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/09/breach-of-the-transfer-limitation-obligation-by-nuinternational-singapore-and-newcastle-research-and-innovation-institute","timestamp":"2021-09-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 5\nCase No. DP-2009-B7011\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\n(1) NUInternational Singapore Pte Ltd\n(2) Newcastle Research and Innovation Institute Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisations\n\nDECISION\n\n\f(1) NUInternational Singapore Pte Ltd; (2) Newcastle Research and\nInnovation Institute Pte Ltd\n[2021] SGPDPC 5\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2009-B7011\n23 June 2021\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 17 September 2020 and 13 November 2020, the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (the “Commission”) was notified of a ransomware attack relating to Newcastle\nResearch and Innovation Institute Pte Ltd and NUInternational Singapore Pte Ltd (collectively\nknown as the “Organisations”) in Singapore (the “Incident”).\n\nFacts of the case\n\n2\n\nThe ransomware infected, on or around 30 August 2020, (a) a database in the United\n\nKingdom, managed by the ultimate parent company of the Organisations (containing 1,083\nrecords of Singapore-based individuals); and (b) a database in Malaysia, hosted by a related\ncompany of the Organisations (containing 194 records of Singapore-based individuals). These\nrecords containing personal data of the Singapore-based individuals were previously\ntransferred from the Organisations to the ultimate parent company in the United Kingdom and\nthe related company in Malaysia respectively. The Singapore-based individuals were a mix of\nstaff members, undergraduates and/or post-graduate students of the Organisations. Their\n\n2\n\n\fpersonal data (comprising names and user account identifications) were exfiltrated by the threat\nactor.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n3\n\nSection 26(1) of the PDPA stipulates that an organisation shall not transfer any personal\n\ndata to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with the requirements\nprescribed under the PDPA to ensure that organisations provide a standard of protection to\npersonal data so transferred that is comparable to the protection under the PDPA (the\n“Transfer Limitation Obligation”). The requirements mentioned in section 26(1) were set\nout in Regulations 9 and 10 of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014 (which were\nin force at the time) (the “Transfer Regulations 2014”). The Transfer Regulations 2014 was\nrecently amended (“the Transfer Regulations 2021”). The ensuing analysis and application\nof the Transfer Regulations 2014 is equally relevant for the Transfer Regulations 2021, which\nis in pari materia but for some re-numbering of the regulations.\n\n4\n\nThe Transfer Regulations 2014 provides for a range of transfer mechanisms to ensure\n\ncompliance with Section 26(1) of the PDPA, e.g. through legally enforceable obligations under\nany law, contracts, binding corporate rules or any other legally binding instruments. Within a\ngroup of companies, reliance on intra-group agreements and binding corporate rules is common\nfor cross-border data transfers. They provide a flexible system for centralisation of corporate\nfunctions and services. The commercial decision would be driven by where these functions are\nbest located, and intra-group agreements and binding corporate rules allow the group to\nestablish a bespoke internal governance system to ensure that personal data is well managed\n\n3\n\n\facross the group. The Transfer Regulations 2014 (and 2021) support the adoption of intragroup agreements and binding corporate rules in the following manner.\n\n5\n\nPursuant to Regulation 9(1)(b), the Organisations could have met the Transfer\n\nLimitation Obligation by taking appropriate steps to ensure that the recipients of the transferred\npersonal data in United Kingdom and Malaysia were bound by legally enforceable obligations\n(in accordance with Regulation 10(1) of the Transfer Regulations 2014) to provide to the\ntransferred personal data a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the\nPDPA. Regulation 9(1)(b) is now Regulation 10(1) in the Transfer Regulations 2021.\nRegulation 10(1) of the Transfer Regulations 2014 specifies that such legally enforceable\nobligations includes any law, a contract that complies with the conditions in Regulation 10(2),\nor binding corporate rules that meets the conditions set out in Regulation 10(3). These same\nregulations are now in Regulation 11 in the Transfer Regulations 2021. These regulations\nsupport the use of intra-group agreements1 and binding corporate rules2.\n\n6\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Organisations did not put in place intra-group\n\nagreements, binding corporate rules or any other legally binding instrument to ensure that a\nstandard of protection comparable to the PDPA is provided to personal data transferred within\nthe group as required by Regulation 10(1).\n\n7\n\nIn its responses to the Commission, the Organisations put forward the argument that\n\nthey had met the Transfer Limitation Obligation under the PDPA by virtue of the fact that the\nlaws of the United Kingdom applied to the receiving organisations within their group. I do not\nexclude the possibility that the data protection system that governs the receiving organisation\n\n1\n2\n\nSee Re Everlast Projects & Others [2020] SGPDPC 20 at [13].\nSee Re Singapore Technologies Engineering Limited [2020] SGPDPC 21.\n\n4\n\n\fmay, on a proper analysis, provide comparable protection. However, based on the responses\nmade by the Organisations to the Commission, I am not satisfied that the transferring\norganisation conducted this analysis and concluded that there would be comparable protection\nbefore the transfer. After the fact justification will not be accepted.\n\n8\n\nOf the 1,083 Singapore-based individuals whose personal data had been transferred to\n\nthe ultimate parent company in the United Kingdom, the Organisations mentioned that 44 of\nthese individuals, who were employees, had consented to the transfer of their personal data out\nof Singapore in their employment contracts. Regulation 9(3)(a) of the Transfer Regulations\n2014 did provide for the Transfer Limitation Obligation to be met by obtaining the consent of\nindividuals for the transfer of their data. However, to meet the consent requirement under\nRegulation 9(3)(a) of the Transfer Regulations 2014, Regulation 9(4) requires the\nOrganisations to provide to the individuals a summary in writing of the extent to which their\npersonal data, when transferred to a foreign country or territory, would be protected to a\nstandard comparable to the PDPA. These requirements are now encapsulated in Regulations\n10(2)(a) and 10(3) of the Transfer Regulations 2021. The procedural safeguards established by\nRegulation 9(3) of the Transfer Regulations 2014 makes the use of consent somewhat more\ncumbersome, as there is a need for consent to be refreshed whenever reorganisation of the\ngroup’s internal function leads to a relocation of that function in a different jurisdiction. This\nalso does not enable the Organisations to benefit from the employment management exception\nto the requirement for consent. Be that as it may, this option is available for organisations that\nchoose to rely on it. However on the evidence, this summary in writing was not provided by\nthe Organisations to the 44 Singapore employees.\n\n5\n\n\fThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n\n9\n\nIn view of the foregoing, I therefore find that the Organisations have failed to discharge\n\ntheir Transfer Limitation Obligation under section 26 of the PDPA. The Organisations are\ndirected to do the following within 30 days from the date of this Decision:\n\n(a) put in place intra-group agreements or binding corporate rules for compliance with\nsection 26 of the PDPA in relation to any personal data transferred out of\nSingapore3;\n(b) if relying on consent, review and make necessary changes to its consent and\nnotification processes for compliance with section 26 of the PDPA and Regulation\n10(3) of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021 in relation to any personal\ndata transferred out of Singapore; and\n(c) inform the Commission of the completion of the above within 7 days of\nimplementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n3\n\nRefer to Regulation 11 of Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021, which is applicable at the present time.\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"Singapore Telecommunications Limited was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident which occurred on or about 13 July 2020 where a threat actor accessed the accounts belonging to 17 subscribers.","tags":["Not in Breach","Information and Communications","Phishing"],"date":"2021-08-12","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Singapore-Telecommunications-Limited---21062021.pdf","nature":"","title":"No Breach of the Protection Obligation by Singapore Telecommunications Limited","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/08/no-breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-singapore-telecommunications-limited","timestamp":"2021-08-12","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2007-B6607\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1.\n\nOn 15 July 2020, Singapore Telecommunications Limited (the “Organisation”)\ninformed the Personal Data Protection Commission of an incident which had\noccurred on or about 13 July 2020 (the “Incident”). In the Incident, a threat actor\naccessed the accounts of 17 of the Organisation’s telecommunications service\nsubscribers to request for issuance of new SIM cards, forwarding of voice calls\nand/or cessation of mobile services 1 .

On 29 November 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived a complaint against Larsen & Toubro Infotech Limited, Singapore Branch\n(“LTI”) from an LTI job applicant.\n\n2. On 25 November 2020, an LTI employee had emailed the complainant a set of sample\nforms which contained the personal data of a past job applicant. The LTI employee had\nsent the complainant those sample forms to assist him in filling up his own forms correctly.\n\n3. Subsequently, on 3 December 2020, another LTI employee sent an email reminder to the\ncomplainant and 53 other job applicants to complete their application process. The email\ncontained all of the job applicants’ respective names, with their email addresses placed in\nthe “To” field and thus visible to all recipients.\n\n\f4. Once notified of the complaint by the Commission, LTI undertook a review of its\nemployees’ emails for the period from 2016 to 2020, and uncovered 73 other instances\nwhere past job applicants’ personal data had been disclosed to other job applicants.\n\n5. In total, 13 past job applicants’ forms were disclosed by 10 of LTI’s employees to 74 other\njob applicants. The personal data disclosed in the forms comprised:\n\na. Name;\nb. Signature;\nc. Email address;\nd. National Identification/ passport numbers;\ne. Date of Birth;\nf. Address;\ng. Contact number;\nh. Medical health status;\ni. Employment history;\nj. Salary information; and\nk. Criminal records disclosure.\n\n6. The Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds that LTI negligently\ncontravened the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 by failing to provide adequate instructions to its employees dealing with recruitment\nmatters on how to handle personal data. LTI also negligently contravened the Consent\n\n\fObligation under section 13 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, by disclosing the\nnames and email addresses of all job applicants in its email sent to the 54 job applicants on\n3 December 2020, including the complainant.\n\n7. While LTI claimed to have a general Corporate Privacy Policy and an Employee Privacy\nNotice which applied to all employees, the purpose of these documents was to provide\nnotice to individuals and employees on how LTI used, processed, and protected personal\ndata. Guidance to employees on how they should handle personal data in the course of work\ncould only be found in LTI’s “Data Privacy Awareness” training materials. LTI had no\ntargeted policies or standard operating procedures specifically for the employees handling\nrecruitment matters, despite the type and volume of personal data handled by such\nemployees. The fact that as many as 10 of LTI’s employees had engaged in the same\nconduct over a 4 year period, reinforced the finding that the existing instructions were\ninadequate.\n\n8. LTI indicated that it would make all its employees aware of this incident, and that it would\nimplement a new set of procedures for email communications to external job applicants.\nLTI notified all affected job applicants of the wrongful disclosure of their personal data to\nother job applicants, and informed the job applicants to delete the emails they had received\ncontaining the affected job applicants’ forms. Refresher training was also conducted for the\nemployees who had sent the emails.\n\n\f9. After considering the circumstances of the case and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012, including LTI’s cooperation with investigations, its\nproactive review to identify additional historical breaches, and its prompt remedial actions,\nthe Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection requires that LTI pay a financial\npenalty of $7,000 for the breach.\n\n10. LTI must make payment of the financial penalty within 30 days from the date of this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial\npenalty until it is paid in full.\n\n11. No further directions are required as LTI had taken actions to address the gaps in its security\narrangements.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $25,000 was imposed on Webcada for breaches of the PDPA.

On 4 September 2020, Webcada Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) that three of its database servers had been\nsubjected to a ransomware attack on 29 August 2020 (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The personal data of 522,722 individuals were affected in the Incident. The datasets\naffected comprised of the individuals’ names, phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses and\norder histories.\n\n3. Following the Incident, the Organisation engaged an independent third-party consultant to\ninvestigate, review and assist in the implementation of additional data protection measures.\n\n4. Investigations revealed that the ransomware had been uploaded onto the affected servers\nvia the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (\"IPMI\"). The IPMI is a set of computer\n\n\finterface specifications used for remote monitoring and management of servers. There was\nno evidence of data exfiltration, and all affected data was restored from available back-ups.\n\n5. The Organisation took the following remedial measures after the Incident:\n(a) IPMI was permanently disabled for all servers;\n(b) The public IP address of all servers was removed and all remote management access to\nthe servers was configured to allow only trusted IP addresses;\n(c) End-point protection software with threat hunting capabilities was installed on all\nservers and computers within the Organisation; and\n(d) A written data protection policy was developed and implemented to comply with the\nprovisions of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the \"PDPA\").\n\n6. In its representations to the PDPC, the Organisation admitted to having breached the\nAccountability Obligation under section 12 and the Protection Obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA, and requested for the matter to be dealt with in accordance with the PDPC’s\nExpedited Decision Procedure.\n\nSection 12 of the PDPA\n7. First, the Organisation admitted it did not have a written data protection policy prior to the\nIncident. In this regard, it is important to reiterate that an organisation must document its\ndata protection policies and practices in writing as they serve to increase awareness and\n\n\fensure accountability of the organisation's obligations under the PDPA. This requirement\nhas been emphasized multiple times in previous decisions1.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA\n8. Second, the Organisation admitted that it did not configure its IPMI access settings\ncorrectly prior to the Incident. It enabled access to the IPMI from the public Internet when\nthis was not necessary. Furthermore, in the monthly vulnerability scans carried out by the\nOrganisation, it had omitted to scan the IPMI. Hence, it was not able to detect\nvulnerabilities in its IPMI, which were exploited to gain access to and upload the\nransomware on the servers.\n\n9. In the circumstances, the Organisation is found to have breached sections 12 and 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n10. After considering the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA and the circumstances\nof this case, including (i) the Organisation's upfront voluntary admission of liability which\nsignificantly reduced the time and resources required for investigations; and (ii) the\nOrganisation's prompt remedial actions, the Organisation is given notice to pay a financial\npenalty of $25,000.\n\n1\n\nSee Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDC 14 at [32]; Re Singapore Taekwondo Federation [2018] SGPDC 17 at [39] to\n[42]; Re AgcDesign Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDC 23 at [4] to [5]; Re (1)Everlast Projects Pte Ltd (2)Everlast\nIndustries (S) Pte Ltd (3) ELG Specialist Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDC 20 at [8] to [9]\n\n\f11.

Ltd. (the “Organisation”) was affected by a ransomware attack.\nThe ransomware encrypted and denied access to various files on the Server, including\nfiles containing personal data of the Organisation’s staff and trainees (the “Incident”).\n2\n\nOn 7 December 2019, the Organisation informed the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (“Commission”) of the Incident. The Commission subsequently received\ntwo separate complaints about the Incident.\nBackground\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a dedicated private provider of healthcare training to\n\nindividuals (“Participants”) in Singapore. In the course of carrying out its business\nactivities, the Organisation collects personal data from, among others, (i) its\nemployees, including temporary and contract staff such as associate trainers,\n(“Employees”) for the purposes of managing or terminating such employment\nrelationships, and (ii) the Participants, for the purposes of registration and the\nadministration of their enrolment in the Organisation’s training courses.\n4\n\nThe Server affected by ransomware was set up in 2014 and was located in\n\nSingapore. It was owned by the Organisation but maintained by the Organisation’s\nappointed IT solution service provider (the “Vendor”). The Server stored personal data\nin Microsoft Word or Excel files, most but not all of which were password-protected.\n5\n\nThe Server was protected by a firewall that blocked all connections to the\n\nServer, except for those through port 3389, a standard port which was used for the\nRemote Desktop Protocol (“RDP Port”). The RDP Port was used by the Vendor for\n\n1\n\n\fremote management and/or troubleshooting purposes. According to the Organisation,\nthe RDP Port was kept open from sometime in 2014 up to the date of the Incident on\n4 December 2019 (i.e. for more than four (4) years) to allow the Vendor quick and\neasy access. The significance of the RDP Port being kept open will be elaborated on\nbelow.\n6\n\nThe Server only had one administrator account which was shared by the\n\nOrganisation’s IT administrator and at least three other employees of the Vendor. By\nuse of this administrator account, the Vendor could access the Server remotely\nthrough the RDP Port and view, change, or delete all the data in the Server.\n7\n\nOn 4 December 2019, an employee of the Organisation was unable to access\n\nfiles on the Server containing the personal data of some Participants. An initial\ndiagnostic conducted by the Vendor revealed that the Server had been affected by\nransomware. File extensions of the files on the Server had been changed and a\nransom note was found on the Server.\n8\n\nOn 5 December 2019, the Organisation engaged a cybersecurity expert\n\ncompany (“CSE”) to conduct a thorough assessment of the Incident. The CSE found\nthat:\n(a)\n\nthe attacker had likely discovered the open RDP Port following a\n\nrandom, opportunistic search for vulnerabilities; and;\n(b)\n\nhaving discovered the open RDP Port, it was likely that the attacker\n\nused brute force attacks to obtain the administrator account password for the\nServer in order to gain access to the Server and execute the ransomware.\n9\n\nIn total, the personal data of approximately 110,080 Participants, and 253\n\nEmployees were affected by the Incident (the “Affected Personal Data”).\n10\n\nFor the affected Participants, the following categories of personal data were\n\naffected:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n2\n\n\f11\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nAddress;\n\n(d)\n\nRace;\n\n(e)\n\nGender;\n\n(f)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(g)\n\nAge;\n\n(h)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(i)\n\nContact number;\n\n(j)\n\nCourse details;\n\n(k)\n\nNationality; and\n\n(l)\n\nEmployer details and past employment history.\n\nFor the affected Employees, the following categories of personal data were\n\naffected:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(d)\n\nNationality;\n\n(e)\n\nCitizenship;\n\n(f)\n\nAge;\n\n(g)\n\nContact number;\n\n(h)\n\nVehicle licence plate; and\n\n3\n\n\f(i)\n\nFinancial Information (including salary/payment information, Central\n\nProvident Fund (“CPF”) information, and bank account numbers.\n12\n\nNot all of the above categories of personal data were affected in every\n\nindividual’s case. For instance, the bulk of the affected Participants (approximately\n98,000) only had their names and NRIC numbers stored on the Server.\n13\n\nThe CSE’s investigation found no evidence of any exfiltration of the Affected\n\nPersonal Data from the Server. The Organisation also managed to retrieve all the\nAffected Personal Data as most of the affected files were back-up files.\n14\n\nUpon being made aware of the Incident, the Organisation took prompt remedial\n\nactions. The Organisation:\n(a)\n\nDecommissioned the Server (without paying the ransom), and isolated\n\nthe Server from its network and the Internet;\n(b)\n\nNotified the Commission, SingCERT, and all the affected Employees\n\nand Participants that it was able to (approximately 95%) of the Incident; and\n(c)\n15\n\nIssued a media advisory on the Incident.\n\nThe Organisation also carried out actions to prevent a recurrence of the\n\nIncident. It:\n(a)\n\nAdopted its own internal password management policy;\n\n(b)\n\nPermanently disconnected and blocked remote access for IT support\n\nprocedures;\n(c)\n\nImplemented Internet separation measures for all devices containing\n\npersonal data;\n(d)\n\nIntroduced various endpoint enhancements and gateway security\n\nmeasures including a monitoring system for all Internet-facing traffic, a suite of\nantivirus and malware protection for all computers and enhancing email hosting\nsecurity protection and hard disk encryption;\n\n4\n\n\f(e)\n\nEngaged external IT security consultants to establish an Information\n\nSecurity Management Framework based on the ISO 27001 certification;\n(f)\n\nConducted cybersecurity training sessions and cybersecurity awareness\n\nworkshops for its staff;\n(g)\n\nConducted ad-hoc email phishing tests to augment the cybersecurity\n\ntraining sessions and to engender greater awareness and vigilance towards\nsuspicious emails; and\n(h)\n\nPut in place a monthly IT bulletin post to all employees to keep all staff\n\nup to date on IT and cybersecurity issues.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n16\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements\nto prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (“Protection Obligation”).\n17\n\nAs a preliminary point, even though the Organisation had engaged the Vendor\n\nto maintain the Server and the Organisation’s other IT infrastructure, the scope of the\nVendor’s engagement did not involve the processing or handling of any personal data\non behalf of the Organisation. The Organisation owned the Server and was in\npossession and control of the Affected Personal Data at all material times. The Vendor\nwas therefore not a data intermediary and the responsibility to protect the Affected\nPersonal Data fell squarely on the Organisation.\n18\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Organisation failed to implement reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Affected Personal Data from the risk of authorised\naccess, modification and disposal.\n\n5\n\n\fFailure to adequately regulate remote access to the Server\n19\n\nFirst, the Organisation did not have sufficiently robust processes to ensure safe\n\nremote access to the Server via the RDP Port. The Remote Desktop Protocol (i.e.,\nRDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft Corporation for use in its\nRemote Desktop Connection application, which allows for remote connections to be\nestablished from one computer (i.e., a server) to another computer (i.e., the client)\nallowing the client to remotely control the server. By default, the server uses port\nnumber 3389 (i.e., the RDP Port) for incoming connections and requires authentication\nin the form of a username and password, before access to the server is granted. While\nthe RDP Port is intended to be used for legitimate RDP client-server connections, its\nexistence is well known and thus susceptible to be exploited by malicious actors to\ngain unauthorised access to a server if there are weak protective measures in place\n(e.g. weak user authentication).\n20\n\nWhile there is no strict requirement that the RDP Port must always be closed,\n\norganisations should regularly review and assess the potential risks of keeping such\npublic facing ports open. Where it is necessary to keep the RDP Port on a server open,\norganisations should ensure that there are sufficient measures in place to protect the\npersonal data stored on the server.\n21\n\nThat said, where an organisation holds a high volume of personal data and/or\n\nhighly sensitive personal data, the Commission is of the view that the default approach\nshould be to close all ports, including RDP Ports. Where it is necessary to open the\nRDP Port, organisations must ensure that there are sufficient measures in place to\nensure the security and legitimacy of any incoming RDP connection, and to promptly\nclose the RDP Port upon completion of the required use. Additional measures to\nsecure the files, for example, access control to folders and file encryption, may also\nbe deployed. These are different layers of defences that can be used cumulatively or\nin different combination, depending on the volume and sensitivity of personal data and\nthe requirements of business operations.\n22\n\nIn this case, the Organisation kept the RDP Port open from the time the Server\n\nwas set up in 2014 until the occurrence of the Incident on 4 December 2019. According\n\n6\n\n\fto the Organisation, the RDP Port was kept open to allow the Vendor quick remote\naccess to the Server for recovery and maintenance works. The Organisation claimed\nthat keeping the RDP Port permanently closed was not practicable, as half a day of\ndown time would be required whenever the RDP Port needed to be opened or closed.\n23\n\nGiven the fact that a minority of records (i.e. 253 Employees) contained more\n\nsensitive financial information and bank account numbers, as well as the volume of\npersonal data stored on the Server, it is questionable whether the RDP Port should\nhave been kept open permanently for recovery or maintenance work. Even if this\nmeant incurring some down time in activating and deactivating the firewall for the RDP\nPort, the inconvenience associated with this down time should have been measured\nagainst the risk to the type and volume of personal data that was stored on the Server.\nNonetheless, the benefit of doubt is given to the Organisation as the majority of records\nwere personal particulars and contact information.\n24\n\nEven if it was necessary for the RDP Port to be kept open, the Organisation\n\nshould at least have put in place other types of technical measures to secure the RDP\naccess, such as:\n(a)\n\nUsing a different port (other than the default port 3389) for RDP\n\nconnections;\n(b)\n\nRestricting access to specific IP addresses or IP addresses within\n\nspecified ranges, i.e. “whitelisting”;\n(c)\n\nusing a RDP gateway; and/or\n\n(d)\n\nConducting log reviews for unusual activity, whether upon automated\n\nalerts or scheduled monitoring.\n25\n\nThe risks arising from poor management of RDP Ports have also been\n\nhighlighted in the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s (“CSA”) recent advisory dated\n28 December 2020, titled “Protect Your Systems and Data From Ransomware\nAttacks” 1 . The CSA similarly cautioned that some ransomware variants take\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/advisories/ad-2020-006\n\n7\n\n\fadvantage of exposed services and open ports such as the RDP Port to spread across\na network. As such, in order to minimise the chance of a ransomware attack, the CSA\nemphasised that organisations should review their port settings, particularly, to assess\nwhether there was a need to leave the RDP Port exposed, and if so, to restrict RDP\nconnections to only trusted hosts.\n26\n\nThe Organisation represented to the Commission that it would have been\n\nimpractical to whitelist specific IP addresses as connections to the Server were\ngenerally made through dynamic, instead of static, IP addresses. Even so, the onus\nremained on the Organisation to put in place alternative security measures that were\ncommensurate with the standard of protection required to protect sensitive data stored\non the Server. However, the Organisation failed to implement any such alternative\nsecurity measures.\n27\n\nThe Organisation’s inaction on this front placed the Server at risk for more than\n\nfour years - from the time the Server was set up in 2014 until it was disconnected\nfrom the Internet after the Incident.\nFailure to implement proper password management\n28\n\nSecond, the Organisation failed to implement proper password management\n\npolicies. The Organisation had adopted and generally directed its staff to follow the\npassword policy of one of its affiliates (the “Password Policy”). The guidelines and\nstandards in the Password Policy are consistent with the Commission’s\nrecommendations in its Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium2, which\nrecommends that passwords used for authentication have a length of at least 8\ncharacters, containing at least one alphabetical character and one numeric character.\n29\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to take steps to ensure that the Password\n\nPolicy was compiled with in practice. None of the passwords used by the Organisation\nfor the administrator account of the Server or the files containing the Affected Personal\nData (including those containing financial information) met the Password Policy’s\nrecommended complexity rules. The passwords used by the Organisation also\n\n2\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2017/10/guide-to-securing-personal-data-in-electronic-medium\n\n8\n\n\fincorporated an acronym of the organisation’s name, which made them easy to guess\nand vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n30\n\nAs noted in Re Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1 at [5(d)]:\n“In this regard, various articles/guides have stated that the use of an\norganisation’s name as a component of the password is not\nrecommended because it is not difficult to guess and cracked by hackers.\nThe digits “2018” as a component of the password was also guessable,\nfor example, through brute force or dictionary attacks. As such, the\npassword used by the Organisation failed to prevent unauthorised copying\nand deletion of the Chizzle Database.”\n[Emphasis added]\n\n31\n\nThe login credentials for the administrator account on the Server were also\n\nshared between one administrator in the Organisation and at least three other\nindividuals in the Vendor. Other than the login credentials, there were no other access\ncontrols to the administrator account (e.g.\n\n2FA or anti-hammering features). As\n\npreviously stated in Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 12 (at\n[31]) user accounts should generally not be shared between different individuals, and\nall the more so for administrator accounts:\n“Additionally, there should not be a sharing of credentials amongst\nusers. When credentials are shared among multiple users, it is difficult\nto ensure accountability as it is difficult to track the activity of each\nindividual using the common set of credentials.”\n[Emphasis added]\n32\n\nAlthough the sharing of the administrator account credentials was not a direct\n\ncontributing factor to the Incident, the sharing of account credentials – in particular,\nadministrator accounts with high privileges – created an additional risk factor which\ncould have diminished the robustness of other security measures put in place by the\nOrganisation.\n9\n\n\f33\n\nSimilarly, while strong passwords may only slow but not entirely deter threat\n\nactors, the absence of strong passwords could greatly facilitate unauthorised access\nto IT systems, including IT systems holding personal data.\nFailure to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Vendor would protect personal data\n34\n\nThirdly, while the Organisation claims to have relied on the Vendor’s technical\n\nexpertise with regard to the security of the Server, the Organisation did not take\nreasonable or sufficient steps to stipulate clear requirements of its Vendor to ensure\nthat the Vendor understood its role in the protection of the personal data in the Server.\n35\n\nAs mentioned in the Commission’s Guide to Managing Data Intermediaries3:\n“The primary means by which a DC (i.e. a Data Controller) may ensure\nappropriate protection and retention of the personal data processed by its\nDI (i.e. a Data Intermediary) is through a contract. As the range of data\nprocessing activities that can potentially be outsourced is very broad, it is\nnecessary for the scope of outsourced data processing activities to be\nclearly defined and agreed upon. There should be clear communication\nbetween the DC and the DI on the scope of outsourced data processing\nactivities and the personal data requirements. For the DC, this is crucial in\nensuring that its business requirements and management decisions in\nrelation to the outsourcing are made clear to the DI.”\n\n36\n\nThe Vendor in this case was not a Data Intermediary. However, the Vendor was\n\nnevertheless expected to handle personal data in the course of its work or make\ndecisions which affected the security of personal data stored in the Server 4. As such,\nin order for the Organisation to say that it had discharged its Protection Obligation by\nrelying on the Vendor’s technical expertise, clear business requirements on the\nprotection of the data in the Server should have been specified. Alternatively, the\nVendor could have made recommendations on the data protection requirements\nbased on its understanding of the engagement (including for protection of the data in\nthe Server), which the Organisation could have approved and adopted. In either case,\n3\n4\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2020/09/Guide-to-Managing-Data-Intermediaries\nSee Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15 at [13] and [14]\n\n10\n\n\freasonable efforts should have been taken by the Organisation to verify that the\nVendor was meeting its data protection requirements.\n37\n\nThe exact requirements for a given case would depend on the services that a\n\nvendor is engaged to provide. If a vendor is engaged to put in place protection features\nfor a Data Controller’s IT systems, the business requirements should describe the risks\nthat the vendor is to address. In this case, the Organisation’s contract with the Vendor\ndid not specify any business requirements for the protection of personal data in the\nServer. Neither could the Organisation provide any evidence to suggest that the\nVendor made any recommendations about how to protect the data in the Server. As\nsuch, the Organisation could not say that it had discharged its Protection Obligation\nby relying on the expertise of the Vendor.\n38\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation failed to\n\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in the Server\nfrom the risk of unauthorised access, modification and disposal. Accordingly, the\nCommissioner finds the Organisation in breach of its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n39\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to\npay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA and the following aggravating and mitigating factors were taken\ninto account:\nAggravating Factor\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation’s failure to put in place reasonable security measures\n\nput the personal data in the Organisation’s possession and/or control at risk of\nexposure for more than four years.

DP-1912-B5514 and DP1912-B5559\n\n26 October 2020\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nPhishing attacks are increasingly prevalent and are one of the top\n\ncybersecurity threats faced by organisations1. In its latest report, the Cyber\nSecurity Agency of Singapore reported 47,500 cases of phishing in Singapore\nlast year, almost triple the number of cases in 20182. This case is yet another\nexample of an organisation falling victim to phishing.\n2\n\nOn 16 December 2019, ST Logistics Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that the\nOrganisation had detected an Emoted malware (“Emotet”) in their network\nwhich had infected 6 of its users’ laptops (including 4 laptops containing\npersonal data), potentially affecting up to 4,000 individuals in the Ministry of\n\n1 Phishing is a method employed by cyber criminals, often disguising themselves as legitimate\n\nindividuals or reputable organisations, to fraudulently obtain personal data and other sensitive\nor confidential information. Once cyber criminals obtain an individual’s personal data, they may\ngain access to the individual’s online accounts and may impersonate the individual to scam\npersons known to the individual. See Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, Cyber Tip – Spot\nSigns of Phishing (25 February 2020) https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/go-safe-forme/homeinternetusers/spot-signs-of-phishing.\n2 See “Phishing attacks last year tripled from 2018”, The Straits Times, 27 June 2020.\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nDefence (“MINDEF”) and Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) (the “Incident”).\nSubsequently, on 23 December 2019, the Commission received a complaint\nfrom an individual affected by the Incident.\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation\n\nprovides logistical\n\nservices to Singapore’s\n\ngovernment and defence sectors, as well as commercial sectors. It has more than\n800 employees worldwide and an annual revenue of approximately S$350\nmillion3.\n4\n\nOn 2 October 2019, the Organisation’s users received phishing emails\n\nfrom email addresses with the text “Stlogs” in the sender name field (e.g.\n“Account Executive (Stlogs)” and “Assistant General Manager (Stlogs)”). Each\nemail contained an attachment with the file extension “doc”. A total of 13 users\nfrom the Organisation opened the malicious attachment (the “Affected Users”).\n7 Affected Users had the Palo Alto Traps software (“Traps Software”), an\nadvanced endpoint protection solution, installed in their laptops and were\ntherefore protected from Emotet. The remaining 6 Affected Users (“Infected\nUsers”) did not have Traps Software installed in their laptops. This resulted in\nthe Incident with Emotet being installed and executed on the laptops of the\nInfected Users. Emotet subsequently harvested the emails in the Infected Users’\naccounts, created approximately 100 new phishing emails, and sent these new\nphishing emails on 3 October 2019. Those new phishing emails quoted the\nbodies of real emails in the email accounts of the Infected Users.\n5\n\nUnencrypted files containing personal data were stored in 4 of the\n\nInfected Users’ laptops. The files were offline working copy files used in\nrelation to the logistics services provided by the Organisation to the MINDEF\n\n3 <https://www.stlogs.com/our company/about-st-logistics>.\n\n2\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nand SAF. The working files contained personal data relating to a total of 2,400\nMINDEF and SAF personnel (“Affected Individuals”). The types of personal\ndata of the Affected Individuals at risk of unauthorised access (collectively, the\n“Disclosed Data”) were:\n(a)\n\nNames;\n\n(b)\n\nMailing addresses;\n\n(c)\n\nEmail addresses;\n\n(d)\n\nTelephone numbers; and\n\n(e)\n\nNRIC numbers (1,320 full NRIC numbers and 1,080 masked\n\n(last 3 digits and checksum) NRIC numbers).\n6\n\nBased on the Organisation’s investigations (including anti-virus scans\n\nperformed following the Incident), the infection by Emotet was limited to the\nlaptops of the Infected Users. At the time of the Incident, the Organisation’s\nproxy logs captured information which showed that some exfiltration had taken\nplace. However, there was insufficient information in the proxy logs to confirm\nthat the exfiltration included files containing the Disclosed Data.\n7\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the following remedial actions were\n\ntaken to mitigate the effects of the Incident:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation immediately disconnected the Infected Users\n\nlaptops from the Organisation’s corporate network;\n(b)\n\nSecurity advisories (including guidelines on how to identify\n\nphishing emails) were sent to all the Organisation’s users to inform them\nof the Incident and to be vigilant; and\n\n3\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n(c)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nAll Affected Individuals were notified by MINDEF through text\n\nmessages by 27 December 2019.\n8\n\nIn addition, the following remedial actions have been taken, or are\n\ncommitted to be taken, by the Organisation to prevent recurrence of the Incident\nor similar incidents.\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation conducted a “PDPA awareness” programme in\n\nFebruary 2020 for its staff. “PDPA awareness” training materials were\nmade available to all staff on the Organisation’s intranet. Selected users\nalso attended the PDPA training offered by NTUC Learning Hub in\nFebruary 2020;\n(b)\n\nMalicious email domains were identified. Enhanced firewall\n\nprotection was implemented to inspect traffic to the Organisation’s\nemail gateway. Email rules were created to block similar phishing\nemails from reaching the Organisation’s users;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation performed a company-wide validation\n\nexercise to ensure that Traps Software was installed on the laptops of all\nits users;\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation conducted a Sender Policy Framework\n\nverification to reduce the number of spam and phishing emails reaching\nits users;\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation implemented the display of warning banners\n\nfor emails that do not originate from the Organisation’s email server;\n(f)\n\nThe Organisation will increase the frequency of sending\n\n“Cybersecurity Advisory & Personal Data Protection Awareness”\nnotices to all users;\n\n4\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n(g)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nThe Organisation implemented internet separation via URL\n\nfiltering and has been exploring a sandbox feature and URL checking\nfor all emails;\n(h)\n\nPeriodic phishing exercises will be conducted as part of the\n\nOrganisation’s Cybersecurity Awareness Program; and\n(i)\n\nIndependent security experts will be engaged to perform\n\ncompromise assessment to validate the security status of the\nOrganisation’s systems environment in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nMost phishing attacks are sent by email,4 and the most common form is\n\nthe general, mass-mailed type, where the cyber attacker sends an email\npretending to be someone else and tries to trick the email recipient to log into a\nwebsite or download malware.5 Based on the Commission’s past investigations,\nthere are generally 2 scenarios when a data breach involves phishing attacks on\ne-mail accounts:\n(a)\n\nFirst, where malware harvests email addresses from the victim’s\n\nemail address book to send further phishing emails to contacts of the\nvictim. In this scenario, the only personal data that are accessed and used\nby the malicious actor are email addresses; and\n\n4\n\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en_sg/products/security/email-security/what-is-phishing.html; See\nalso National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom), Phishing attacks: defending your\norganisation (version 1.1, 8 August 2019) https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing:\nPhishing can be conducted via a text message, social media, or by phone, but the term 'phishing'\nis mainly used to describe attacks that arrive by email.\n5 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3234716/types-of-phishing-attacks-and-how-to-identify-\n\nthem.html\n\n5\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n(b)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nSecond, where the content of the victim’s email account is\n\ncompromised, and emails are downloaded and/or forwarded by\nmalicious actors. In this scenario, there may be personal data within the\nbody of the email message (e.g. customer information, employee human\nresource data, payroll information etc.) as part of its communication\ncontent. Some of these may be confidential or commercially sensitive\ninformation.\n10\n\nThe first type of email phishing attack at [9(a)] is more common, and\n\nthe risk of harm is relatively low as the unauthorised access and use is limited\nto email addresses. Conversely, while the second type of email phishing attack\nat [9(b)] is less common, the risk of harm is significantly greater. This is because\nin addition to email addresses, communication content exposed to unauthorised\naccess and use may contain other type(s) of personal data (including those of a\nsensitive nature, e.g. medical and financial data). Consequentially, a breach of\ndata protection obligations resulting in the organisation falling victim to the\nsecond type of email phishing attack generally results in more serious\nconsequences.\n11\n\nThe present case falls into the first type of email phishing attack, and the\n\nissue for determination is whether the Organisation had complied with its\nobligations under Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”). Section 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n12\n\nAs a preliminary point, it is not disputed that the Organisation was in\n\npossession and control of the Disclosed Data at all material times, and was\nobliged to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the Disclosed\nData.\n6\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n13\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation failed\n\nto conduct periodic security reviews to detect vulnerabilities in its IT systems.\n(a)\n\nAs stated in the Commission’s previous decisions, organisations\n\nare expected to conduct periodic security reviews of its IT systems.6\nConducting regular information and communication technology\n(“ICT”) security audits, scans and tests to detect vulnerabilities help\norganisations to ensure that ICT security controls developed and\nconfigured for the protection of personal data are properly\nimplemented7. The comprehensiveness of such security reviews should\nbe scoped based on the organisation’s assessment of its data protection\nneeds, and be conducted to a reasonable standard;\n(b)\n\nIn the present case, a reasonably conducted security review\n\nshould have included (i) verifying complete installation and proper\nconfiguration of the security software on all of the Organisation’s users’\nlaptops; and (ii) checking that the security software is updated;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to conduct a security review to a\n\nreasonable standard resulted in the following undetected security gaps\nthat led to the Incident8:\n(i)\n\nThe anti-virus software installed on users’ laptops was\n\nnot updated because they had not been properly configured to\nreceive updates. This security gap affected all of the Infected\nUsers, whose laptops were not so configured. The investigations\n\n6 See Re WTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.

[2019] SGPDPC 44 at [6] to [8].\n7 Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised 20 January\n\n2017) at [6.1].\n8 As an updated anti-virus software and Traps Software both offered protection against Emotet,\n\nthe Organisation could have chosen to take a phased approach to its security review.\n\n7\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\ninto the Incident revealed that if anti-virus software had been\nupdated, it would have been able to block and remove Emotet at\nthe material time; and\n(ii)\n\nDue to a rollout gap, the Traps Software was not installed\n\non the laptops of some Organisation’s users. In contrast with\nsignature-based anti-virus software (which is used to identify\n“known” malware), Traps Software detects malware based on\ntheir behaviour. This enables Traps Software to detect newly\nreleased forms of malware (which signature-based anti-virus\nsoftware may potentially fail to detect) based on behavioural\nanalysis. As mentioned at [4], this security gap affected all of the\nInfected Users, on whose laptops the Traps Software had not\nbeen installed. Conversely, the laptops of the remaining 7\nAffected Users (who had also opened the malicious attachment)\nhad Traps Software installed, and were accordingly protected\nfrom Emotet.\n14\n\nBased on the Commission’s preliminary findings, it appeared that the\n\nOrganisation also did not conduct proper data protection training for its staff. In\nparticular, the Organisation had conceded during investigations that not all the\nAffected Users had completed the relevant data protection training at the time\nthe Incident occurred. The failure to conduct proper data protection training\nwould have been an additional ground (other than the omission to conduct\nperiodic security reviews to detect vulnerabilities in the IT system) in support\nof finding the Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation.\n15\n\nHowever, the Organisation subsequently clarified in its representations\n\nto the Commission’s preliminary findings that its data protection training for its\nstaff prior to the Incident included PDPA awareness programmes conducted in\nMarch and April 2019 and bi-monthly staff induction programmes covering\n8\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\ncybersecurity and PDPA compliance. In addition, the training material for the\nPDPA awareness programme, as well as relevant reference materials and the\nURL link to the Commission’s website were provided in the Organisation’s\nintranet to allow staff ready access to data protection related resources.\n16\n\nThe Commission recognises that staff movement will always have to be\n\nfactored into staff training programmes, and at any one point in time, there will\nalways be members of staff at different stages of training. Having a training\nprogramme in place and a system to track staff training is therefore important.\nThus, while not all the Affected Users had completed the relevant data\nprotection training at the time of the Incident, the arrangements the Organisation\nhad implemented towards trainings its staff on data protection was reasonable\nin the circumstances.\n17\n\nFor the reasons set out at [13] above, the Commissioner finds the\n\nOrganisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n18\n\nIn addition to the representations made on data protection training, the\n\nOrganisation also raised the following factors for consideration in support of a\nreduction in the quantum of financial penalty which the Commissioner intended\nto impose:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had put in place reasonable security\n\narrangements to protect the Disclosed Data prior to the Incident. These\nincluded advanced end point solution (Palo Alto Traps) on corporate\nservers and workstations; privileged access management; monitoring of\nsecurity events through security information and events management\nsystems; and web penetration test performed for corporate applications\nby CREST accredited vendor. Notwithstanding these arrangements, the\nOrganisation was a victim of a phishing attack; and\n\n9\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n(b)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nThere was a low risk of harm arising from the Incident as the\n\nunauthorised access and use of the Disclosed Data by the cyber attacker\nwere limited to email addresses. There was also no evidence that any\nDisclosed Data had been exfiltrated.\n19\n\nThe Organisation’s representations that it had put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Disclosed Data prior to the Incident is not\naccepted. As explained at [13], the Organisation failed to conduct periodic\nsecurity reviews to detect vulnerabilities in its IT systems. The requirement for\norganisations to conduct periodic security reviews to comply has been\nemphasised in the Commission’s previous decisions.9 Separately, the\nOrganisation’s representation that there was a low risk of harm arising from the\nIncident is accepted and has been taken into account in determining the financial\npenalty.\n20\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has\n\ndecided to reduce the financial penalty to the amount set out at [22]. The\nquantum of financial penalty has been determined after due consideration of the\nlow risk of harm arising from the Incident and the mitigating factors set out at\n[21].\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n21\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account the\nOrganisation’s cooperation with the investigations and its prompt and\nforthcoming responses to the Commission’s queries.\n\n9 See cases listed at Footnote 6.\n\n10\n\n\fST Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n22\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 19\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\ndirects the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$8,000 within 30 days\nfrom the date of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the\nRules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the\noutstanding amount of the financial penalty until it is paid in full. The\nCommissioner has not set out any further directions given the remediation\nmeasures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Greatearth Corporation for failing to obtain consent to disclose personal data of 8 crane operators on the external façade of a construction site.","tags":["Consent","Warning","Construction","Consent","Ban list","Acting in Course of Employment"],"date":"2021-05-12","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Progressive-Builders-and-Greatearth-Corporation---16042021-(002).pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"Breach of the Consent Obligation by Greatearth Corporation, No Breach of the PDPA by Progressive Builders","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/05/breach-of-the-consent-obligation-by-greatearth-corporation","timestamp":"2021-05-12","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 2\n\nCase No. DP-1907-B4305\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\n(1) Progressive Builders\nPrivate Limited\n(2) Greatearth Corporation\nPte.

Ltd. (“GCPL”). On 19 and 20 July 2019, the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) received complaints from each of the Complainants alleging\nthat their personal data had been disclosed by Progressive Builders Private Limited (“PBPL”)\nwithout their consent (the “Complaints”). The Commission commenced an investigation into\nthe Complaints.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Complainants are tower crane operators engaged by Craneworks Pte Ltd (“the\n\nSubcontractor”) to operate tower cranes for the Subcontractor’s clients, including PBPL.\nPBPL is the main contractor for a housing project in Geylang (the “Geylang Project”) and is\nin charge of the Geylang Project worksite (the “Geylang Worksite”). PBPL had collected the\nComplainants’ personal data (including their full name, NRIC, contact number and\nphotograph) when they were appointed as tower crane operators for the Geylang Project. The\ncollection of their personal data was for the purposes of managing the Complainants’ roles as\ntower crane operators. The Subcontractor is a sub-contractor of PBPL for the Geylang Project.\nIt supplies licensed crane operators to PBPL for the operation of tower cranes.\n3\n\nGCPL is also a company that is in the construction business. It is the main contractor\n\nfor a housing project in Clementi (the “Clementi Project”) and is in charge of the Clementi\n\n2\n\n\fProject worksite (“Clementi Worksite”). GCPL does not have any business relationship with\nPBPL, the Subcontractor, or the Complainants.\nCreation of the Banned Operators List\n4\n\nBetween 12 and 18 July 2019, a series of incidents involving the Complainants and the\n\nstaff of PBPL occurred at the Geylang Site. As a result of the incidents, PBPL banned the\nComplainants from entering the Geylang Worksite. After the workplace incidents, PBPL’s\nproject director (“Project Director”) directed PBPL’s Workplace Safety & Health Officer\n(“WSHO”) at the time to compile a list of the Complainants’ details, which included the\nfollowing personal data of each of the Complainants:\n(a)\n\nFull name;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nContact number; and\n\n(d)\n\nPhoto ID of the individual\n\n(collectively, the “Banned Operators List”).\n5\n\nAccording to PBPL, the Banned Operators List was created to identify the\n\nComplainants that were involved in the workplace incidents and sent to the Subcontractor and\nthe Ministry of Manpower to inform them of the individuals involved in the workplace\nincidents.\nDisclosure of the Banned Operators List\n6\n\nOn or about 17 July 2019, unbeknownst to PBPL and without any authorisation from\n\nPBPL, PBPL’s WSHO sent the Banned Operators List to a private Whatsapp group comprising\nof workplace safety professionals in Singapore (the “Whatsapp Group”) along with the\nfollowing Whatsapp message:\n“… [details of the incident]. Please look out for such operators in future at your\nsite.”\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nThe Complaints were filed with the Commission between 19 and 20 July 2019 after the\n\nComplainants came to know of the existence of the Banned Operators List and the fact that it\nwas being circulated amongst those in the construction industry.\n8\n\nGCPL’s WSHO was a member of the Whatsapp Group. When GCPL’s WSHO received\n\nthe Banned Operators List and message, he understood it to mean that the individuals listed in\nthe Banned Operators List (i.e. the Complainants) were banned from working at the Geylang\nWorksite. As he oversaw the Clementi Worksite, he wanted to look out for the Complainants\nshould they come onto the Clementi Worksite.\n9\n\nOn or about 24 July 2019, GCPL’s WSHO sent the Banned Operators List to GCPL’s\n\nsafety coordinator with instructions “to look out for these people and not to let them enter the\nClementi worksite”. Specifically, GCPL’s WSHO instructed GCPL’s safety coordinator to\nprint and paste a copy of the Banned Operators List in the guard room so that the security\nguards could keep a lookout for the Complainants. However, GCPL’s safety coordinator\nmisunderstood these instructions. Instead of pasting a copy of the Banned Operators List in the\nguard room of the Clementi Worksite, the word “BANNED” was added as a header to the\nBanned Operators List and the list was pasted on the external façade of the Clementi Worksite\nwhere it was visible to all persons walking onto the Clementi Worksite (the “Poster”).\n10\n\nAccording to GCPL’s WSHO, he had not noticed that the Poster was pasted on the\n\nexternal façade of the Clementi Worksite as he usually drove into the worksite. While GCPL’s\nWSHO claimed to have only noticed the Poster on the external façade in late September 2019\nand intended to remove it, GCPL only took down the Poster after the Commission notified it\nof the Complaints on or about 26 September 2019. The Poster had been displayed on the\nexternal façade for about 2 months.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n11\n\nThe issues to be determined in this case are:\n(a)\n\nwhether PBPL is responsible for their WSHO’s disclosure of the Banned\n\nOperators List;\n(b)\n\nif PBPL is responsible, whether PBPL contravened its obligations under the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”);\n4\n\n\f(c)\n\nwhether GCPL is responsible for their WSHO and safety coordinator’s\n\ncollection, use, and disclosure of the Banned Operators List; and\n(d)\n\nif GCPL is responsible, whether GCPL contravened its obligations under the\n\nPDPA.\nWhether PBPL is responsible for their WSHO’s disclosure of the Banned Operators List\n12\n\nUnder section 53(1) of the PDPA, any act done, or conduct engaged in by an employee\n\nin the course of his employment is treated as done or engaged in by his employer as well,\nregardless of whether it was done or engaged in with the employer’s knowledge or approval.\nSection 53(2) provides for a defence of reasonable diligence for offences under the PDPA,\nwhere the employer had taken reasonable steps to prevent or reasonably reduce the risk of the\noccurrence of the employee’s action or conduct that resulted in an unauthorised collection, use\nand/or disclosure of personal data. For investigations into breaches of the PDPA that are not\noffences — such as the present case — a similar standard of reasonable diligence may be\napplied by virtue of section 11(1) of the PDPA, by considering whether the organisation had\nacted reasonably in meeting its responsibilities under the PDPA.\n13\n\nIn the present case, the Commission’s investigations found that PBPL’s WSHO was\n\nnot acting in the course of his employment when he disclosed the Banned Operators List to the\nmembers of the Whatsapp Group:\n(a)\n\nfirst, even though PBPL’s WSHO compiled the Banned Operators List in the\n\ncourse of his employment, there was no evidence that PBPL had directed him to share\nthe Banned Operators List in the Whatsapp Group. PBPL was not aware of the\nWhatsapp Group’s existence and did not know that their WSHO was a member of the\nWhatsapp Group; and\n(b)\n\nsecond, in sharing and disclosing the Complainants’ personal data in the Banned\n\nOperators List to the members of the Whatsapp Group, PBPL’s WSHO had disregarded\nhis obligations of confidentiality under his employment contract:\n“You shall keep confidential and not, during your employment, directly or\nindirectly use, divulge, disclose or deliver to any person except as\nauthorized or required by your duties, or by law, and term in this letter of\n5\n\n\fany Confidential Information of the Company acquired by you in the\ncourse of your employment.”\n14\n\nThus, given that PBPL’s WSHO acted outside of the course of his employment when\n\nhe disclosed the Complainants’ personal data without their consent, section 53(1) of the PDPA\ndoes not apply and the WSHO’s actions cannot be attributed to PBPL. Accordingly, PBPL did\nnot contravene its data protection obligations under the PDPA with regard to the disclosure of\nthe Complainants’ personal data in the Banned Operators List.\nWhether GCPL is responsible for their WSHO and safety coordinator’s collection, use and\ndisclosure of the Banned Operators List\n15\n\nSimilar to PBPL, it is doubtful if GCPL knew of the existence of the WhatsApp Group\n\nor that it’s WSHO was a member thereof. GCPL’s WSHO probably also did not obtain the\nBanned Operators List in the course of his employment, since his participation in the WhatsApp\nGroup was unsanctioned. However, the significant departure is that unlike PBPL’s WSHO,\nGCPL’s WSHO was acting in the course of his employment when he instructed GCPL’s safety\ncoordinator to put up a copy of the Banned Operators List in the Clementi Worksite\nguardhouse. The use of the Complainants’ personal data was expressly professed to be for the\npurpose of screening and restricting the entry of the Complainants onto the Clementi Worksite.\nSimilarly, GCPL’s safety coordinator was also acting in the course of his employment when\nhe pasted the Poster on the external façade of the Clementi Worksite, thereby disclosing the\nComplainants’ personal data.\n16\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to section 53(1) of the PDPA, GCPL’s WSHO and safety\n\ncoordinator’s collection, use, and disclosure of the Complainants’ personal data were the\nactions of GCPL for which it was responsible.\nWhether GCPL has contravened its obligations under the PDPA\n17\n\nUnder section 13 of the PDPA, organisations are prohibited from collecting, using or\n\ndisclosing an individual’s personal data unless the individual gives, or is deemed to have given,\nhis consent for the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data, or the collection, use or\ndisclosure without consent is authorised under the PDPA or any other written law (the\n“Consent Obligation”).\n6\n\n\f18\n\nOn the present facts, the disclosure of the Complainants’ personal data without their\n\nconsent was not authorised under the PDPA or any other written law; nor could disclosure be\nsupported by any extant exceptions for the Consent Obligation. It was clear from the facts that\nthe Complainants had not voluntarily provide their personal data to GCPL. GCPL therefore\nneeded to have obtained the Complainants’ consent before disclosing their personal data by\npasting the Banned Operators List onto the façade of the Clementi Worksite. However, GCPL\nfailed to do so.\n19\n\nWhile it is arguable that the use of the Banned Operators List within the guardroom and\n\nconfined to the security personnel may have been acceptable, especially if the context of the\ninformation had been provided and clear instructions had been given that the Banned Operators\nList be restricted to private reference by security personnel on duty. However, the present case\nwent beyond what a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. The\ninformation came from an informal source – i.e. the WhatsApp Group – and GCPL made a\ndecision to ban the Complainants from the Clementi Worksite on the basis of the Banned\nOperators List. These are decisions that GCPL may make as a private commercial enterprise.\nThe Banned Operators List could have been handled more discretely and used more\nresponsibly. However, pasting it on the external façade of the Clementi Worksite such that it\ncould be seen any passer-by fell below the standard of reasonableness that is expected from\nGCPL.\n20\n\nIn the circumstances, GCPL breached the Consent Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n21\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on GCPL under section 48I of the\n\nPDPA, I took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe incident occurred because GCPL’s safety coordinator (who was a new\n\nemployee at the time) misunderstood the instructions given to him;\n(b)\n\nthe incident had originated from GCPL’s WSHO whose actions arose out of\n\nconcern for the safety of the Clementi Worksite, in view of the alleged conduct of the\nComplainants, and in the interest of his employer;\n\n7\n\n\f(c)\n\nthere was limited disclosure of personal data of the Complainants and any\n\ndisclosure would have been limited to those who entered the Clementi Worksite on\nfoot; and\n(d)\n\nupon being notified of the Complaints, GCPL took prompt remedial action by\n\nremoving the Banned Operators List poster from the Clementi Worksite.\n22\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, I hereby issue a Warning to\n\nGCPL. No further directions are necessary given the remedial actions that have already been\ntaken by GCPL.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A review application under section 28 (now known as section 48H(1)(a)) of the PDPA was conducted following a failed request by an individual to obtain his full unredacted internal evaluation report prepared by HSBC Bank (Singapore) Limited for the purpose of evaluating his credit card application.","tags":["Finance and Insurance","Access and Correction","Evaluation","Opinion Data"],"date":"2021-05-12","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision--HSBC-Bank-Singapore-Limited--10032021.pdf","nature":"","title":"Outcome of a Review Application Involving an Individual and HSBC Bank","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/05/outcome-of-a-review-application-involving-an-individual-and-hsbc-bank","timestamp":"2021-05-12","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 3\nCase No. DP-1810-B2892R\n\nIn the matter of a review under section 48H(1)(a)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and\nof the Personal Data Protection (Enforcement) Regulations 2021\n\nBetween\n\n[Redacted]\n… Applicant\nAnd\n\nHSBC Bank (Singapore) Limited\n… Respondent\n\nDECISION\n\n\fHSBC Bank (Singapore) Limited\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-1810-B2892R\n10 March 2021\n\nBackground\n1\n\nThe Respondent, HSBC Bank (Singapore) Limited (“HSBC”), is a full-service bank in\n\nSingapore. HSBC’s personal banking offerings include credit card facilities to individuals,\noffered subject to a process of application and approval by the bank. Sometime in 2018, the\nApplicant applied to HSBC for a credit card, but was unsuccessful. Dissatisfied, he requested\nHSBC to provide him with a copy of the bank’s internal evaluation report prepared for the\npurpose of evaluating his credit card application (“the Report”).\n2\n\nIn response to the Applicant’s request, HSBC furnished a copy of the Report but with\n\nsome fields redacted (“the Redacted Data”). HSBC’s position was that they were not obliged\nto disclose the Redacted Data to the Applicant, as the Redacted Data constituted opinion data\nkept solely for an evaluative purpose, an exception to the Access Obligation under paragraph\n1(a) of the Fifth Schedule (“the Evaluative Purpose Exception”).\n3\n\nThe Applicant maintained that he was entitled to the full unredacted Report, and\n\napproached the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) for assistance. The\nCommission attempted to facilitate an amicable resolution between the parties. When attempts\nto facilitate an amicable resolution were unsuccessful, the Commission informed the Applicant\nof his option to make a review application under the then section 28 of the PDPA (now, section\n48H(1)(a) of the PDPA) (“the Review Application”).\n4\n\nThe Applicant elected to take this option on 18 March 2020. As HSBC’s position on\n\nthe Review Application was extensively set out in its prior correspondence with the\nCommission, these were (with HSBC’s consent) treated as the Respondent’s response for the\npurposes of Regulation 6 of the Personal Data Protection (Enforcement) Regulations 2014\n(“the Response”). In the Response, in addition to the Evaluative Purpose Exception, HSBC\n\n\fcited additional grounds to justify not disclosing the Redacted Data to the Applicant. Despite\nthe Commission’s invitation, the Applicant did not submit any reply to the Response.\nFindings and basis for determination\n5\n\nThe issues that arise for my determination in this Review Application are:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Report is personal data of the Applicant; and\n\n(b)\n\nIf so, whether the Evaluative Purpose Exception (or any other exception under\n\nthe PDPA or other written law) applies so as to justify HSBC’s refusal to give the\nApplicant access to the Redacted Data.\nThe Access Obligation\n6\n\nThe Applicant’s request for access to the Report should be viewed as a data subject\n\naccess request made pursuant to section 21(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”). Section 21(1) of the PDPA gives a data subject the right to access personal data\nabout him that is in an organisation’s possession or under its control (“the Access\nObligation”). The data subject’s right of access is moderated by section 21(2) of the PDPA\nwhich allows an organisation to invoke any of the exceptions listed in the Fifth Schedule of the\nPDPA to decline the data subject access request.\n7\n\nThe Access Obligation should not be examined in isolation. The Access Obligation\n\nenables a number of neighbouring obligations: the Purpose Limitation Obligation (section 18\nof the PDPA), the Correction Obligation (section 22 of the PDPA) and the Accuracy\nObligation (section 23 of the PDPA). The Access Obligation enables the data subject to\nascertain what personal data about him an Organisation possesses or controls, and also how it\nhas been used or disclosed. It empowers the data subject to ask for an account of how personal\ndata about him has been collected, used or disclosed: section 21(1)(b) of the PDPA. It also\nenables the data subject to ascertain that personal data about him is correct, and to request for\ncorrection of errors or omissions: section 22(1) of the PDPA. This in turn supports the\norganisation’s use of personal data. The Accuracy Obligation requires an organisation to ensure\nthat personal data that it uses when making decisions that affect an individual is accurate and\ncomplete: section 23(a).\n\n2\n\n\f8\n\nThe PDPA respects a fundamental distinction between ensuring that good quality data\n\nis available to organisations that make use of them to make decisions, and the decision and\ndecision-making process. Whereas the Access and Correction Obligations support the former\nby empowering the individual in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, the Fifth\nand Sixth Schedules contain a number of exceptions that are intended to preserve the\nconfidentiality of the decision-making process e.g. evaluative purpose and trust administration.\n9\n\nI thought it helpful to preface the relationships of these obligations before providing the\n\nreasons for my decision on this Review Application.\nIs the Report personal data of the Applicant?\n10\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” as data, whether true or not, about an\n\nindividual who can be identified (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information\nto which the organisation has or is likely to have access. In the Commission’s Advisory\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA, the following guidance has been provided on when\ndata would be considered “personal data” for the purposes of the PDPA, at [5.2] and [5.4]:\n(a)\n\nThe term “personal data” is not intended to be narrowly construed and may\n\ncover different types of data about an individual and from which an individual can be\nidentified, regardless of whether such data is true or accurate, or whether the data exists\nin electronic or other form.\n(b)\n\nThere are two principal considerations. First, is the nature or purpose of the\n\ninformation to be data about an individual or which relates to the individual. Second,\nthe individual should be identifiable from the data on its own, or from that data and\nother information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access.\n11\n\nThe Report was prepared for the purposes of evaluating the Applicant’s application for\n\ncredit card facilities. It contained information about him that was relevant to deciding whether\ncredit card facilities should be extended by HSBC. The Report contained various data fields,\nsome of which were populated with text, and some left blank. Some of the populated fields in\nthe Report were redacted by HSBC when a copy was provided to the Applicant (i.e. the\nRedacted Data). Since the Report contains information about the Applicant, who is identifiable\nfrom the information, and the Report was prepared for the purpose of making a decision\n\n3\n\n\fconcerning his application for credit card facilities, the Report is therefore the personal data of\nthe Applicant.\n12\n\nIn its Response, HSBC described the Redacted Data as opinion data auto-generated by\n\nHSBC’s proprietary algorithm that determined an individual’s suitability for a credit card by\nanalysing data from various sources. The data analysed included (i) information provided by\nthe Applicant in his credit card application form such as his age, education level, income and\nemployment information, and (ii) data obtained from third parties such as other banks or the\nCredit Bureau Singapore. HSBC also explained that the Redacted Data did not comprise of\nactual data from these sources, but was data derived from information obtained from these\nsources.\n13\n\nI did not consider the fact that the Redacted Data was algorithmically generated data to\n\nbe relevant in determining whether they formed part of the Applicant’s personal data. The\nprimary focus is whether the information is about an identified or identifiable individual. It\nmatters not whether the data was collected directly from the data subject, from a third-party\nsource or derived from data from either (or both) of such sources. So long as the information\nis about the individual and it is in the possession or under the custody of the organisation, it is\npersonal data.\n14\n\nFor the purpose of deciding the applicability of the Evaluative Purpose Exception\n\nsubsequently, I need to be satisfied that the Redacted Data is opinion data. HSBC’s argument\nis that the Redacted Data was derived after an analysis of primary data based on business rules\nthat are expressed in its proprietary algorithm. For the purpose of this Review Application,\nHSBC provided the Report in the clear. There are five fields that were redacted: four were\nalgorithmically generated and one contained type-written information. I am satisfied that the\nRedacted Data is not merely a reproduction of personal data obtained from a third-party source\nnor are they the result of simple arithmetic operations; they are expressions of opinions after\ndata processing. I therefore accept the argument that the application of business rules in the\nalgorithmic analysis yielded opinions, and by virtue of this, the Redacted Data is opinion data.\nTherefore, the Redacted Data is opinion data that forms part of the Applicant’s personal data\nthat HSBC has in its possession and control; and the Redacted Data is potentially subject to the\nAccess Obligation, unless HSBC is able to rely on an applicable exception.\n\n4\n\n\fCan HSBC rely on the Evaluative Purpose Exception (or other grounds) to decline access to\nthe Redacted Data?\n15\n\nThe Fifth Schedule allows an organisation to decline providing access to “opinion data\n\nkept solely for an evaluative purpose”: para 1(a) of the Fifth Schedule. Section 2(1) of the\nPDPA defines “evaluative purpose” to mean:\n“(a) for the purpose of determining the suitability, eligibility or qualifications of the\nindividual to whom the data relates —\n(i) for employment or for appointment to office;\n(ii)\n\nfor promotion in employment or office or for continuance in employment\nor office;\n\n(iii)\n\nfor removal from employment or office;\n\n(iv)\n\nfor admission to an education institution;\n\n(v)\n\nfor the awarding of contracts, awards, bursaries, scholarships, honours or\nother similar benefits;\n\n(vi)\n\nfor selection for an athletic or artistic purpose; or\n\n(vii)\n\nfor grant of financial or social assistance, or the delivery of appropriate\nhealth services, under any scheme administered by a public agency;\n\n(b) for the purpose of determining whether any contract, award, bursary, scholarship,\nhonour or other similar benefit should be continued, modified or cancelled;\n(c) for the purpose of deciding whether to insure any individual or property or to\ncontinue or renew the insurance of any individual or property; or\n(d) for such other similar purposes as may be prescribed by the Minister”\n[emphasis added]\n16\n\nIt is clear from the words emphasised in bold in the definition above that the Evaluative\n\nPurpose Exception is intended to cover the decision-making process: in other words, the\nevaluation before a decision is made. The definition enumerates a number of decisions that\norganisations have to make from time to time: see the words emphasised in italics. Thus, the\nEvaluative Purpose Exception operates to keep opinions that form part of the decision-making\nprocess confidential. Data subjects do not have the right to access personal data that is\ncontained in such opinions: section 21(2) read with para 1(a) of the Fifth Schedule; nor do they\nhave the right to request corrections: section 22(6) and 22(7) read with para 1(a) of the Sixth\nSchedule.\n\n5\n\n\f17\n\nIn the present Review Application, the Applicant had applied for credit card facilities.\n\nLimb (a) of the definition is the relevant one. HSBC is evaluating his suitability or eligibility\nfor the credit card facilities. The evaluation will result in a decision whether to extend to him\nthe credit card facilities that he had applied for, which will entail the award of a contract: i.e.\nsub-section (v) “for the awarding of contracts, awards, bursaries, scholarships, honours or\nother similar benefits”. The operative decision here is to make an award; the subject matter of\nthe decision covers a range of things. Some are in the nature of a bilateral relationship, eg\ncontracts, bursaries and scholarships; some a unilateral conferment of a status, eg honours or\nsimilar benefits. Thus, HSBC was using the opinion data to evaluate whether to award the\ncontract to the Applicant. I therefore find that HSBC was entitled to rely on the Evaluative\nPurpose Exception to decline giving the Applicant access to the Redacted Data.\n18\n\nSection 21(5) of the PDPA contemplates occasions, such as the present, where\n\ndocuments may contain personal data that the data subject is entitled to access commingled\nwith other personal data that the organisation may decline to provide access to. Thus, HSBC is\nentitled to rely on the Evaluative Purpose Exception to exclude the Redacted Data from the\ncopy of the Report that was furnished to the Applicant.\n19\n\nEven though HSBC declined to disclose the Redacted Data, it had provided to the\n\nApplicant two publications: (a) HSBC’s Principle for the Ethical Use of Big Data and AI and\n(b) HSBC’s Credit Decisioning Policy Statement. These publications provide information\nabout how AI and Big Data are used in an ethical manner by HSBC and how technology is\nused to conduct credit facility assessments. I found the Credit Decisioning Policy Statement\nrelevant. It provides a description of the type of opinions that the majority of the Redacted Data\nconveyed. Even though HSBC was entitled to decline providing access to the Redacted Data,\nit had acted reasonably by providing information about how it uses data and technology to\nconduct credit facility assessments. From the perspective of accountability and disclosure of\npolicies and practices, HSBC had acquitted itself.\n20\n\nFor completeness, HSBC also cited various other reasons in its Response to justify its\n\nrefusal to give the Applicant access to the Redacted Data. In view of my conclusion that HSBC\nwas entitled to rely on the Evaluative Purpose Exception to decline providing access to the\nRedacted Data, it is unnecessary for me to consider these additional grounds put forth by HSBC\n\n6\n\n\fin full. Nevertheless, I set out these additional grounds and the reasons why I did not think that\nthey merited full consideration:\n(a)\n\nCiting paragraph 1(g) of the Fifth Schedule of the PDPA, HSBC argued that\n\ndisclosure of the Redacted Data would reveal confidential commercial information that\nwould affect HSBC’s competitive position. From my perusal of the Report, I did not\nthink that the Redacted Data would disclose or allow for the reverse-engineering of\n“confidential commercial information” pertaining to HSBC’s credit card application\nevaluation process that would affect its competitive position. On the contrary, their\nCredit Decisioning Policy Statement provided an ample description of the majority of\nthe Redacted Data.\n(b)\n\nCiting paragraph 1(h) of the Fifth Schedule of the PDPA, HSBC argued that the\n\nRedacted Data was personal data collected for the purposes of an investigation and that\nthis investigation and associated proceedings and appeals had not yet been completed.\nBased on the information provided, there was no ongoing ‘investigation” within the\nmeaning of section 2(1) of the PDPA. Client due diligence or customer information\nchecks for the purposes of a credit card application were not “investigations” in this\nsense.\n(c)\n\nCiting paragraph 1(j)(ii) of the Fifth Schedule of the PDPA, HSBC argued that\n\nthe burden or expense of providing access to the Redacted Data would be unreasonable\nconsidering the volume of credit application applications that HSBC received daily.\nThis was an assertion unsupported by evidence. It was not unreasonably burdensome\nor expensive for HSBC to respond to the Applicant’s access request, and the fact that\nthe Applicant’s request might lead to other individuals making similar requests was not\na relevant consideration.\n(d)\n\nCiting paragraph 1(j)(v) of the Fifth Schedule to the PDPA, HSBC argued that\n\nthe Applicant’s request was frivolous and vexatious as the Applicant had full\nknowledge of the personal data and financial information that he had himself provided\nby way of his credit card application only some 2 weeks prior to his access request. I\ndid not consider the Applicant’s request to be frivolous or vexatious as he had not\nrequested for the same data which he had provided to HSBC in his credit card\n\n7\n\n\fapplication form, but had requested for the bank’s opinion data in the Report, which he\nhad no knowledge of but was interested in.\n(e)\n\nFinally, HSBC argued that MAS Notice 626 issued on 24 April 2015 (pursuant\n\nto section 27B of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act) took precedence over\nHSBC’s obligations under the PDPA by virtue of section 4(6) of the PDPA, and allowed\nHSBC to refuse access to the Redacted Data. MAS Notice 626 deals with anti-money\nlaundering and terrorism financing. Having considered the Redacted Data in the clear,\nI did not think that this MAS Notice was relevant.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n21\n\nPursuant to section 48H(2)(a) of the PDPA, and for the reasons set out above, I confirm\n\nHSBC’s refusal to provide the Applicant with access to the Redacted Data.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":""},{"description":"A warning was issued to Flying Cape, a data intermediary, for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of 191 users of a website.

FCPL\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of the Incident\non 12 November 2020, after having received a ransom demand in respect of the\nExfiltrated Data.\n\n3.\n\nSometime in early September 2020, as part of its management of the Website, FCPL\nextracted the personal data of the Affected Individuals from the database of the Website\n\n\finto an excel file. An FCPL employee who was assigned to work with the excel file failed\nto protect the file with a password or encrypt it as required by FCPL’s IT policy.\nMoreover, the employee incorrectly stored the excel file in a publicly accessible online\nstorage bucket, as opposed to the correct, secured storage bucket. These lapses were\nbelieved to have led to the Incident.\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to section 53(1) of the PDPA, FCPL is liable for acts done by employees. The\nquestion therefore becomes whether FCPL had taken reasonable steps to prevent or\ndetect mistakes such as the one made by the employee. The investigations did not surface\nany arrangements to supervise or verify its employees’ compliance with its internal\npolicies or detect non-compliance. The Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data\nProtection therefore found that FCPL had breached the Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) in respect of the\nExfiltrated Data.\n\n5.\n\nAs the data controller and owner of the Website, ACCA owed the Protection Obligation\nin respect of the Exfiltrated Data as well. The Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that\nACCA discharged this obligation by (i) carrying out a due diligence assessment of\nFCPL’s data protection policies and practices before their engagement, and (ii) by\nstipulating data protection requirements in its contract when engaging with FCPL.\n\n\f6.\n\nTaking into account the circumstances of the case, and in particular the factors below,\nthe Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found ACCA not in breach of\nthe PDPA and decided to issue a Warning to FCPL:\n\na.

On 16 October 2020, St Joseph’s Institution International Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) informed the Personal Data Protection Commission that a file\nlisting the personal data of 3155 parents and students (“the File”) was found\non a website called VirusTotal (the “Incident”).\n2. The Incident occurred on or around 13 October 2020 when a staff of the\nOrganisation downloaded and deployed a Google Chrome browser extension\ndeveloped by VirusTotal for additional security scanning. Unknown to the staff,\napart from security scanning, the extension also forwarded scanned samples\nto premium members of VirusTotal (the “3rd Parties”) for security analysis and\nresearch. This use of samples was made known in VirusTotal’s privacy policy\ncovering the use of the extension.\n3. As a result of the Incident, the personal data of 3155 individuals including both\nparents and students were put at risk of unauthorised access. The personal\ndata affected included the names of parents and students, parents’ email\naddresses, students’ date of birth, students’ classes, students’ year and grades.\n4. Users of the VirusTotal Chrome extension would have to agree to VirusTotal’s\nPrivacy Policy, which provides that once files are uploaded to the VirusTotal\nwebsite for scanning, copies of these files will be kept by VirusTotal and shared\nwith their subscribers for research purposes. The risk of such file sharing and\nin turn disclosure of personal data to 3rd Parties ought to have been known to\nthe said staff of the Organisation, but was overlooked due to oversight. Such\noversight could have been prevented if the Organisation had sufficiently robust\nprocesses for assessing such risks prior to deploying downloaded software,\nincluding Chrome Extensions. However, the Organisation lacked such\nprocesses.\n\n\f5. Nevertheless, the Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the effects of the\nbreach by contacting VirusTotal immediately to remove the File and notified all\naffected individuals. While personal data was disclosed, it was limited to\npremium members of VirusTotal for research purposes only.\n6. On the facts, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found the\nOrganisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012. However, in consideration of the limited risk\nof personal data being disclosed, and the Organisation’s commitment to\nimprove its processes, a Warning was issued to the Organisation.\n7. The Commission reminds all organisations that they must have sufficiently\nrobust processes to obtain a functional understanding of software to be\ndeployed, in order to assess the security risks to personal data in their\npossession or control.

The\nOrganisation only discovered the matter on 8 September 2020 when a member of the\nOrganisation performed a Google search of another member’s name and found a Google\nsearch result of the File.\n\n\f3.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that there were no access controls to the sub-directory prior\nto the incident as the sub-directory was intended to be accessible to public. As a result,\nthe File was indexed by search engines and showed up in online search results. The\nOrganisation also admitted that at the time of the incident, the Organisation had not\ndeveloped any internal policies and practices to ensure compliance with the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”). In particular, there was no system of checks for\nthe uploading of files on the Organisation’s website.\n\n4.\n\nFortuitously, it appeared that the access to the File was minimal – based on Google\nAnalytics Report, save for the Organisation’s member who discovered the File on the\ninternet on 8 September 2020, there was only one other access to the File on 9 December\n2019, and the access only lasted for approximately 1 minute.\n\n5.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Organisation disabled the search engine indexing to the subdirectory, password-protected all files with members’ data, and implemented a weekly\ncheck of all files uploaded onto the website to detect any accidental uploading of\nincorrect files; and a policy to delete files that are on the website for more than three\nmonths. The Organisation has also informed the Commission that it intends to engage a\nconsultant to conduct PDPA training for its staff, as well as to review the data protection\nprocesses within the Organisation to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n\n6.\n\nIn view of the facts stated at [3] above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data\nProtection found the Organisation in breach of section 12 of the PDPA (the obligation to\n\n\fdevelop and implement data protection policies and practices), and section 24 of the\nPDPA (the obligation to protect personal data in an organisation’s possession or under\nits control by making reasonable security arrangements).\n\n7.\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\nPDPA, the following factors were taken into account:\n\n(a) The Organisations had voluntarily notified the Commission of the incident, fully\ncooperated with the Commission’s investigations and implemented prompt remedial\nmeasures to address the breach; and\n\n(b) There was minimal access to the File and no evidence that the personal data had been\nmisused.\n\n8.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner would not be imposing any financial\npenalty on the Organisation. However, in light of the Organisation’s lack of the necessary\ndata protection policies and practices, the Deputy Commissioner hereby directs the\nOrganisation to:\n\n(a) Develop and implement internal data protection policies and practices to comply\nwith the provisions of the Act within 90 days from the date of the direction, and\n\n(b) Inform the Commission within 1 week of implementation of the above.\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $29,000 was imposed on Tripartite Alliance for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of approximately 20,000 individuals’ and companies’ data stored in its customer relationship system database.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Social Service","Ransomware","Scope of Duties","Third Party Vendor"],"date":"2021-04-15","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Tripartite-Alliance-Limited---16032021.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Tripartite Alliance","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-tripartite-alliance","timestamp":"2021-04-15","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2003-B6000\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTripartite Alliance Limited\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1.\n\nOn 3 March 2020, Tripartite Alliance Limited (the “Organisation”) notified the Personal\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that a server hosting its customer\nrelationship management (“CRM”) system was infected with ransomware on or around\n17 February 2020.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. In this regard, the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision. It\nalso admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the\n“PDPA”).\n\nThe Incident\n3.\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of promoting fair and progressive employment\npractices, as well as providing mediation and advice in employment–related disputes.\n1\n\n\f4.\n\nThe CRM system is a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solution provided by a software\nservice provider engaged by the Organisation (the “Vendor”). The Organisation uses the\nCRM system to handle employment-related enquiries, feedback and complaints.\n\n5.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the CRM system contained approximately 12,000 individuals’\nand 8,000 companies’ data (including information of the companies’ representatives).\nThe types of data affected for each individual varied, but may include an individual’s\nname, identification number, contact number, email address, age, race, marital status,\nsalary and compensation amount (if applicable).\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 February 2020, the CRM system was unavailable to users. The Vendor managed\nto restore the CRM system from a back-up copy within the next three hours.\n\n7.\n\nUpon investigations, the Organisation determined that the CRM system suffered a\nransomware attack. In particular, security logs obtained from the Vendor showed that\nhacking attempts were made on the database server between 7 and 14 February 2020.\n\n8.\n\nThe Organisation claimed that it had, since June 2019, expanded the scope of the IT\nservices procured from the Vendor to include security monitoring services for the CRM\nsystem, such as the blocking of cyber-attacks based on alerts. However, there was\ninadequate process put in place to ensure that the Vendor proactively monitor the alerts\nand take actions to block malicious activities in a timely manner. Nevertheless, the\n2\n\n\fOrganisation accepts that it had the responsibility to ensure that the Vendor had the same\nunderstanding on its duty of care under the monitoring services contract and to oversee\nand supervise the work of the Vendor through clear instructions on regular reporting and\nupdates by the Vendor.\n\n9.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Organisation started close monitoring of the Vendor’s IT\nservices support on a weekly basis to ensure timely update of patches and follow-ups on\nsecurity alerts received. The Organisation also undertook an organisation-wide review to\nstrengthen its management of all its third-party IT service providers, such as requesting\nthese service providers to conduct cybersecurity audits, vulnerability assessment and\npenetration testing for the Organisation’s existing IT systems. The Organisation also\ninformed the Commission that it will be migrating to a new CRM system and is currently\nworking to terminate the existing CRM system.\n\n10.\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the database in the CRM system was\nnot protected by encryption at the time of the incident, which made the database\nvulnerable for exposure. However, there was no evidence that the hacker had exfiltrated\nthe database.\n\nThe Organisation’s Admission and the Commission’s Decision\n11.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had breached the Protection Obligation under section\n24 of the PDPA in failing to ensure that the Vendor had duly discharged its contractual\ndata protection obligations. In particular, the Organisation admitted that it had not\n3\n\n\fmonitored the Vendor’s performance to ensure that the Vendor met the required\ninformation security standards.\n\n12.\n\nAs stated in previous decisions by the Commission1, organisations have to give proper\ninstructions and exercise reasonable oversight over their vendors to ensure that their\noutsourced providers are indeed delivering the services contracted. Without reasonable\noversight, the risk from any failure will fall on the organisation. In the circumstances, the\nCommissioner found that the Organisation was in breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n13.\n\nAs for the Vendor, it was a SaaS provider who provided the CRM system, including\nmaintenance support, and security monitoring services. These services did not entail the\nprocessing of personal data. As such, the Vendor was not a “data intermediary” of the\nOrganisation. Accordingly, the Vendor was not responsible for the protection of the\nindividuals’ personal data under the PDPA in respect of the incident.\n\n14.\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation for the breach, the\nCommissioner took into account the following factors:\n\n1\n\nSee for example, Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and Ors [2016] SGPDPC 19, Re Royal Caribbean Cruises\n(Asia) Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 5, and Re SCAL Academy Pte. Ltd. [2020] SGPDPC 2.\n\n4\n\n\fAggravating\n(a) The high number of affected individuals, which is approximately 20,000;\n(b) The nature of the affected data. In particular, the database contained details of\nemployment-related complaints and disputes. Individuals would expect a high level\nof confidence when they convey such matters to the Organisation for handling;\n\nMitigating\n(c) The Organisation’s upfront admission of breach of the Protection Obligation, and the\nprompt remedial actions to mitigate the effects and prevent recurrence of the incident;\nand\n(d) There was no evidence of exfiltration of the database in the CRM system.\n\n15.\n\nOn account of the above, the Organisation is directed to pay a financial penalty of\n$29,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction. In view of the remedial action of\nthe Organisation, the Commission will not be issuing any other directions.\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Jigyasa was found in breach of the PDPA.

The Reports were generated based on survey results collected by the\nOrganisation via its web application (the “Web Application”) and stored in a folder on\nthe server which hosted the Web Application. Reports documented 360 degree feedback\non employees of the Organisation’s clients, based on evaluation by their subordinates,\nsupervisors and/or peers. The feedback included character qualities, for example\nwhether they were considered fair, honest, reliable and trusted, demonstrated\nprofessional behaviour at all times or had good technical knowledge. Each of these\ncharacter qualities was given an average rating from a scale of 1 to 10, with 9-10 being\nan exceptional strength and 1-2 being below expectations. These Reports\ncomprehensively set out such information for each named individual employee of the\nOrganisation’s clients. There is also a section which provides verbatim comments from\nrespondents (e.g. “handle more complex responsibilities”, “slower support”). Some of\nthe Reports also included individual employees’ qualities, such as leadership, integrity,\ndecision-making, initiative, and professional disposition, ranked against their\ncolleagues.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nOn 10 July 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived complaints from 3 individuals (the “Complainants”) alleging that when they\nsearched their names on the Internet, the search results included links to copies of their\n360 Feedback Reports, and these reports were accessible through the links (the\n“Incident”).\n\n4\n\nWhen notifying the Commission, the Complainants stated that they expected these\nReports to be private and confidential and that the disclosure of their 360 Degree\nFeedback Report would have a significant impact on their job prospects and career\noptions. One of the Complainants alleged that as the industry the Complainant worked\nin is “extremely niche”, “this could be the reason [he has] not been successful in his\njob interviews over the past 2 years”. No evidence was adduced to support such claims.\nNevertheless, the possibility that the information contained in the Reports may have\nbeen accessed by a prospective employer’s human resource personnel as they\nconducted due diligence on job applications cannot be discounted.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation did not appear to be familiar with the security arrangements of its\nWebsite and was not able to provide clear accounts on what led to the Incident during\nthe course of the investigation. In this regard, it was noted that the Organisation had\nceased the use of the Web Application in 2010, some 7 years before the Commission’s\ninvestigation. The Organisation initially claimed that it did not know that when a client\nrequested for a 360 Feedback Report using the Web Application, a copy of the Report\nwould be saved on the Organisation’s system as a PDF file. It claimed that the Report\nwas dynamically generated by the Web Application and presented for viewing, without\nstoring a copy on the Website. However, when the operation of the Web Application\nwas demonstrated to it, the Organisation agreed that the Reports could have been\ncreated but disclaimed knowledge of this. It also maintained that the data should have\nbeen removed from the server when that particular version of the Web Application was\ndiscontinued in 2010. In this regard, the Organisation’s explanation was that “[the Web\nApplication] and all its data should have been removed, but I am not sure if [the Web\nApplication] is still in the server”.\n\n3\n\n\f6\n\nIn relation to how the Reports became publicly accessible, the Organisation’s version\nof events is that the webpages containing the Reports (the “Webpages”) were\ninadvertently created on or around February 2017 during the redesign of the\nOrganisation’s Website. The Organisation had engaged an independent developer (the\n“Developer”) to redesign its Website by changing it from HTML to WordPress. The\nDeveloper provided a test URL to the Organisation to confirm that the Website was\ndesigned according to the latter’s instructions. The Organisation did so, but did not\ndetect that the Webpages had been created. According to the Organisation, during the\nredesign process, password protection for the Reports was not implemented even\nthough this was implemented previously. On balance, the Organisation is given the\nbenefit of doubt and its position that the Reports were made publicly accessible as a\nresult of the redesign is accepted. The complaint to the Commission (on 10 July 2017),\nwas submitted not long after the redesigning of the Website in or around February 2017,\nand to the Commission’s knowledge, there had not been any complaints prior to this. If\nthe earlier version of the Website did not implement any form of access control, any\none of the employees of the Organisation’s clients who had used the system would\nlikely have raised this as an issue and the Organisation would have had to rectify it.\n\n7\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the webpages contained Reports relating to 671 employees\nof the Organisation’s clients (the “Affected Individuals”). Depending on the type of\nReport, the information therein (collectively, “Personal Data”) may have included:\n(a)\n\nthe names of the Affected Individuals;\n\n(b)\n\nthe name and addresses of the Affected Individuals’ employers;\n\n(c)\n\nappraisals of the Affected Individuals’ work performance by subordinates,\n\nsupervisors and/or peers;\n(d)\n\nthe Affected Individuals’ 360 Feedback scores; and\n\n(e)\n\nan indication of whether the Affected Individuals were top performers within\n\ntheir respective organisations.\n\n4\n\n\fRemedial Measures\n8\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident by the Commission, the Organisation undertook the\nfollowing remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nmoved the Reports to password-protected locations and subsequently deleted\n\nReports prepared for former clients;\n(b)\n\nrequested the service provider hosting the Website (the “Webhost”) to provide\n\nthe Organisation with the access logs for the Webpages;\n(c)\n\nengaged a developer to scan the Website and find out whether there were more\n\nwebpages containing Reports which were accessible through the Internet without any\naccess restrictions; and\n(d)\n\nrequested the Webhost to conduct an audit of all web based applications and\n\nintroduce enhanced security monitoring to prevent any lapses.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had breached section 24 of the PDPA\n9\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires organisations\nto protect personal data in their possession or under their control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks. Although the Organisation had\nengaged the Developer to redesign the Website, the Developer did not process any\npersonal data on behalf of the Organisation. The Organisation managed the Website on\nits own and retained full responsibility for the IT security of the Website and the\nPersonal Data.\n\n10\n\nFirst, as stated in paragraph 5 above, the Organisation demonstrated a lack of\nknowledge as to the security arrangements of its Website, in particular, the creation and\nstorage of the Reports, and had been under the mistaken impression that the Personal\nData had been removed from the server when the previous Website was discontinued.\nIn order to fulfil its Protection Obligation, the Organisation is required to, at the very\n5\n\n\fleast, be aware of how and where it stores personal data in order to implement measures\nto protect such data. In this regard, the Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised\n10 July 2018) states that:\n“5.7 Personal Data Inventory\n5.7.1 Organisations and any engaged IT vendors should keep track of where the collected\npersonal data is stored, and should impose a limit on how long the data is kept, or regularly\nreview their need to continue storing the personal data.\n5.7.2 If the personal data is no longer required, organisations and any engaged IT vendors should\nthen ensure that the personal data is anonymised or disposed of in such a way that it cannot be\nrecovered.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n11\n\nSecondly, the Organisation did not give any specific instructions to the Developer to\nprotect personal data or on security arrangements of its Website during the redesign\nprocess. The engagement was done over a short email exchange, and the Organisation\ncould not produce the contract or evidence of any written instructions to the Developer\non security arrangements. It had relied solely on the goodwill and integrity of the\nDeveloper to conduct the redesign properly, without any documentation, supervision or\nother means of control.\n\n12\n\nWhile the Organisation claimed that the Developer was engaged to merely change the\n“look and feel” of the Website, the facts suggest that the redesign of the Website was a\nmore involved project which required a significant amount of coding work and\namounted to building a new Website. In this regard, the Developer had expressly\ninformed the Organisation that the scope of work involved the need to redesign the\nWebsite on the WordPress environment instead of using the HTML coding of the\nexisting Website and required the existing content on the Website to be migrated. This\nis not merely a redesign of the look-and-feel of the Website, but a redevelopment. Thus,\nthe Organisation should have provided the Developer with clear instructions to ensure\nthat no personal data was subject to unauthorised disclosure or access as a result of the\nredesign.\n\n6\n\n\f13\n\nAccording to the Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (at [4.2]):\n“4.2.1 Organisations should emphasise the need for personal data protection to their IT\nvendors, by making it part of their contractual terms. The contract should also state clearly the\nresponsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the PDPA. When discussing the scope of the\noutsourced work, organisations should consider whether the IT vendor’s scope of work will\ninclude any of the following:\n\n\nRequiring that IT vendors consider how the personal data should be handled as part\nof the design and layout of the website.\n\n\n\nPlanning and developing the website in a way that ensures that it does not contain\nany web application vulnerabilities that could expose the personal data of\nindividuals collected, stored or accessed via the website through the Internet.\n\n…”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n14\n\nThe Commission has also taken a similar position in Re Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5,\nin which the organisation was unaware of its obligations under the PDPA and showed\na lack of knowledge of the security arrangements over its website. Specifically, the\norganisation in that case did not, inter alia, communicate any specific security\nrequirements to its developer to protect the personal data stored on the website’s server\n(including ensuring that the personal data would not be accessible to the public).\n\n15\n\nThirdly, the Organisation failed to conduct vulnerability scans or any other form of\nsecurity testing for the Website. As set out in the Guide on Building Websites for SMEs\n(at [5.6]):\n“5.6 Security Testing\n5.6.1 Testing the website for security vulnerabilities is an important aspect of ensuring the\nsecurity of the website. Penetration testing or vulnerability assessments should be conducted\nprior to making the website accessible to the public, as well as on a periodical basis (e.g.\nannually). Any discovered vulnerabilities should be reviewed and promptly fixed to prevent\ndata breaches.\n\n7\n\n\f5.6.2 Where organisations have outsourced the development of its website, they should either\nrequire the IT vendor(s) to conduct the above security testing, or arrange for a cybersecurity\nvendor to do so. As a baseline, organisations may wish to consider using the Open Web\nApplication Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide and the OWASP Application Security\nVerification Standard (ASVS) to verify that security requirements for the website have been\nmet.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n16\n\nIn Re InfoCorp Technologies Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 17, the Commission took the\nview that the organisation’s failure to conduct web application vulnerability scans was\na breach of section 24 of the PDPA, and that given the sensitivity of the personal data\nwhich the documents contained, it was unreasonable that the organisation had omitted\nsecurity testing prior to the launch of the website. Also, in Re WTS Automotive Services\nPte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26, the Commission emphasised the need for regular review\nof security arrangements and tests to detect vulnerabilities, it stated (at [18]) that:\n“… [t]he Commission also recognises that personal data of individuals may be exposed if the\nwebsite or database in which it is stored contains vulnerabilities. There needs to be a regular\nreview to ensure that the website collecting personal data and the electronic database storing\nthe personal data has reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. The Commission\nconsiders that it is good practice for an organisation to “conduct regular ICT security audits,\nscans and tests to detect vulnerabilities…”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n17\n\nIn this case, even if the Organisation was unaware that the Reports were being created\nand stored, had the Organisation conducted vulnerability scans as a form of security\ntesting on its Website prior to the redesigned Website going live or at any time after\nthat, the fact that the folders contained Reports with personal data and the fact that the\nReports were publicly-accessible would likely have been detected and could have been\nremedied. As a result, the Organisation was unable to assess whether the folders ought\nto have been restricted. It also did not consider whether any webpages which were\ncreated as part of the redesign of its Website were correctly created.\n\n8\n\n\f18\n\nThe foregoing lapses demonstrate a fundamental lack of care by the Organisation over\nthe personal data in its possession and/or under its control. It is clear that the\nOrganisation had not applied its mind to its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\nwith respect to implementing adequate security arrangements to protect the Reports. In\nview of the above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA.\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA\n19\n\nSection 11(3) of the PDPA requires organisations to designate one or more individuals,\ntypically referred to as the data protection officer (“DPO”) to be responsible for\nensuring the organisations’ compliance with the PDPA. Section 12 of the PDPA\nrequires organisations to, inter alia, develop and implement policies and practices that\nare necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA (“Data\nProtection Policies”), and to communicate information about such policies and\npractices to its staff.\n\n20\n\nIn the course of the Commission’s investigations, the Organisation admitted that it was\nunaware of the data protection provisions of the PDPA and was under the impression\nthat the PDPA only relates to the Do-Not-Call provisions. Hence, the Organisation did\nnot appoint a DPO or develop and implement any Data Protection Policies. In this\nregard, it is a trite principle of law that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Hence, the\nOrganisation’s lack of awareness of its obligations under the PDPA is not an excuse for\ncontravening the PDPA.\n\n21\n\nThe Organisation also admitted that, at the time of the Incident, it only had certain\nunwritten policies with respect to the protection of client data, which were\ncommunicated to its employees. In this regard, it is important to reiterate that an\norganisation’s Data Protection Policies should be documented in a written policy, as\nper Re Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [14]:\n“[t]he lack of a written policy is a big drawback to the protection of personal data. Without\nhaving a policy in writing, employees and staff would not have a reference for the\nOrganisation’s policies and practices which they are to follow in order to protect personal data.\nSuch policies and practices would be ineffective if passed on by word of mouth, and indeed, the\n\n9\n\n\fOrganisation may run the risk of the policies and practices being passed on incorrectly. Having\na written policy is conducive to the conduct of internal training, which is a necessary component\nof an internal data protection programme.”\n\n22\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had also\nbreached sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\n\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n\n23\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations on the\n\namount of financial penalty that was to be imposed. The Organisation raised the following\nfactors for consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Commission should not have placed such significant weight on the Personal\n\nData in the Reports that was exposed in the Incident. In this regard, the Personal Data\nin the Reports should not be accorded the status of sensitive personal data and treated\nas an aggravating factor because:\n(i)\n\nThe\n\nReports\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\ncontain\n\nthe\n\nAffected\n\nIndividual’s\n\nidentification/NRIC number, health data or biometric data. The identifying\npersonal data was limited to the name of the Affected Individuals and the name\nof his/her employer; and\n(ii)\n\nThe feedback data in the Reports would not fall within the realm of what\n\nwould typically be known as sensitive personal data as defined in Articles 9 and\n10 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”);\n(b)\n\nAny aggravating weight to be given to the disclosure of the Reports must be\n\nreduced by the fact that evaluative purpose exception in the PDPA permits a prospective\nemployer to obtain such feedback or evaluative information without consent of the\nAffected Individuals. The Organisation posited that the evaluative purpose exception\ntempers the extent of breach or application of the Protection Obligation because\ndisclosure is permitted so long as the exception applies;\n(c)\n\nThe possibility of a member of the public specifically carrying out keyword\n\nsearches of the names of Affected Individuals during the period when the specific URL\nlinks leading to the Reports had been exposed would not be high;\n10\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe Reports were not more recent than the year 2010. As the Incident occurred\n\nin 2017, the accuracy of the contents of the Reports would have waned with the\neffluxion of time, and this could be a point taken into consideration by a prospective\nemployer;\n(e)\n\nIn past decisions, the Commission has taken into consideration the financial\n\ncircumstances of an organisation in determining the financial penalty (if any) to be\nimposed. The financial penalty that the Commissioner intended to impose would have\na crushing burden on the Organisation, and cause undue hardship. Further, taking into\nconsideration the type of personal data and the potential harm to the Affected\nIndividuals, the proposed financial penalty would be disproportionately higher than\nwhat had been imposed on organisations in previous decisions; and\n(f)\n\nThe Incident was a one-off occurrence and there was no evidence that the\n\nWebsite was otherwise insecure. During the past 16 over years that the Organisation\nhas been in business, there were no other complaints in relation to unauthorised\ndisclosure of personal data.\n24\n\nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations on the nature of the Personal Data in\nthe Reports at [23(a)], Singapore’s legislative approach to determining the sensitivity\nof personal data is different from jurisdictions like the European Union. Unlike the\nGDPR, the PDPA does not have a definition of sensitive personal data. It is\ninappropriate to draw comparisons with the GDPR approach to defining sensitivity of\npersonal data as the jurisprudential basis of GDPR is markedly different from the PDPA.\nThe Commission’s approach in each case is to assess the nature of the personal data in\nquestion, taking into account specific circumstances such as the context in which the\ndata was collected and the potential risk of harm due to unauthorised access or\ndisclosure.\n\n25\n\nThe Organisation’s representations on the evaluative purpose exception at [23(b)]\ncannot be accepted. The fact that personal data that may be collected, used or disclosed\nunder an exception to consent cannot ipso facto be equated with an inference that the\nclass of personal data is less sensitive and need not be protected, or that there is less\nculpability for a failure to protect. It is necessary to examine the nature of the exception\nand the raison d’etre for its existence. The following analysis is confined to the\n11\n\n\fevaluative purpose and is not intended to establish any special rule for personal data\ncovered by other exceptions.\n(a)\n\nThe PDPA recognises that there is a class of personal data that exists for an\n\nevaluative purpose. A perusal of its definition discloses that the categories of activities\nare characterised by the need for full disclosure and frank discussions in order to arrive\nat a decision to, for example, employ, promote or dismiss a person, amongst a list of\nother circumstances that circumscribe this purpose.1 The recognition of the need for\nfull disclosure and frank discussions is carried through in a number of exceptions,\nwhich permit personal data to be collected, used and disclosed without consent. 2\nFurther, personal data in the nature of opinion data kept solely for an evaluative purpose\nis exempted from the access and correction requirements. 3 The upshot of these\nexceptions is to recognise the necessity to preserve the space for full disclosure of\nrelevant personal data and frank exchanges of views between persons who are tasked\nto conduct an evaluation before making a decision or recommendations leading to a\ndecision.\n(b)\n\nGiven the nature of the evaluative purpose exceptions and their raison d’etre, it\n\nis necessary to ensure that organisations accord personal data that is covered by the\nevaluative purpose exceptions with a higher degree of protection. The quid pro quo for\norganisations having the liberty to collect, use and disclose personal data without\nconsent for evaluative purposes, and to keep opinion data beyond the reach of data\nsubjects for access and correction, is that they are expected to put in place more robust\nmeasures to comply with the Protection Obligation. In other words, personal data that\nis kept for an evaluative purpose should be treated as sensitive data and be protected to\na greater degree.\n\nSee definition of “evaluative purpose” in section 2 of the PDPA. See also Section 29(3) of New Zealand’s\nPrivacy Act 1993 which has a similar definition of “evaluative material” for the purposes of a refusal to disclose\npersonal information pursuant to Principle 6 (Access to personal information).\n2\nSee para 1(f) of the Second Schedule, para 1(f) of the Third Schedule and para 1(h) of the Fourth Schedule of\nthe PDPA.\n3\nSee para 1(a) of the Fifth Schedule and para 1(a) of the Sixth Schedule of the PDPA respectively. See also\nSection 29(1)(b) of New Zealand’s Privacy Act 1993 which permits an agency to refuse to disclose personal\ninformation pursuant to Principle 6 if (i) the disclosure of the information or of information identifying the\nperson who supplied it, being evaluative material, would breach an express or implied promise (i) which was\nmade to the person who supplied the information; and (ii) which was to the effect that the information or the\nidentity of the person who supplied it or both would be held in confidence.\n1\n\n12\n\n\f(c)\n\nFurther, the Incident in the present case involved the risk of unauthorised\n\ndisclosure to the world at large whereas the evaluative purpose exception is much\nnarrower in scope (i.e. it permits disclosure of personal data without consent to specific\nindividual(s)/organisation(s) only where it is necessary for evaluative purposes). The\nexpectations of persons who provided the 360-degree feedback would have been for\ntheir feedback to be accessed by persons with a role in evaluating the performance of\nthe employee under review. It would be difficult, by any stretch of imagination, for\nthem to accept that their feedback was accessible by the world at large.\n26\n\nThe possibility of actual unauthorised disclosure raised by the Organisation at [23(c)]\nhad already been taken into consideration in determining the financial penalty that was\nto be imposed. While the risk of actual unauthorised disclosure may have not been high,\nthe fact that the Reports were exposed to the risk of unauthorised access and disclosure\nfor more than 7 years (between 2009 to 2017) is particularly glaring.\n\n27\n\nAs for the accuracy of the contents of the Reports at [23(d)], the passage of\napproximately 7 years is unlikely to make a significant difference to the potential harm\nsuffered by the Affected Individuals due to unauthorised access or disclosure of the\nReports, or dampen the expectations of the persons who provided feedback as discussed\nin [25(c)].\n\n28\n\nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations comparing the present case to earlier\ndecisions at [23(e)], it needs only be said that each decision is based on the unique facts\nof that case. The decision in each case takes into consideration the specific facts of the\ncase so as to ensure that the decision and direction(s) are fair and appropriate for that\nparticular organisation.\n\n29\n\nThe fact that the Incident may have been the Organisation’s first data breach is not a\nmitigating factor. Conversely, if the Incident was a repeated contravention by the\nOrganisation of the Protection Obligation, this would likely weigh in favour of a higher\nfinancial penalty.\n\n30\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has decided to\nreduce the financial penalty to the amount set out at [33(a)]. The quantum of financial\npenalty has been determined after due consideration of the appropriate weight to be\n13\n\n\fgiven to the aggravating factors at [32], the Organisation’s financial circumstances and\nto avoid imposing a crushing burden on the Organisation. Although a lower financial\npenalty has been imposed in this case, this is exceptional and should not be taken as\nsetting any precedent for future cases.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n31\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\nPDPA, the Commissioner took into account, as a mitigating factor, the fact that the\nOrganisation had promptly taken the remedial measures set out above (at [8]).\n\n32\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following aggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Personal Data in the Reports were sensitive in nature as they included data\n\non the assessment of the Affected Individuals’ work performance and unauthorised\naccess of such data could potentially result in harm to the individuals concerned (for\nexample, the individuals’ future employment prospects may be affected);\n(b)\n\nthe Personal Data in the Reports was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access\n\nand disclosure for a period of more than 7 years; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation showed a lack of awareness of its obligations under the PDPA\n\neven though it processes large volumes of sensitive personal data in the course of its\nbusiness.\n33\n\nHaving carefully considered the facts and circumstances of this case and the above\nmitigating and aggravating, the Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nTo pay a financial penalty of $90,000 within 30 days of the date of this direction,\n\nfailing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full;\n(b)\n\nto appoint a DPO within 30 days from the date of this direction; and\n\n14\n\n\f(c)\n\nto develop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the\n\nOrganisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA, and communicate them to its\nstaff, within 30 days of the date of this direction.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n15\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on Iapps for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of some users of the ActiveSG mobile application.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Information and Communications","Code deployment","Wrong Environment"],"date":"2021-03-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Iapps-Pte-Ltd---10022021.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Iapps","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/03/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-iapps","timestamp":"2021-03-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2021] SGPDPC 1\nCase No DP-1903-B3441\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nIapps Pte Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n[2021] SGPDPC 1\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No DP-1903-B3441\n10 February 2021\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 1 March 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a complaint from an individual (the “Complainant”)\nin relation to potential unauthorised disclosure of his personal data through the\nActiveSG mobile application (the “ActiveSG App”). The Complainant’s\nconcerns arose because he was able to view another individual’s personal data\nwhen he logged into his child’s supplementary account on the ActiveSG App\n(the “Incident”)\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nActiveSG is a national movement for sports coordinated by Sport\n\nSingapore,1 a statutory board of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.\nIapps Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) is a financial technology company\nspecialising in mobile application development and marketing. Sport Singapore\nengaged the Organisation to develop, deploy and operate the Super Sports Club\nMembership Management System (“SSCMMS”). The functions of SSCMMS\nincluded membership registration, and the ActiveSG App was a component of\n\n1\n\nSport Singapore was formerly known as Singapore Sports Council.\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nthe SSCMMS. Members of ActiveSG could use the ActiveSG App to book sport\nfacilities, register for fitness classes and purchase entry passes to ActiveSG\nsport centres.\n3\n\nSport Singapore is the owner of the SSCMMS and ActiveSG App.\n\nPursuant to the written contract between the Organisation and Sport Singapore,\nthe Organisation’s scope of work included providing and operating the\nproduction server for the ActiveSG app. The Organisation also developed,\ndeployed and operated the SSCMMS (including the ActiveSG App).\n4\n\nOn 1 March 2019, the Organisation’s engineer developed a security code\n\nfix for the ActiveSG App. The security code fix was meant to be deployed into\nthe enterprise environment (which was a test environment) for further testing.\nHowever, due to human error, the security code fix was deployed into the\nproduction environment, resulting in the Incident.\n5\n\nAccording to the Organisation, the personal data of 153 individuals (the\n\n“At Risk Individuals”) had been at risk of unauthorised access by 84\nindividuals during the Incident. Out of the At Risk Individuals, there was actual\nunauthorised access of 108 individuals’ (including 9 minors below the age of\n18) (the “Affected Individuals”) names and NRIC numbers (“Disclosed\nData”) by 84 individuals who were able to view this information when logging\ninto their own accounts on the ActiveSG App. For 6 of the Affected Individuals,\nin addition to the Disclosed Data, there was also actual unauthorised access of\nadditional personal data, including (collectively, the “Additional Disclosed\nData”):\n(a)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(b)\n\nMobile telephone number;\n\n2\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n6\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\n(c)\n\nHome telephone number;\n\n(d)\n\nAddress;\n\n(e)\n\nGender;\n\n(f)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(g)\n\nRace;\n\n(h)\n\nEmployment status; and\n\n(i)\n\nSports Interests.\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident on the same day, the Organisation\n\nimmediately took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nRectified the issue within 2 hours of the Incident;\n\n(b)\n\nReminded its staff to be careful and vigilant in the course of their\n\nwork; and\n(c)\n\nTogether with Sport Singapore, implemented the following\n\nmeasures:\n(i)\n\nSeparated the enterprise environment and production\n\nenvironment that were previously on the same server;\n(ii)\n\nPut\n\nin\n\nplace\n\n2-factor\n\nauthentication\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s engineers to access the production environment.\nThis means that the engineers are required to obtain the 2-factor\none-time password from Sport Singapore to access the\nproduction environment;\n\n3\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\n(iii)\n\nMonitoring of affected users for suspicious activities;\n\nand\n(iv)\n7\n\nImplemented dynamic QR codes for member IDs.\n\nSport Singapore also notified the Affected Individuals about the\n\nIncident.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nThere is the preliminary issue of whether the Organisation was a data\n\nintermediary for Sport Singapore, and whether it could avail itself of the\nexception under the previous section 4(1)(c) of the of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).2\n9\n\nEffective 1 February 2021, the exclusion in section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA\n\nhas been amended to be limited to “public agencies” only. Organisations acting\non behalf of public agencies in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of\npublic data (even when in an agency relationship of the type described below),\nare now subject to obligations under the PDPA, and cannot claim to be excluded\nfrom the same.\n10\n\nAs the Incident in this case occurred prior to 1 February 2021, the\n\napplicability of the exclusion under the previous section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA\nremains to be considered. However, the Commission makes clear that this\nexclusion will not be applicable or considered in future cases.\n\nPrior to 1 February 2021, section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA provided that “any public agency or an\norganisation in the course of acting on behalf of a public agency in relation to the collection,\nuse or disclosure of personal data is not subject to the obligations under Parts III to VI of the\nPDPA”\n2\n\n4\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n11\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nThe exclusion in the previous section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA for\n\norganisations acting on behalf of public agencies was based on the legal concept\nof agency i.e. where the organisation was authorised by a public agency to act\nin its place, as its agent, and the agent manifested assent or otherwise consented\nto so act.3 Whether an agency relationship was created in any particular case is\nessentially a question of fact. Relevant factors to take into consideration when\ndetermining whether an agency relationship arose included the communications\nbetween the parties and their conduct, as well as the terms of any relevant\ncontract.\n12\n\nThe underlying question in each case was whether the organisation was\n\nauthorised to act on behalf of the principal. The authorisation by the principal\nin an agency relationship is usually made expressly, although it could in some\ncases be by implication from the conduct or situation of the parties. Where there\nis such authority, the acts of the agent that are within the scope of the authority\nare the acts of the principal, which would be legally liable for the acts of its\nagent.4\n13\n\nIn the present case, the Commission’s investigations revealed that the\n\nOrganisation was at all material times an independent third party vendor. There\nwas nothing in the contract between the parties which expressly authorised the\nOrganisation to act on behalf of Sport Singapore. The clauses in the contract\npointed to the Organisation being a service provider to Sport Singapore, and not\nits agent. Further, there was an indemnity clause in the contract which obliged\nthe Organisation to among others, indemnify and keep Sport Singapore fully\n\n3\n\nSee Alwie Handoyo v Tjong Very Sumitomo and anor [2013] 4 SLR 308 at [147]\n\n4\n\nSee Ong Han Ling and anor v American International Assurance Co Ltd and ors [2018] 5\nSLR 549 at [208]\n\n5\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nindemnified against all actions, claims, demands, losses, expenses arising out of\nor in connection with the performance of the contract by the Organisation. As\nexplained at [11] – [12], if the Organisation and Sport Singapore were in an\nagency relationship, acts of the agent (i.e. the Organisation) within the scope of\nauthority would be acts of the principal (i.e. Sport Singapore) who would be\nlegally liable for acts of its agent. An indemnity would therefore not be\nnecessary. The presence of the indemnity clause is evidence that the relationship\nwas not a principal-agent relationship. In addition, Sport Singapore confirmed\nthat it had never appointed the Organisation to act in its place. In the\ncircumstances, the exclusion in the previous section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA did\nnot apply to the Organisation.\n14\n\nWith respect to whether the Organisation was acting as a data\n\nintermediary, the Commission’s investigations found that the Organisation was\nengaged to carry out activities of “processing” personal data on behalf of Sport\nSingapore as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA. As mentioned at [3], the\nOrganisation’s scope of work included developing, deploying and operating the\nSSCMMS (including the ActiveSG App). In the course of operating the\nSSCMMS and the ActiveSG App, the Organisation organised and retrieved the\nDisclosed Data and the Additional Disclosed Data on the behalf of Sport\nSingapore. In addition, the Organisation also processed service requests (which\nincluded enquiries and extraction of information including the Disclosed Data\nand Additional Disclosed Data) on behalf of Sport Singapore. The Organisation\nwas therefore acting as a data intermediary of Sport Singapore\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n15\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\n\n6\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification or similar risks.\n16\n\nThe obligation to make reasonable security arrangements does not attach\n\nunless an organisation was in possession or control of personal data. In the\npresent case, the Organisation provided the production environment and\noperated the SSCMMS (including the ActiveSG App). The Organisation\ntherefore had actual possession of the Disclosed Data and Additional Disclosed\nData and control of the processing activities that they had contracted to provide.\nTherefore, prior to the Incident, they were obliged to put in place reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Disclosed Data and Additional Disclosed\nData.\n17\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation’s\n\nprocesses for the deployment of code into production and test environments\nwere not sufficiently robust to safeguard against risks of deployment of codes\ninto the wrong environment.\n(a)\n\nAccording to the Organisation, its usual code deployment\n\nprocess went through 3 stages (i) User Acceptance Testing (“UAT”);\n(ii) “enterprise environment” (i.e. test environment); and (iii) production\nenvironment.\n(b)\n\nDue to human error on the part of its engineer, the Organisation’s\n\nprocesses and procedures for the deployment of the security code fix\ninto the ActiveSG App were not followed. After the UAT was\ncompleted, the code that was meant to be deployed to the testing\nenvironment was instead deployed directly into the production\nenvironment. This is a grave and serious error with, as is evident in this\ncase, potentially severe consequences. In this regard, the Commission’s\n7\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\ninvestigations revealed that the Organisation did not have second-level\napprovals or supervisory checks in its processes for the deployment of\ncodes into the test environment. This meant there was no oversight of\nthe code deployment process nor any supervision of the actions of the\nOrganisation’s engineers after UAT was completed.\n(c)\n\nAs stated in the Commission’s previous decisions, relying solely\n\non employees to perform their duties diligently is not a sufficient\nreasonable security arrangement – organisations should take practical\nsteps to implement its policies and procedures to protect personal data,\nincluding identifying areas of high risk that require higher level of\napproval and adequate supervision.5 In the present case, the deployment\nof the security code fix into the ActiveSG App could potentially expose\nthe Disclosed Data and the Additional Disclosed Data to security risks.\nThe Organisation should have identified this risk, and implemented a\nsecond-level check to ensure that its engineers deployed the codes into\nthe correct environment. Alternatively, the Organisation could have\nautomated its processes by using development operations software that\nwould automate the correct deployment of code.\n(d)\n\nThe absence of any second-level checks in the Organisation’s\n\nprocesses for the deployment of codes and lack of any other form of\nsecurity arrangement to safeguard against risks of deployment of codes\ninto the wrong environment amounted to weak internal work process\ncontrols.\n\n5\n\nSee Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 and Re Marshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 34\n\n8\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n18\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n19\n\nAfter being notified of the Commission’s proposed decision including\n\nthe proposed financial penalty amount, the Organisation made representations\nto the Commission suggesting that (i) the Organisation had done the necessary\nto comply with section 24 of the PDPA, or (ii) that a warning ought to be\nadministered in lieu of the Commission’s proposed financial penalty. The\nOrganisation’s representations were rejected for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation contended that it did have second-level checks\n\nfor the deployment of code, and referred the Commission to its Standard\nOperating Procedure (“SOP”) for the SSCMMS. While the SOP did\ndescribe multi-level checks at the UAT stage (i.e. the first stage of\ntesting), it not dictate any second-level checks relating to the deployment\nof code into the enterprise environment, and thereafter production\nenvironment (i.e. the second and third stages). In fact, the SOP contained\nno references to deployment of code in the enterprise environment at all.\nThe Organisation failed to provide any evidence of any second-level\nchecks after UAT and before deployment of the code in production.\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation claimed that the Incident was the result of\n\nhuman error which happened “in the rush of the moment” and would not\nhave been prevented by a second level check. The Commission\ndisagrees. For the reasons stated at 17(c) and 17(d) above, the\nappropriate processes such as a second-level check or automated code\ndeployment via software should have been implemented, and would\nhave prevented the Incident. Such processes are all the more necessary\n\n9\n\n\fIapps Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nconsidering the time pressure that engineers often operate under, as\nappears to have happened in this case.\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation highlighted that it had taken prompt remedial\n\nactions after discovery of the Incident (listed at [6] above). The\nCommission accepts that the remedial action taken by the Organisation\nwas timely and sufficient. This has been taken this into consideration in\nquantifying the financial penalty imposed in this case (as set out below),\nand in deciding that no further directions need be issued to the\nOrganisation.\nFinancial Penalty\n20\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the\n\nOrganisation pursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of\nsuch financial penalty, the Commissioner took into account the factors listed at\nsection 48(6) of the PDPA, including that:\n(a)\n\nthat the Disclosed Data included the NRIC numbers of 9 minors;\n\n(b)\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation\n\ncooperated\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nCommission’s\n\ninvestigations; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation implemented prompt remedial actions (i.e. the\n\nissue was fixed within 2 hours of the Incident).\n21\n\nOn 23 July 2020, the Organisation was given notice of the\n\nCommission’s intention to impose a financial penalty of S$11,000 and was\ninvited to make representations.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1. BLS International Services Singapore Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) provides\ngovernment-to-citizen services for the High Commission of India in Singapore, such as\nvisa and consular services.\n\n2. On 7 July 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received\ninformation that the URLs of the printable version of appointment booking confirmation\nwebpages could be manipulated to access other individuals’ personal data (the “Incident”).\nThe personal data comprised the individual’s name, passport number, contact number,\nemail address, type of service request, booking date/time, appointment date/time, and\nnumber of booking applications.\n\n3. The Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. In this regard, the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision. It also\n\n\fadmitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Dara Protection Act (the\n“PDPA”).\n\n4. Investigations revealed that on 8 June 2020, which was about a month prior to the Incident,\nthe Organisation had implemented a new booking system for the High Commission of\nIndia. Under this new booking system, users who submitted a booking for an appointment\nat the High Commission of India would be provided with an URL, which led to a printable\nversion of the booking confirmation. In designing the booking system, the Organisation\nhad intended for the URLs to be encrypted. This would have made it more difficult for\npeople to manipulate the URL. However, the encryption was not done properly due to a\ncoding error. Although the Organisation had conducted some testing on the new booking\nsystem, the testing was not extensive enough to detect the error.\n\n5. Upon realising the occurrence of the Incident from the Commission on 16 July 2020, the\nOrganisation took immediate action to investigate and subsequently identified the coding\nerror. On the same day, the Organisation made changes to the booking system. It stopped\nproviding users with an URL to a printable version of their booking confirmation. Instead,\nthe booking confirmation would be sent to the user’s email account.\n\n6. The Organisation’s records showed that a total of 3,357 individuals used the new booking\nsystem from 8 June 2020 to 16 July 2020. This meant that the personal data of 3,357\nindividuals was at risk of exposure by URL manipulation.\n\n\f7. The Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found that the Organisation was\nin breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 for failing to conduct adequate testing of the booking system before it went “live”.\nDepending on how the URL encryption was implemented, URL encryption could had been\na reasonable security measure for the personal data type the Organisation was collecting.\nHowever, because the Organisation had not conducted adequate testing of the booking\nsystem before it went “live”, the Organisation did not detect the coding error, thereby\nresulting in the Incident.\n\n8. After considering the circumstances of the case, including: (i) the Organisation’s upfront\nvoluntary admission of liability which significantly reduced the time and resources required\nfor investigations; and (ii) the Organisation’s prompt remedial actions, the Deputy\nCommissioner for Personal Data Protection directs that the Organisation pays a financial\npenalty of $5,000 for the breach.\n\n9. The Organisation must make payment of the financial penalty within 30 days from the date\nof this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect\nof judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial\npenalty until it is paid in full.\n\n10.

(the “TFC”) operates an e-commerce website at\nhttps://www.thermomix.com.sg (the “Website”), retailing kitchen appliances and\naccessories.\n\n2. On 3 January 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived a complaint that a text file (the “File”) containing personal data was accessible via\nthe URL: https://thermomix.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woocommerce-orderexport-1.csv-1.txt. (the “Incident”).\n\n3. The File contained the personal data of 178 unique individuals who had purchased items\nfrom the Website. The File was accessible via the URL from 1 October 2019 until 6 January\n2020. It contained the following types of personal data (the “Personal Data”):\na. Name;\nb. Email Address;\n\n\fc. Billing Address;\nd. Shipping Address;\ne. Customer Notes (e.g. delivery instructions);\nf. Order information (such as payment status, mode of payment, and transaction ID);\ng. Product ID of items;\nh. Quantity of items ordered; and\ni. Telephone number.\n\nThe Commission’s Findings\nNo breach by Hachi as a Data Intermediary\n4. TFC had engaged Hachi Web Solutions Pte. Ltd. (“Hachi”) to re-design the Website and\nalso perform data backup and migration. Insofar as the data backup and migration activities\nare concerned, Hachi was TFC’s data intermediary. The cause of the breach, however, did\nnot relate to the data processing activities but to the Website re-design. Therefore, Hachi\nwas not in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) by virtue of its role as a data intermediary.\n\nTFC in breach of the Protection Obligation\n5. The cause of the data breach may be traced to a WordPress plugin (the “Plugin”) which\nwas installed on the Website. The Plugin contained a bug which caused the File to be\ngenerated and uploaded on the Website’s directory folder. Although this was a temporary\nfile, it was accessible to the public via the URL.\n\n\f6. TFC had used the Website to collect the personal data of individuals. At the time of the\nIncident, TFC’s database contained personal data of approximately 3,500 individuals. To\ndischarge its Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA, TFC needed to have put\nin place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data collected.\n\n7. In this case, investigations revealed that TFC had failed to discharge its obligations as data\ncontroller when engaging Hachi to undertake data processing activities. First, TFC did not\nspecify any requirements for Hachi to implement any data protection measures to be\nimplemented in the Website, whether in its contract with Hachi or other project\ndocumentation. Second, TFC did not conduct any pre-launch security testing (such as\nvulnerability assessments) on the Website. Had security testing been conducted, TFC\nwould have been able to detect the presence of the publicly accessible temporary file, even\nif it was unaware of the bug in the Plugin that caused it.\n\n8. Once it knew about the Incident, TFC and Hachi removed the Plugin and disabled the\npublic’s access to the relevant directory folder. Hachi also contacted the developers of the\nPlugin, who acknowledged the existence of the bug and fixed the bug in an updated version.\nTFC subsequently engaged a vendor to perform penetration testing and other measures to\nenhance the security of the Website.\n\n9. The Deputy Commissioner found TFC in breach of the Protection Obligation under section\n24 of the PDPA. After considering the circumstances of the Incident, including according\nmitigatory weight to TFC’s cooperation with the Commission during investigations and the\n\n\fremedial action taken by TFC after the Incident, the Deputy Commissioner directs TFC to\npay a financial penalty of $9,000 for its breach.\n\n10. TFC must make payment of the financial penalty within 30 days from the date of this\ndirection, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial\npenalty until it is paid in full.\n\n11. No further directions are required as TFC had taken actions to address the gaps in its\nsecurity arrangements.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Singapore Technologies Engineering was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to the transfer of the personal data of its Singapore-based employees to its subsidiaries based in United States.","tags":["Transfer Limitation","Not in Breach","Manufacturing","Ransomware"],"date":"2021-01-14","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision----ST-Engineering-Ltd---16112020.pdf","nature":"Transfer Limitation","title":"No Breach of the Transfer Limitation Obligation by Singapore Technologies Engineering","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2021/01/no-breach-of-the-transfer-limitation-obligation-by-singapore-technologies-engineering","timestamp":"2021-01-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\nCase No. DP-2006-B6426\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\n\nSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2006-B6426\n16 November 2020\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 10 June 2020, Singapore Technologies Engineering Limited (the\n\n“Organisation”) notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) that its subsidiary based in the United States of America\n(“USA”), VT San Antonio Aerospace Inc.

This is because they did not carry out any activities in relation to the\ncollection, use or disclosure of the Affected Individual’s Personal Data Sets in\nSingapore. The Commission will defer to the ongoing investigations by the US\nfederal law enforcement officials into VT SAA and the Organisation’s\nsubsidiaries based in the USA. The Commission’s investigations in the present\ncase focused on whether the Organisation’s transfer of the Affected Individual’s\nPersonal Data Sets from Singapore to the USA met the requirements under the\nPDPA.\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation under Section 26 of the PDPA\n6\n\nSection 26(1) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall not\n\ntransfer any personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in\naccordance with requirements prescribed under the PDPA to ensure that\norganisations provide a standard of protection to personal data so transferred\nthat is comparable to the protection under the PDPA (the “Transfer Limitation\nObligation”). The relevant requirements are prescribed in Part III of the\nPersonal Data Protection Regulations 2014 (“PDPR”). In particular:\n\n4\n\n\fSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n\n(a)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\n\nRegulation 9(1)(b) of the PDPR requires an organisation that transfers\npersonal data to a country or territory outside of Singapore to take\nappropriate steps to ensure that the recipient of personal data is bound\nby legally enforceable obligations (in accordance with Regulation 10) to\nprovide to the transferred personal data a standard of protection that is\nat least comparable to that under the PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\nRegulation 10(1)(c) of the PDPR provides that such legally enforceable\nobligations include, amongst other things, any binding corporate rules\nin accordance with Regulation 10(3) of the PDPR; and\n\n(c)\n\nRegulation 10(3) of the PDPR provides that such binding corporate rules\nmust require every recipient of the transferred personal data to provide\na standard of protection for the transferred personal data that is\ncomparable to that of the PDPA, and must specify (i) the recipients of\nthe transferred personal data to which the binding corporate rules apply;\n(ii) the countries and territories to which the personal data may be\ntransferred under the binding corporate rules; and (iii) the rights and\nobligations provided by the binding corporate rules. Further such\nbinding corporate rules may only be used by recipients that are related\nto the transferring organisation.\n\nWhether the Organisation complied with the Transfer Limitation Obligation\n7\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation had\n\ncomplied with the Transfer Limitation Obligation for the reasons explained\nbelow.\n8\n\nAt the material time, the Organisation had put in place binding corporate\n\nrules set out in the St Engineering’s Group Binding Corporate Rules for\n\n5\n\n\fSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\n\nTransfers of Personal Data (PDP-04) (“BCRs”), which met the requirements of\nRegulation 9(1)(b) read together with Regulations 10(1)(c) and 10(3) of the\nPDPR:\n(a)\n\nThe BCRs were applicable to and legally binding upon all of the\nOrganisation’s direct and indirect subsidiaries worldwide (each a\n“Group Company” and collectively, the “Group”), concerning the\ntransfers (including international transfers) of personal data within the\nGroup;\n\n(b)\n\nThe BCRs specified the countries and territories to which personal data\nmay be transferred (which included the USA);\n\n(c)\n\nEach Group Company that received transferred personal data was bound\nby legally enforceable obligations to provide a standard of protection for\nthe personal data transferred that is at least comparable to the protection\nunder the PDPA. In particular:\n“5.6\n\nThe Receiving Company shall protect the transferred Personal\n\nData in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or other similar risks to the\ntransferred Personal Data.\n\n6.1\n\nEach Group Company warrants and undertakes that it has\n\nimplemented and maintained appropriate security, technological and\norganisational measures in accordance with the Group Company’s\nlegal obligations under the PDPA or other applicable Data Protection\nLaws to protect Personal Data and to prevent unauthorised access,\n\n6\n\n\fSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\n\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or other\nsimilar risks to the transferred Personal Data.”\n(d)\n\nRights and obligations provided by the BCRs are specified. These\nincluded the permitted purposes for transfer of personal data, data\nprotection obligations of the receiving company, and protection and\nsecurity of personal data. The permitted purposes set out in the following\nclauses in the BCRs included the purposes of transfer of the Affected\nIndividual’s Personal Data Sets at [3]\n“1.\n\nManaging or terminating the employment relationship …\n\n… (xvii) Preparing and making travel arrangements for employees’\nwork or business travel (including visa applications, transport and\naccommodation arrangements) …\n… 2.\n\nEvaluative purposes …\n\n… (iii) Evaluation for secondment / transfer of employment to another\nentity within the Group / for extension of contract (for contract staff) /\ntermination / redundancy / restructuring …\n… 3.\n\nGroup’s business operations, including the Group’s internal\n\nbusiness management, administration and operations: …\n… (vi) Submission to government agencies and authorities for permits\nand approvals …\n… (xiii) To facilitate security clearance / entry access into premises of\ncustomers, vendors, consultants and other business partners”.\n9\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant circumstances and for the\n\nreasons set out above, I find that the Organisation complied with the Transfer\n\n7\n\n\fSingapore Technologies Engineering Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 21\n\nLimitation Obligation in relation to its transfer of the Affected Individual’s\nPersonal Data Sets to VT SAA and its other subsidiaries based in the USA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Water + Plants Lab for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its employees.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 9 April 2020, Water + Plants Lab Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) informed the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission of a ransomware infection that rendered the\nOrganisation’s server (the “Server”) inaccessible to the Organisation (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Incident occurred on or around 30 March 2020. Personal data of 28 employees were\nencrypted by the ransomware. The personal data affected included the employees’ name,\nNRIC/FIN/Work Permit number, address, date of birth, mobile number and photograph.\n\n3.\n\nInvestigations revealed that an employee from the Organisation had downloaded and\nopened an email attachment that contained ransomware. At the time of the Incident, the\nOrganisation had some security measures in place, for example, it had anti-virus\nprotection, and access rights and password control for the Server. It also had a good\npractice of performing regular backup of its Server, and most of the data was successfully\n\n\frestored from an external backup. The Organisation therefore suffered minimal data loss\nas a result of the Incident.\n\n4.\n\nHowever, as admitted by the Organisation, it had not carried out any patching and\nsecurity scanning of the Server in the 12 months preceding the Incident. Patching and\nregular security scanning are important security measures to prevent vulnerabilities in an\norganisation’s ICT systems which a hacker may exploit in compromising personal data.\nFor this reason, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found that the\nOrganisation had failed to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control,\nin breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n\n5.\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation installed a firewall with greater capabilities to\nprotect the Organisation against external threats, for example, possessing deeper content\ninspection capabilities to identify malware. The Organisation had also conducted staff\ntraining on personal data protection and on how to identify security threats.\n\n6.\n\nUpon consideration of the facts, including the impact from the breach, the remediation\naction taken by the Organisation and that there was no evidence of exfiltration of the data\nin the Server, the Deputy Commissioner issued a warning to the Organisation.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to R.I.S.E Aerospace for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its employees from unauthorised disclosure.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 August 2020, R.I.S.E Aerospace Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified\n\nthe\n\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware infection\nthat had rendered its network storage server inaccessible to the Organisation (the\n“Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Incident occurred on or about 23 August 2020. Personal data of 21 employees were\nencrypted by the ransomware. The personal data encrypted included the name, address,\ncontact number, NRIC number, Work Permit details, passport details. redacted bank\naccount numbers, and child’s date of birth.\n\n3.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Organisation had not implemented adequate technical\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or control, in\nparticular, the Organisation did not carry out any security scans or perform updates to\nthe server firmware despite being prompted to do so by the device manufacturer. In\n\n\faddition, the Organisation did not put in place any documented form of IT Security\npolicies such as its password policy, policies for patching and updating of the company\nserver etc. These failings had resulted in a system that had vulnerabilities which a hacker\ncould exploit by injecting ransomware into the server.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation had since discontinued the use of its network\nstorage server and to opt for cloud storage instead. Additionally, the Organisation also\ndecided to encrypt all its sensitive data and only store them on offline devices.\n\n5.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds the\nOrganisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) and took into account the following factors in\ndeciding to issue a Warning to the Organisation.\na.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 8 April 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived information that a database belonging to Hello Travel Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) was posted on an internet forum and was thus made publicly available\n(the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. In this regard, the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision. It\nalso admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Dara Protection Act (the\n“PDPA”).\n\n3.\n\nThe compromised database contained the personal data of approximately 71,002 users\nwho had created accounts at the Organisation’s website (www.havehalalwilltravel.com)\nfrom February 2015 to July 2018. The disclosed personal data included their name, email\n\n\faddress, date of birth, nationality and phone number. The table below summarises the\nnumber of affected individuals for each corresponding type of personal data disclosed:\nS/N\n\nType of Personal Data\n\nNumber of Individuals\nAffected\n\n4.\n\n1\n\nName\n\n71,002\n\n2\n\nEmail Address\n\n57,693\n\n3\n\nPhone Number\n\n453\n\n4\n\nDate of Birth\n\n946\n\n5\n\nNationality\n\n20,754\n\nThe Organisation’s internal investigations pointed to a possible hack as the cause of the\nIncident. Sometime in year 2018, the server instance which hosted the Organisation’s\nwebsite and the database became corrupted and unusable after the installation of a free\nopen source wordpress plugin. The Organisation believed that unknown parties could\nhave exploited vulnerabilities of the installed plugin at that time and exfiltrated the\ndatabase.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it did not give due attention to personal data protection\nand had neglected to put in place basic procedural and technical security arrangements\nto protect the personal data in its possession and control. As examples, it did not have the\nrelevant policies and/or protocols in place to perform regular system patching or to\nconduct security assessment and/or testing when making changes to its ICT systems.\n\n\f6.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds the\nOrganisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n7.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Organisation implemented technical measures to secure its\nsystems from potential vulnerabilities. The personal data of its members were also\nencrypted immediately. Additionally, the Organisation had engaged relevant parties to\ntake down the compromised database and informed the affected individuals of the\nIncident.\n\n8.\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation. The Deputy\nCommissioner took into account the following factors:\n\nAggravating factors\n(a) The high number of individuals affected;\n(b) The fact that personal data was exfiltrated and posted online; and\n(c) The Organisation did not put in place basic procedural and technical security\narrangements.\n\nMitigating factors\n(a) The Organisation had cooperated with the investigation;\n(b) The Organisation’s upfront voluntary admission of liability to a breach of the\nProtection Obligation under the PDPA;\n\n\f(c) The Organisation’s prompt remedial actions at [7] to address the inadequacies in\nits procedures and processes; and\n(d) There was no evidence that the personal data affected in the Incident had been\nmisused in any form.\n\n9.\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representation on the\namount of financial penalty which the Commission intends to impose and requested that\nthe financial penalty to be paid in instalments. The Organisation raised the following\nfactors for the Commission’s consideration:\n\n(a) The Organisation had been suffering substantial loss due to the impact to the\ntravel industry by the Covid-19 pandemic; and\n(b) The Organisation had already spent quite a substantial amount of money to fix\nthe security breach.\n\n10.\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Deputy Commissioner has decided\nto reduce the financial penalty to the amount set out in [11a] and is agreeable for the\nfinancial penalty to be payable in instalments. The quantum of financial penalty has been\ncalibrated after due consideration of the Organisation’s financial circumstances due to\nthe unprecedented challenges faced by businesses amid the current Covid-19 pandemic,\nbearing in mind that financial penalties imposed should not be crushing or cause undue\nhardship on organisations. Although a lower financial penalty has been imposed in this\n\n\fcase, the quantum of financial penalty should be treated as exceptional and should not be\ntaken as setting any precedent for future cases.\n\n11.\n\nTaking into account all relevant facts and circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner\nhereby directs the Organisation to:\n\n(a) Pay a financial penalty of $8,000 in 10 instalments by the due dates as set out\nbelow, failing which, the full outstanding amount shall become due and payable\nimmediately and interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full:\n\ni.\n\n1st instalment of $800 on 1 January 2021;\n\nii.\n\n2nd instalment of $800 on 1 February 2021;\n\niii.\n\n3rd instalment of $800 on 1 March 2021;\n\niv.\n\n4th instalment of $800 on 1 April 2021;\n\nv.\n\n5th instalment of $800 on 1 May 2021;\n\nvi.\n\n6th instalment of $800 on 1 June 2021;\n\nvii.\n\n7th instalment of $800 on 1 July 2021;\n\nviii.\n\n8th instalment of $800 on 1 August 2021;\n\nix.\n\n9th instalment of $800 on 1 September 2021; and\n\nx.\n\n10th instalment of $800 on 1 October 2021\n\n\f12.\n\nIn view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, the Deputy Commissioner will\nnot be issuing any other directions.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were imposed on Everlast Projects, Everlast Industries (S) and ELG Specialist for breaches of the PDPA.

The Organisations are\nowned by the same shareholder, managed by the same directors, and operate from\ncommon premises. Two of the Organisations also have a common name, “Everlast”.\nThe Organisations operated like a group of companies and centralised their payroll\nprocessing, such that the human resources (“HR”) department of EPPL was in charge\nof processing payrolls of not only its own employees, but also the employees of EIPL\nand ESPL. The Organisations’ employees’ personal data were stored in the Server,\nwhich was owned and maintained by EPPL.\n3\n\nOn 10 August 2019, EPPL discovered the Incident. EPPL had both an onsite\n\nphysical backup and a secondary cloud backup of the contents of the Server. The\nphysical backup was affected by the ransomware and rendered unusable. A total of\n384 individuals were affected by the Incident (the “Affected Employees”):\n2\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\nName of Organisation\n\nNumber of employees affected\n\nEPPL\n\n141\n\nEIPL\n\n239\n\nESPL\n\n4\n\nTotal number of individuals\n\n384\n\n4\n\nThe types of personal data of the Affected Employees that were at risk of\n\nunauthorised access included the following (collectively, the “Personal Data Sets”):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC/FIN number;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(d)\n\nBank account details; and\n\n(e)\n\nInformation relating to salary.\n\n5\n\nThe cause of the ransomware infection was not identified. EPPL’s\n\ninvestigations could not determine how the ransomware gained entry to the Server.\nEPPL was also unable to confirm whether any of the Personal Data Sets had been\nexfiltrated as a result of the Incident. Upon discovery of the Incident, EPPL took prompt\nremedial action by ceasing to use the Server immediately.\n6\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n7\n\nThe two issues to be determined in this case are as follows:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisations had each complied with their obligations under\nsection 12 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”); and\n\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisations had each complied with their obligations under\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n3\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\nWhether EPPL, EIPL and ESPL had each complied with their obligations under section\n12 of the PDPA\n8\n\nSection 12 of the PDPA requires organisations to, inter alia, develop and\n\nimplement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its\nobligations under the PDPA, and to communicate information about such policies and\npractices to its staff (the “Accountability Obligation”).\n9\n\nIn this regard, it is important to reiterate that an organisation’s Data Protection\n\nPolicies should be documented in a written policy, as per Re Furnituremart.sg [2017]\nSGPDPC 7 at [14]:\n“[t]he lack of a written policy is a big drawback to the protection of personal data. Without having\na policy in writing, employees and staff would not have a reference for the Organisation’s policies\nand practices which they are to follow in order to protect personal data. Such policies and\npractices would be ineffective if passed on by word of mouth, and indeed, the Organisation may\nrun the risk of the policies and practices being passed on incorrectly. Having a written policy is\nconducive to the conduct of internal training, which is a necessary component of an internal data\nprotection programme.”\n\n10\n\nAs mentioned at [2], EPPL, EIPL and ESPL operated as a group of companies\n\nin the sharing of payroll processing services, which are centralised within the HR\ndepartment of EPPL. The Commission recognises the commercial benefits which arise\nfrom centralising common corporate functions within a group of companies. In such\nsituations, one entity (the “Servicing Organisation”) provides corporate services to\nother entities in the same corporate group (each a “Contracting Organisation”). If\nthe shared common corporate services involve the processing of personal data, the\nServicing Organisation would be acting as a data intermediary for each Contracting\nOrganisation.1\n11\n\nThe common corporate service shared by the Organisations in the present case\n\nwas the payroll processing function. EIPL and ESPL were therefore permitted to\ncollect, without consent, their respective Affected Employees’ Personal Data Sets and\n\n1\n\nSee the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 2 June 2020) at [6.28].\n\n4\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\ndisclose the same to EPPL for the purposes of managing the employment\nrelationship.2 In these circumstances, EPPL was:\n(a)\n\nA data controller with respect to its own Affected Employees’ Personal\n\nData Sets; and\n(b)\n\nEIPL and ESPL’s data intermediary with respect to their respective\n\nAffected Employees’ Personal Data Sets that EPPL was processing on their\nbehalf.\n12\n\nThe Organisations admitted that they did not have any written data protection\n\npolicies and relied only on verbal instructions to employees. Although the\nOrganisations are in the construction industry and, in this case, do not typically collect\npersonal data from customers, the Accountability Obligation required the\nOrganisations to put in place data protection policies in relation to the protection of\npersonal data of their respective employees.\n13\n\nIn this regard, organisations operating as a group of companies may comply\n\nwith the Accountability Obligation through binding group-level written policies or intragroup agreements that set out a common and binding standard for the protection of\npersonal data across all organisations in the same corporate group. These binding\ngroup-level written policies or intra-group agreements are akin to binding corporate\nrules (“BCRs”) imposed by an organisation on its overseas recipient of the personal\ndata (in compliance with the Transfer Limitation Obligation under Section 26(1) of the\nPDPA), which oblige the overseas recipient to provide a standard of protection to the\ntransferred personal data that is at least comparable to that under the PDPA. 3 Where\nthe corporate group is a multinational corporation (“MNC”) and the Contracting\nOrganisation transfers personal data to an overseas Servicing Organisation, the\nbinding group-level written policies, intra-group agreements or BCRs which meet the\n\n2\n\nSee Second Schedule of the PDPA, para 1(o) and Fourth Schedule of the PDPA, para 1(s).\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation under Section 26 of the PDPA requires an organisation that transfers\npersonal data to a country or territory outside of Singapore to take appropriate steps to ensure that the\nrecipient of personal data is bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide to the transferred personal\ndata a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that under the PDPA.\n3\n\n5\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\nrequirements of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA4 would also\nmeet the requirements of section 26(1) of the PDPA in relation to the Protection\nObligation.5\n14\n\nIn the present case, the Organisations did not have any such binding group-\n\nlevel written policies, intra-group agreements or BCRs. In the circumstances, I find\neach of EPPL, EIPL and ESPL in breach of the Accountability Obligation.\nWhether EPPL, EIPL and ESPL had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n15\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\nsimilar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). The obligation to make reasonable security\narrangements does not attach unless the organisation is in possession or control of\npersonal data.\n16\n\nAs mentioned at [10], EPPL was (i) a data controller with respect to its own\n\nAffected Employees’ Personal Data Sets; and (ii) EIPL and ESPL’s data intermediary\nwith respect to their Affected Employees’ Personal Data Sets that EPPL was\nprocessing on their behalf. In this regard, EPPL, EIPL and ESPL had possession\nand/or control of the Affected Employees’ Personal Data Sets at the material time.\n(a)\n\nEPPL was in possession and control of the Affected Employees’ Personal Data\nSets. This was because the Organisations’ payroll processing functions were\ncentralised within the HR department of EPPL.\n\n(b)\n\nWhile EIPL and ESPL did not have possession of their respective Affected\nEmployees’ Personal Data Sets because they were centrally hosted on EPPL’s\nServer, I find that EIPL and ESPL remained in control of their respective Affected\nEmployees’ Personal Data Sets as data controllers. This is because the\n\n4\n5\n\nThe Protection Obligation is explained at paragraph 14.\nSee, for illustration, Re Cigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V. [2019] SGPDPC 18 at [13].\n\n6\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\nprocessing of EIPL’s and ESPL’s Affected Employees Personal Data Sets by\nEPPL was for EIPL’s and ESPL’s respective business purposes.6\n17\n\nEach of the Organisations were therefore obliged to put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Affected Employees Personal Data Sets,\nincluding preventing the risk of unauthorised modification. In the present case, the\nCommission’s investigations into the Incident revealed that the ransomware had\nencrypted all the files in the Server and its physical backup, including the Affected\nEmployees’ Personal Data Sets. The unauthorised modification of the Affected\nEmployees’ Personal Data Sets by the ransomware made it unreadable and unusable.\n18\n\nIt is well established that a data controller should have in place a written contract\n\nwith its data intermediary that clearly specifies the data intermediaries’ obligation to\nprotect personal data. 7 That said, the relationship between the Organisations is a\nrelevant factor in determining the reasonable security measures expected of them to\ncomply with the Protection Obligation. In this regard, for a group of companies, the\nwritten contract requirement between a Servicing Organisation and the Contracting\nOrganisation may be met by binding group-level written policies, intra-group\nagreements or BCRs as discussed at [13] above.\n19\n\nIn addition to a written agreement specifying data protection requirements, a\n\nContracting Organisation should also implement operational processes so as to be\nable to exercise some form of supervision or control over the activities of the Servicing\nOrganisation when it processes personal data on the Contracting Organisation’s\nbehalf.8 Where the Servicing Organisation has specialised knowledge, skills and/or\ntools for processing personal data, having a robust audit framework could be an\nappropriate form of oversight. This may be particularly suited for MNCs which typically\n\n6\n\nSee Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and another [2016] SGPDPC 22 at [17] – [18]; Re AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte\nLtd [2018] SGPDPC 8 at [18].\n7\n\nSee the Commission’s Guide on Data Protection Clauses for Agreements relating to the Processing of Personal\nData (20 July 2016) at [4]; Re Singapore Telecommunications Limited [2017] PDPC 4 at [14]\n8\nThe Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 2 June 2020) at [17.5] provides\nthat “[e]nsuring that IT service providers are able to provide the requisite standard of IT security” is an\nexample of a technical measure an organisation may use to protect personal data.\n\n7\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\nconduct periodic internal and/or external audits and assessments to monitor\ncompliance by each organisation within the corporate group.9 Conversely, small and\nmedium-sized enterprises that only operate in Singapore are less likely to conduct\nsuch compliance audits on each organisation in the corporate group in the areas of\ncybersecurity and/or data protection. In such situations, appropriate oversight could\ninvolve more simple processes. For example, requiring the Servicing Organisation to\nexplain to the Contracting Organisation the measures which would be taken to secure\npersonal data, with appropriate documentation to evidence this process (e.g. written\nacknowledgement given by the Contracting Organisation to the Servicing\nOrganisation), and provide regular reports showing that it has put these processes in\nplace.\n20\n\nIn the present case, both EIPL and ESPL failed to put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to ensure that EPPL (who was their data intermediary for the\npurposes of payroll processing) would protect their respective Affected Employees’\nPersonal Data Sets. There was no written contract, intra-group agreement or grouplevel written policies/BCRs setting out data protection requirements that EPPL was\nobliged to comply with when processing EIPL’s and ESPL’s respective Affected\nEmployees’ Personal Data Sets. Notwithstanding that the Organisations conducted\ntheir business operations from the same premises, both EIPL and ESPL also did not\nimplement any operational processes to supervise or exercise some form control over\nEPPL to ensure EPPL protected their Affected Employees’ Personal Data Sets. In the\ncircumstances, I find each of EIPL and ESPL in breach of the Protection Obligation.\n21\n\nEPPL was also obliged to comply with the Protection Obligation. As mentioned\n\nin [10], it was: (i) a data controller with respect to its own Affected Employees’ Personal\nData Sets; and (ii) EIPL and ESPL’s data intermediary with respect to their Affected\nEmployees’ Personal Data Sets. The Commission’s Investigations revealed that EPPL\ndid not put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data\nSets as explained below:\n\n9\n\nAs an example, see Re Cigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V. [2019] SGPDPC 18 at [7(c)].\n\n8\n\n\fEverlast Projects Pte Ltd & Others\n\n(a)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 20\n\nEPPL did not install a firewall for the Server. Without a firewall, the Server and\ncorporate network was vulnerable to web-based security threats;10\n\n(b)\n\nEPPL did not conduct periodic security reviews of its IT systems, including\nvulnerability scans of the Server, to assess the overall security of its IT\ninfrastructure. The requirement for organisations to conduct periodic security\nreviews of its IT systems has been emphasized in previous decisions. 11\nConducting regular information and communication technology (“ICT”) security\naudits, scans and tests to detect vulnerabilities help organisations to ensure\nthat ICT security controls developed and configured for the protection of\npersonal data are properly implemented. 12 The comprehensiveness of such\nsecurity reviews should be scoped based on the organisation’s assessment of\nits data protection needs, and be conducted to a reasonable standard. The\nscope and level of the review would depend on the type of personal data to be\nprotected. In this case, as the Personal Data Sets included personal data of a\nfinancial nature (e.g. information relating to bank accounts and salaries), a\nhigher standard of periodic security review was required of EPPL in order to\ncomply with the Protection Obligation. If EPPL had conducted a security review\nof its IT system to a reasonable standard, it would have discovered the absence\nof a firewall for the Server; and\n\n(c)\n\nEPPL was unable to provide any written IT security policies (e.g. password\npolicy, policies for patching and updating of the company server, etc.). 13 In this\nregard, EPPL conceded that they did not know what was required in order to\nprotect personal data in electronic form.\n\n10\n\nThe Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (20 January 2017) at [9.1] states as\nfollows: “It is important for an organisation to ensure that its corporate computer networks are secure.\nVulnerabilities in the network may allow cyber intrusion, which may lead to theft or unauthorised use of\nelectronic personal data. Defences that may be used to improve the security of networks include: […]\nFirewalls”.\n11\nSee, for example, Re WTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.

Ltd.\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nNovelship Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) operates an e-commerce website for\nindividuals to sell or buy luxury brands of streetwear (the “Website”). To create\na buyer or seller account on the Website, individuals would have to provide their\npersonal data to the Organisation. The Organisation does not, in usual course,\nreveal the personal data it had collected to any buyer or seller transacting on the\nWebsite. Instead, the Organisation, together with an external payment\nprocessor, facilitates transaction payments on behalf of the parties.\n\n2.\n\nOn 1 May 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived information that a registered seller (“User”) was able to gain\nunauthorised access to the personal data of other sellers by employing software\ntools and manipulating the public URLs of active listings (“the “Incident”).\n\n3.\n\nThe User had accessed the personal data of six unique sellers who had active\nlistings at the time of the Incident. The personal data concerned included: (i) first\nand last names; (ii) email addresses; (iii) shipping addresses; (iv) hashed\naccount passwords; and (v) the name of bank and bank account numbers\n(“Personal Data Sets”). No buyer data was accessed in the Incident.\n\n4.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Organisation had not conducted adequate\nsecurity testing before the launch of the Website. The testing it had conducted\nwas limited to design and functionality issues, such as verifying the password\nhashing and password requirement functions. Critically, the Organisation\nshould have—but had not—conducted vulnerability scanning. Vulnerability\nscanning that is reasonably and competently conducted should include scanning\nfor OWASP Top Ten, i.e. the top 10 security vulnerabilities listed by the Open\nWeb Application Security Project (“OWASP”). The vulnerability of URLs to\nmanipulation is within the OWASP Top 10, and would have been detected if the\nOrganisation had conducted adequate vulnerability testing.\n\n\f5.\n\nThe Commission understands that not every organisation is equipped with\nadequate knowledge of cyber security risks or the ability to conduct security\ntesting. However, the obligation of organisations to protect the personal data they\ncollect and process online cannot depend on their subjective familiarity with the\nsecurity risks or ability to prevent them. Organisations are expected to engage\nqualified competent parties, where reasonably needed, to assist them to\ndischarge their obligation to protect personal data. When doing so, organisations\ncan refer on the technical advice and expertise of their service provider, but\nremain ultimately responsible for articulating the business risks they wish to avoid\nand business outcomes that they seek to achieve.\n\n6.\n\nSimilarly, the Commission recognises that organisations may face financial,\nmanpower and technical limitations. These limitations are relevant in establishing\nthe reasonableness of decisions they have taken, but cannot allow an\norganisation to justify providing a level of protection that is below what is\nreasonable for the type of personal data it collects and processes.\n\n7.\n\nAccordingly, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds the\nOrganisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012.\n\n8.\n\nHaving considered the representations made by the Organisation and the\nmaterial factors, in particular:\n(a)\n\nthe sellers’ personal data would have been at risk of unauthorised access\nfor a period of eight months (from the time the sellers were first allowed to\nsell on the Website, to the date remedial actions were taken);\n\n(b)\n\nthere was actual unauthorised access of the Personal Data Sets of six\nindividuals by the User;\n\n(c)\n\nthe remedial measures taken by the Organisation upon being made aware\nof the Incident; which included fixing the vulnerability to ensure that the\nsellers’ personal data would no longer be accessible to unauthorised\npersons, redacting all user information relating to bank information, and the\nOrganisation committing to developing a new website; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe adverse impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the Organisation’s\nbusiness;\n\nthe Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection directs that the\nOrganisation pays a financial penalty of S$4,000 for the contravention.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 April 2020, Roche Singapore Pte Ltd (“Roche”) informed the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data security incident involving its\nformer vendor, Worksmartly Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”). Roche had detected an\nunauthorised disclosure of their employees’ data on GitHub repository (“GitHub”) on 3\nMarch 2020 (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited decision procedure. In this regard, the Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision. It also admitted\nthat it was in breach of sections 24 and 25 of the Personal Data Protection Act (the\n“PDPA”).\n\n\fBackground\n3.\n\nThe Organisation was engaged by Roche in 2017 to provide finance and payroll\nprocessing services. In order for the Organisation to provide the said services, Roche\nhanded over its employees’ personal data to the Organisation. The contract between the\nparties was subsequently terminated, and the Organisation’s last day of service was 31\nDecember 2018.\n\nThe Incident\n4.\n\nOn or around 28 February 2020, one of the Organisation’s employees uploaded a file on\nthe Organisation’s GitHub account (the “File”). When doing so, the employee changed\nthe setting of the GitHub account from “private” to “public” under the mistaken belief\nthat the File would only be accessible to other members of the Organisation. In fact, the\nchange in setting had resulted in the File being accessible to the public.\n\n5.\n\nThe File contained the personal data of 308 individuals, which comprised Roche’s\ncurrent and former employees (the “Employees”), and their dependents (the\n“Dependents”). The personal data included:\na.\n\nFor the Employees: name, NRIC/FIN/Passport number, address, date of birth,\nrace, citizenship, employee ID, Roche email address, role title, employment\ncommencement date, salary, bank account name and numbers and name of bank;\nand\n\nb.\n\nFor the Dependents: name, NRIC/FIN/Passport number, date of birth and contact\nnumber.\n\n\f6.\n\nThe File was used for data migration during the initial service engagement in 2017. The\nFile was supposed to have been deleted—along with other files containing Roche’s\nemployees’ data—before the Organisation’s last day of service, i.e. 31 December 2018.\nHowever, because the File was stored in a different folder from the other files, the\nOrganisation had inadvertently omitted to delete the File. This led to the File being\nexposed to the public when the Organisation’s employee set the GitHub folder’s setting\nto “public” as stated at [4] above.\n\n7.\n\nThe File was exposed to the public for a period of five days from 28 February 2020 to 3\nMarch 2020. Based on GitHub’s logs, the repository containing the File was accessed 23\ntimes and downloaded 11 times during this time.\n\nThe Contraventions\n8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it lacked checks to manage the correct security settings\nof its GitHub account and had relied solely on employees to do the right thing. The\nOrganisation also admitted that it had not conducted the necessary housekeeping and\nmaintenance of files, which resulted in retaining the File when it was no longer required\nfor business or legal purposes.\n\n9.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds the\nOrganisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 and Retention\nObligation under section 25 of the PDPA.\n\n\f10.\n\nUpon realising the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\na.\n\nImmediately set the GitHub access to “private” and deleted the File;\n\nb.\n\nReset the passwords for all the databases and servers;\n\nc.\n\nConducted housekeeping to ensure removal of obsolete files from GitHub;\n\nd.\n\nDirected its GitHub account administrator to always set the repositories to\n“private” and introduced a disciplinary framework for the mishandling of its\nGitHub accounts.\n\nThe Decision\n11.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection notes that the Organisation had\nadmitted to a breach of Protection and Retention Obligations under the PDPA, and had\ncooperated with the Commission’s investigation and taken prompt remedial action.\n\n12.\n\nOn account of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection directs\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $5,000 within 30 days from the date of this\ndirection (failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until the financial penalty is paid in full).\n\n13.\n\nIn view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, the Commission will not be\nissuing any other directions.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $20,000 was imposed on Times Software, a data intermediary, for: (i) failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of  personal data belonging to the employees of its clients; and (ii) retaining personal data which was no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.

Between January and February 2018,\nthree organisations which directly or indirectly used Times’ services became aware\nthat the personal data of some their current and former employees (the “Employee\nData”) had been exposed online from Times’ servers and could be found using the\nGoogle search engine (the “Incident”). These three organisations were Dentons\nRodyk & Davidson LLP (“Dentons”), Red Hat Asia Pacific Pte Ltd (“Red Hat”) and\nLiberty Specialty Markets Singapore Pte Limited (“LIU”). Each of these organisations\nsubmitted a data breach notification to the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) after the Incident.\nThe Facts\nThe Relationship between the Parties and how Times had obtained the Employee\nData\n2\n\nDentons had, since 2001, engaged Times to use a payroll software application\n\ndeveloped by Times (the “Payroll Software”). The Payroll Software was hosted\ninternally on Dentons’ servers. In or around November 2015, Dentons commissioned\nthe development of a new functionality of the Payroll Software which would enable\n\n1\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nDentons to create customised employee reports. Dentons provided their Employee\nData to Times to test this functionality.\n3\n\nIn December 2015 and February 2016, Red Hat and LIU respectively engaged\n\nTMF Singapore H Pte Ltd (“TMF”), a professional services company, for certain HR\nand payroll services. For this purpose, Red Hat and LIU provided TMF with their\nEmployee Data.\n4\n\nIn turn, TMF had, since 2008, engaged Times to use the Payroll Software to\n\nprovide services to its clients, including Red Hat and LIU. The Payroll Software was\nhosted on TMF’s servers. Sometime between December 2015 and February 2016,\nTMF provided Times with Red Hat and LIU’s Employee Data. The reason for doing so\nwas disputed by TMF and Times:\n(a)\n\nAccording to Times, TMF had provided the Employee Data for a one-\n\ntime exercise which involved data migration and the development of a new\nfunctionality within the Payroll Software;\n(b)\n\nIn contrast, TMF asserted that the data migration and development of a\n\nnew functionality within the Payroll Software were two separate and unconnected\nrequests to Times. In this regard, TMF claimed that it had provided the Employee\nData of Red Hat’s and LIU’s to Times only for the purposes of data migration,\nand was not aware of—and did not consent to—Times’ use of the Employee Data\nto develop the functionality.\n5\n\nThere was insufficient contemporaneous evidence to support either party’s\n\nversion of events. In particular, TMF and Times did not have a written agreement on\nthe handing over of the Employee Data which could have provided more context. In\nany event, there is no need to make a finding on which version of events is to be\nbelieved. As explained further at [36] below, the findings regarding TMF’s breach of\nits Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) are not dependent on whether TMF had consented to Times’ use of Red\nHat’s and LIU’s Employee Data to develop the functionality within the Payroll Software.\n2\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nThe Disclosure of the Employee Data\n6\n\nThe Employee Data handed over to Times by Dentons and TMF was stored in\n\nTimes’ File Server System (“FSS”). Between 21 December 2017 and 23 December\n2017, Times suffered a hard disk failure in its FSS. To remediate this, Times restored\na backup of the data in the FSS on or around 23 December 2017 and reset the FSS\noperating system settings to their default settings, which included disabling the\npassword protection feature. As the FSS was accessible over the Internet, the\nEmployee Data that was stored in the FSS was exposed to web crawlers and indexed\nby the Google search engine and stored in Google’s cache.\n7\n\nIn total, 616 employees had their Employee Data exposed over the Internet from\n\n23 December 2017 to around mid-February 2018. This number comprised 400\nemployees from Dentons, 162 employees from Red Hat, and 54 employees from LIU.\nThe types of Employee Data which was exposed during the Incident included:\n(a)\n\nFor Dentons: name, NRIC or other identification number, residential\n\naddress, contact number, work designation, duration of employment and base\nsalary;\n(b)\n\nFor Red Hat and LIU: name, NRIC or other identification number, date\n\nof birth, marital status, nationality, race, base salary, bank account information,\nincome tax account number, addresses and mobile number.\n8\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the organisations took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a)\n\nTimes:\n(i)\n\nTook action to take down all links to the Employee Data by\n\ncontacting Google and other search engines (i.e., Bing and Archive.org);\n(ii)\n\nTook all server hosting development files offline so that they were\n\nno longer available on the Internet and could only be accessed internally\nvia Local Area Network with proper authentication;\n3\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n(iii)\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nDeveloped additional policies and SOP on data handling for its\n\nemployees, which included the following requirements:\n(A)\n\nHeads of departments are now required to conduct a\n\nweekly audit to ensure sensitive files are destroyed upon\ncompletion of work;\n(B)\n\nCross-department audits are to be done on a monthly\n\nbasis, as well as upon completion of work;\n(C)\n\nRandom audits are to be done by the IT manager on a bi-\n\nmonthly basis; and\n(D)\n\nServers published online will no longer accept unencrypted\n\nfiles.\n(b)\n\nLIU:\n(i)\n\nImposed more stringent contractual provisions on TMF with\n\nregard to the services it is providing including dealing with data breaches\nor the protection of personal data;\n(ii)\n\nWorked with Times to ensure that all relevant data, including the\n\nEmployee Data, had been removed from Times’ environments;\n(iii)\n\nThe Liberty Mutual Global IT Team undertook a comprehensive\n\nsecurity review of TMF’s services; and\n(iv)\n(c)\n\nNotified all its current employees of the Incident.\n\nRed Hat:\n(i)\n\nBeing the first party to discover the breach, notified Google to take\n\ndown the Employee Data;\n(ii)\n\nNotified all current employees and former employees of the\n\nIncident and offered free credit monitoring service to the affected\nemployees; and\n4\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n(iii)\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nObtained assurance from TMF and Times that Times had\n\ndisabled the internal folder from public view, and that Times would perform\naudits to ensure all servers published on the internet that are meant for\ninternal use were password-protected.\n(d)\n\nDentons:\n(i)\n\nNotified its employees of the Incident; and\n\n(ii)\n\nObtained assurance from Times that all servers connected to the\n\nInternet were password protected.\n(e)\n\nTMF:\n(i)\n\nCeased to allow Times to retain any of its clients’ information for\n\ndevelopment purposes, and set up a UAT environment for Times for future\ndevelopment of additional functionalities.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nBreach by Times of Sections 24 and 25 of the PDPA\n9\n\nTimes was a data intermediary1 of Dentons as it processed personal data on\n\nbehalf of, and for the purposes of Dentons. As explained further at [27] below, Times\nwas also a data intermediary of TMF as it processed personal data on behalf of, and\nfor the purposes of TMF, the relevant data here being Red Hat’s and LIU’s Employee\nData.\n10\n\nA data intermediary is subject to both the Protection Obligation and the Retention\n\nLimitation Obligation under Section 242 and Section 253 of the PDPA. The\nCommission’s investigations showed that Times had breached both these obligations.\nSection 2 of the PDPA defines “data intermediary”.\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires organisations to protect personal data in their possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks.\n3\nSection 25 of the PDPA requires an organisation to cease to retain its documents containing personal data, or\nremove the means by which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is\n1\n2\n\n5\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n11\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nIn relation to the Protection Obligation, Times had breached it in two ways. First,\n\nthe processes in remediating the hard disk failure in its FSS fell short of the standard\nrequired under Section 24 of the PDPA. Times’ Standard Operating Protocol (“SOP”)\nrequired the employee who carried out the server restoration to enable the\nauthentication function, i.e. password-protect function, so that only a user with proper\ncredentials would be granted access to the data in the FSS. The employee’s\nsupervisor was also required to check that the authentication function was enabled.\nHowever, the relevant employee had failed to enable the authentication function after\nthe server restoration. This was not discovered by the employee’s supervisor as the\nsupervisor did not take any measures to confirm that the authentication function was\nenabled.\n12\n\nIt can be seen that even though Times had SOPs in place, the fact Times had\n\nnot detected the employee’s error in not enabling the authentication function shows\nthat the security arrangement was not sufficiently reasonable. As set out in Re\nMarshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 34 at [21], “relying solely on\nemployees to perform their tasks diligently is not a sufficiently reasonable security\narrangement, and the organisation would need to take proactive steps to protect\npersonal data”. Given the amount and type of personal data that Times was\nprocessing, Times should have ensured that their SOP included specific procedures\nthat were designed to reasonably detect non-compliance and to discourage deliberate,\nreckless or careless failures to adhere to the SOP by its employees.\n13\n\nSecond, Times’ other internal policies also fell short of reasonable protection\n\nexpected for an organisation that handles the amount and type of personal data that\nTimes handled:\n(a)\n\nTimes had poor password management policies in place. It was the\n\nprevailing practice of Times’ employees to set the same password to the FSS\nprior to and after a server restoration. While this may be permissible for certain\n\nreasonable to assume that the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by the\nretention of the personal data, and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.\n\n6\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nmore routine restorations in the course of operational maintenance,\norganisations should set new passwords for server access control, especially\nwhere there has been a restoration of the server after security incidents;\n(b)\n\nThe Employee Data included bank account numbers and salaries. As\n\nthe disclosure of such data may have a direct and significant impact on the\nindividuals concerned, additional measures should have been adopted by Times\nto protect such data, for example, by encrypting such data, when storing such\ndata in the FSS. This has been emphasised by the Commission in its Guide to\nSecurity Personal Data in Electronic Medium (Revised 20 January 2017); and\n(c)\n\nTimes should not have used live customer data for testing purposes. As\n\nhighlighted in the Commission’s Guide to Basic Data Anonymisation Techniques\n(Published 25 January 2018), using live personal data for testing involved risks\nas a development and/or test environment may be remotely accessed. Rather,\nTimes should have used either anonymised or synthetic data, so that testing of\nthe new functionality may be done without any risk to the personal data.4\n14\n\nAs for Retention Limitation Obligation, Times admitted that the requested tool\n\nwas implemented in December 2015 and the Employee Data of Red Hat’s and LIU’s\nImpacted Employee should have been deleted after that. In fact, Times’ SOP on\nsoftware development required employees to delete personal data once project signoff has been obtained. However, in breach of the SOP, the employee who assisted in\nthe development of the new functionality for the Payroll Software did not delete the\npersonal data provided by TMF. No checks were conducted to ensure that the SOP\nwas followed. Times had therefore contravened its Retention Limitation Obligation\nunder Section 25 of the PDPA.\n15\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, Times made representations proposing to\n\ntake full responsibility for the Incident, and for a reduction in the quantum of financial\n\n4\n\n[13] of Guide to Basic Data Anonymisation Techniques.\n\n7\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\npenalty that the Commissioner had intended to impose. Times raised the following\nfactors for consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Incident was the first data breach in Times’ 21 years of operations;\n\n(b)\n\nNo damages were reported as a result of the Incident;\n\n(c)\n\nTimes had improved their network security, conducted vulnerability\n\nassessments, and improved their SOPs to reduce human errors; and\n(d)\n16\n\nTheir business had since been adversely affected by Covid-19.\n\nTimes’ proposal to take full responsibility for the Incident does not absolve the\n\nother organisations that are also in breach. The PDPA imposes data protection\nobligations on all organisations in relation to personal data in their possession or\ncontrol, and each organisation is individually responsible to comply with these\nobligations.\n17\n\nThe other factors raised at [15(a)]-[15(d)] have were considered in mitigation. In\n\nparticular, the exceptional challenges faced by businesses amid the current Covid-19\npandemic have been taken into account, bearing in mind that financial penalties\nimposed should not be crushing or cause undue hardship on organisations.\n18\n\nAll things considered, the financial penalty imposed on Times has been reduced\n\nto $20,000 for the contravention of the Protection Obligation and Retention Limitation\nObligation of the PDPA. Although a lower financial penalty has been imposed in this\ncase, this is exceptional and should not be taken as setting any precedent for future\ncases.\nBreach by Dentons of Section 24 of the PDPA\n19\n\nSection 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation has the same obligations\n\nunder the PDPA in respect of personal data processed on its behalf by a data\nintermediary as if the personal data was processed by the organisation itself. This\n8\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nmeans that both the organisation and data intermediary each have an obligation to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data that are in their\npossession or under their control. The Commission has in previous decisions stated\nthat it is necessary for an organisation to put in place the appropriate contractual\nprovisions with its data intermediaries to set out the obligations and responsibilities of\nthe data intermediary to protect the organisation’s personal data, and the parties’\nrespective roles to protect the personal data.5\n20\n\nIn this case, it is not disputed that there was no written contract between Dentons\n\nand Times regarding the processing of the Employee Data by Times. Instead, Dentons\nrepresented that it had relied on a letter issued by Times in July 2014 (the\n“Statement”) to protect personal data as evidence in writing of the contract. The\nsalient terms of the Statement are reproduced below:\n“As a Data Intermediary, Times Software Pte Ltd has always been\ncommitted in protecting your personal data and will implement the\nfollowing standard operating procedures (SOP) to ensure that we are in\nfull compliance with the new ruling:\na) All employees of Times Software Pte Ltd (“staff”) must get\nwritten consent from the customer before retrieving any\npersonal data (such as company database or payroll related\nreports). The written consent must specify the identity and the\npurpose of usage by the applicant.\nb) Staff should not reveal, distribute or broadcast any personal\ndata that are deemed confidential by the client(s) even after\nresignation.\nc) Printed copies of clients’ confidential information or personal\ndata are not to be recycled or reused. They must be\nimmediately shredded upon completion of usage.\nd) Staff are not allowed to keep or retain any customers’\npersonal data upon completion of its intended purpose stated\nin the written consent.\ne) Any electronic copies or duplications containing sensitive\ninformation, personal data or material which are to be sent or\n5\n\nSee for example Re Cellar Door and Ors [2016] SGPDPC 22 at [15]; Re Singapore Telecommunications\nLimited [2017] PDPC 4 at [14]; Re Singapore Health Services Pte Ltd & Ors [2019] SGPDPC 3 at [59].\n\n9\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nreceived by clients via any electronic medium must be\nencrypted with a password only known to the staff and the\nclient. The password must not be in the same communicated\ne-mail or message. It should either be advised by phone\nconversation, sent in via Short Messaging Service (SMS) or\nin a separate mailer.”\n[emphasis in original]\n21\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, Dentons raised the following factors in\n\nrelation to the Statement for consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Statement is a contract between Times and Dentons that is legally\n\nbinding and fully enforceable. It contained three key commitments given by\nTimes to Dentons: (i) the commitment to protect Denton’s personal data and\nTimes’ full compliance with the PDPA; (ii) the commitment to not retain Denton’s\npersonal data upon completion of its intended purposes, and to shred such data\nupon completion of use; and (iii) the commitment to encrypt all electronic copies\nor duplications containing sensitive information or personal data which are to be\nsent or received by Dentons;\n(b)\n\nThe three commitments in the Statement mirror the obligations\n\ncontained in the template clauses in the Commission’s Guide on Data Protection\nClauses for Agreements in relating to Processing of Personal Data (Published\n20 July 2016);\n(c)\n\nWhat is reasonable must be viewed in the context and the purposes for\n\nwhich personal data was being provided. Having regard to the scope and context\nof Denton’s engagement with Times, any other contractual obligations in addition\nto the Statement would be superfluous, and place an onerous and unreasonable\nburden on Dentons; and\n(d)\n\nLastly, where an adequate level of protection had been achieved in the\n\ncircumstances (of the Statement), the Commission ought not to, with the benefit\nof hindsight, impose onerous additional requirements on Dentons for not meeting\nsuch enhanced requirements.\n10\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n22\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nDentons’ representations that the Statement sufficed to discharge its Protection\n\nObligation are not accepted as Dentons had overstated the effect of the Statement.\nWhile the Statement may meet the requirement of a contract evidenced in writing, it\nsuffered from a significant flaw. The Statement omitted to cover the expected standard\nof protection for electronic storage of Employee Data. The commitments made by\nTimes in the Statement pertained only to the conduct of staff, the security of physical\ncopies of documents, and data protection (such as the need for encryption) during\nelectronic transmission. Notably, the Statement did not specify any requirements for\nor include any commitments in relation to implementing security measures for the\nelectronic storage of Employee Data, which was most relevant and paramount given\nthat the Employee Data processed by Times was in electronic form and the Employee\nData handed over by Dentons to Times was stored electronically in the FSS as\nmentioned at [6]. This was a serious omission of scope, which left the standard of\nprotection of a significant volume of electronic Employee Data unaccounted for.\n23\n\nThe data protection commitments in the Statement were incomplete and could\n\nnot reasonably be relied on by Dentons as a security arrangement to protect the\nEmployee Data that was provided to Times.\n24\n\nContrary to Dentons’ representations, the requirement for an organisation to put\n\nin place contractual provisions to ensure its data intermediary will protect personal\ndata is neither onerous nor unreasonable. In this regard, the Commission’s Guide on\nData Protection Clauses for Agreements Relating to the Processing of Personal Data\n(Published 20 July 2016) sets outs sample clauses that an organisation may adapt to\nsuit its needs. This is not an onerous process, and would not incur significant costs. In\nthis case, the Statement that was introduced into the ongoing contractual relationship\nis sufficient written evidence of the data processing contract but it suffered from a\nsignificant defect in scope as explained at [22] above.\n25\n\nAs for Dentons’ representations that the Commission should not use the benefit\n\nof hindsight to impose additional requirements on organisations, the requirement for\nan organisation to ensure that its written contract with its data intermediary clearly\n11\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nspecifies the data intermediary’s obligation to protect personal data is not new. As an\nillustration, that requirement was referred to in an earlier version of the Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (issued in September 2013),\napproximately two years before Dentons had provided its Employee Data to Times for\nprocessing.\n26\n\nFor the above reasons, the finding that Dentons had contravened the Protection\n\nObligation in failing to put in place the appropriate contractual provisions with Times\nfor the protection of their Employee Data was maintained. After taking into account the\nrelevant mitigating and aggravating factors listed at [44] below, it was decided that a\nwarning to Dentons for the breach would suffice in this case.\nBreach by TMF of Section 24 of the PDPA\n27\n\nTMF was a data intermediary of Red Hat and LIU as it was engaged to provide\n\npayroll services which involved the processing of Red Hat’s and LIU’s Employee Data.\nAs a data intermediary, TMF was subject to the Protection Obligation set out at Section\n24 of the PDPA and was required to put in place reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect Red Hat’s and LIU’s Employee Data in its possession or under its control. What\nthe “reasonable security arrangements” entail will depend on the context.\n28\n\nBased on the Commission’s preliminary findings, it appeared that subsequent to\n\nits engagement as Red Hat’s and LIU’s data intermediary, TMF had outsourced to\nTimes the processing of Red Hat’s and LIU’s Employee Data for payroll services. In\nthis scenario, Times was not only a data intermediary of TMF, but may also be referred\nto as a “subsidiary data intermediary” of Red Hat and LIU.\n29\n\nTo elaborate, the term “subsidiary data intermediary” may be used to describe\n\nan organisation who is a sub-contractor to a data intermediary, and who is subcontracted to carry out data processing activities that are directly related and\nnecessary to what the said data intermediary is supposed to undertake for an\norganisation (analogous to a data controller). As highlighted above, Times would be a\n“subsidiary data intermediary” of Red Hat and LIU if TMF had outsourced to Times the\n12\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nprocessing of Red Hat’s and LIU’s Employee Data for payroll services, because TMF\nwas supposed to have performed these tasks in the contract TMF had with Red Hat\nand LIU.\n30\n\nSubsequently, TMF clarified in its representations to the Commission’s\n\npreliminary findings that it did not sub-contract to Times any processing of Red Hat’s\nand LIU’s Employee Data for payroll services. Instead, it had provided Red Hat’s and\nLIU’s Employee Data to Times for the purposes of a one-time data migration exercise.\nAs the data migration in this case was a different set of processing activity unrelated\nto the payroll services that Red Hat and LIU had engaged TMF to provide, it would not\nbe appropriate to refer to Times as a “subsidiary data intermediary” of Red Hat and\nLIU.\n31\n\nAlthough the term “subsidiary data intermediary” may be used to describe the\n\nposition the sub-contractor is in vis-à-vis the data controller (ie, it is a “subsidiary data\nintermediary” of the data controller), the use of such a term is simply a convenient and\ninformal label to describe such sub-contractors in the context of data processing where\nsubcontracting is common. It has no legal implications; in particular, it does not mean\nthat the data controller here is responsible for its subsidiary data intermediary in the\nsame way as it does for its primary data intermediaries. This is because in many\nscenarios, the data controller may not even be aware that its primary data intermediary\nhad engaged a sub-contractor, and hence it is in no position to influence its subsidiary\ndata intermediary. Instead, in situations where there are multiple layers of subcontracting and sub-processing of personal data, there is a separate data controller\nand data intermediary relationship in each layer. The scope of data processing\noutsourced in each layer of sub-contracting is determined by the relevant contract\nwhich should also set out the data controller’s and data intermediary’s respective\nobligations to protect the personal data. Therefore, even if Times was regarded as\nRed Hat’s and LIU’s “subsidiary data intermediary” (not actually so in this case for the\nreason set out in the preceding paragraph), Red Hat and LIU would not be responsible\nfor Times as if they were Times’ data controller for the purposes of the PDPA. Times’\ndata controller here would be TMF solely.\n13\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n32\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nIndeed, TMF’s role as Times’ data controller and Red Hat’s and LIU’s data\n\nintermediary meant that TMF was subject to the Protection Obligation in putting in\nplace “reasonable security arrangements”, such as contractual mechanisms with\nTimes, to ensure that Times had the necessary safeguards to protect the Employee\nData.\n33\n\nIn this regard, it is not disputed that there was no written contract between TMF\n\nand Times regarding the processing of the Employee Data. TMF was therefore found\nin breach of the Protection Obligation in the Preliminary Decision.\n34\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, TMF made representations disputing the\n\npreliminary finding that it had breached the Protection Obligation, raising the following\nfactors for consideration:\n(a)\n\nTMF had conducted annual vendor assessments with Times, and Times\n\nhad confirmed in those assessments that it had a formal data disposal policy in\nplace, which had led TMF to incorrectly believe that none of the Employee Data\nwas retained by Times. In the circumstances, it would not be reasonable to\nexpect TMF to conduct an invasive audit of Times’ IT system to verify that the\nEmployee Data was absent; and\n(b)\n\nTMF did not ask Times to retain and use the Employee Data for the\n\ndevelopment of a new functionality within the Payroll Software. Times had done\ndo without TMF’s authorisation, and was not acting as TMF’s data intermediary\nin doing so. Accordingly, TMF should not be held responsible for Times secret\nretention of the Employee Data.\n35\n\nWhile TMF’s conduct of the annual vendor assessments is a mitigating factor\n\nthat is taken into account, it does not suffice to discharge TMF’s Protection Obligation.\nThe annual vendor assessments would only assist to check that Times had not\nretained the Employee Data unnecessarily. However, it bears repeating here that TMF\nhad not entered into any contract with Times with respect to Time’s processing of Red\nHat’s and LIU’s Employee Data on TMF’s behalf. This means that the purpose and\n14\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nscope of the processing to be undertaken by Times, as well as Times’ obligation to\nprotect the relevant Employee Data, were not clearly set out in the first place.\n36\n\nOn this note, the grounds for finding that TMF had breached the Protection\n\nObligation is primarily due to TMF’s failure to put in place the necessary contractual\nprovisions requiring Times to protect Red Hat’s and LIU’s Employee Data prior to the\ntransmission of the data during the one-time data migration exercise. Hence, it is not\nnecessary to make a finding on whether Times had used the Employee Data for the\ndevelopment of the new functionality tool. As mentioned at [4] above, TMF disputes\nthis account and there was insufficient contemporaneous evidence to support either\nparty’s version of events.\n37\n\nHaving carefully considered the facts of the case, the finding that TMF had\n\ncontravened the Protection Obligation was maintained. After taking into account the\nrelevant mitigating and aggravating factors listed at [44] below, it was determined that\na warning to TMF for the breach would suffice in this case.\nNo Breach by Red Hat and LIU\n38\n\nFor Red Hat and LIU, the question to be determined is whether they had taken\n\n“reasonable security arrangements” to protect their Employee Data when they\nprovided the Employee Data to TMF for processing.\n39\n\nRed Hat and LIU had both entered into a written contract with TMF for the\n\nprocessing of their Employee Data. Both contracts were similarly worded and imposed\na general obligation on TMF to comply with the “applicable law”, with no express\nreference to compliance with the PDPA. Both Red Hat and LIU were found to have\ncontravened the Protection Obligation in the Preliminary Decision because in addition\nto an “applicable law” clause, they ought to have put in place more detailed contractual\nprovisions setting out TMF’s obligations to protect the Employee Data (which included\nbank account and salary information).\n\n15\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n40\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, Red Hat made representations disputing\n\nthe preliminary finding that it had breached the Protection Obligation, and raised the\nfollowing factors for consideration:\n(a)\n\nAlthough the contract between Red Hat and TMF imposed only a general\n\nobligation on TMF to comply with the “applicable law”, there should be no\nambiguity that the applicable data protection law is the PDPA given that both Red\nHat and TMF are incorporated in Singapore; and\n(b)\n\nThe contract between Red Hat and TMF had to be read together with\n\nthe Master Services Agreement (“MSA”) between their parent companies. The\nMSA contained two pertinent clauses on data protection:\n“TMF and its Affiliates shall use at least the same degree of care to\nprotect the Confidential Information of Client and its Affiliations from\nunauthorised disclosure or access that TMF and its Affiliates use to\nprotect its Confidential Information but not less than reasonable care”\n(Clause 10.4 of the MSA); and\n“[T]he processing and global transmission of Data shall comply with\nApplicable Law which includes among others the binding corporate rules\nof TMF on international data transfers” (Clause 11.2 of the MSA).\n41\n\nThe provisions in the MSA meant that TMF was contractually bound to protect\n\nthe Employee Data of Red Hat with the same standard of care as its own data, and in\nany case, not less than reasonable care. TMF’s internal data protection policies are\ntherefore relevant in assessing the standard of protection that it was contractually\nrequired to put in place. In this regard, TMF’s: (i) Personal Data Protection Policy; (ii)\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation Statement; and (iii) Binding Corporate Rules for\nprocessing customer data set out comprehensive requirements on data protection.\n42\n\nThe inclusion of such terms in the contracts between TMF and Red Hat are\n\nadequate to satisfy the “reasonable security arrangements” requirement in Section 24\n\n16\n\n\fTimes Software Pte Ltd & Ors\n\n2020 SGPDPC [18]\n\nof the PDPA.

In this\nregard, the Organisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the\nfacts as set out in this Decision and that it was in breach of section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n2\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation has been engaged by the Health Sciences Authority\n\n(“HSA”) since 2013 to develop and maintain various IT systems. One of the\nprojects for which the Organisation was engaged was the development,\nmaintenance and enhancement of its queue management system (“ QMS”) for\nblood donors (the “QMS Engagement”). Pursuant to the QMS Engagement,\nHSA provided the Organisation with files containing copies (in part or\notherwise) of the Database (“Files”) for the purposes of testing and developing\nthe QMS. HSA would also provide the Organisation with copies or updates of\nthe Database (“Updates”) from time to time during the period of the QMS\nEngagement (hereinafter, the use of the phrase “Files” will include “Updates”,\nunless the context specifies otherwise).\n4\n\nThe Organisation stored the Files in a storage server that was designated\n\nfor the purposes of testing and development (the “Testing and Development\nServer”). The Testing and Development Server was accessible through the\nInternet and unsecured as it was not intended to be used to store personal data\nor other confidential information. The Server’s system was not actively patched\nor updated, the router to which the Server was connected did not have a\nperimeter firewall setup, and there were no firewalls or any other security\nprotocols to restrict access to the Server.\n5\n\nAt the material time, the Files contained registration-related information\n\n(the “Personal Data”) of about 800,000 individual blood donors (the “Affected\nIndividuals”), specifically:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC;\n\n3\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n6\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\n(c)\n\nGender;\n\n(d)\n\nHandphone number1;\n\n(e)\n\nNumber of blood donations;\n\n(f)\n\nDates of the last 3 blood donations; and\n\n(g)\n\n(In some cases) blood type, height and weight.\n\nA cybersecurity expert discovered that he could access the Personal Data\n\nin the Database through one of the Organisation’s servers. Based on the forensic\ninvestigations conducted by the Organisation, the number of records from the\nDatabase that had been exfiltrated amounted to anywhere between 236,023 to\n328,546.\n7\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident on 13 March 2019, the Organisation\n\ntook the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nDisconnected the Testing and Development Server from the\n\nInternet and removed all physical devices connected to the compromised\nports to the server;\n(b)\n\nDisabled all remote access to the Organisation’s servers to\n\nensure that all development zones were protected by firewalls;\n(c)\n\nOrganised an employee townhall session addressing the\n\nIncident;\n\n1This was based on the information provided by the Organisation.\n\n4\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n(d)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nAppointed external vendors to undertake forensic analysis of the\n\naffected servers;\n(e)\n\nIssued press releases to keep the public informed of the Incident\n\nand the status of ongoing investigations;\n(f)\n\nInformed its employees not to receive personal data from clients\n\nif it was not necessary and to escalate the receipt of personal data\n(inadvertently or otherwise) to senior management;\n(g)\n\nConducted further investigation on the security of its Internet\n\nlines and Internet-facing services;\n(h)\n\nBegan reviewing and improving its internal processes and taking\n\nsteps to enhance its cybersecurity posture, including appointing a second\nData Protection Officer, requiring employees to complete an e-learning\nprogram and identifying and remediating any gaps in protection; and\n(i)\n\nBegan reviewing its security infrastructure with the assistance of\n\nan external vendor, and implementing certain measures, including (i)\nensuring all devices used by employees are secured and the anti-virus\nsoftware installed on these devices are up-to-date, (ii) implementation\nof a Network Access Control measure, (iii) adoption of a “defence-indepth” approach (including segregation of servers containing sensitive\ninformation) and (iv) enhancement of endpoint security measures.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n5\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n8\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks. As a preliminary point, the\nOrganisation has accepted that it is a data intermediary of HSA and is required\nto comply with section 24 of the PDPA with respect to the Personal Data in its\npossession.\nWhether the Organisation Complied with Section 24\n9\n\nThe Organisation has admitted that it has breached section 24 of the\n\nPDPA by failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the\nPersonal Data.\n10\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that it had stored the Files\n\ncontaining the Database in its Testing and Development Server as it did not\nanticipate that it would be receiving actual copies of production databases from\nHSA and, as such, did not take any steps to designate any specific security\ninfrastructure set up to receive or store such data on premise.\n11\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it ought to have been aware that the Files\n\ncontained personal data even though they had not been specifically informed of\nthis by HSA. In past projects between them, the Organisation had directly\nretrieved personal data from a production environment on the servers on HSA’s\npremises for the purposes of testing and development. On this occasion, even\nthough the Files were provided by HSA to the Organisation for the QMS\nEngagement, from July to August 2018, the Organisation was given access to\nHSA’s server rooms to retrieve Updates directly from HSA’s servers, an\narrangement that made sense if the Files also contained actual personal data (as\n\n6\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nopposed to dummy data). Accordingly, the Organisation ought to have been\naware that personal data was contained in the Files, but most definitely in the\nUpdates.\n12\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation admitted that the Files should not have\n\nbeen stored on the Testing and Development Server, and this was a breach of\nthe Organisation’s own data protection policies and practices, which required\nthat personal data be protected and secured regardless of the purposes for which\nit was provided.\n13\n\nThe Organisation has accepted that there were gaps in its data\n\ngovernance and processes with respect to the receipt of test data from its clients.\n14\n\nIn view of the above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n15\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made\n\nrepresentations to request that the financial penalty as set out in [19] be paid in\nthe following manner:\n\n16\n\n(a)\n\n$60,000 within 30 days from the date of the directions; and\n\n(b)\n\n$60,000 within 7 months from the date of the directions.\n\nThe Organisation raised the following factors for the Commissioner’s\n\nconsideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation is a small medium enterprise in a highly\ncompetitive IT services industry. It has to contend with rising\n\n7\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nwage costs and increased rentals while battling depressed prices\nthat customers are willing to pay for their services;\n(b)\n\nArising out of the Incident, the Organisation has:\n(i)\n\nExpended significant resources when it appointed\n\nreputable advisors to undertake forensic activities, and sought the\nadvice and assistance of professionals to respond to the police and\nthe Commission’s investigations;\n(ii)\n\nInvested heavily to shore up its data protection and\n\ncybersecurity measures, including conducting research and\nexploring various technologies and methods which may be\ndeployed in protecting data (at rest and in transit) without\ncompromising ease of use of the data; and\n(c)\n\nPayment of the entire financial penalty of $120,000 in one lump\nsum would negatively affect the Organisation’s cash flow.\n\n17\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has\n\ndecided to reject the Organisation’s request at [15]. For the purposes of\nsupporting a request that a financial penalty be paid in instalments,\norganisations are required to furnish supporting documents on their financial\nstatus to the Commission. However, despite the Commission’s repeated\nrequests, the Organisation did not furnish its financial statements and was\nunable to provide any explanation why it could not to do so. There was therefore\nno evidence to support the Organisation’s representations on its financial status\nat [16]. If the Organisation is able to secure documentary evidence of its\nfinancial position before the due date for payment as set out at [19], it may\nsubmit another request that the financial penalty be paid in instalments.\n\n8\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n18\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under\n\nsection 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account the following\nfactors:\nMitigating factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the Commission’s\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nAs set out above, the Organisation voluntarily and unequivocally\n\nadmitted to its contravention of the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation implemented remedial actions swiftly to\n\naddress the Incident; and\nAggravating Factor\n(d)\n\nA subset of the Personal Data was subject to unauthorised access\n\nand exfiltration.\n19\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\n$120,000 within 30 days from the date of the directions, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n20\n\nThe Commissioner took the view that the remedial actions set out at\n\nparagraph [7] had sufficiently addressed the risks to the Personal Data arising\n\n9\n\n\fSecur Solutions Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 8\n\nfrom the Incident.

The recordings in question captured exchanges between\nthe company’s representative and staff of the debtor company.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nMajestic Debt Recovery Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) is a company in the business of\n\ncollecting debts on the behalf of its clients. On 22 March 2019, the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) received a complaint from the managing director (the\n“Complainant”) of a debtor company (the “Company”) stating that the Organisation had been\nengaged by the Company’s sub-contractor to recover debts from the Company. The\nComplainant stated that on or around 21 March 2019, the Organisation’s representatives (the\n“Representatives”) visited the Company’s premises to collect a debt on behalf of its client (the\n“Incident”). Not surprisingly, heated words were exchanged with the Company’s personnel\nwhen the Representatives attempted to recover the debt. The Representatives recorded video\nfootage of the exchanges with the Company’s personnel, including the Complainant (the\n“Recording”), on a tablet device. The Complainant and the Company’s personnel could be\nidentified from the images and audio captured by the Recording. According to the\nComplainant, he “protested against the taking of [the Recording and] posting it [on] social\nmedia but [the Representative] said he would do it”. The Representatives nonetheless took the\nRecording and subsequently posted it on the Organisation’s official public Facebook page (its\n“Facebook Page”).\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nDuring its investigation, the Commission found other video recordings on the\n\nFacebook Page. These videos also captured images and voices of other individuals who\nappeared to be either individual debtors or representatives of corporate debtors of the\nOrganisation’s clients.\n4\n\nBy its own admission to the Commission, the Organisation did not have any knowledge\n\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) prior to this incident and had not\ndeveloped any data protection policies or practices. The Organisation also admitted that it did\nnot have a data protection officer (“DPO”) prior to this incident.\n5\n\nUpon being notified by the Commission, the Organisation took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a)\n\nRemoved the Recording and all other videos from the Facebook Page;\n\n(b)\n\nDesignated an individual tasked with data protection matters (i.e. a DPO); and\n\n(c)\n\nAssured the Commission that it will ensure that it obtains consent in writing\n\nfrom individuals before recording and uploading their personal data onto its Facebook\nPage.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had breached section 13 of the PDPA\n6\n\nBroadly, section 13 of the PDPA prohibits organisations from collecting, using or\n\ndisclosing personal data about an individual unless the individual’s consent is obtained (either\nactual or deemed) or such collection, use or disclosure is required or authorised under the PDPA\nor any written law. As stated at [2], the Organisation recorded the video using a tablet device.\nThe incident took place at the Company’s premises, after the Representatives were met at the\nreception and brought into the office proper, which was not open to the public. The\nOrganisation posted the Recording on its Facebook Page despite the Complainant’s protests.\nThis disregard of the individual’s wishes is a breach of section 13 of the PDPA given that the\ncollection, use and disclosure of the Recording was not required or authorised under the PDPA\nor other written law.\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nIn relation to the Organisation’s assurance (noted at [5]) that it would in future obtain\n\nconsent from individuals concerned, it seems unlikely or even unconceivable that an individual\nwho owed a debt would willingly consent to be filmed by the debt collecting agency calling on\nhim, and for such recordings to be posted on social media. If such consent were obtained ex\nante by an organisation, for example at the time when the loan was first given, and the purpose\nfor posting the recording on social media is to shame the debtor, there is a real risk that this\npurpose may not be one which a reasonable person would consider appropriate under section\n18 of the PDPA; or that consent thus obtained is vitiated under section 14(3), as having been\nobtained through unfair, or deceptive or misleading practices.\n8\n\nHowever, this is not to say that the capturing of personal data through video will never\n\nbe appropriate or in compliance with the PDPA. As an example, a security company may wish\nto equip its security officers with body worn cameras to ensure that its officers are exercising\ntheir duties in a responsible and lawful manner and their interactions with the public adhere to\ntheir code of conduct. Any organisation that wishes to implement such a practice has to be\naccountable and should ensure that it has sound legal basis to do so. Additionally, it will need\nto put clear guidelines and policies in place for its employees in relation to their conduct and\nthe use of such cameras and the video footage captured. In developing such guidelines and\npolicies, such organisations should ensure that the use of these recording devices are in\ncompliance with the PDPA and have measures and controls in place to ensure that these\nguidelines and policies are adhered to.\nWhether the Organisation had breached sections 12 and 11(3) of the PDPA\n9\n\nSection 12 of the PDPA requires organisations to, inter alia, develop and implement\n\npolicies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations under the\nPDPA, and section 11(3) of the PDPA requires organisations to designate one or more\nindividuals (i.e. the DPO) to be responsible for ensuring the organisations’ compliance with\nthe PDPA.\n10\n\nBy nature of its business, the Organisation would be in possession and/or control of\n\nvarious personal data, including those of its employees and its clients’ debtors or the debtors’\nemployees. As stated at [3], the Organisation admitted that it did not have any knowledge of\n\n4\n\n\fthe PDPA prior to being notified by the Commission over this incident, did not have any data\nprotection policies or practices, and had not appointed a DPO.\n11\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Organisation was also in breach of sections 11(3) and 12\n\nof the PDPA.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n\n12\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations regarding\n\nthe findings as set out at [6]. The Organisation raised the following factors:\n(a)\n\nWhen the Representatives visited the Company to recover debts on various\n\noccasions prior to the Incident they had made video recordings of those visits without\nany objections from the Company; and\n(b)\n\nAccording to the Organisation, it had “video proof” of the Complainant\n\nconsenting to the Organisation posting video recordings of the Representative’s visits\nto the Company on its Facebook Page.\n13\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, I maintain the finding that the\n\nOrganisation was in breach of Section 13 of the PDPA for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was unable to provide any evidence to support its assertion\n\nthat there had been consent by the Company on previous occasions to the Organisation\nvideo recording the Representatives’ visits to the Company’s premises. The\nOrganisation was also unable to provide the “video proof” referred to at [12(b)];\n(b)\n\nEven if consent had been obtained previously, section 16(1) of the PDPA\n\nprovides that on giving reasonable notice to the organisation, an individual may at any\ntime withdraw any consent given, or deemed to have been given in respect of the\ncollection, use or disclosure by that organisation of personal data about the individual\nfor any purpose. As mentioned at [2], the Complainant had expressly objected to the\nvideo recording and the subsequent posting of the video on the Facebook Page. In the\ncircumstances, I find that even if consent was given previously as asserted by the\nOrganisation at [12], it had been withdrawn by virtue of the Complainant’s express\n5\n\n\fobjections at the material time. Accordingly, the Organisation did not have consent to\npost the Recording on its Facebook Page; and\n(c)\n\nFurthermore, even if consent had been obtained to post the video recording on\n\nsocial media to shame the debtor, I have grave doubts if the consent will stand up to\nscrutiny under section 14(2) of the PDPA, which vitiates consent obtained through\nunfair, and deceptive or misleading practices. For example, if consent to post video\nrecordings made during debt recovery attempts was made a condition of obtaining the\nloan, it could possibly go beyond what is reasonable in order to provide the loan: see\nsection 14(2)(a). Consent obtained through such unfair practice is vitiated by section\n14(3). Neither would such a purpose be one which a reasonable person — on an\nobjective standard — would likely consider to be appropriate under section 18 of the\nPDPA.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n14\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\n\nPDPA, I took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative and forthcoming in the course of\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial action after being notified by the\n\nCommission; and\n(c)\n\nthere was no evidence of any further unauthorised use of the personal data\n\ncaptured in the Recording.\n15\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, I hereby direct the\n\nOrganisation to:\n(a)\n\npay a financial penalty of $7,500 within 30 days from the date of this direction,\n\nfailing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full;\n\n6\n\n\f(b)\n\ndevelop and implement policies and practices which are necessary for its\n\ncompliance with the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nput in place a program of compulsory training for its employees on compliance\n\nwith the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n7\n\n\f","decision":"Directions, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Security Masters for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of building visitors’ mobile numbers.

However, structured training is needed to help its security\npersonnel understand the importance of protecting the personal data they handled daily\nin their duties, such as National Registration Identification Card numbers, photographs\nand closed-circuit television footage.\n\n5.\n\nOn the above consideration, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nhereby directs the Organisation to:\n\na) Within 60 days from the date of the direction, revise its training curriculum to ensure\n\nthat its security personnel understand\ni.\n\nthe rationale for personal data protection;\n\nii.\n\nthe importance of consent and authorisation in the handling of personal data;\nand\n\niii.\n\nthe circumstances in which it would be appropriate to use and disclose\npersonal data on social media platforms for work-related purposes; and\n\nb) Inform the Commission within 1 week of implementation of the above.\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Interauct! for retaining personal data which was no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.","tags":["Retention Limitation","Warning","Others","Backup files","Server migration"],"date":"2020-10-16","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Interauct-Pte-Ltd---04082020.pdf","nature":"Retention Limitation","title":"Breach of the Retention Limitation Obligation by Interauct!","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2020/10/breach-of-the-retention-obligation-by-interauct","timestamp":"2020-10-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-1911-B5268\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nInterauct! Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1. Interauct! Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) operated an online mobile number auction (the\n“Auction”) for a telecommunications provider (the “Telco”). This arrangement started in\nthe year 2000 and ended in 2018.\n\n2. In November 2019, the Commission was informed that the Telco’s cybersecurity team had\nlocated an internet sub-domain containing files with the personal data of individuals who\nhad participated in the Auction (the “Files”). The Files contained the following types of\npersonal data:\na. Name;\nb. ID (such as passport or NRIC number);\nc. Mobile number;\nd. Address;\ne. Date of birth; and\nf. Email address.\n\n\f3. The Commission’s investigations revealed the following:\n\na. The Organisation had engaged a vendor to provide web hosting services for the\nAuction. In 2012 and 2016, the vendor conducted server migration exercises. On both\noccasions, the Organisation created backups of the Files prior to server migration\nexercises and uploaded them on the vendor’s servers. The Organisation did not delete\nthe Files after the server migration were completed;\n\nb. In April 2019, the vendor misconfigured its servers. As a result, the Files became\naccessible on the internet sub-domain. However, to access this sub-domain requires\nan individual to key in either one of two URLs exactly. Both URLs were complex\nand lengthy. It was therefore difficult for an individual to determine the URLs exactly\nto enter the sub-domain. Indeed, an examination of server logs found that only the\nTelco had accessed the sub-domain;\n\nc. The Files contained a mix of individuals’ personal data, as well as dummy data used\nfor testing purposes. An analysis of the Files showed that there were approximately\n8,750 individuals’ personal data contained in them. The Telco compared the data with\nits customer records, and via a reconciliation process, was able to identify 3,380\nindividuals as its customers. In this regard, the Telco informed that it would have\nbeen very difficult for a third party, without access to the Telco’s customer records,\nto carry out such a reconciliation exercise. This means that even if an individual had\n\n\faccessed the Files, it would have been difficult to him to identify the individuals from\nthe personal data in the Files;\n\nd. The Organisation deleted the Files within three hours of the Telco notifying the\nOrganisation of their discovery of the internet sub-domain. The Organisation had also\nensured that the vendor fixed the misconfiguration of the servers, which was done\nwithin six hours of the discovery of the internet sub-domain.\n\n4. The Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection (the “Deputy Commissioner”)\nfinds that the Organisation had put in place, via the vendor, reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data. In particular, the security arrangements in place\nwould have prevented direct access by unauthorised third-parties to the Files hosted on the\nserver. This had greatly reduced the potential adverse impact of the incident.\n\n5. However, the Organisation admitted that there was no reason to retain the Files after the\nmigration exercises were completed. If the Files had been duly deleted, the personal data\nin the Files would not have been compromised in the first place. The Deputy Commissioner\ntherefore finds the Organisation in breach of the Retention Limitation Obligation under\nsection 25 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n\n6. After considering the facts and circumstances of the incident, including the fact that the\npersonal data in the Files was ultimately not exposed, the Deputy Commissioner has\n\n\fdecided to issue a warning to the Organisation for the breach of the Retention Limitation\nObligation. No other direction is required as the breach has been remedied.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Chan Brothers Travel for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of individuals on its website.

Both were in relation to\npersonal data being at risk of unauthorised access through the Organisation’s website at\nhttp://chanbrotherstravelclub.force.com (the “Website”) (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nIn March 2017, the Organisation purchased Community Cloud, a product of\nSalesforce.com Singapore Pte Ltd (“Salesforce”), to host the Website. The Organisation\nmanaged the Website internally. In August 2018, the Organisation engaged Aodigy Asia\nPacific Pte Ltd (“Aodigy”) as an outsource vendor to maintain and improve the Website.\n\n3.\n\nThe Website provided three online forms for enquiries and feedback. These were the\n“Enquiry Form”, Feedback Form” and “Post-Tour Feedback Form” (collectively the\n“Forms”). The Forms collected the users’ names, email addresses and mobile phone\nnumbers.\n\n\f4.\n\nIn March 2018, there was a software update released by Salesforce for Community\nCloud. This software update included an automated search engine optimisation feature\n(the “SEO”). As the Website’s access configuration was set to “Public”, the Forms\nautomatically inherited the same setting for the purpose of the SEO feature. The result\nwas that the personal data of an estimated 5,593 individuals collected by the Forms were\nindexed and cached, and made searchable, through online web search engines.\n\n5.\n\nOrganisations that employ IT systems or features are responsible for data security.\nOrganisations must acquire knowledge of the security settings and be aware of security\nimplications of software features of their IT system, and they must configure the security\nsettings to enable effective protection of personal data stored in the IT system. This\nresponsibility extends to new features introduced by subsequent software releases.\nOrganisations that lack the IT knowledge to discharge this responsibility should engage\nqualified assistance.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation failed to consider the implication of the “Public” setting of the Website\non the security of the data collected by the Forms. It also failed to understand the function\nand operation of the SEO feature. The combination of these acts of omission resulted in\nthe security issues arising leaving the SEO feature enabled.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation claimed not to have received any notification from Salesforce of the\nSEO release. However, this is contradicted by the following. First, the notes of the\nsoftware release was published on the website of Salesforce. Second, Aodigy had (in its\nrole as vendor for another project) received information of the release. On balance, it is\n\n\ftherefore unlikely that Salesforce would have omitted to notify the Organisation about\nthe software release. In any event, the software release was in March 2018 when the\nOrganisation was still maintaining the Website internally. The responsibility to assess\nthe security implications of the software release laid squarely on its shoulders during that\n5-month period before Aodigy was engaged.\n\n8.\n\nFurther, there is some uncertainty over whether Aodigy was instructed to review the\nsecurity configuration of the Website (including the new software features) as part of its\nmaintenance services when it was engaged. The Organisation did not give clear\ninstructions to Aodigy to assess the security configuration of the IT system as part of the\nmaintenance services.\n\n9.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection therefore\nfound the Organisation in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nand took into account the following factors in deciding to issue a Warning to the\nOrganisation:\n\na. The personal data at risk of disclosure was limited to names, email address and\ncontact numbers, apart from an estimated 50 NRIC numbers.\n\nb.

As the\napplication did not give rise to significant legal or factual issues, a separate decision on\nthe application will not be published.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 19 June 2019, Tanah Merah Country Club (the “Organisation”) informed the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of unauthorised access to its\nelectronic direct mail (“EDM”) system (the “Incident”). During the Incident, which\noccurred on 9 June 2019, the EDM system was used to send unauthorised spam emails.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation was unable to determine how unauthorised access was gained to the\nEDM system. During investigations, it was discovered that the common password for\nlogin to the EDM system was weak, as it comprised the initials of the Organisation and\nthe year 2010 (which was the year that the EDM system was set up). The password was\nshared by at least 3 persons: 2 of the Organisation’s marketing staff and its technical\nsupport vendor. Further, it had not been changed since 2010. Investigations disclosed that\nthere were no arrangements in place to ensure and enforce password strength, expiry and\nprotection.\n\n3.\n\nIn the circumstances, although the means of unauthorised access to the EDM system was\nnot determined, the evidence pointed to weak password control as the cause. The Deputy\nCommissioner for Personal Data Protection therefore found the Organisation in breach\nof section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n\n\f4.\n\nThe Organisation is directed to pay a financial penalty of $8,000 within 30 days from the\ndate of this direction, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full. In view of the remedial\nmeasures taken by the Organisation, the Commission will not issue any other directions.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation’s prompt co-operation in the course of the Commission’s investigation\nand its prompt actions taken to remediate the breach were taken into consideration in\ndetermining the quantum of the financial penalty.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $5,000 was imposed on Vimalakirti Buddhist Centre for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its members and non-members from unauthorised disclosure.

On 14 April 2020, Vimalakirti Buddhist Centre (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware\ninfection that had rendered its data management system inaccessible by the\nOrganisation (the “Incident”).\n2. The Organisation subsequently requested for this matter to be handled under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. In this regard, the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nin this decision. It also admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal\nDara Protection Act (the “PDPA”).\n3. The Incident occurred on or about 31 March 2020. Personal data of approximately\n4,500 members and 4,000 non-members (total 8,500 individuals) were encrypted\nby the ransomware. The personal data encrypted included the name, address,\ncontact number, NRIC number, date of birth and donation details of the individuals.\n4. The Organisation admitted it did not give due attention to personal data protection,\nand had neglected to implement both procedural and technical security\narrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and control.\nConsequently, it did not have the relevant security software and/or protocols in\nplace to prevent the ransomware from entering its data management system.\n5. In the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection finds\nthe Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n6. Following the incident, the Organisation set up a new server with backup from 21\nOctober 2019. For the data collected by the Organisation from 22 October 2019 to\nthe Incident, the Organisation had retrieved the data from physical file records and\nrestored them in the new server. It also installed a firewall to filter network traffic to\nand from the new server, and cleaned, restored and reinstalled all computers\n\n\fconnected to its data management system. Additionally, the Organisation\ncommitted to engage consultants to help produce a data protection manual and\ntrain its staff in cyber hygiene and incident response.\n7. The Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection notes that the\nOrganisation had admitted to a breach of Protection Obligation under the PDPA,\ncooperated with the Commission’s investigation and taken prompt remedial action.\nThere was no evidence that the personal data affected in the Incident had been\nmisused in any form. In addition, the Organisation had a backup copy of the\nencrypted data and did not lose any data as a result of the Incident. Accordingly,\nthe practice of having data backup(s) should be encouraged to prevent\norganisations from losing data in the event of ransomware.\n8. On account of the above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\ndirects the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $5,000 within 30 days from\nthe date of this direction (failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full).\n9. In view of the remedial actions taken by the Organisation, the Commission will not\nbe issuing any other directions.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Horizon Fast Ferry for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in the Organisation’s email account.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Others","Password policy","Email account","Phishing"],"date":"2020-10-16","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision----Horizon-Fast-Ferry-Pte-Ltd---27082020.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Horizon Fast Ferry","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2020/10/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-horizon-fast-ferry","timestamp":"2020-10-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-1912-B5465\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nHorizon Fast Ferry Pte.

In the course of\ntheir business, NovenaMRI subscribed to an internet based teleradiology system\n(“System”) provided by Clarity Radiology Pte Ltd (“Clarity”). In-turn, Clarity\nengaged an overseas IT vendor (the “IT Vendor”) to maintain the System.\n\n2.\n\nOn 7 November 2018, a patient of NovenaMRI (“Complainant”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) about an Excel\nSpreadsheet containing approximately 600 individual’s personal data (including\nthe Complainant’s) that was accessible via the internet (the “Incident”).\n\n3.\n\nDuring the course of investigations, the Commission found two additional Excel\nSpreadsheets containing similar information as the Excel Spreadsheet reported\nby the Complainant. A total of approximately 4,099 individuals were affected by\nthe Incident (“Affected Individuals”). The Affected Individuals’ personal data\nthat was exposed to unauthorised access included their names, NRIC numbers\nand the type of radiology scans performed (collectively, the “Personal Data\nSets”).\n\n\f4.\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that the Incident was caused by a\nlapse in the IT Vendor’s processes while carrying out maintenance work on the\nSystem. In particular, the IT Vendor had removed access restrictions to a\nnetwork folder containing the Excel Spreadsheets for the purposes of patching\nthe System, and omitted to reinstate the access restrictions after the patching\nwas completed. Without access restrictions, the Excel Spreadsheets (containing\nthe Personal Data Sets) were indexed by Google’s search engines and exposed\nto unauthorised access.\n\n5.\n\nNovenaMRI was an organisation who had collected the Personal Data Sets from\nits patients, and had control of the Personal Data Sets at all material times.\n\n6.\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) requires organisations\nlike NovenaMRI to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by\nmaking reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). In this regard, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data\nProtection (“Deputy Commissioner”) finds NovenaMRI in breach of the\nProtection Obligation because:\n(a)\n\nWhen an organisation engages a vendor to supply, modify and/or maintain\nits IT system, it is required to provide the vendor with sufficient clarity and\nspecifications on the requirements to protect personal data. This is because\neven if the vendor was not engaged to process personal data on the\norganisation’s behalf, it may nevertheless handle the personal data\nincidentally or make decisions that affect the security of the personal data\nin the course of providing its services. Depending on the circumstances of\neach case, the organisation should articulate its business requirements\nconcerning the protection of personal data that the IT system will store. This\nwill enable the vendor to assess and recommend the most appropriate and\neffective method to protect personal data. The organization will then be able\n\n\fto make a decision with access to the right information. Examples of\nmeasures include having clauses in written agreements setting out clearly\nthe vendor’s obligations to protect personal data, providing operational\nguidance and verifying the data protection arrangements implemented by\nthe vendor and/or exercising some form of supervision and oversight over\nthe vendor’s activities;\n\n(b)\n\nGiven the nature of NovenaMRI’s business, which entailed being in\npossession and/or control of personal data of a sensitive nature (e.g.\nradiology scans and X-Rays), NovenaMRI should also have conducted a\nproper assessment of its vendor to satisfy itself that the vendor is wellplaced to protect the personal data it hosts. For example, NovenaMRI could\nhave obtained documentary evidence that the vendor had complied with\nindustry standards with respect to information security (eg the ISO 27001\nstandard). However, in this case, there was no evidence that NovenaMRI\nhad conducted proper due diligence of the security standards put in place\nby Clarity, prior to subscribing to the System that provided cloud-based\nservices, including hosting the Personal Data Sets;\n\n(c)\n\nAlthough NovenaMRI claimed that it had a written agreement with Clarity,\nit was unable to produce supporting evidence of this. NovenaMRI’s claim\nwas also disputed by Clarity, who had admitted that there was no written\nagreement between the parties. In addition, even after NovenaMRI had\nengaged Clarity, NovenaMRI did not take any steps to verify if Clarity had\nimplemented any data protection arrangements with respect to the System\nwhich hosted the Personal Data Sets.\n\n7.\n\nAs for Clarity, the contracted services from Clarity to NovenaMRI were to provide\nan archive for Dicom Images and a Web-based radiology information system\nwith scheduling, registration, billing and client access modules. Essentially,\nClarity was a “Software as a Service” provider (or what is commonly known as\n\n\f“SaaS-provider”) who had provided its cloud-based services to NovenaMRI. The\nprovision of such technical solutions or deployment of software integrated into\nthe clinical devices of NovenaMRI did not entail the processing of personal data.\nAs such, Clarity was a vendor of NovenaMRI, and not a “data intermediary” of\nNovenaMRI. As a vendor, Clarity was not responsible for the protection of the\nPersonal Data Sets under the PDPA in respect of the Incident.\n\n8.\n\nHowever, during the course of investigations, Clarity admitted that it had failed\nto appoint a data protection officer and had not developed or put in place any\ndata protection policies, as required under Sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\nAccordingly, Clarity is in breach of Sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\n\n9.\n\nAfter considering the circumstances of the case, the Deputy Commissioner’s\ndecisions are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nto issue a warning to NovenaMRI for its breach of the Protection Obligation.\nNo further directions are necessary as NovenaMRI has ceased its business\nrelationship with Clarity; and\n\n(b)\n\nto direct that Clarity shall, within 30 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nAppoint a data protection officer;\n\nii.\n\nDevelop and implement a data protection policy to comply with its\nobligations under the PDPA; and\n\niii.\n\nInform the Commission within 7 days of the completion of each of the\nabove directions.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on COURTS for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its members from unauthorised disclosure on its website.

This eDM, included for the first time, the New\neDM Link, which was meant to direct Members to the Homeclub login page.\nThe purpose of the New eDM Link was for Members to log in to their respective\nHomeclub accounts to update their membership identifier – Members were\nrequired to provide their mobile numbers to replace NRIC numbers that were\npreviously used as the membership identifier.\n5\n\nThe New eDM Link did not operate as intended, resulting in the\n\nIncident. The Commission’s investigations revealed the following:\n(a)\n\nNotwithstanding that the eDM sent on 31 August 2019 included\n\nfor the first time the New eDM Link, the Organisation continued to use\nthe System in its default setting. The default setting comprised (i) the\nSID embedded in the URL of the New eDM Link;2 and (ii) cookie\nsettings to be refreshed after 60 minutes.\n(b)\n\nThe default setting had not caused any issues when it was used\n\nby the Organisation to send marketing eDMs with eDM links directing\nMembers to specific products on the Website. As Members were not\n\n1\n\nThe Organisation acquired a license to operate the System from 6 March 2017.\n\n2\n\nThis was due to the default setting “Use SID on Storefront” being set to “Yes”\n\n2\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nrequired to log in to their accounts in order to view the specific products,\nthe SID embedded in the URL and cookie settings did not affect the\nfunctioning of the Website.\n(c)\n\nHowever, the default setting should not have been used for the\n\nNew eDM Link – it led to the System assuming that every use of the\nNew eDM Link within 60 minutes of a Member’s login was part of the\nsame session. This meant that:\n(i)\n\nIf Member X clicks on the New eDM Link and logs into\n\nhis Homeclub account without logging out within 60 minutes, all\nother Members who subsequently clicked on the New eDM Link\nwithin 60 minutes of Member X’s login would automatically be\ndirected to Member X’s account, without having to authenticate\ntheir credentials; and\n(ii)\n\nIf Member X logged out while other Members were still\n\nlogged into Member X’s account, the other Members would only\nbe logged out of Member X’s account if they refreshed a page or\nnavigated to other pages within Member X’s account.\n6\n\nAccording to the Organisation, 128 of the Affected Members clicked on\n\nthe New eDM Link between approximately 8am on 31 August 2019 and\n12.25am on 1 September 2019.3 The Incident led to the risk of unauthorised\naccess and modification of personal data in the Affected Members’ respective\nHomeclub accounts. In this regard, each Member’s Homeclub account\n\n3\n\nThe eDM containing the New eDM Link was sent to Members at approximately 8am on 31\nAugust 2019. The Organisation rectified the error causing the Incident at approximately\n12.25am on 1 September 2019.\n\n3\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\ncomprised (i) account information; and (ii) address book, which collectively\ncontained the following data (“Personal Data Set”):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nEmail address:\n\n(c)\n\nMobile Number;\n\n(d)\n\nDate of Birth (“DOB”);\n\n(e)\n\nAddress;\n\n(f)\n\nPassword; and\n\n(g)\n\nTransactional information i.e. products previously purchased by\n\na Member.\n7\n\nIn addition to unauthorised access, the following types of personal data\n\nin the Affected Members’ Personal Data Sets were at risk of unauthorised\nmodification as a result of the Incident:\n(a)\n\nThe Affected Member’s name, DOB, mobile number and\n\nresidential address from his/her account information; and\n(b)\n\nThe Affected Member’s name, mobile number and residential\n\naddress from his/her address book.\n8\n\nThe risk of unauthorised modification in [7(a)] and [7(b)] was possible\n\nbecause password verification was not required to make these changes.\nConversely, an Affected Members’ username (which was his/her email address)\nand password could not be modified without password verification. An Affected\nMember’s Personal Data Sets also could not be downloaded by another Member\n4\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nwho had accessed his/her account because there was no download function on\nthe Website.\n9\n\nThere was no risk of financial loss to Affected Members through the\n\nIncident. While it was possible for another Member (who was given access to\nMember X’s account) to make a purchase through Member X’s account, he/she\nwould have to provide credit card details to complete the purchase. This was\nbecause financial information (i.e. credit card details) was not stored in the\nSystem, and there was no reward system in Homeclub for the redemption of\nproducts or benefits.\n10\n\nBased on the Organisation’s investigations into the Incident, there was\n\nno evidence of any unauthorised modification to the Affected Members’\nPersonal Data Sets. Other than the Affected Member who had notified the\nOrganisation of the Incident, the Organisation did not receive any further\ncomplaints or feedback.\n11\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident on the same day, the Organisation\n\npromptly took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nFixed the error that caused the Incident at approximately\n\n12:25am on 1 September 2019 by changing the setting for “Use SID on\nStorefront” to “No”;\n(b)\n\nImplemented password verification for any changes to\n\nMembers’ account information and address book;4\n\n4\n\nThis came into effect on 6 January 2020.\n\n5\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n(c)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nPut in place a standard operating procedure (“SOP”) to ensure\n\ncorrect link insertion into eDMs to protect personal data. For eDM links\nthat are supposed to lead to a login page, checks will be conducted to\nensure that there will be multiple concurrent user testing;\n(d)\n\nTook steps to engage an external vendor to work on security\n\nmatters (including data protection security), and disseminate this\ninformation to its employees; and\n(e)\n\nEmailed the 128 Affected Members who had clicked on the New\n\neDM Link to inform them of the Incident.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n12\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). It is not disputed that the Organisation had possession and control\nof the Personal Data Sets at the material time. The Commission’s investigations\nrevealed that the Organisation failed to put in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect the Personal Data Sets for the reasons explained below.\n13\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to conduct adequate testing before\n\nimplementation. As mentioned at [4], this was the first time the Organisation\nincluded in its eDM, the New eDM Link to direct Members to the Homeclub\nlogin page. There was only 1 employee in the Organisation’s digital marketing\nteam that was in charge of creating the New eDM Link and testing it prior to its\n\n6\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nlaunch. The employee conducted a limited test of sending the eDM containing\nthe New eDM Link to himself – the New eDM Link operated as intended,\ndirecting the employee to the Homeclub login page. This limited test was clearly\ninadequate. As emphasized in the Commission’s previous decisions, an\norganisation should ensure that testing scenarios are properly scoped. In\nparticular, pre-launch testing of processes or systems needs to mimic expected\nreal world usage, including foreseeable scenarios in a normal operating\nenvironment when the changes are introduced.5 In the present case, the\nOrganisation intended to send the eDM to a very large number of Members. It\nis therefore foreseeable that testing scenarios should include multiple sequential\nlogins or even concurrent logins to the Homeclub login page at peak usage. If\nthe Organisation had tested the New eDM Link to approximate this real world\nscenario, the Incident would have likely come to light at that stage.\n14\n\nSecond, the Organisation failed to assess the appropriateness of the\n\ndefault settings in the System for the New eDM Link.\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation used the default setting in the System for the\n\nNew eDM Link without any assessment on its implications. As\nmentioned in the Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in\nElectronic Medium at [17.5] and previous decisions,6 when using readymade software, organisations are required to obtain a clear\nunderstanding of the intended purpose of the software, how the software\n\n5\n\nSee Re Option Gift Pte Ltd [2019] SGPCPC 10 at [15]; Re AIA Singapore Pte Limited [2019]\nSGPDPC 20 at [15] and L’Oreal Singapore Pte. Ltd. Case No. DP 1812-B3091, Summary of\nthe Decision at [3]\n6\n\nSee for example Re DS Human Resource Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 16 at [9]\n\n7\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nfunctions and how to configure the software correctly. The Organisation\nfailed to do so in the present case;\n(b)\n\nThere was an option in the Platform to automatically generate\n\neDM links without any SID in the URL. The Organisation did not fully\nappreciate the differences in using this option to create links that are\nembedded within an eDM, as compared with the effects of embedding\nSIDs as part of the URL for the New eDM Link. Due to the lack of\nunderstanding the differences between these out-of-the-box features of\nthe commercial off-the-shelf product that he was using, the employee in\ncharge of creating the New eDM Link was not aware that the appropriate\nmethod was to use the option in the Platform that generated eDM links\nwithout SID in the URL. Instead, the employee manually copied the\nNew eDM Link (which contained the SID) from the internet browser for\ninsertion into the eDM; and\n(c)\n\nWhile the Organisation had in place a process for a second-level\n\ncheck on the content and layout of the eDM, the nature of this type of\nchecks would not have been effective in picking up the more technical\nissues relating to embedded SID in the New eDM Link. Understanding\nfully the features of the commercial off-the-shelf product in use and\nproperly scoping the testing scenarios during user acceptance testing\nwould have been the more appropriate and effective way to avoid and\ncatch such errors.\n15\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n16\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made\n\nrepresentations on the amount of financial penalty that the Commissioner\nintended to impose. The Organisation raised the following factors for the\nCommissioner’s consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation takes a serious view of its obligations under\n\nthe PDPA, and has taken the necessary remedial actions to prevent\nfuture data protection incidents from occurring. Personal data protection\nremains a priority for the Organisation even during these uncertain and\nturbulent times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n(b)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the\n\nbusiness of the Organisation, resulting in a significant loss of revenue.\nSpecifically, due to “circuit breaker” measures imposed by the\ngovernment, the Organisation closed all 14 of its retail outlets in\nSingapore from 7 April 2020 to 19 June 2020. Further, its operating\noverheads remained largely unchanged as labour accounted for\nsignificant portion of its costs, and the Organisation has maintained a\ncommitment to retaining employees so as to protect their livelihoods.\nEven with the recent reopening of its physical stores, the Organisation\ncontinues to have a negative outlook of its business due to the impact of\nCOVID-19 on the economy and a challenging retail landscape.\n17\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has\n\ndecided to reduce the financial penalty to the amount set out at [19]. The\nquantum of financial penalty has been calibrated after due consideration of the\nOrganisation’s financial circumstances due to the unprecedented challenges\nfaced by businesses amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, bearing in mind that\n9\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\nfinancial penalties imposed should not be crushing or cause undue hardship on\norganisations. Although a lower financial penalty has been imposed in this case,\nthe quantum of financial penalty should be treated as exceptional and should not\nbe taken as setting any precedent for future cases.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n18\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account as an\naggravating factor that this is the second time the Organisation has been found\nin breach of the Protection Obligation.7 The Commissioner also took into\naccount the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation cooperated with the investigations and\n\nprovided prompt responses to the Commission’s requests for\ninformation;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation implemented remedial actions swiftly to\n\naddress the Incident; and\n(c)\n\nThe Members’ Personal Data Sets was exposed to the risk of\n\nunauthorised access and/or modification for a limited period of less than\none day.\n19\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$9,000 within 30\ndays from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified\nin the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable\n\n7\n\nSee Re Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 4\n\n10\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 17\n\non the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until it is paid in full. The\nCommissioner has not set out any further directions given the remediation\nmeasures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to the Singapore Medical Association for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of 68 individuals’ personal data which were forwarded to an external email address without authorisation.","tags":["Protection","Warning","General (eg.

According to the Complainant,\nwhen he accessed his virtual membership card (the “Virtual Card”) through\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s\n\nmembership\n\nweb\n\nportal\n\non\n\nthe\n\nsame\n\nday\n\n–\n\n“https://gateway.csc.sg” (the “Membership Portal”), he discovered that he was\nable to access a web directory – “https://gateway.csc.sg/webclub/facilities/tmp”\n(the “Directory”). The Directory contained profile photographs of other\nmembers (and their respective NRIC/FIN numbers which were used as file\nnames for their profile photographs), including the Complainant’s (the\n“Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a social club for all Public Service officers in\n\nSingapore, and also welcomes staff of Social Service Organisations and the\ngeneral public to join as associate members. Membership benefits include\nbooking of sports facilities, functions rooms and chalets, as well as members’\nrates for club events and recreational activities.\n\n\fCivil Service Club\n\n3\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 15\n\nIn October 2009, the Organisation engaged the services of an IT vendor\n\n(the “Vendor”) to develop its Club Management System (“CMS”). The\nVendor’s scope of work was set out in a contract entered into between the parties\nin November 2009 (the “Contract”). The Organisation launched the CMS,\nincluding the Membership Portal, in stages. On 1 March 2019, the Organisation\nlaunched the Virtual Card on the Membership Portal, and members’ NRIC/FIN\nnumbers were used as file names for members’ profile photographs.\n4\n\nThe Organisation has 2 separate servers hosted in its premises – the\n\n“enterprise” server (the “Enterprise Server”) and the “gateway” server (the\n“Gateway Server”). The Organisation stored its business and personal data on\nthe Enterprise Server. The Gateway Server was specifically deployed to isolate\nthe rest of the Organisation’s network (which may contain personal data or\nbusiness data) from the public.\n5\n\nWhen a member accessed his/her Virtual Card, the software on the\n\nMembership Portal retrieved a copy of the member’s profile photograph from\nthe Enterprise Server and stored it temporarily in the Directory. The Directory\nresided in the Gateway Server. The files in the Directory (including members’\nprofile photographs) were designed such that they could not be accessed by the\npublic. If the member logged out from the Membership Portal, his/her profile\nphotograph would be deleted from the Directory at that point in time. However,\nif the member closed the web browser directly without logging out of the\nMembership Portal, his/her profile photograph in the Directory would only be\ndeleted during the monthly “housekeeping” process. Other than members’\nprofile photographs stored temporarily in the Directory (and their respective\nNRIC/FIN numbers which were used as file names for their profile\nphotographs), the Gateway Server did not contain any other personal data.\n\n2\n\n\fCivil Service Club\n\n6\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 15\n\nPrior to the Incident, there was an issue arising from members\n\nsubmitting their profile photographs in different file formats and sizes for the\nVirtual Card. The Vendor planned to monitor the situation for three months until\n9 July 2019 and troubleshoot the issue during this period.\n7\n\nAt first, the Vendor attempted to perform troubleshooting in a test\n\nenvironment using dummy photographs. However, the test environment could\nnot replicate the issue with the Virtual Cards. In order to observe members’\nbehaviour patterns when they accessed their Virtual Cards and to collect\nstatistics on photograph file sizes and time of creation, the Vendor enabled\npublic access to the Directory on 3 occasions so that it could perform\ntroubleshooting remotely. The Vendor also postponed the monthly\n“housekeeping\" process for the Directory by pushing it back from June 2019 to\nJuly 2019.\n8\n\nThe Vendor only required a few minutes of remote access to perform\n\nremote troubleshooting, and had, as part of its testing procedures, a requirement\nthat engineers restore all changes made during testing. On the first 2 occasions,\npublic access to the Directory was disabled within 15 minutes. However, on 24\nJune 2019 (i.e. the 3rd occasion of remote troubleshooting), the Vendor’s\nengineer omitted to disable public access to the Directory but erroneously\nreported that he had done so. As a result, approximately 1,770 members’ profile\nphotographs (and their respective NRIC/FIN numbers which were used as file\nnames for their profile photographs) (the “Members Data”) could be accessed\nby anyone who obtained the URL to the Directory, including the Complainant\non the date of the Incident.\n9\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the following remedial actions were\n\ntaken:\n\n3\n\n\fCivil Service Club\n\n(a)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 15\n\nThe Organisation and the Vendor took immediate action to\n\ndisable access to the Directory;\n(b)\n\nThe Vendor enhanced the “housekeeping” processes for the\n\nDirectory such that the members’ profile photographs are deleted\nimmediately after displaying them on the respective members’ Virtual\nCards (i.e. there are no files containing members’ profile photographs\nstored in the Directory at any time); and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation discontinued the use of NRIC/FIN numbers as\n\nmembership numbers, and the members’ profile photographs are no\nlonger named using NRIC/FIN numbers.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n10\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned the Enterprise Server\n\nand Gateway Server, and was in possession and control of the Members Data at\nall material times. While the Organisation had engaged the Vendor to develop\nthe CMS, which included the Membership Portal, the scope of the Vendor’s\nwork did not involve processing of any personal data on behalf of the\nOrganisation. The Vendor was therefore not a data intermediary, and the\nresponsibility to protect the Members Data fell squarely on the Organisation.\n11\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) provides\n\nthat an organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its\ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or similar risks (the\n“Protection Obligation”). The Organisation failed to put in place reasonable\n\n4\n\n\fCivil Service Club\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 15\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Members Data for the reasons explained\nbelow.\n12\n\nAs mentioned at [3], the Organisation started engaging the Vendor’s\n\nservices in October 2009. The Contract between the parties was entered into\nbefore the PDPA came into full force on 2 July 2014 (the “Appointed Day”).\nBefore the Appointed Day, the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA (i.e.\nParts III to VI of the PDPA) were not in force, and the Organisation was not\nsubject to these provisions in relation to personal data in its possession or\ncontrol. However, after the Appointed Day, it became incumbent on the\nOrganisation to take proactive steps to comply with the Data Protection\nProvisions of the PDPA in respect of the existing personal data held in its\npossession or control, as well as any new personal data that may come into its\npossession or control. It was not enough for the Organisation to leave matters\nstatus quo, if this would not enable it to meet the requirements and standards of\nthe Protection Obligation.1\n13\n\nIn the present case, the Commission’s investigations revealed that after\n\nthe Appointed Day, the Organisation’s engagement of the Vendor’s services\nincluded work in relation to the developing and troubleshooting of the Virtual\nCards on the Membership Portal. According to the Organisation, it was not\naware that (i) Members Data had been stored temporarily in the Directory; and\n(ii) the Vendor’s troubleshooting involved enabling public access to the\nDirectory. Notwithstanding this, given that the Organisation’s engagement of\nthe Vendor’s services included work in relation to the Virtual Cards that\ncontained Members Data, the Vendor (although not engaged to process the\n\n1\n\nSee Re Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at [10] – [11]\n\n5\n\n\fCivil Service Club\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 15\n\nMembers Data) may nevertheless handle the Members Data incidentally or\nmake software system design decisions that affect the security of the Members\nData in the course of providing its services.\n14\n\nIn the circumstances, and in order for the Organisation to comply with\n\nthe Protection Obligation, the Organisation should have ensured that it provided\nsufficient clarity and specifications on requirements to the Vendor (when\ndeveloping and troubleshooting the CMS, Membership Portal and Virtual\nCards) to protect the Members Data. There are various ways that the\nOrganisation could have done so:\n(a)\n\nThe Contract was entered into by the parties before the\n\nAppointed Day and did not contain any provisions on the protection of\npersonal data.2 In view of the scope of services provided by the Vendor\nafter the Appointed Day as set out at [13], the Organisation could have\nreviewed the Contract to include clauses setting out requirements for the\nVendor to protect the Members Data. As highlighted in the\nCommission’s Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July\n2018) at [4.2.1], organisations should emphasize the need for personal\ndata protection to their IT vendors by making it part of their contractual\nterms. In this regard, the Organisation could have adapted relevant\nclauses from the Commission’s Guide on Data Protection Clauses for\nAgreements Relating to the Processing of Personal Data (published 20\nJuly 2016) to suit the Organisation’s particular circumstances and needs.\n\n2\n\nThe Contract contained only a confidentiality clause requiring each party to protect\ninformation identified by the other party as confidential.\n\n6\n\n\fCivil Service Club\n\n(b)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 15\n\nFurther and/or in the alternative, the Organisation could have\n\nreviewed and revised the requirements specifications and software\nsystems design documentation to include (i) requirements relating to\nhow personal data (including the Members Data) should be handled as\npart of the design and layout the CMS and the Membership Portal;3 and\n(ii) technical and other measures that protect the personal data (including\nthe Members Data).\n15\n\nFrom the Appointed Day, the Organisation’s failure to take any\n\nreasonable steps to ensure sufficient obligations are imposed on the Vendor\n(when developing and troubleshooting the CMS, Membership Portal and\nVirtual Cards) to protect the Members Data was a breach of its obligations under\nsection 24 of the PDPA. A period of about five years had elapsed since 2 July\n2014 to 2 July 2019. The Organisation, as owner of the CMS, should have\nincluded it as part of its personal data asset inventory and ensured that its data\nprotection policies covered personal data held in the CMS. Had this been done,\nthe Organisation would have identified these gaps in the business requirements\nfor the CMS, which would have set it down the path to rectifying these gaps\nthrough one or both of the options discussed in the preceding paragraph.

The Grab App also\nprovides a carpooling option referred to as “GrabHitch”. GrabHitch matches a\npassenger with a driver willing to give a lift to the passenger (on the way to the\ndriver’s destination) in return for a fee. On 30 August 2019, the Organisation\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that, for\na short period of time on the same day, profile data of 5,651 GrabHitch drivers\nwas exposed to the risk of unauthorised access by other GrabHitch drivers\nthrough the Grab App (the “Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation’s investigations traced the cause of the Incident to the\n\ndeployment of an update to the Grab App on 30 August 2019 (the “ Update”).\nThe purpose of the Update was to address a potential vulnerability discovered\nwithin the Grab App, namely, the application programming interface (“API”)\nendpoint (/users/{userID}/profile) (the “URL”) that had allowed GrabHitch\n\n\fGrabcar Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 14\n\ndrivers to access their data, contained a ‘userID’ that could potentially be\nmanipulated to allow access to other GrabHitch driver’s data.1\n3\n\nIn order to fix the vulnerability, the Update removed the variable\n\n‘userID’ from the URL which shortened it to a hard-coded ‘/users/profile’.\nHowever, the Update failed to take into account the URL-based caching\nmechanism in the Grab App. This caching mechanism (which was configured\nto refresh every 10 seconds) served cached content in response to data requests\nto reduce the load of direct access to the Organisation’s database.\n4\n\nWith the deployment of the Update, all URLs in the Grab App ended\n\nwith “/users/profile”. Without the variable ‘userID’ in the URL (which directed\ndata requests to the correct GrabHitch driver’s accounts), the caching\nmechanism could no longer differentiate between GrabHitch drivers.\nConsequentially, the caching mechanism provided the same data to all\nGrabHitch drivers for 10 seconds before new data was retrieved from the\nOrganisation’s database and cached for the next 10 seconds.\n5\n\nAs a result of the Incident, a total of 21,541 GrabHitch drivers’ and\n\npassengers data was exposed to the risk of unauthorised access (collectively\n“Personal Data Sets”):\n(a)\n\nProfile pictures;\n\n(b)\n\nPassenger names;\n\n(c)\n\nVehicle plate number; and\n\n1\n\nAccording to the Organisation, there was no evidence that this vulnerability had been\nexploited.\n\n2\n\n\fGrabcar Pte Ltd\n\n(d)\n6\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 14\n\nWallet balance comprising journal history of ride payments.\n\nIn addition to the Personal Data Sets, other data that was exposed to the\n\nrisk of unauthorised access during the Incident included GrabHitch booking\ndetails such as addresses and pickup and drop-off times; and driver details such\nas total rides, vehicle model and make.\n7\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following\n\nremedial actions:\n(a)\n\nRolled back the Grab App to the version prior to the Update\n\nwithin approximately 40 minutes;\n(b)\n\nNotified 5,651 GrabHitch drivers of the Incident on the same\n\nday; 2\n(c)\n\nIncreased the minimum “cash out” amount for wallets in\n\nGrabHitch to S$200,000 to prevent unauthorised transfers;\n(d)\n\nDeployed a new update for the Grab App on 10 September 2019;\n\n(e)\n\nReviewed its testing procedures including implementing\n\nmandatory automated tests for all API endpoints dealing with personal\ndata;\n(f)\n\nUpdated governance procedures concerning deployment and\n\nsecurity verification on changes to IT systems and applications; and\n\n2 The Organisation’s initial investigations indicated\n\nthat 5,651 GrabHitch drivers’ data was\nexposed to the risk of unauthorised access due to the Incident. Following further investigations,\nthe Organisation determined that up to 21,541 GrabHitch drivers’ and passengers data was\nexposed to the risk of unauthorised access.\n\n3\n\n\fGrabcar Pte Ltd\n\n(g)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 14\n\nEmbarked on an architecture review of its legacy applications,\n\nand relevant codes which had not been reviewed for an extended period\nof time.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n8\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) provides\n\nthat an organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its\ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or similar risks. It is\nnot disputed that the Organisation had possession and control of the Personal\nData Sets at the material time.\n9\n\nIn the context of the present case, given that the Organisation made\n\nchanges to its IT system that processed the Personal Data Sets, it is obliged to\nput in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent any compromise to the\nPersonal Data Sets.3 The Organisation failed to do so for the reasons explained\nbelow.\n10\n\nFirst, the Organisation did not put in place sufficiently robust processes\n\nto manage changes to its IT system that may put the personal data it was\nprocessing at risk. This was a particularly grave error given that this is the\n\n3 Re Flight Raja Travels Singapore Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 16 at [8].\n\n4\n\n\fGrabcar Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 14\n\nsecond time the Organisation is making a similar mistake, albeit with respect to\na different system.4\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation introduced changes to the Grab App (through\n\nthe Update) without understanding how the changes would operate with\nexisting features of the Grab App and its broader IT system, including\nthe caching mechanism.\n(b)\n\nIn particular, the Update involved changes to the URL (i.e.\n\nremoving the variable ‘userID’). The variable ‘userID’ in the URL had\nthe function of ensuring that data requests (including the Personal Data\nSets) were directed to the correct GrabHitch drivers’ accounts. However,\nthe Organisation implemented the Update without making an\nassessment whether the Grab App would continue to direct data requests\nto the correct GrabHitch drivers’ accounts without the variable ‘userID’\nin the URL.\n11\n\nSecond, the Organisation did not conduct properly scoped testing before\n\nthe Update to the Grab App was deployed.\n(a)\n\nAs found in the Commission’s previous decisions, organisations\n\nare obliged to conduct properly scoped testing before new IT features or\nchanges to IT systems are deployed. These tests need to mimic real\nworld usage, including foreseeable scenarios in a normal operating\n\n4 See Re Grabcar Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 15 at [17] where it was found that the Organisation\n\ndid not have adequate measures in place to detect whether the changes it made to a system that\nheld personal data introduced errors that put the personal data it was processing at risk.\n\n5\n\n\fGrabcar Pte Ltd\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 14\n\nenvironment when the changes are introduced.5 Such tests prior to\ndeployment are critical to enable organisations to detect and rectify\nerrors in the new IT features and/or be alerted to any unintended effects\nfrom changes that may put personal data at risk.6\n(b)\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation admitted that it did not\n\nconduct tests to simulate multiple users accessing the Grab App, whether\nconcurrently or consecutively. The Organisation also admitted that it did\nnot conduct any specific test to verify how the caching mechanism\nwould work in tandem with the Update.\n(c)\n\nIn view of the large number of GrabHitch drivers, multiple users\n\nlogging in concurrently or consecutively are foreseeable scenarios that\nthe Organisation should have simulated during its testing of the Update\nprior to deployment. Properly scoped pre-launch tests would have\nincluded an assessment of how the caching mechanism may affect the\nintended operation of the Update because the caching mechanism can\naffect data requests returned to the GrabHitch drivers.\n12\n\nFor the reasons above, I find the Organisation in breach of section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA.\n\n5 Re AIA Singapore Pte Limited [2019] SGPDPC 20 at [15] and L’Oreal Singapore Pte.

The Organisation\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of the\nIncident on 17 April 2019.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a multinational telecommunications conglomerate\n\nheadquartered in Singapore. Through the Mobile App, the Organisation’s\ncustomers can conveniently manage the Organisation’s services including (but\n\nservice numbers comprised mobile phone numbers, user IDs for the Organisation’s\nbroadband internet services and service numbers for the Organisation’s TV services.\n1 The\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nnot limited to) the payment of their bills, keeping track of their local mobile data\nusage, talk time and SMS, subscribing to a roaming plan to suit their travel needs\netc. Communications between the Mobile App and the Organisation’s servers\nare conducted via an Application Programming Interface (“API”). This would\ninclude the retrieval of active service numbers associated with a user of the\nMobile App.\n3\n\nThe Organisation engaged a software services provider who was in\n\ncharge of developing and introducing code changes for the purpose of code\nupdates to the API (the “Vendor”). As part of a scheduled code update on the\nday of the Incident, the Vendor made changes to the API code. In addition, the\nVendor also conducted code optimisation by running a tool called SonarQube,\nwhich identifies and recommends inefficient code for removal. On this\nparticular occasion, SonarQube recommended the removal of the code which\ngoverned the condition that decoupled Recycled Numbers from their previous\nusers (the “Condition”). The Vendor followed SonarQube’s recommendation\nand removed the Condition.\n4\n\nBefore the code changes were deployed to production, the Vendor raised\n\na Technical Change Request form (“TCR”) to notify the Organisation of the\nchanges made. However, the Vendor omitted to report the removal of the\nCondition in the TCR submitted to the Organisation.\n5\n\nPrior to accepting the code changes to the API for deployment, the\n\nOrganisation conducted business user acceptance testing for business needs and\nregression testing for existing functionality. Given that this was a scheduled\ncode update, these tests were limited in scope to the changes reported in the\nTCR. As the removal of the Condition was not reported in the TCR, the\nOrganisation was unaware of this change, and did not conduct testing on the\n\n2\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nimpact to the operation of the Mobile App due to removal of the Condition.\nFollowing the pre-launch testing, the code changes were approved by the\nOrganisation for deployment.\n6\n\nThe removal of the Condition led to the API retrieving both active and\n\nRecycled Numbers associated with a user of the Mobile App, resulting in the\nIncident. According to the Organisation, 384 of its customers were affected by\nthe Incident (the “Affected Individuals”). The following types of personal data\nof the Affected Individuals’ that was at risk of unauthorised access through the\nMobile App included (collectively, the “Personal Data Sets”):\n(a)\n\nRecycled Numbers2;\n\n(b)\n\nInstallation addresses of those Affected Individuals who\n\nsubscribed to the Organisation’s broadband and TV services;\n(c)\n\nUsage details including mobile phone talk time, number of text\n\nmessages sent and amount of mobile data used;\n(d)\n\nValue-added services subscribed to;\n\n(e)\n\nPrice plans of the various services subscribed to; and\n\n(f)\n\nBilling cycles for the Recycled Numbers.\n\n2 There was a total of 404 unique Recycled Numbers belonging to the Affected Individuals.\n\n3\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n7\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation promptly carried\n\nout the following actions to mitigate the effects of the Incident:\n(a)\n\nBlocked access to the Mobile App a few hours after being\n\nnotified of the Incident;\n(b)\n\nImplemented a fix for the Mobile App the day after the Incident,\n\nand restored access to the Mobile App; and\n(c)\n\nReversed five erroneous transactions relating to roaming and\n\ncallerID that were processed during the Incident.\n8\n\nIn addition, to prevent a recurrence of the Incident or similar risks:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation will be implementing additional regression test\n\nscenarios which will cover testing of Recycled Numbers;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation has also implemented the following\n\nenhancements on the Mobile App:\n(i)\n\nTo prevent any historical services from being retrieved\n\nand displayed on the Mobile App, only active services will be\ndisplayed moving forward; and\n(ii)\n\nEnhanced the Mobile App to ensure that only\n\ninformation retrieved for the customer’s identifiers in the\nauthenticated session is displayed on the Mobile App.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned the Mobile App and was\n\nin possession and control of the Personal Data Sets. The Vendor’s role, in the\ncontext of the Incident, was to develop and introduce code changes to the API\n4\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nfor the purposes of the code update. The Vendor did not process the Personal\nData Sets on behalf of the organisation and was accordingly not a data\nintermediary. In the circumstances, the responsibility to protect the Personal\nData Sets fell squarely on the Organisation.\n10\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”)\n\nprovides that an organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or\nunder its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\nsimilar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n11\n\nAs highlighted in previous decisions 3, an organisation is not required to\n\nprovide an absolute guarantee for the protection of personal data in its\npossession. What is expected of the organisation is to make such security\narrangements as a reasonable person would consider appropriate, given the\nnature of the personal data involved and the particular circumstances of the\nOrganisation. The Protection Obligation is not automatically breached upon the\noccurrence of a data leak, and this case is an example of an application of this\nprinciple.\n12\n\nThe\n\nCommission’s\n\ninvestigations\n\nrevealed\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nsecurity\n\narrangements put in place by the Organisation to protect the Personal Data Sets\nwas reasonable in the circumstances for the reasons explained below.\n\n3Re Tiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 6 and Re BHG (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 16.\n\n5\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n(a)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nFirst, the Organisation emphasized to the Vendor the need for\n\npersonal data protection of the Organisation’s customers by making it\npart of the contractual terms in the Statement of Works 4. Specifically,\nthe Statement of Works contained data protection clauses requiring the\nVendor to establish security processes and actively enforce policies\naddressing personal data protection, follow industry standard measures\nto protect the Organisation’s customers’ personal data, and exercise the\nsame degree of care to guard against unauthorised disclosure. In\naddition, the Organisation verified the data protection arrangements put\nin place by the Vendor to protect its customers’ data5. This included\nconducting audits on the Vendor to ensure the adequacy and\neffectiveness of IT controls and processes implemented by the Vendor,\nand to ensure that the Vendor’s staff conformed to the said IT controls\nand processes. Further, in order to increase its vendors’ knowledge and\nawareness of the PDPA’s requirements, the Organisation also conducted\nmandatory annual briefings for its vendors on the PDPA, the\nOrganisation’s cybersecurity policy for third party vendors as well as\ninformation security. These annual briefings were attended by the\nVendor’s employees.\n\n4 Commission’s Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1].\n5cf. Re SCAL Academy Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 2 at [8]: Organisation instructed its vendor to\n\nprevent documents from being “leaked” online, but did not check with its vendor what security\narrangements were put in place to ensure this.\n\n6\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n(b)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nSecond, the Organisation ensured that the pre-launch tests for\n\ncode changes were reasonably scoped to pick up and rectify errors\nand/or flaws prior to deployment.\n(i)\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation\n\nhad\n\nconducted\n\nbusiness\n\nuser\n\nacceptance testing based on the change requests set out by the\nVendor in the TCR. As mentioned at [5], there was no testing\nconducted on the impact to the operation of the Mobile App due\nto removal of the Condition – the Organisation was not aware of\nthe removal of the Condition because it had not been reported in\nthe TCR. Given that there was no reason for the Organisation to\nsuspect any additional code changes in a scheduled routine code\nupdate, it was reasonable for the Organisation to perform testing\nonly on those changes set out in the TCR 6.\n(ii)\n\nAs part of its quality assurance measures, the\n\nOrganisation conducted various testing of critical business\nfunctions of the Mobile App, including user acceptance testing\nand regression testing. The results from the tests were reviewed\nby directors in the Organisation’s business and IT departments\nbefore the code changes were approved for deployment to the\nMobile App.\n\n6cf: The Commission’s previous decisions where organisations were found in breach of Section\n\n24 of the PDPA for not conducting sufficiently scoped pre-launch tests before introducing new\nchanges to its systems that processed personal data. See for example: Re Flight Raja Travels\nSingapore Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 18 (organisation introduced a new mobile application) and\nRe Singapore Telecommunications Limited [2019] SGPDPC 49 (organisation migrated its\ndatabase of customer accounts to a new billing system).\n\n7\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n13\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 13\n\nIn conclusion, nothing in the Commission’s investigations pointed to the\n\ncause of the Incident being due to a systemic problem in the Organisation’s\nmeasures to protect the Personal Data Sets. Instead, this appeared to be a oneoff incident that was difficult to foresee in the circumstances. Having carefully\nconsidered all the relevant circumstances and for the reasons set out above, I\nfind that the Organisation had not contravened its obligations under section 24\nof the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $5,000 was imposed on Singapore Red Cross for breaches of the PDPA.

There was also no password management policy requiring\nstrong passwords of sufficient length and complexity during the development phase.\nThis resulted in a weak password (i.e. “12345”) being set for the Tool;1 and\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation did not conduct any regular security reviews, e.g.\n\nvulnerability assessment, on its systems that would identify applications that it did not\nneed. 2 Consequentially, the Organisation did not realise that the Tool remained\nconnected to the Website even after development of the Website had been completed.\nThis allowed unauthorised individual(s) to gain access to the Database through the Tool\nwhich had a weak password.\n\n1\n\nFor examples of the Commission’s previous decisions on the need for proper password management policies,\nsee Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 12 at [35] – [36] and Re Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n[2019] SGPDPC 22 at [15].\n2\nFor examples of the Commission’s previous decisions on the requirement for periodic security reviews, see\nRe Watami Food Services Singapore Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 12 at [6]; Re WTS Automotive Services [2018]\nSGPDPC 26 at [18]; Re Bud Cosmetics [2019] SGPDPC 1 at [24]; Re Chizzle Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 44 at [6].\n\n2\n\n\fSingapore Red Cross Society\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 16\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had contravened Section 25 of the PDPA\n6\n\nUnder Section 25 of the PDPA, an organisation is obliged to cease to retain its\n\ndocuments containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal data can be\nassociated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that: (a) the purpose\nfor which the personal data was collected is no longer served by retaining the data; and (b) the\nretention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes (the “Retention Limitation\nObligation”).\n7\n\nThe Organisation admitted that there had been unnecessary retention of Personal Data\n\nof approximately 900 Affected Individuals, and this was a breach of the Retention Limitation\nObligation.\n(a)\n\nPrior to the Incident, the Organisation intended to purge Personal Data of these\n\n900 Affected Individuals from the Database. However, the Organisation provided\nwrong instructions to its vendor for the purging exercise. The Organisation had\ninstructed its vendor to only remove some data elements instead of entire records of the\n900 Affected Individuals’ Personal Data; and\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation also did not conduct any verification checks to ensure the\n\npurging exercise was properly carried out. As a result, the Organisation failed to detect\nthat the Database still retained records of the 900 Affected Individual’s Personal Data.\n8\n\nIn view of the above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in breach of sections\n\n24 and 25 of the PDPA.\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n9\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations on the\n\namount of financial penalty that the Commissioner intended to impose. The Organisation raised\nthe following factors for the Commissioner’s consideration:\n\n3\n\n\fSingapore Red Cross Society\n\n(a)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 16\n\nThe Organisation is a charity that depends on public donations to run its\n\noperations and programmes, all which are for the benefit of the community. Such a high\nfinancial penalty would set the Organisation back significantly, and would mean less\nhelp for the disadvantaged and the vulnerable;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation takes its obligations under the PDPA seriously and already\n\nhad in place various IT security measures and had embarked on a consultancy to ensure\nits compliance with the PDPA even before the Incident;\n(c)\n\nThe attackers were skilled hackers who utilised sophisticated hacking tools to\n\nexploit a weak administrator password for the Tool which left the Database vulnerable\nto unauthorised access. The Tool was never used by the Organisation’s staff and was\nlikely created during the development stage of Database;\n(d)\n\nUpon being informed of the Incident, the Organisation immediately made a\n\npolice report and promptly informed various public authorities including the Health\nSciences Authority and the Commission. The Organisation has also extended full\ncooperation and provided prompt responses during the Commission’s investigations;\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation promptly informed all affected individuals and there were no\n\nregistered complaints on the case;\n(f)\n\nSince the Incident, the Organisation had taken immediate steps to remove the\n\nDatabase from the Website and put in place more security measures. This included\nlayered and restricted access, isolation of sensitive systems at the network level,\npassword training for staff, review and strengthening of standard operating procedures,\npractising more stringent oversight of vendor actions, implementation of vulnerability\nassessment and penetration testing regime for critical systems before deployment and\non a regular basis annually; and\n(g)\n\nThe financial penalty that the Commissioner intended to impose seemed\n\nexcessive in light of previous decisions for similar or even more serious breaches.\n\n4\n\n\fSingapore Red Cross Society\n\n10\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 16\n\nWith respect to the representations on the nature and purpose of the Organisation, the\n\nfact that the Organisation is a charity cannot be a mitigating factor, and its charitable status\ncannot lower the standard expected of it in complying with its obligations under the PDPA.\nThe admitted failures on the Organisation’s part at [5] clearly fell short of the standard of\nprotection required for the Personal Data stored in the Database.\n11\n\nAs for the Organisation’s representations comparing the present case to previous\n\ndecisions, it needs only to be said that each decision is based on the unique facts of each case.\nThe decision in each case takes into consideration the specific facts of the case so as to ensure\nthat the decision and direction(s) are fair and appropriate for that particular organisation.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n12\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has decided to\n\nreduce the financial penalty to the amount set out at [13]. The quantum of financial penalty has\nbeen determined after due consideration of the appropriate weight to be given to:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation’s upfront voluntary admission of liability which significantly\n\nreduced the time and resources required for investigations under the Expedited Breach\nDecision procedure;3 and\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation’s comprehensive remedial actions at [9(f)] to address the\n\ninadequacies in its procedures and processes that contributed to the Incident.\n13.\n\nTaking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances, the Commissioner directs\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $5,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe direction, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect\nof judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full. Although a lower financial\n\n3\n\nSee the Commission’s Guide on Active Enforcement at page 21\n\n5\n\n\fSingapore Red Cross Society\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 16\n\npenalty has been imposed in this case, this is exceptional and should not be taken as\nsetting any precedent for future cases.\n14.\n\nIn view of the remedial measures taken by the Organisation, the Commissioner has not\nimposed any other directions.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $5,000 was imposed on Singapore Accountancy Commission for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of 6,541 Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification programme personnel and candidates’ personal data.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Professional","Scientific and Technical","Unintended recipient","Email attachments"],"date":"2020-08-03","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Singapore-Accountancy-Commission---22062020.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Singapore Accountancy Commission","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2020/08/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-singapore-accountancy-commission","timestamp":"2020-08-03","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-1911-B5296\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nSingapore Accountancy Commission\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 November 2019, Singapore Accountancy Commission (the “Organisation”)\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that a folder\ncontaining personal data of 6,541 Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification\nprogramme personnel and candidates was mistakenly enclosed in emails sent to 41\nunintended recipients between 12 June 2019 and 22 October 2019.

DP-1903-B3630, DP-1908-B4431\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n1. Zero1 Pte. Ltd.\n2. IP Tribe Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, Zero1 Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) voluntarily informed the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that invoices\ncontaining the personal data of their subscribers had been emailed to unintended\nrecipients (the “Incident”). Each invoice contained the name, address,\nsubscriber ID, mobile number, mobile charges, and the call details of any\ninternational calls made by a subscriber (the “Personal Data”). Each email\ncontained a subscriber’s invoice which was unintendedly sent to another\nsubscriber instead.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation was a licensed Mobile Virtual Network Operation that provided\nmobile services. It partnered Singtel Mobile Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“Singtel”),\nwhich appointed IP Tribe Pte Ltd (“IPT”) to develop and deploy a Mobile Virtual\nNetwork Enabler (the “1st Platform”) to manage subscriber accounts.\n\n3.\n\nIPT ran the 1st Platform for the Organisation, including generating and sending\nmonthly emails to subscribers. IPT then subcontracted the provision of the billing\nsystem within the 1st Platform to Openet Telecom Sales Limited (“Openet”). The\n1st Platform was deployed in August 2018.\n\n4.\n\nA replacement platform (the “New Platform”) was deployed in 2019. Openet\nsubcontracted 6D Technologies (“6D”) to migrate subscriber data from the 1st\nPlatform to the New Platform. In February 2019, 6D migrated the data of 12,000\nto 15,000 subscribers.\n\n5.\n\nThe Incident was caused by Batch ID duplication. The Batch ID was a unique\nnumber that tagged each subscriber to his name and email address. The\nmigration was staggered and some errors made it necessary to delete data\n\n\fmigrated earlier. However, due to a coding error, not all previously migrated data\nhad been deleted. The New Platform failed to recognise the Batch IDs that were\nnot deleted and re-issued the same Batch IDs. As a result, 118 invoices\nbelonging to subscribers with duplicated Batch IDs were affected. Since each\nBatch ID determined the email address to which an invoice was sent, Batch ID\nduplication resulted in the New Platform emailing the 118 invoices to the wrong\naddresses.\n6.\n\nBefore a new IT system or a change to an IT system goes live, pre-launch testing\nis important to determine that the system would run as expected. The\nOrganisation, IPT and 6D jointly conducted pre-launch testing. The Organisation\nas the end user, and IPT as the Organisation’s data intermediary, should have\nscoped the pre-launch testing to include a simulation of expected scenarios. In\nparticular, the scenario in which migration to the New Platform is staggered and\na high volume of email addresses would have been assigned Batch IDs for the\nsending of emails to the right subscriber (“Migration Scenario”).\n\n7.\n\nHowever, in the pre-launch testing, the Migration Scenario was not catered for.\nOnly two test accounts were used to check that the New Platform could generate\nand email invoices to the right parties. This was insufficient to simulate expected\nusage. Consequently, the tests failed to surface this issue.\n\n8.\n\nThe proper scoping of pre-launching testing is important for the detection of\nfunctionality issues that may put personal data at risk. In failing to simulate the\nexpected scenarios, in particular the Migration Scenario, the Organisation and\nIPT failed to meet the reasonable standard required to discharge the Protection\nObligation.\n\n9.\n\nFurthermore, the processes to ensure that the New Platform would issue unique\nBatch IDs were inadequate. A date/time stamp could have been included as part\nof each Batch ID to avoid duplication, which was implemented only after the\nIncident.\n\n10. In deciding to find the Organisation and IPT respectively in breach of the\nProtection Obligation under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”)\nand to issue a Warning to each party, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal\nData Protection took into account the following:\na. Although the Organisation neither owned nor operated the New Platform, it\nremained a data controller in control of its subscribers’ Personal Data.\nb. IPT was the Organisation’s data intermediary in developing the New Platform,\nwhich included migration of the personal data of subscribers. IPT relied on\nOpenet as its subcontractor, and the Batch ID duplication occurred as a result\nof errors during the migration that was performed by 6D. Notwithstanding the\nrepresentations made by IPT, it retained a key role, together with the\nOrganisation, in scoping the pre-launch testing of the New Platform.\n\n\fc. The tests proved to be inadequate and a reasonable opportunity to prevent\nthe Incident was missed. For this, both the Organisation and IPT bore\nresponsibility.\n11. No directions are required as the Organisation and IPT had taken remedial\nactions to address the gaps in security arrangements respectively.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Actstitude for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of individuals' personal data.

The URLs generated by the Organisation could also be\nmanipulated to access resume files uploaded by different individuals.\n\n3.\n\nWhen the webpage was created on 5 July 2018, the Organisation did not conduct\nvulnerability scanning as part of pre-launch testing; neither did the Organisation\nconduct periodic security reviews. Such scans offer a reasonable chance of detecting\nboth the lack of access controls and the vulnerability of the URLs to manipulation.\n\n\f4.\n\nThe result of this failure to put in place access controls or to conduct security testing\nwas that Google indexed and disclosed the URLs when a search was made of the names\nin the uploaded resumes.

On 3 May 2019, the Organisation notified the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) that dividend cheques of some CDP Account\nHolders had been mailed to outdated addresses, resulting in the disclosure of their personal\ndata to other individuals.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nPrior to 10 December 2018, the Organisation used a software known as the Post Trade\n\nSystem (“PTS”) for the purposes of post trade processing. The Organisation developed and\ncustomised additional modules that interfaced with PTS, including a module for the printing\nof dividend cheques (“Dividend Cheque Module”). The Dividend Cheque Module was used\nto automate the generation of dividend cheque mailers (i.e. mailers enclosing dividend cheques\nto be posted to CDP Account Holders).\n3\n\nSubsequently, the Organisation purchased another software, the New Post Trade\n\nSystem (“NPTS”) to replace the PTS. In comparison to the PTS, the NPTS facilitated record\nkeeping that was more comprehensive. The PTS only recorded a CDP Account Holder’s latest\naddress, while the NPTS kept records of the CDP Account Holder’s updated address as well\nas historical addresses.1 Arising from the new feature of the NPTS that kept records of CDP\nAccount Holders’ updated addresses and historical addresses, the Organisation updated the\nprogramming logic of the Dividend Cheque Module (and all other modules that required\nretrieving of addresses) to extract the CDP Account Holders’ updated addresses.\n\n1\n\nAs there was only one address for each CDP Account Holder stored in the PTS, a query for the address would\nalways extract that address of the CDP Account Holder.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nPrior to migration from PTS to NPTS, the Organisation conducted several tests, which\n\nincluded the following:\n(a)\n\nA test for the change of address for the module that generated notification letters\n\nacknowledging a change of address. This included checking that the notification letters\nextracted the updated address (the “Notification Letters Test”);\n(b)\n\nA test for the extraction of CDP Account Holders’ personal data for the\n\nDividend Cheque Module. The scope of this test did not include the scenario of change\nof address (i.e. whether the Dividend Cheque Module would extract the updated address\nin the event a CDP Account Holder changed its address) (the “Dividend Cheque\nModule Test”); and\n(c)\n\nManual code review of the additional modules (including the Dividend Cheque\n\nModule).\n5\n\nOn 10 December 2018, the Organisation migrated from PTS to NPTS. As the tests\n\nmentioned at [4] did not detect any errors, the Organisation was unaware that the Dividend\nCheque Module may not consistently extract a CDP Account Holder’s updated address.\n6\n\nOn 20 March 2019, a CDP Account Holder complained that the Organisation had\n\nmailed a cheque for dividends to an outdated address (“First Incident”). The Organisation\ncommenced investigations immediately. However, the Organisation’s technical team was\nunable to replicate the error and identify the issue that caused the First Incident. The results for\nthe Dividend Cheque Module Test returned the correct addresses, including the complainant’s\ncorrect address.\n7\n\nSubsequently, on 12 April 2019, the Organisation’s customer service team received an\n\nemail from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) in relation to a complaint (“Second\nIncident”). Meanwhile, notwithstanding that the Organisation’s technical team was unable to\nidentify the issue that caused the First Incident, to further reinforce the programming logic,\nthey introduced a defensive measure with a clause to consistently extract the updated addresses\n(the “Fix”). On 20 April 2019, the Organisation deployed the Fix into the production\nenvironment.\n\n3\n\n\f8\n\nAfter several rounds of correspondence and additional information provided by MAS\n\non 30 April 2019 in relation to the Second Incident, the Organisation realised that the issue\npertaining to the First Incident and Second Incident may have a wider impact than originally\nanticipated. The Organisation conducted further investigations which revealed that all of the\nmodules involving the retrieval of addresses were correctly coded except the Dividend Cheque\nModule. The error in the code in the Dividend Cheque Module (which resulted in the\nprogramme logic not consistently extracting a CDP Account Holder’s updated address) had\ncaused the First Incident and Second Incident. Due to the implementation of the Fix as\nmentioned at [7], the error had been permanently resolved by this time.\n9\n\nAccording to the Organisation, 542 CDP Account Holders were due to receive dividend\n\ncheque mailers, and had previously updated their addresses. Out of the 542 CDP Account\nHolders whose personal data was at risk of unauthorised disclosure, the Organisation confirmed\nthat 331 CDP Account Holders had presented their dividend cheques, indicating that their\ndividend cheque mailers had been sent to the correct addresses. By deduction, there were\naccordingly 211 CDP Account Holders (“Affected Individuals”) whose dividend cheque\nmailers were sent to outdated addresses.\n10\n\nThe information disclosed in the dividend cheque mailers (collectively, “Disclosed\n\nData”) were:\n\n11\n\n(a)\n\nName of client;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nCentral Depository (Pte) Limited (“CDP”) account number;\n\n(d)\n\nName of security;\n\n(e)\n\nQuantity of security held; and\n\n(f)\n\nDividend amount.\n\nDuring the course of its investigations into the First Incident and Second Incident, the\n\nOrganisation took the following remedial actions:\n\n4\n\n\f(a)\n\nOn 20 April 2019, introduced an additional measure to ensure that the updated\n\naddress of CDP Account Holders would be extracted in the Dividend Cheque Printing\nModule;\n(b)\n\nReviewed all modules which interfaced with NPTS and which involved the\n\nextraction of addresses to confirm that the error was specific only to the Dividend\nCheque Module; and\n(c)\n\nRe-issued replacement cheques and explanation letters to the Affected\n\nIndividuals.\n12\n\nIn addition, the Organisation will also be conducting refresher training to ensure that\n\nits teams report issues under their respective purview as soon as practicable (even when similar\ntype of issues had previously been raised), so that necessary follow up action may be taken.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n13\n\nIt is undisputed that the Disclosed Data constitutes “personal data” as defined in section\n\n2(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), and the Organisation had possession\nand/or control over the Disclosed Data at all material times.\n14\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. The fact that the Disclosed Data included NRIC numbers and personal data of a financial\nnature (i.e. CDP account number, name and quantity of security held, and dividend amount) is\nrelevant in assessing the standard of reasonable security arrangements required. As emphasized\nin previous decisions, when it comes to the protection of personal data of a sensitive nature,\nstronger security measures must be put in place due to the actual or potential harm, and the\nseverity of such harm, that may befall an individual from an unauthorised use of such data. 2\nHaving in mind the sensitivity of the Disclosed Data, the Organisation failed to put in place\n2\n\nSee for example, Re Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [25]; Re Aviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC\n4 at [17]; DS Human Resource Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 16 at [9(c)]; and AIA Singapore Private Limited\n[2019] SGPDPC 20 at [12].\n\n5\n\n\freasonable security arrangements to protect the Disclosed Data for the reasons explained\nbelow.\n15\n\nWhen the Organisation migrated from PTS to NPTS, it had an obligation to conduct\n\nproper and adequate testing of the NPTS and its implementation that simulated real world usage\nof the system. This was critical in order to prevent errors from compromising the security of\nthe Disclosed Data. In particular, and as mentioned at [3], the NPTS had a new feature which\nkept records of both the updated addresses of CDP Account Holders as well as their historical\naddresses, and the Organisation was relying on the NPTS and its customised additional\nmodules to extract the correct address when generating the dividend cheque mailers.\n16\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation failed to conduct\n\nsufficient testing before migrating from PTS to NPTS for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nFirst, the scope of the testing for the Dividend Cheque Module was too narrow\n\nand did not include the scenario of change of address. This omission was unacceptable\ngiven that (i) change of address was a known scenario (which was tested in the module\nwith respect to generation of notification letters that acknowledged change of address);\nand (ii) the Organisation relied on the Dividend Cheque Module to extract the updated\naddress and automate the generation of dividend cheque mailers;\n(b)\n\nSecondly, the Organisation should have tested the Dividend Cheque Module in\n\nan environment that simulated real world usage of the system. This required the\nOrganisation to not only scope the tests to include the change of address scenario, but\nalso to have a sufficient number of test cases to properly test these scenarios; and\n(c)\n\nThirdly, the Organisation had conceded that there was a “reasonable chance”\n\nthat the error in the Dividend Cheque Module may have been detected if the scope of\nthe tests had included the change of address scenario with a sufficient number of tests\ncases.\n17\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in breach of section\n\n24 of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\fRepresentations by the Organisation\n18\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations on the\n\namount of financial penalty that was to be imposed. The Organisation raised the following\nfactors for consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had expended its best efforts in testing:\n(i)\n\nPrior to migration from PTS to NPTS, the Organisation carried out the\n\nNotification Letter Test and the Dividend Cheque Module Test. Both tests did\nnot return any errors. In view of this, the Organisation did not contemplate\nfurther targeted testing at the material time.\n(ii)\n\nEven if the Organisation had expanded the scope of the Dividend\n\nCheque Module Test to cover the change of address scenario and increased the\nrelevant test cases, such testing may have still failed to reveal the defect. In this\nregard, after being informed of the First Incident, the Organisation was unable\nto replicate the error through repeated testing with real world cases.\n(b)\n\nThere was no risk of actual financial loss.\n(i)\n\nThe dividend cheques were made out to the names of the Affected\n\nIndividuals and could only be encashed into accounts bearing such names.\n(ii)\n\nThe Disclosed Data of each Affected Individual was disclosed only to a\n\nsingle recipient, as opposed to the world at large. The Disclosed Data was also\ninsufficient, in and of itself, to be used by a recipient to impersonate or execute\nany transaction in the name of an Affected Individual.\n(iii)\n\nThe Organisation used a specific envelope for the mailing of dividend\n\ncheques to minimise unauthorised access to the Disclosed Data, save in wilful\ncircumstances. Each envelope was marked “Private & Confidential” and “To be\nopened by addressee only”. A return address was printed on the face of the\nenvelope, to cater for the event that the letter was not properly delivered to the\naddressee.\n\n7\n\n\f(c)\n\nUpon establishing the number of dividend cheques affected on 3 May 2019, the\n\nOrganisation promptly notified the Affected Individuals and the Commission. The\nOrganisation also took proactive and prompt remedial steps at [11].\n(d)\n\nThe financial penalty imposed should be consistent with the Commission’s\n\nprevious decisions and commensurate with the scale of the Incident. Taking into\nconsideration the number of Affected Individuals in the present case and financial\npenalties imposed in the Commission’s previous decisions involving similar number of\naffected individuals, a warning would suffice. In the alternative, the Organisation\nsubmitted that any financial penalty imposed should not exceed $5,000.\n19\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has decided to\n\nmaintain the financial penalty set out at [21] for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nAs explained in [15] to [16], the Organisation failed to conduct sufficient testing\n\nbefore migrating from PTS to NPTS. The module that generated notification letters\nacknowledging a change of address was coded independently from the Dividend\nCheque Module. The Organisation should not have relied on test results from the\nNotification Letters Test as assurance that there were no errors in the Dividend Cheque\nModule, and it would consistently extract a CDP Account Holder’s updated address.\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation’s representations that there was no risk of financial loss\n\ncannot be accepted. Although the risk of financial loss was reduced because the\ndividend cheques were made out to the names of the Affected Individuals, there was\nstill a risk of fraud i.e. the unauthorised individuals who received the dividend cheque\nmailers could have fraudulently altered the names on the dividend cheques and\npresented them for encashment. In addition, for the period between the Incident and the\nOrganisation issuing the replacement cheques, the Affected Individuals would have\nbeen deprived of the use of funds they would have otherwise access to. As for the\nOrganisation’s representations on the specific envelopes used for the mailing of\ndividend cheques, the fact that the dividend cheques mailers were sent to unauthorised\nindividuals meant that there was a risk of further unauthorised access, use and\ndisclosure of the Disclosed Data.\n\n8\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe Organisation’s voluntary notification of the Incident to Affected\n\nIndividuals and the Commission, as well as the Organisation’s proactive and prompt\nremedial steps had already been taken into consideration in determining the financial\npenalty at [21].\n(d)\n\nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations comparing the present case\n\nto earlier decisions, it needs only to be said that each decision is based on the unique\nfacts of each case. The decision in each case takes into consideration the specific facts\nof the case so as to ensure that the decision and direction(s) are fair and appropriate for\nthat particular organisation.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n20\n\nIn the assessment of the breach and determination of the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the PDPA, the fact that the Affected\nIndividuals were put at risk of actual financial loss was an aggravating factor. The dividend\ncheques mailers were sent to outdated addresses and there was a risk that they may have been\nbanked in by unauthorised persons. The Affected Individuals would also have been deprived\nof the use of the funds they would have otherwise access to, had they received and banked in\nthe dividend cheques. On the other hand, the following mitigating factors were also considered:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial actions to rectify the error and mitigate\n\nthe effects of the breach; and\n(b)\n21\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations.\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Commissioner hereby\n\ndirects the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $32,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe directions, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full. The Commissioner has not set out any further\ndirections given the remediation measures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n9\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on MDIS Corporation for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of individuals on its website.

The\nComplainant was able to access the Spreadsheet through a Google search of her\nNRIC number on 2 May and 17 June 2019 (the “First Incident” and “Second\nIncident” respectively).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a not-for-profit, professional institute for lifelong\n\nlearning. The Organisation’s server and webpage were maintained by a web\ndevelopment vendor (the “Vendor”). In October 2017, the Organisation\nengaged the Vendor to develop its website (the “Website”) to include a content\nmanagement system (“CMS”) for the Organisation to manage training and\ncourses provided, and an online registration form (the “Form”) for course\nparticipants to provide their personal data. The purpose of the Form was for the\nOrganisation to use the personal data collected to identify course attendees,\ncreate certificates for individuals who had completed their courses and verify\ntheir details for the purposes of claiming SkillsFuture credits. The Vendor\n\n\fsubsequently engaged a freelance developer based in India (the “Developer”)\nto assist in developing the Website.\n3\n\nThere were no written contracts between (i) the Organisation and the\n\nVendor; and (ii) the Vendor and the Developer setting out the parties’ respective\nscope of work and responsibilities with respect to the development of the\nWebsite. During development of the Website, the Organisation conveyed its\ninstructions for the Website via telephone to the Vendor, and the Vendor acted\nas the middleman between the Organisation and the Developer. From time to\ntime, the Organisation would also contact the Developer directly.\n4\n\nIn December 2017, the Organisation and the Vendor carried out pre-\n\nlaunch testing on the Website (including the Form). In September 2018, the\nOrganisation approved the Website for launch and the Website went “live”\nshortly after. Between September 2018 and February 2019, the Vendor assisted\nto rectify various features on the Website that were not developed to the\nOrganisation’s expectations. The Organisation terminated the Vendor’s\nengagement in or around February 2019 as it was not satisfied with the Vendor’s\nservice.\n5\n\nThe First Incident occurred on 2 May 2019 when the Complainant\n\nentered her NRIC number into a Google search. The search result was a URL\nlink displaying partial information about the Complainant, including NRIC\nnumber, email address and mobile phone number (the “Spreadsheet Link”).\nThe Complainant clicked on the Spreadsheet Link which led to the Spreadsheet\ncontaining the following information of 304 individuals including the\nComplainant’s (the “Disclosed Data”):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n2\n\n\f6\n\n(b)\n\nDesignation;\n\n(c)\n\nCitizenship;\n\n(d)\n\nNRIC number / identification number (for foreigners);\n\n(e)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(f)\n\nName of Company name that the individual worked for;\n\n(g)\n\nRegistration type;\n\n(h)\n\nContact number;\n\n(i)\n\nBilling address;\n\n(j)\n\nCountry;\n\n(k)\n\nContact person; and\n\n(l)\n\nCourse title, course code and date.\n\nOn the same day, the Complainant notified the Commission and the\n\nOrganisation about the First Incident. The Organisation promptly took the\nfollowing remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nBlocked the CMS administrative backend;\n\n(b)\n\nInserted a “robot.txt” file to prevent search engines from\n\ncrawling the Website; and\n(c)\n\nSubmitted a removal request to Google to ensure cached\n\nversions of Spreadsheet Link would be removed from search results.\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nIn addition, as part of the Organisation’s investigations, it periodically\n\nremoved the blockage on the CMS administrative backend to test and replicate\nthe First Incident.\n8\n\nThe Second Incident occurred on 17 June 2019 when the Complainant\n\nentered her NRIC number into a Google search and was again able to access the\nSpreadsheet Link and Spreadsheet. According to the Organisation, the Second\nIncident occurred because the Complainant carried out the Google search of her\nNRIC number at the same time that the Organisation had removed the blockage\non the CMS administrative backend to conduct tests on the First Incident.\n9\n\nAs of 19 June 2019, the Organisation’s newly appointed vendor\n\ndeployed security patches on the Website and removed the codes that caused\nthe First Incident and Second Incident. As part of the Organisation’s remedial\nactions, a new backend system for the Website will also be deployed.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n10\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned the Website and was in\n\npossession and control of the Disclosed Data (collected through the Form) at all\nmaterial times. While the Vendor and the Developer were engaged to develop\nthe Website, the Organisation confirmed that neither of them processed the\nDisclosed Data on the Organisation’s behalf. Both the Vendor and Developer\nwere accordingly not data intermediaries, and the responsibility to protect the\nDisclosed Data fell squarely and solely on the Organisation.\n11\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by taking reasonable steps or arrangements\nto prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\n\n4\n\n\fmodification, disposal or similar risks. The Organisation failed to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Disclosed Data for the reasons\nexplained below.\n12\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to communicate any data protection\n\nrequirements to the Vendor or the Developer.\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation conceded that it did not have a written contract\n\nwith the Vendor in relation to the development of the Website. There\nwas also no written contract between the Vendor and Developer. As\nemphasized in previous decisions and the Commission’s Guide on\nBuilding Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1],\norganisations that engage IT vendors to develop and/or maintain their\nwebsites should ensure that their IT vendors are aware of the need for\npersonal data protection by making it part of their contractual terms.1\n(b)\n\nAccording to the Organisation, it had verbally communicated\n\ndata protection requirements to the Vendor and Developer. In contrast,\nthe Vendor asserted that there was no such communication. As the data\ncontroller and customer, the Organisation ought to be clear about the\nscope of services that it is procuring from its service providers, and\ndocument the scope properly in contract and other project\ndocumentation.2 In this case, the Organisation was not able to produce\nanything in writing to corroborate its assertions. In the circumstances,\nthe Commissioner finds that the Organisation failed to communicate\ndata protection requirements to the Vendor and Developer.\n\n1\n\nSee for example Re EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 38 at [11].\n\n2\n\nRe Royal Carribean Cruises (Asia) Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 5 at [12]\n\n5\n\n\f(c)\n\nGiven that one of the purposes of developing the Website was to\n\ncollect Disclosed Data through the Form, the Organisation’s failure to\nspecify clear requirements with respect to the protection of personal data\nis particularly glaring.\n13\n\nSecond, prior to the launch of the Website, the Organisation failed to\n\ntake reasonable steps to scope the pre-launch testing to discover risks to the\nDisclosed Data that was collected through the Form. As a result, the\nvulnerability in the CMS administrative backend of the Website (which allowed\nGoogle to crawl and index the Spreadsheet Link) remained undetected prior to\nthe First Incident.\n(a)\n\nWebsites connected to the Internet are subject to a multitude of\n\ncyber threats that may compromise the website and expose any personal\ndata collected. The Commissioner takes this opportunity to reiterate that\norganisations should ensure protection of personal data and the security\nof the website is a key design consideration at each stage of the website’s\nlife cycle, including requirements gathering, design and development,\nUAT, deployment and operations support.3\n(b)\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that the pre-launch\n\ntesting conducted prior to launch of the Website focused on its\nfunctionality. According to the Organisation, it believed that the\npassword protection to the administrative panel was “secure enough”.\nIn this regard, the Organisation admitted that it did not inform the\n\n3\n\nSee Commission’s Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [3.2 – 3.3]\nand Re Horizon Horizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 27 at [26]\n\n6\n\n\fVendor of the requirement to secure personal data collected through the\nForm.\n(c)\n\nThe omission to include security testing prior to the launch of the\n\nWebsite is particularly concerning given that:\n(i)\n\nThe purpose of the Form was to collect Disclosed Data\n\nfrom individuals participating in the Organisation’s courses; and\n(ii)\n\nThe Organisation knew that the administrative panel had\n\nan export function which collated the Disclosed Data (entered by\ncourse participants in the Form) into the Spreadsheet. The export\nfunction could be triggered either by clicking on the export\nbutton in the administrative panel or by clicking on the\nSpreadsheet Link. The Spreadsheet link was not intended to be\npublicly available and should have only been accessible with\nvalid login credentials.\n(d)\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation should have scoped the\n\npre-launch testing to verify that password protection measures on the\nadministrative panel and the login credentials on the Spreadsheet Link\noperated as intended.\n14\n\nDuring the course of the Commission’s investigations, the Organisation\n\nasserted that it was not an IT services provider, and therefore had relied on its\nVendor to identify the risks and implement the appropriate security measures\nfor the Website. This is not an acceptable explanation. It should be reiterated\nthat while organisations may delegate work to vendors to comply with the\nPDPA, the organisation’s responsibility for complying with statutory\n\n7\n\n\fobligations under the PDPA may not be delegated.4 While an organisation may\nnot have — or need to have — the requisite level of technical expertise, a\nresponsible organisation would have engaged competent service providers and\nmade genuine attempts to give proper instructions.5 The Organisation is only\nexpected to articulate its business requirements as owner of the system, which\nthe service provider can translate into technical requirements. In addition, as the\ndata controller, the Organisation is required to exercise reasonable oversight to\nensure that its instructions are carried out.6 In this case, and as mentioned at\n[12], the Organisation failed to provide any data protection instructions to either\nthe Vendor or the Developer. The Commission’s investigations also revealed\nthat the Organisation did not exercise reasonable oversight in respect of the\nsecurity arrangements for the Website.\n15\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n16\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account the\nfollowing mitigating factors:\n\n4\n\nRe WTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 26 at 23; Re National Healthcare\nGroup [2019] SGPDPC 46 at [17]\n\n5\n\nRe WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26 at [24]; Re DS Human Resource Pte.\nLtd.

The Directory was one of the files stored on the NAS. The\n2\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nOrganisation did not intend for the NAS to be connected to the Internet. Prior\nto the Incident, the Organisation was unaware that the Directory could be\naccessed via an Internet Protocol address without the need for any login\ncredentials.\n\n3\n\nThe Directory contained personal data of 562 individuals collected for\n\nthe purposes of complying with the Building Maintenance and Strata\nManagement Act, the Building Maintenance (Strata Management) Regulations\n2005, as well as to contact subsidiary proprietors of the Organisation.\n\n4\n\nThe following types of personal data of the Affected Individuals were\n\nexposed to the risk of unauthorised disclosure (collectively, the “Disclosed\nData”):\n(a)\n\n12 council members of the Organisation: Name; NRIC / Passport\n\nNumber; Contact number; Email address; and\n(b)\n\n550 subsidiary proprietors of the Organisation: Name; Email\n\naddress; Contact number; Block and Unit number; Change of property\n\n3\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nownership details; Identity of resident; Statement of accounts; Car plate\nnumbers; Figures in relation to share values/arrears.1\n\n5\n\nUpon being informed of the Incident by the Commission on 2 September\n\n2019, the Organisation promptly disconnected the NAS from the Internet on the\nsame day.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n\n6\n\nIn today’s digital age, many organisations are moving towards paperless\n\noffices. Through digitisation, an increasing amount of information (including\npersonal data) is stored electronically and online. This has resulted in a higher\nrisk of data breaches involving IT security vulnerabilities.

Given the increasing number of cases involving IT security\nvulnerabilities, including the present one, I would like to take this opportunity\nto highlight some of the measures that organisations could implement in order\nto comply with their obligations under Section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n7\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\nIn my view, the Organisation failed to put in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect the Disclosed Data and was in breach of the Protection\nObligation for the reasons explained below.\n\n8\n\nIn an IT security context, timely detection of risks to personal data is key\n\nto an organisation’s compliance with the Protection Obligation. As explained\nand discussed below, there are two key measures that organisations should\nimplement to detect IT security vulnerabilities.\n\n4\n\nSee Re Fu Kwee Kitchen Catering Services & anor [2016] SGPDPC 14; Re Tutor City [2019]\nSGPDPC 5; Re Advance Home Tutors [2019] SGPDPC 35; Re SearchAsia Consulting Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 40; and Re Society of Tourist Guides (Singapore) [2019] SGPDC 48.\n\n5\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n9\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nFirst, organisations should conduct code reviews5 and pre-launch\n\ntesting6 before new IT features or changes to IT systems are deployed. These\nprocesses allow organisations to pick up and rectify errors and/or flaws in the\nnew IT features and/or systems prior to deployment. There have been a number\nof cases where errors in the application code resulted in the unintended\ndisclosure of personal data or unintended access to personal data: see, for\nexample, Re Singapore Telecommunications Limited [2019] SGPDPC 367, and\nRe Flight Raja Travels Singapore Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 168. This is\nparticularly important if the new IT feature is accessible from the Internet, and\ntherefore exposed to a “multitude of cyber threats that may compromise the\nwebsite and expose any personal data [the organisation] collects” 9.\n\n5\n\nDepending on the complexity and scope of the new code/system, organisations may conduct\nthe code reviews manually, or with the appropriate automated code review software and tools.\n6\n\nThis may include load testing, stress testing and/or integration testing.\n\nThere was unauthorised disclosure of personal data of the organisation’s customers due to a\ndirect object reference vulnerability (which was a design issue in the organisation’s mobile\napp’s application programming interface).\n7\n\n8\n\nThe organisation introduced a new mobile application that allowed access to the online booking\nsystem through mobile devices without login. This resulted in some of the organisation’s\ncustomers having unauthorised access to booking records (containing personal data) of other\ncustomers.\n9\n\nSee Re Horizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 27 at [26].\n\n6\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n10\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nSecond, organisations should conduct periodic security reviews of its IT\n\nsystems10. The comprehensiveness of such security reviews should be scoped\nbased on the organisation’s assessment of its data protection needs. For\nexample, periodic security reviews would not typically include penetration tests\nfor most systems that are within the internal corporate network. However,\norganisations with Internet-facing IT systems that contain personal data that is\nsensitive in nature should consider conducting penetration testing as part of their\nperiodic security reviews.\n\n11\n\nGenerally, as part of the periodic security review of its IT systems,\n\norganisations should avail themselves of up-to-date online vulnerability\nscanning tools, and are expected to acquire reasonable proficiency in their use\nor seek assistance by engaging vendors with the appropriate expertise11. The use\nof such tools provides organisations a reasonable chance of detecting common\nsecurity vulnerabilities in their IT systems12.\n\n10\n\nAs set out by the Commissioner in a number of previous decisions, including Re WTS\nAutomotive Services Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 26 at [18], Re Bud Cosmetics [2019] SGPDPC\n1 at [24] and Re Chizzle Pte. Ltd. [2019] SGPDPC 44 at [6] to [8].\n11\n\nSee Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26 at [24], and Re DS Human\nResources Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 16 at [15(a)].\n12\n\nFor example, see the OWASP Top Ten at: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/.\n\n7\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n12\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nAs a complement to the use of up-to-date online vulnerability scanning\n\ntools, the periodic security review of an organisation’s IT systems should also\ninclude a manual component. This would include review of password\nmanagement policies13, archival of personal data that no longer needs to be\nstored online to near-line or off-line storage14, and purging of personal data that\nno longer serves any legal or business purpose for the organisation.\n\n13\n\nIn addition, it is important for an organisation to be aware of and track\n\nits personal data assets. The creation and maintenance of a personal data asset\nregister (i.e. a record identifying all personal data in the organisation’s\npossession or control) is a good practice that would assist organisations to\ncomply with the Protection Obligation. An up-to-date personal data asset\nregister provides the organisation with an accurate record of all the personal\ndata in its possession or control, and enables the organisation to ensure its\nperiodic security reviews covers the personal data assets. It also enables the\norganisation to more effectively review the implementation of its data\nprotection policies, for example, the access control list setting out the employees\nwho have access to the IT systems the personal data asset is stored in, whether\n\n13\n\nSee Re GlogbalSign.in Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 43.\n\n14\n\nSee Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte.

The Organisation ought to have\nformulated a policy for the NAS and the Directory, implemented the IT security\npractices that gives effect to the policy and conducted periodic security reviews\nto ensure that the practices are adequate. For example, if the intention was to\npermit access to the NAS and the Directory from the Internet, then the policy\nshould establish who should have access and the level of sensitivity of the\npersonal data; the IT security practices would then implement the right level of\nsecurity measures to control access to the personal data and protect the personal\ndata during its transmission. On the contrary, if the intention was to restrict the\nNAS and the Directory to the internal corporate network, then the practices to\nimplement this policy would include considerations like whether the NAS and\n\n15\n\nThis includes aspects like whether the personal data is accurate and how recently it was\nupdated: see The Commission’s Model ArtificiaI Intelligence Governance Framework (Second\nEdition) at page 38.\n\n9\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nthe Directory was connected to the right segment of the corporate network and\nwhether their configuration was effective in limiting access to users from within\nthe corporate network. In view of the Organisation’s admission, and the lack of\nany security measures to protect the Disclosed Data stored in the Directory, I\nfind the Organisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nConclusion\n\n15\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder section 29 of the PDPA, I took into account the following mitigating\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nThe majority of the Affected Individual’s Disclosed Data\n\nexposed to risk of unauthorised access, use and/or disclosure related\nonly to contact information;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation’s took prompt remedial action to disconnect\n\nthe NAS from the Internet; and\n(c)\n\nThere was no evidence of actual misuse or exfiltration of the\n\nDisclosed Data.\n\n16\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, I have decided to\n\nissue a warning to the Organisation for the breach of its obligations under\n\n10\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 10\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.

In November 2014, MCST 3593 had also engaged New-E to provide security services at\nthe Condominium. ETCPM’s scope of work as managing agent included supervising New-E\nto ensure it carried out its duties properly.\n3\n\nOn 1 February 2019, an owner resident of a unit at the Condominium (the “Resident”)\n\napproached the security supervisor on duty, who was an employee of New-E (the “Security\nSupervisor”), to request a copy of the CCTV footage of the Condominium’s lobby on 29\nJanuary 2019 between 9.00 pm to 9.30 pm (the “Requested CCTV Footage”). The Requested\nCCTV Footage had captured images of identifiable individuals who had passed through the\ncommon property during that period, and hence contained personal data of those individuals.\nThe Security Supervisor proceeded to review the CCTV recordings and used his mobile phone\nto record a copy of the Requested CCTV Footage. The Security Supervisor then sent a copy of\nthe Requested CCTV Footage which he had recorded on his mobile phone to the Resident using\nWhatsApp messenger. The Security Supervisor also sent a copy of the same footage to the\nresidence manager of the Condominium, who was an employee of ETCPM (the “Residence\n2\n\n\fManager”). Upon receiving the copy of the Requested CCTV Footage, the Residence Manager\ncontacted the Security Supervisor who informed him of the Resident’s request. The Residence\nManager instructed the Security Supervisor not to release the Requested CCTV Footage to the\nResident and to await further instructions. At that time, the Security Supervisor did not inform\nthe Residence Manager that he had already sent a copy of the Requested CCTV Footage to the\nResident.\n4\n\nOn 2 February 2019, ETCPM informed MCST 3593 of the Resident’s request. MCST\n\n3593 decided not to disclose the Requested CCTV Footage to the Resident and the Residence\nManager conveyed MCST 3593’s decision to the Security Supervisor. Both MCST 3593 and\nETCPM remained unaware that the Security Supervisor had already sent a copy of the\nRequested CCTV Footage to the Resident.\n5\n\nOn 9 February 2019, the Residence Manager was notified that the Resident’s Facebook\n\npage contained a post with a copy of the Requested CCTV Footage (the “Facebook Post”). On\n11 February 2019, the Residence Manager contacted the operations director of New-E to\ninform him of the matter. On the same day, the Security Supervisor admitted to the Operation\nDirector of New-E that he had sent a copy of the Requested CCTV Footage to the Resident on\n1 February 2019. On 13 February 2019, ETCPM informed MCST 3593 of the unauthorised\ndisclosure of the Requested CCTV Footage by the Security Supervisor to the Resident and the\nFacebook Post.\n6\n\nSince the discovery of the Incident, the following remedial actions have been taken:\n(a)\n\nMCST 3593 appointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) and implemented its\n\nPersonal Data Protection Policy and Standard Operating Procedure to comply with the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). MCST 3593 also informed the\nCommission that it will also be preparing and including additional data processing\nprovisions in addendum(s) to the respective contracts with its managing agent and\nsecurity company; and\n(b)\n\nNew-E developed a personal data protection policy and operational procedure\n\non personal data protection for all its employees.\n\n3\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n7\n\nFor the reasons set out below, I find MCST 3593 in breach of Sections 11(3), 12 and\n\n24 of the PDPA and New-E in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. I find ETCPM not to be in\nbreach of any of its obligations under the PDPA in relation to the Incident.\nBreach of Sections 11(3), 12 and 24 of the PDPA by MCST 3593\n8\n\nAs an “organisation” under the PDPA, MCST 3593 had the primary responsibility of\n\nensuring that there are reasonable security arrangements in place to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control. 1 It is not disputed that MCST 3593 had possession and/or\ncontrol of the Requested CCTV Footage. To the extent that an MCST has appointed a\nmanaging agent or vendor to process personal data on its behalf, it should have in place a\nwritten agreement with clauses requiring them to comply with the data protection provisions\nunder the PDPA, and carried these contractual obligations through into implementing practices\nlike standard operating procedures.2\n9\n\nIn the present case, MCST 3593 had engaged New-E to provide security services\n\n(including the management of CCTV footage) for the Condominium. In the course of providing\nsecurity services, New-E was engaged to process personal data on behalf of MCST 3593, to\nwit, New-E had to process video footages captured by the CCTV network and system. In this\ncase, the Security Supervisor retrieved CCTV footage, made a recording of an extract, and\ntransmitted it. These actions amount to “processing” as the term is defined in section 2(1) of\nthe PDPA. Hence, the true nature of the relationship between MCST 3593 and New-E is that\nof a data controller and data intermediary. However, the contract between MCST 3593 and\nNew-E did not contain any clauses relating to the protection of personal data or any reference\nto the PDPA. There were no written instructions in the contract in relation to the management\nof CCTV footage, and MCST 3593 admitted to the Commission that it had not communicated\nany data protection requirements to ETCPM or New-E. In the circumstances, I find MCST\n3593 in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n1\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA\nSee Re KBox Entertainment Group Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 1 at [12] and 29(b)(ii); the Commission’s Guide\non Data Protection Clauses for Agreements Relating to the Processing of Personal Data (20 July 2016) which\nprovides sample data protection clauses that organisations may find helpful\n2\n\n4\n\n\f10\n\nIn addition, during the course of investigations, MCST 3593 admitted that it had not\n\nappointed any DPO and it had not developed and put in place any data protection policies, as\nrequired under Sections 11(3) and 12 respectively of the PDPA. The importance of these\nrequirements have been emphasized multiple times in previous decisions, 3 as well as the\nCommission’s Advisory Guidelines for Management Corporations (issued on 11 March 2019)\nat [2.6]. In the circumstances, MCST 3593 was also in breach of Sections 11(3) and 12 of the\nPDPA.\nBreach of Section 24 of the PDPA by New-E\n11\n\nAs mentioned at [9], the security services provided by New-E included the management\n\nof CCTV footage. This amounted to “processing” of personal data as defined in section 2(1)\nof the PDPA. New-E was accordingly acting as a data intermediary of MCST 3593 with respect\nto the Requested CCTV Footage.\n12\n\nIn my view, New-E failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect\n\nthe Requested CCTV Footage and was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA for the following\nreasons:\n(a)\n\nAccording to New-E, it had a practice of only releasing CCTV footage to\n\nrepresentatives of ETCPM which was communicated verbally to New-E’s employees\nand ETCPM. However, New-E conceded that it did not have any written policies to\ninstruct and guide its employees with respect to their obligations under the PDPA, in\nparticular the usage of mobile phones to record CCTV footage. In the present case, the\nSecurity Supervisor did not adhere to New-E’s practice and this may be due, at least in\npart, to the lack of a written policy which clearly sets out the relevant procedures to be\nfollowed before CCTV footage is disclosed.\n(b)\n\nNew-E did not provide data protection training for its employees. It is well-\n\nestablished that proper training is a key security arrangement in an organisation’s\ncompliance with the protection obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.4 Proper staff\n\n3\n\nSee Re Aviva Ltd 2017 SGPDPC 14 at [32]; Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017]\nSGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37]; Re AgcDesign Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 23 at [5]\n4\nRe National University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5 at [15] – [28]; Re SLF Green Maid Agency [2018]\nSGPDPC 27 at [12]; Re SME Motor Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 21 at [10] and Advisory Guidelines On Key\nConcepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (Revised 9 Oct 2019) at [17.5]\n\n5\n\n\ftraining – which creates data protection awareness amongst employees, imparts good\npractices in handling personal data, and puts employees on the alert for threats to the\nsecurity of personal data – is necessary to complement an organisation’s data protection\npolicies.\nNo Breach of the PDPA by ETCPM\n13\n\nETCPM was a data intermediary of MCST 3593 in relation to the personal data it\n\nprocessed on their behalf when carrying out its duties as managing agent. As a data\nintermediary, ETCPM had an obligation under section 24 of the PDPA to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect such personal data which was in its possession or\nunder its control.\n14\n\nHowever, the personal data which is the subject of the present case was not in the\n\npossession or under the control of ETCPM. In particular, the Requested CCTV Footage was in\nthe possession and under the control of New-E and was within the scope of New-E’s\nresponsibilities as MCST 3593’s security services provider, as mentioned at [11]. Accordingly,\nit was not ETCPM’s responsibility in the present case to put in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect the Requested CCTV Footage.\n15\n\nFor completeness, I note that pursuant to the written agreement between the MCST\n\n3593 and ETCPM, ETCPM’s scope of services as managing agent included supervising NewE and ensuring that it carried out its duties and responsibilities properly and efficiently. The\nIncident did not arise due to ETCPM’s lack of supervision over New-E. As mentioned at [3]\nand [4] above, the Residence Manager instructed the Security Supervisor not to disclose the\nCCTV Footage to the Resident without further instructions, and subsequently conveyed MCST\n3593’s instructions to the Security Supervisor that the Requested CCTV Footage should not be\ndisclosed. Unbeknown to the Residence Manager, his instructions came too late because the\nSecurity Supervisor had already disclosed a copy of the Requested CCTV Footage to the\nResident before then.\n16\n\nIn the circumstances, I find that ETCPM was not in breach of any of its obligations\n\nunder the PDPA in relation to the Incident.\n\n6\n\n\fRepresentations by MCST 3593\n\n17\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, MCST 3593 made representations regarding the\n\nfindings as set out at [8] to [10], and on the quantum of financial penalty . The Organisation\nraised the following factors:\n(a)\n\nMCST 3593 comprises of subsidiary proprietors, and its council is elected\n\nannually at the annual general meeting to represent all subsidiary proprietors. All\nmembers of the council serve on a voluntary basis;\n(b)\n\nMCST 3593 appointed ETCPM to advise on its obligations and act on its behalf.\n\nMCST 3593’s management council relies on ETCPM to guide and help put in place\nmeasures to comply with the PDPA. According to MCST 3593, measures and\nsafeguards had already been put in place to ensure that collection, use, disclosure of\npersonal data, as well as protection and retention of personal data are in compliance\nwith the PDPA;\n(c)\n\nThe Security Supervisor disclosed the Requested CCTV Footage against the\n\nResident Manager’s instructions and usual standard operating procedures. The Resident\nManager’s instructions to the Security Supervisor was for and on behalf of the MCST\n3593. No measures or safeguards could have prevented such wilful acts by the Security\nSupervisor; and\n(d)\n\nMCST 3593 took immediate remedial actions to address the matter, including\n\nvoluntarily informing the Commission of the Incident.\n18\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, I have decided to maintain the\n\nquantum of financial penalty set out at [19(a)] for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nIn relation to MCST 3593’s representations on its constitution and the voluntary\n\nnature of the members of MCST 3593’s council, it is not disputed that MCST 3593 is\nan “organisation” as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA and is therefore required to\ncomply with the data protection provisions. The fact that the members of MCST 3593’s\n\n7\n\n\fcouncil are volunteers does not lower the standard expected of MCST 3593 in\ncomplying with its obligations under the PDPA.\n(b)\n\nIt is not disputed that one of the roles that ETCPM had to perform as managing\n\nagent was the supervision of New-E. However, the gravamen of the breach lies in the\nfact that when MCST 3593 appointed New-E, there was nothing in the contract between\nthem, or any written instructions thereafter, that dealt with the protection of personal\ndata in the management of CCTV footage. New-E is a data intermediary to MCST 3593\ninsofar as it was managing personal data captured and stored in the CCTV system. As\nsuch, the contract between MCST 3593 and New-E has to deal with the protection and\nretention limitation obligations under the PDPA over this set of personal data. This\nought to be followed through in their standard operating procedures, which in this case\ncould either be supplied by ETCPM in its capacity as managing agent and supervisor\nof New-E or put in place between MCST 3593 and New-E. A review of the contract\nbetween MCST 3593 and New-E discloses this omission; and no written policies\nconcerning the management of personal data stored in CCTV footage has been\nproduced during investigations. On the contrary, New-E has admitted that there was\nnothing written up and they relied on verbal instructions of practices: at [12(a)]; and\nMCST 3593 admitted that it has not given any data protection instructions to either\nETCPM or New-E: at [9].\n(c)\n\nAs for MCST 3593’s representations on the Resident Manager’s instructions to\n\nthe Security Supervisor and the Security Supervisor’s wilful conduct, this does not\nabsolve MCST 3593 from the requirement of having data protection clauses in its\nrespective contracts with ETCPM and New-E and implementing standard operating\nprocedures.

The\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) subsequently\nbecame aware that closed-circuit television (“CCTV”) footage showing the\nglass door falling on the woman was disclosed on the Internet (the “Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nAt the time of the incident, MCST 4375 had appointed Smart Property\n\nManagement (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“SPMS”) as its managing agent and A Best\nSecurity Management Pte Ltd (“ABSM”) to provide security services at the\nMall. These appointments took effect from 1 July 2018 and 1 June 2018\nrespectively. SPMS’ scope of work as managing agent included supervising\nservice providers such as ABSM to ensure it carried out its duties properly.\n3\n\nOn 24 February 2019, the senior security supervisor from ABSM (the\n\n“SSS”) who was on duty at the Mall’s Fire Control Centre, saw a glass door fall\non a woman at Level 4 of the Mall’s car park lift lobby (the “Accident”) through\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nthe CCTV monitors. The SSS immediately called for an ambulance and notified\nMCST 4375’s Property Officer and ABSM’s Operations Manager of the\nAccident. Shortly thereafter, MCST 4375’s Property Officer asked the SSS to\nsend her a copy of CCTV footage of the Accident. In response to this request,\nthe SSS replayed the portion of the CCTV footage showing the Accident (the\n“Relevant CCTV Footage”) and recorded it with his mobile phone. The SSS\nthen sent the copy of the Relevant CCTV Footage which he had recorded on his\nmobile phone to a WhatsApp group chat consisting of the SSS, the Security\nExecutive from ABSM (the “SE”) who was also on duty at the time of the\nAccident, and MCST 4375’s Property Officer. The SSS also sent a copy of the\nsame footage to ABSM’s Operations Manager in a separate WhatsApp message.\nSubsequently, the SE forwarded a copy of the Relevant CCTV Footage to the\ncleaning supervisor (engaged by MCST 4375) on duty at the time of the\nAccident (the “Cleaning Supervisor”). The SE also told the Cleaning\nSupervisor to inform the cleaners not to enter the barricaded area (where the\nAccident occurred) when carrying out their cleaning duties.\n4\n\nOn 25 February 2019, a member of the management council of MCST\n\n4375 (the “Management Council Member”) requested a copy of the Relevant\nCCTV Footage from the SSS for purposes of relating to an emergency meeting\nof MCST 4375’s management council. The SSS sent the Management Council\nMember a copy of the Relevant CCTV Footage. The Management Council\nMember then forwarded the Relevant CCTV Footage via WhatsApp to the other\nmembers of MCST 4375’s management council for their information.\n5\n\nOn or around 26 February 2019, a copy of the Relevant CCTV Footage\n\nwas posted onto the video-sharing website YouTube. The YouTube video\ncontaining a copy of the Relevant CCTV Footage was subsequently made\navailable through various websites on the Internet.\n\n2\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n6\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nSince the discovery of the Incident, MCST 4375 took the following\n\nremedial actions:\n(a)\n\nMCST 4375 replaced SPMS with a new managing agent with\n\neffect from 18 March 2019; and\n(b)\n\nAn internal memorandum was issued to all MCST 4375\n\nemployees specifying that there shall be no distribution of any\ndocuments or media materials from the management office of MCST\n4375, without prior approval from MCST 4375’s management council.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n7\n\nFor the reasons set out below, I find MCST 4375 in breach of Sections\n\n12 and 24 of the PDPA and ABSM in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. I find\nSPMS not to be in breach of any of its obligations under the PDPA in relation\nto the Incident.\nBreach of Sections 12 and 24 of the PDPA by MCST 4375\n8\n\nUnder section 24 of the PDPA, MCST 4375 had the primary\n\nresponsibility of ensuring that there are reasonable security arrangements in\nplace to protect personal data in its possession or under its control. It is not\ndisputed that MCST 4375 had possession and/or control of the Relevant CCTV\nFootage. To the extent that an MCST has appointed a managing agent or vendor\nto process personal data on its behalf, it should have in place a written agreement\n\n3\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nwith clauses requiring them to comply with the relevant data protection\nprovisions under the PDPA1.\n9\n\nIn the present case, MCST 4375 had engaged ABSM to provide security\n\nservices which included management of CCTV footage recorded via the Mall’s\nCCTV system. In the course of providing security services, ABSM was engaged\nto process personal data on behalf of MCST 4375, to wit, ABSM had to process\nvideo footages captured by the Mall’s CCTV network and system. In this case,\nthe SSS retrieved CCTV footage recorded by the Mall’s CCTV system, made a\nrecording of an extract (i.e. the Relevant CCTV Footage) and transmitted it to\nvarious parties. These actions amount to “processing” as the term is defined in\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA. Hence, the true nature of the relationship between\nMCST 4375 and ABSM is that of a data controller and data intermediary.\n10\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that MCST 4375 had security\n\narrangements in place to restrict access to the Fire Control Centre (which was\nthe only place where CCTV footage could be viewed). However, MCST 4375\ndid not provide any instructions to ABSM or SPMS in relation to requests for\naccess to personal data, as well as the management of CCTV footage in general.\nGiven its duties (which included processing CCTV footage on behalf of MCST\n4375), MCST 4375 should have had written instructions clearly setting out the\nrelevant procedures to be followed by ABSM and SPMS if they received a\nrequest for access to, or disclosure of, any CCTV footage recorded at the Mall.\nIn the circumstances, I find MCST 4375 in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n1See Re KBox Entertainment Group Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 1 at [12] and 29(b)(ii); the\n\nCommission’s Guide on Data Protection Clauses for Agreements Relating to the Processing of\nPersonal Data (20 July 2016) which provides sample data protection clauses that organisations\nmay find helpful\n\n4\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n11\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nIn addition, under section 12 of the PDPA, organisations are required to\n\ndevelop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the\norganisation to meet the obligations of the organisation under the PDPA. The\nimportance of data protection policies have been emphasized multiple times in\nprevious decisions 2, as well as the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines for\nManagement Corporations (issued on 11 March 2019) at [2.6].\n12\n\nIt emerged during the course of the Commission’s investigations that\n\nMCST 4375 had not developed or put in place any data protection policies.\nAccording to MCST 4375, it expected its managing agent (i.e. SPMS) to put in\nplace the necessary policies and practices for MCST 4375 to comply with the\nPDPA. However, the contract between MCST 4375 and SPMS did not contain\nany requirements or clauses to this effect. MCST 4375 also conceded that it had\nnot given any instructions to SPMS in this regard. In the circumstances, I also\nfind MCST 4375 in breach of Section 12 of the PDPA.\nBreach of Section 24 of the PDPA by ABSM\n13\n\nAs mentioned at [9], the security services provided by ABSM included\n\nthe management of CCTV footage. This amounted to “processing” of personal\ndata as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA. ABSM was accordingly acting as\na data intermediary of MCST 4375 in respect of the Relevant CCTV Footage.\n14\n\nAt the material time, ABSM had a Personal Data Protection Policy,\n\nwhich specifically provided that ABSM would not disclose personal data to\nthird parties without MCST 4375’s consent. ABSM also had Standard\n\n2See Re Aviva Ltd 2017 SGPDPC 14 at [32]; Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37]; Re AgcDesign Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 23 at [5]\n\n5\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nOperating Procedures (“SOP”) outlining the standards of conduct expected of\nits employees. However, the SOP did not include provisions in relation to the\nrecording, retrieving or disclosure of CCTV footage recorded at the Mall or the\npersonal data captured therein. In addition, ABSM had a Crisis Report Flow\nChart for the reporting of incidents (such as the Accident) which also did not\ncontain any provisions relating to the handling of personal data.\n15\n\nAlthough the Relevant CCTV Footage contained personal data that was\n\npublicly available and consent for disclosure is not required, section 18(a) of the\nPDPA overlays the requirement that disclosure must nevertheless be for a\nreasonably appropriate purpose in the circumstances. In my view, the disclosure\nof the Relevant CCTV Footage by the SSS to MCST 4375’s Property Officer,\nABSM’s Operation Manager, the SE and the Management Council Member was\nfor a reasonably appropriate purpose. Pursuant to the Crisis Report Flow Chart,\nthe SSS had to inform representatives of MCST 4375 and his supervisor (i.e.\nthe ABSM Operation Manager) of the Accident. The SE was on duty at the time\nof the Accident and would have been working with the SSS to manage the\nsituation post-Accident. As for the disclosure to the Management Council\nMember, members of the Management Council are representatives of an MCST\nand disclosure to them was akin to disclosure to MCST 4375.\n16\n\nHowever, the disclosure of the Relevant CCTV Footage by SE to the\n\nCleaning Supervisor was unauthorised and in direct contravention of both\nABSM’s Personal Data Protection Policy and Crisis Report Flow Chart. Given\nthat the Relevant CCTV Footage contained personal data that was recorded in\nthe Mall, ABSM’s Personal Data Protection Policy required the SE to obtain\nMCST 4375’s approval before sending a copy of the Relevant CCTV Footage\nto the Cleaning Supervisor. The SE’s failure to do so may be due, at least in\n\n6\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\npart, to the lack of any provisions in the SOP setting out the procedures to be\nfollowed before CCTV footage is disclosed.\n17\n\nIt is well-established that proper training is a key security arrangement\n\nin an organisation’s compliance with the protection obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA3. Proper staff training – which creates data protection awareness\namongst employees, imparts good practices in handling personal data, and puts\nemployees on the alert for threats to the security of personal data – is necessary\nto complement an organisation’s data protection policies. According to ABSM,\nboth the SSS and SE were briefed on the PDPA in August 2018 when they were\nassigned to work at the Mall. However, the SE’s conduct evidenced a lack of\nknowledge or understanding of ABSM’s internal policies and procedures.\n18\n\nIn my view, ABSM failed to properly train and communicate its internal\n\npolicies and procedures in relation to the protection of personal data to its\nemployees. In particular, ABSM should have had a written policy setting out\nthe procedures to be followed in relation to the disclosure of CCTV footage and\nthe personal data therein. In the circumstances, I find ABSM in breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\nNo Breach of the PDPA by SPMS\n19\n\nSPMS was also a data intermediary of MCST 4375 in relation to the\n\npersonal data it processed on their behalf when carrying out its duties as\nmanaging agent. As a data intermediary, SPMS had an obligation under section\n\n3Re National University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5 at [15] – [28]; Re SLF Green Maid\n\nAgency [2018] SGPDPC 27 at [12]; Re SME Motor Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 21 at [10] and\nAdvisory Guidelines On Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (Revised 9 Oct\n2019) at [17.5]\n\n7\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\n24 of the PDPA to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect such\npersonal data which was in its possession or under its control.\n20\n\nNotably, the personal data which is the subject of the present case was\n\nnot in the possession or under the control of SPMS. In particular, the Relevant\nCCTV Footage was in the possession and under the control of ABSM and was\nwithin the scope of ABSM’s responsibilities as MCST 4375’s security services\nprovider.\n\nAccordingly, it was not SPMS’ responsibility to put in place\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Relevant CCTV Footage.\n21\n\nWhile SPMS’ duty as managing agent was to exercise a supervisory role\n\nover ABSM, the Commission’s investigations revealed that this was limited to\nexercising broad oversight over the attendance and performance of duties by\nABSM’s employees. In both ABSM’s Personal Data Protection Policy and\nCrisis Report Flow Chart, SPMS did not have a role with respect to the\nmanagement or approval of requests for access or disclosure of personal data.\nIn particular, there was no requirement for ABSM’s employees to consult or\nseek approval from SPMS in relation to the disclosure of CCTV footage. The\nIncident accordingly did not arise due to SPMS’ lack of supervision over\nABSM.\n22\n\nIn the circumstances, I find that SPMS was not in breach of any of its\n\nobligations under the PDPA in relation to the Incident.\n\n8\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n23\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, I hereby direct:\n(a)\n\nMCST 4375 to:\n(i)\n\nDevelop and implement policies necessary for the\n\nprotection of personal data in its possession and/or under its\ncontrol to meet its obligations under Section 12 of the PDPA\nwithin 60 days from the date of this decision;\n(ii)\n\nPut in place reasonable security arrangements, including\n\npolicies necessary for the protection of personal data in its\npossession and/or under its control to meet its obligations under\nSection 24 of the PDPA within 60 days from the date of this\ndecision;\n(iii)\n\nAs part of the security arrangements to be put in place,\n\nconduct training to ensure that its staff are aware of, and will\ncomply with, the requirements of the PDPA when handling\npersonal data within 60 days from date of decision; and\n(iv)\n\nInform the Commission of the implementation of each of\n\nthe above within 1 week of implementation; and\n(b)\n\nABSM to:\n(i)\n\nPut in place reasonable security arrangements, including\n\npolicies necessary for the protection of personal data in its\npossession and/or under its control to meet its obligations under\nSection 24 of the PDPA within 60 days from the date of this\ndecision; and\n\n9\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4375 & Others\n\n(ii)\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 4\n\nInform the Commission of the implementation of the\n\nabove within 1 week of implementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"Directions were imposed on Henry Park Primary School Parents’ Association for breaches of the PDPA.

Henry Park Primary School Parents’ Association (the “Organisation”) is a registered\nsociety whose membership comprised parent volunteers. To register as members of the\nOrganisation, individuals provided to the Organisation their names, contact numbers, name\nof child and the child’s class in Henry Park Primary School (the “Personal Data Set”). The\nOrganisation had a website at https://hppa.org.sg (the “Website”) where members could\nview their own account particulars upon logging in using their assigned user ID and\npassword.\n\n2. On 15 March 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”)\nreceived a complaint. The complainant informed that when she performed a Google search\nusing her name, she found a search result of a webpage of the Website which disclosed her\npersonal data (the “Incident”).\n\n\f3. The Personal Data Sets of registered members were never intended to be disclosed online.\nThe Website had been developed by a parent volunteer using the WordPress content\nmanagement system.\n\n4. The Organisation had conducted tests to verify that members who logged in to the Website\ncould view their own account particulars. The Organisation also verified that account\nparticulars could not be viewed when accessing the Website as a public user. Nevertheless,\nthe Personal Data Set was crawled, indexed and searchable by Google. This points to a\nweakness in access control that had not been picked up by these rudimentary tests.\n\n5. Security testing such as vulnerability scans would have identified the access control issue.\nThe Organisation failed to conduct adequate security testing before launching the Website.\nOn the above facts, the Commission found that the Organisation did not put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data Sets.\n\n6. The Commission also found that the Organisation had not appointed a person to be\nresponsible for ensuring its compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”). Further, the Organisation had not developed and implemented any policies and\npractices necessary for it to meet its obligations under the PDPA.\n\n7. The Organisation had taken the Website offline after the Incident on 15 March 2019. On\n14 November 2019, the Organisation had put online a new website that no longer allowed\n\n\fonline access to the database of the Organisation’s members. The new website also\nincluded a data protection notice.\n\n8. In the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found the\nOrganisation in breach of sections 11(3), 12 and 24 of the PDPA. In determining the\ndirections, the Deputy Commissioner took into consideration that the Organisation was a\nvolunteer organisation made up primarily of parents.\n\nThe Organisation is directed to,\n\nwithin 60 days, (i) appoint one or more individuals to be responsible for ensuring that it\ncomplies with the PDPA, (ii) develop and implement internal data protection and training\npolicies, and (iii) to put all volunteers handling personal data through data protection\ntraining.\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to AXA Insurance for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of its policyholders.

The complaint was\nabout an email (the “Email”) sent with a scanned document (the “Attachment”)\ncontaining personal data of 87 other policyholders (the “Affected Individuals”) to the\nComplainant on 28 June 2019.

The lapses\npointed to a failure by the Organisation to make reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect the personal data of its policyholders from inadvertent disclosure by its\nemployees.

The\nusers received automated acknowledgement emails attached with files containing\npersonal data of other individuals (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nOn 10 July 2019, the Organisation enhanced the website’s online enquiry application to\nallow users to upload supporting documents together with their enquiry submissions.\nWhen a user A uploaded files, the application assigned a variable that served to identify\nthe files for future retrieval by the same user or by the Organisation. However, due to a\ncoding error, if the next user B did not upload files, the variable generated for the\npreceding user was applied to the B’s submission. As a result, the supporting documents\nuploaded by A were associated with B’s submission.\n\n\f3.\n\nThis coding error manifested in the sending of acknowledgement emails, which were\nintended\n\nto\n\ninclude supporting documents\n\nsubmitted by the\n\nuser. When\n\nacknowledgement emails were generated for a user who did not upload files, the coding\nerror caused the files uploaded by a preceding user to be attached.

The files contained their\npersonal data, such as names, policy numbers, premium amounts, sum assured and period\nof coverage, email and mailing addresses.\n\n4.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the Incident was caused by poor quality codes. The\nCommission found that such errors should have been detected during the manual code\nreview process that the Organisation had conducted.

Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fRoyal Caribbean Cruises (Asia) Pte. Ltd.\n[2020] SGPDPC 5\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No. DP-1904-B3721\n4 February 2020\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 14 April 2019, Royal Caribbean Cruises (Asia) Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that the systems of one\nof the Organisation’s vendors (the “IT Vendor”) had been subject to a cyber-attack, resulting\nin the personal data of some of the Organisation’s customers being exposed to unauthorised\naccess (the “Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nIn early 2017, the Organisation engaged the IT Vendor to develop and supply the\n\nOrganisation with an electronic receipt system to generate and store electronic receipts with\nrespect to payments made by the Organisation’s customers for cruise and holiday bookings (the\n“Receipt System”). The initial plan was for the Receipt System to be hosted on the\nOrganisation’s internal server. However, after taking into consideration that the Receipt System\nwould need to be accessed from external Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses during events and\nroadshows, the Organisation asked the IT Vendor to host the Receipt System on an Amazon\nWeb Services (“AWS”) server. The Receipt System was installed on an AWS Server in\nDecember 2017 and the Organisation started using the Receipt System at the end of January\n2018.\n3\n\nOn 11 April 2019, the Organisation encountered difficulties operating the Receipt\n\nSystem and reported the issue to the IT Vendor. On 12 April 2019, the IT Vendor informed the\nOrganisation that the Receipt System had been subject to a cyber-attack. The cyber-attacker\nhad deleted the database in the Receipt System, and replaced it with a ransom message\ndemanding payment of 0.08 Bitcoins in order to recover the deleted data.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nThe following types of personal data belonging to 6,004 of the Organisation’s\n\ncustomers (“Affected Customers”) were affected by the Incident (collectively, “Customer\nData”):\n(a)\n\nReceipt Date and Number;\n\n(b)\n\nSailing Date;\n\n(c)\n\nName of Guest / Card Holder;\n\n(d)\n\nShip Name;\n\n(e)\n\nBooking ID;\n\n(f)\n\nAmount Paid;\n\n(g)\n\nPayment Type;\n\n(h)\n\nThe first four and last four digits of credit / debit card number for payments\n\nmade using credit / debit cards;\n(i)\n\nIssuing bank and the 6 digit cheque numbers for payments made using cheques;\n\nand\n(j)\n5\n\nVoucher redemption numbers for payment made using vouchers.\n\nIn addition, 440 of the 6,004 Affected Customers had completed an online check-in\n\nprocess that required them to provide additional personal data. These 440 Affected Customers\nhad the following types of additional personal data placed at risk of unauthorised access\n(collectively, “Additional Customer Data”):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNationality;\n\n(c)\n\nMarital status;\n\n(d)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(e)\n\nResidential address;\n3\n\n\f(f)\n\nMobile number;\n\n(g)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(h)\n\nEmergency contact information;\n\n(i)\n\nLast 4 characters of the passport numbers;\n\n(j)\n\nPassport expiry date; and\n\n(k)\n\nCustomer credit card details including the cardholder's name, credit card issuer,\n\nlast 4 digits, and expiry date.\n6\n\nThere were 25 employees of the Organisation whose personal data was also affected by\n\nthe Incident (collectively, “Employee Data”):\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nReceipt System Username;\n\n(c)\n\nReceipt System User role;\n\n(d)\n\nReceipt System Password;\n\n(e)\n\nEmail Address;\n\n(f)\n\nMobile number; and\n\n(g)\n\nLocation (i.e., office or roadshow).\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nOn 12 April 2019, the Receipt System’s phpMyAdmin1 web application name\n\nwas changed to obscure access. IP address restrictions were also added for access to the\nReceipt System;\n\n1\n\nphpMyAdmin is an open source administration tool for MySQL and MariaDB data over the world wide web.\n\n4\n\n\f(b)\n\nOn 16 April 2019, the Organisation engaged a cybersecurity consultant to\n\nconduct technical forensic investigations and identify vulnerabilities in the Receipt\nSystem;\n(c)\n\nOn 17 April 2019, the Organisation took the Receipt System offline\n\npermanently. The Organisation also blocked its online check-in portal to prevent\ninformation from the Receipt System from being used to access Additional Customer\nData of the 440 Affected Customers; and\n(d)\n\nOn 1 May 2019, the Organisation notified the 440 Affected Customers of the\n\nIncident, on the basis that the Additional Customer Data that may have been accessed\nthrough the online check-in portal was likely to be sensitive and/or could materially\nimpact them.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n8\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation\n\nto protect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps\nor arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks.\n9\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned the Receipt System and had possession\n\nand control over the Customer Data, Additional Customer Data and Employee Data at all\nmaterial times. While the IT Vendor was engaged to develop the Receipt System, the\nCommission’s investigations revealed that the IT Vendor had not processed, nor were they\nengaged to process, the Customer Data, Additional Customer Data and Employee Data on the\nOrganisation’s behalf. The IT Vendor was accordingly not a data intermediary and the\nOrganisation was solely responsible for the protection of the Customer Data, Additional\nCustomer Data and Employee Data.\n10\n\nThe Receipt System had vulnerabilities and gaps that the cyber-attacker could easily\n\nhave exploited, resulting in the Incident:\n\n5\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe administrative credentials (i.e., administrator username and password) to\n\nlog into the Receipt System were stored in files within the same server with no access\ncontrols and were therefore publicly accessible; and\n(b)\n\nThe version of the phpMyAdmin tool in use with the Receipt System at the\n\nmaterial time was not patched and contained known security vulnerabilities.2\n11\n\nIn relation to (a), given that the administrative credentials would allow and enable\n\naccess to Customer Data, Additional Customer Data and Employee Data of a significant\nnumber of individuals stored in the Receipt System, it clearly should not have been stored in\nfiles without access controls, especially so when the files were in the same server. In relation\nto (b), and as mentioned in previous decisions,3 regular security testing and patching as security\nmeasures is absolutely crucial. Patching is one of the common tasks that all system owners are\nrequired to perform in order to keep their security measures current against external threats.\nThe Organisation clearly did not have any process in place to ensure regular patching in the\npresent case.\n12\n\nAccording to the Organisation, it was the IT Vendor’s responsibility to put in place the\n\nappropriate security measures for the Receipt System. In contrast, the IT Vendor asserted that\nit was the Organisation’s network security team that was in charge of security. The\nCommission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation had not in fact engaged the IT\nVendor to provide services in relation to security maintenance or patching of the Receipt\nSystem. As the data controller and customer, the Organisation ought to be clear about the scope\nof services that it is procuring from the IT Vendor, and document the scope properly in contract\nor other project documentation. In this case, the Organisation was not able to produce anything\nin writing to corroborate its assertions. The absence of documentation, on the contrary,\nbuttresses the IT Vendor’s assertion that it was not engaged to provide services in relation to\nsecurity measures for the Receipt System. Without clarity, the risks of any omissions will fall\non the Organisation, which as data controller is ultimately responsible. In the circumstances,\nthe Commissioner finds that it was the Organisation and not the IT Vendor that had the\nobligation to ensure that the Receipt System had up-to-date security maintenance and patching.\n2\n\nThe security vulnerabilities were listed in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, which is a list of publicly\ndisclosed information security vulnerabilities and exposures.\n3\nSee for example Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive Works Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 22 at\n[26]; Re Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd. & others [2019] SGPDPC 3 at [124]; Re Tutor City [2019]\nSGPDPC 5 at [23]; Re Genki Sushi [2019] SGPDPC 26 at [20]-[21].\n\n6\n\n\f13\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to implement security measures, including software patches\n\nto ensure that vulnerabilities the Receipt System were properly patched, resulted in a standard\nof protection that fell far short of what was required for the Receipt System. As such, the\nOrganisation failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the Customer\nData, Additional Customer Data and Employee Data. Accordingly, the Commissioner finds the\nOrganisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n14\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation under section\n\n29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n\n15\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation cooperated with the Commission in its investigations; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions in respect of the Incident.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby directs\n\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $16,000 within 30 days from the date of this\ndirection, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until it is paid in full. The Commissioner has not set out any further directions given\nthe remediation measures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $26,000 was imposed on SPH Magazines for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of personal data of members of HardwareZone forum site.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty"],"date":"2020-02-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---SPH-Magazines-Pte-Ltd.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by SPH Magazines","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2020/02/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-sph-magazines","timestamp":"2020-02-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 3\n\nCase No DP-1802-B1731\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nSPH Magazines Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fSPH Magazines Pte Ltd\n[2020] SGPDPC 3\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1802-B1731\n31 January 2020\nFacts of the Case\n1\n\nOn 20 February 2018, SPH Magazines Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) voluntarily\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that the account of a\nsenior moderator of its HardwareZone forum site (the “Forum”) had been accessed by an\nunknown hacker who used the senior moderator’s credentials to retrieve personal data of\nmembers of the Forum. The Organisation subsequently discovered through its consultants who\nwere engaged to assist in its investigations into the incident that the senior moderator’s email\naddress and password had been published on a credential leak database on 5 December 2017.\nThe Organisation believed that the hacker had obtained the senior moderator’s credentials from\nthis source or other similar databases as its investigations showed that its systems and\napplications had not been compromised during the incident.\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates, hosts and maintains the Forum, an online Internet portal for\n\nmembers to engage in discussions on technology and other matters. Members are required to\nprovide their usernames, email addresses, full names and passwords during registration and\nthis personal data would form part of a member’s user profile. Members also have the option\nof including the following personal data in their user profile:\n(a)\n\nYear of Birth\n\n(b)\n\nGender\n\n(c)\n\nCountry\n\n(d)\n\nEducation\n\n(e)\n\nJob Scope\n\n(f)\n\nRole in IT Procurement\n2\n\n\f3\n\n(g)\n\nOccupation\n\n(h)\n\nIndustry\n\n(i)\n\nCompany Size\n\n(j)\n\nMonthly Income (range)\n\n(k)\n\nArea of interest\n\n(l)\n\nHome Page URL\n\n(m)\n\nUse of MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, AIM, Skype\n\nSenior moderators of the Forum are volunteers selected by the Organisation from\n\namongst the members of the Forum and appointed to review and moderate the discussion\nthreads in the Forum and to ensure that any postings comply with applicable laws and the\nForum’s Terms of Service. Senior moderators are also responsible for issuing warnings and\nother sanctions (such as suspensions or bans) to members who do not comply with the Forum’s\nTerms of Service. Access to members’ user profiles was given to senior moderators (through\ntheir respective senior moderator accounts) to allow them to carry out their duties. The senior\nmoderators would be able to view the Forum members’ usernames, email addresses and any\noptional information included by the members in their user profiles. While the full names and\npasswords of the members were salted and hashed using the MD5 algorithm, and ordinarily\nsenior moderators would not be able to view these fields, it is well-known that the MD5\nalgorithm is outdated and could be circumvented: see Fei Fah Medical Manufacturing Pte Ltd\n[2016] SGPDPC 3 at [19] and [20].\n4\n\nThe Organisation first realised that something was amiss when it was notified of an\n\nunauthorised post published using the account of a website administrator. The website\nadministrator is employed by the Organisation. Using the administrator’s credentials, the\nhacker published the unauthorised post and changed the avatar of the administrator account.\nHowever, as the Forum administrators could only access the user profiles of members by way\nof a two-factor authorisation (“2FA”) process, the hacker was unable to access the user profiles\nusing the administrator account.\n\n3\n\n\f5\n\nThe Organisation also subsequently discovered the website administrator’s credentials\n\nin the same credential leak database which published the senior moderator’s credentials.\n6\n\nIt thus appears that the hacker used the compromised senior moderator account to\n\naccess the user profiles of members. At the material time, there were a total of 685,393 user\nprofiles in the Organisation’s system. The Organisation’s investigations further showed that\nthe senior moderator’s account was used to perform 704,764 attempted views of Members’\nuser profiles using networks that did not reveal the actual source IP address, between 22\nSeptember 2017 to 30 September 2017. The frequent number of attempted views and the use\nof networks which are difficult to trace suggest that the senior moderator’s account was used\nto access personal data of Members without authorisation. The investigations also showed that\nthe senior moderator’s account experienced unusual activity from at least December 2015.\n7\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a)\n\nThe access rights of senior moderator accounts to user profiles was temporarily\n\nsuspended on 19 February 2018;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation sent emails to members informing them of the breach and\n\nadvising members to change their passwords. The Organisation also posted a\nnotification of the breach on the Forum website.\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation revised its Password policy on 23 February 2018 requiring\n\npasswords to have a minimum of 8 characters and include both alphanumeric and\nupper/lower case characters. Passwords will also expire within 3 months;\n(d)\n\n2FA was implemented for senior moderator accounts in April 2018;\n\n(e)\n\nCaptcha for the Site’s login page was implemented;\n\n(f)\n\nEntries in the filed for full names was removed from the application level and\n\npurged from the database; and\n(g)\n\nAdditional information in optional fields were also removed from the\n\napplication level and purged from the database.\n\n4\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n9\n\nThe key finding in this case was that the Organisation had omitted to implement\n\nreasonable password security requirements for its senior moderators. While the Organisation\ndid have in place a Password Policy which, amongst other things, required passwords to be of\na certain length and complexity and provided for the expiration of passwords, the Policy and\nthe security measures therein were applicable to the Organisation’s employees and did not\napply to senior moderators. In fact, there was no requirement for senior moderators to change\ntheir passwords regularly or to have passwords of an acceptable length and complexity.\n10\n\nDuring the investigations it was discovered that the password used by the relevant\n\nsenior moderator was not changed in 10 years and did not meet the length and complexity\nstandard the Organisation implemented for its employees. In this regard, the permissions and\nprivileges granted to senior moderators allowed senior moderators to set password expiry rules\nand to set prohibitions for the re-use of passwords within a selected period (i.e. password\nhistory setting) but did not compel them to do so.\n11\n\nFinally, the Organisation did not perform any security testing of the Forum website. It\n\ntherefore did not have an overall picture of its security needs in relation to the website.\n12\n\nThe failure to implement and enforce reasonable password security requirements on the\n\nsenior moderator accounts and to conduct security testing to acquire knowledge of the Forum\nwebsite’s security amounted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA by the Organisation.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n13\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\n\nPDPA, the following factors were taken into account:\n\n5\n\n\fMitigating factors\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation voluntarily notified the Commission of the Incident and\n\nmembers of the Forum promptly;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to implement measures to prevent a\n\nrecurrence of such an incident;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation cooperated with the Commission’s investigations;\n\nAggravating factors\n(d)\n\nThe password which was compromised had not been changed for a very long\n\nperiod of 10 years; and\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation was unable to detect the unauthorised access of personal data\n\nfor about 2 years.\n14\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\ndirects the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $26,000 within 30 days of the date of this\ndirection, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.

(the “Organisation”) provides courses, seminars and\n\nworkshops for individuals (the “Participants”) and collects personal data of Participants\nthrough its website, http://www.scal-academy.com.sg (the “Website”), for registration\npurposes. The Website was developed and maintained by a freelance vendor (the “Vendor”).\n2\n\nOn 29 November 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint that the results of an online search of the names of Participants displayed\nlinks to scanned copies of registration documents (the “Documents”) on the Website (the\n“Incident”). The Documents were accessible by clicking on the listed links.\n3\n\nThe Documents contained various personal data of 3,628 Participants including their\n\nname, race, nationality, date of birth, gender, country of birth, NRIC or work permit number,\naddress, occupation and the name of the company the Participants were employed by (the\n“Compromised Personal Data”).\n4\n\nThe cause of the Incident was traced to an enhancement to the Website (the\n\n“Enhancement”) which allowed Participants to upload the Documents directly onto a folder\n(the “Folder”) on the Website. The Vendor had been tasked with developing the Enhancement\non 7 February 2018 and, in the course of doing so, the Vendor omitted to programme the\nEnhancement to verify that only authorised employees can access the Folder. The Documents\nwere thus accessible without the need for login credentials. Additionally, the Vendor had also,\nthrough an oversight, omitted to implement another requirement, which is to implement\n\n\fGoogle’s recommendations to prevent bot crawlers from searching and indexing website\ncontent.\n5\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nImplemented measures to prevent Google trawling and indexing, such as\n\ndeploying ‘noindex’ tags and scripts to ignore search bots;\n(b)\n\nRequested Google to remove search engine records of the production\n\nenvironment and the links to the Documents;\n(c)\n\nRemoved the Documents from the Website;\n\n(d)\n\nDisabled the upload function for Documents for online registration on the\n\nWebsite; and\n(e)\n\nAssessed the harm and impact of the Incident on the affected individuals and\n\nnotified approximately 27 of them who the Organisation believed would likely suffer\nsignificant harm or impact.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”)\n6\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned and managed the Website, and had\n\npossession and control over the Compromised Personal Data at all material times. While the\nVendor had been engaged to develop and maintain the Website and subsequently assisted in\nthe development of the Enhancement, the Vendor had not processed any personal data collected\nvia the Website on the Organisation’s behalf. The Vendor was therefore not a data intermediary\nof the Organisation, and the obligations under the PDPA did not apply to the Vendor in respect\nof its engagement by the Organisation.\n\n\f7\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n8\n\nIn this regard, while the Organisation had instructed the Vendor to prevent the\n\nDocuments from being ‘leaked’ online, it did not check with the Vendor what security\narrangements had been put in place to ensure this. It is essential that, having identified a data\nprotection risk, the Organisation and the Vendor agree on the measures to be implemented.\nThese can then be followed through to the testing stage and scenarios can also be devised for\nuser acceptance testing. Since this was not done, it therefore follows that the Organisation did\nnot conduct any tests, or verify whether the Vendor had conducted any tests, to ensure that the\nsecurity arrangements were effective in protecting the Documents from unauthorised\ndisclosure.\n9\n\nAs observed in WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26 at [24], the\n\nresponsibilities of an organisation over the personal data in its control and/or possession does\nnot require technical expertise. The examples of actions that the Organisation ought to have\nundertaken as set out at paragraph 8 above do not require deep technical expertise. Instead, it\nrequires that organisations articulate their business requirements, work with their vendors on a\nset of agreed technical measures, and to follow through with proper testing based on risk\nscenarios derived from the business requirements.\n10\n\nIn view of the above, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had not put in place\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in the Documents and,\naccordingly, was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n11\n\nIn the course of settling this Decision, the Organisation submitted its representations to\n\nthe Commission on various aspects of the preliminary Decision. The representations, in part,\n\n\fcovered matters which have already been addressed in this Decision or which were not relevant\nto this Decision. The relevant matters raised in the representations which are not addressed\nelsewhere in this Decision were:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation warned the Vendor that the Incident was a breach of the\n\nPDPA;\n(b)\n\nWhile not justifying the data breach, the Organisation took the position that the\n\nIncident neither impacted nor caused significant harm to the affected individuals;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation has since taken steps to prevent a recurrence of a similar\n\nincident such as strengthening and improving communication with suppliers and\nvendors especially where personal data is concerned and educating members on\ncompliance with the PDPA; and\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation counselled the Vendor and obtained an undertaking requiring\n\nthe Vendor to implement additional safeguards, such as, disabling all UAT websites\nfrom being searchable by search engines, educating staff members on the PDPA and\ncommunicating and collaborating with the Organisation to ensure that work done\ncomplies with the PDPA.\n12\n\nWith respect to the matter raised at [11(a)], as stated at [6], the Vendor was not a data\n\nintermediary for the purpose of its engagement by the Organisation. Nevertheless, informing\nthe Vendor of the Incident and that the PDPA had been breached is a legitimate remedial action.\nThis has already been taken into consideration in determining the directions to be issued to the\nOrganisation, as set out below at [15(b)].\n13\n\nWith respect to [11(b)], this should be seen in light of the Organisation having, as part\n\nof its remedial efforts, notified affected individuals who it believed would likely suffer\nsignificant harm or impact.

The Incident took\nplace over a period of approximately 11 hours on 20 February 2018 and the personal data of\n750 subscribers (the “Affected Subscribers”) were exposed to the risk of access by other\nsubscribers. Of these, the personal data of 39 subscribers were, in fact, accessed by other\nsubscribers. The specific cause of this incident is described below.\n3\n\nThe Incident arose during the Organisation’s migration of its database of mobile\n\ncustomer accounts from its existing billing system (the “Existing System”) to a new billing\nsystem (the “New System”). [Redacted].\n4\n\nHowever, an issue arose when there was a mobile number previously assigned to a\n\nsubscriber (“historical numbers”) that was subsequently reassigned to another subscriber.\nOne situation in which this happened was when a subscriber ported over an existing mobile\nnumber from another mobile telephone operator to the Organisation. In order to effect the\nporting over, the Organisation would first issue the subscriber with a temporary mobile phone\nnumber (this is referred to as a “dummy number”) as part of the overall porting mechanism.\nAfter the subscriber’s existing mobile telephone number had been successfully ported over to\nthe Organisation, the dummy number will cease to be linked to the subscriber [redacted].\n2\n\n\f5\n\n[Redacted].\n\n6\n\nDuring the migration period, when a subscriber logged in to the App, the App would\n\nquery the Organisation’s Master Routing Database (“MRD”) to check if the subscriber’s data\nhad been migrated and then route the query to the relevant billing system. On 20 February\n2018, due to slow response times, queries by MRD to the Existing System encountered\ntimeouts. When these timeouts occurred, even if the subscriber had been migrated to the New\nSystem, the query would by default be routed to the Existing System. If the subscriber had a\nhistorical number, such as a dummy number [redacted], [in certain circumstances] the\nservice information associated with both the current mobile number and the historical number\nwould be retrieved and made available to the subscriber. The service information of the\nhistorical number could be viewed by clicking on the mobile number and information bar. If\nthe historical number had been reassigned to an Affected Subscriber, the service information\nof the Affected Subscriber would have been retrieved and made available to, and therefore\nat risk of access by, the subscriber. In this way, the associated information of the 39 subscribers\nwere accessed during the timeouts.\n\n7\n\nThe types of personal information of the Affected Subscribers (the “Personal Data”)\n\nwhich were accessible through the App included:\n(a)\n\nmobile numbers;\n\n(b)\n\nmobile plans subscribed to;\n\n(c)\n\nusage details;\n\n(d)\n\naccount numbers; and\n\n(e)\n\nadd-on services subscribed to. The relevant subscribers1 could also modify the\n\nadd-on services tied to the Affected Subscribers’ mobile number; 6 such subscribers\nhad tried to make such modifications.\n8\n\nUpon being notified by the Commission, the Organisation ensured that migrated\n\nSubscribers who encountered timeouts when using the App were shown an error message, and\nperformed testing to verify that this was the case.\n3\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) requires an\n\norganisation to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks.\nWhether the Organisation Complied with Section 24\n10\n\nWith respect to the design of the MRD, the Organisation asserted that it did not intend\n\nfor the MRD to route queries to the Existing System in the event of a timeout, and that the\nOrganisation’s intentions was for an error message to be displayed instead. I give the\nOrganisation the benefit of doubt and accept its assertion. Since the intention was to display an\nerror message, this ought to have been included as a scenario for user testing. Consequently,\nthis Incident was caused by the following lapses on the Organisation’s part:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had not carried out more thoroughly scoped tests to firstly\n\nensure that dummy numbers in these circumstances did not produce any unintended\neffects; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe test plan should have anticipated likely scenarios, such as session time-\n\nout.\n\n12\n\nIf these had been done, the Organisation could have discovered the potential\n\nerroneous retrieval and unauthorised disclosure of the Affected Subscribers’ Personal Data\nfor such accounts, and consequently, implemented measures to prevent the Incident from\noccurring. In view of the above, I found the Organisation in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n13\n\nThe Organisation in its representations made the point that, in their view, the data\n\nbreach “happened only where there was an obscure combination of factors”. While, it is\naccepted that a combination of events had to occur before personal data would have been\ndisclosed, I do not think that the combination of factors was obscure. First, session timeout\nfor MRD queries was foreseen, with the intention for an error message to be displayed.\n4\n\n\fSecond, the Organisation had full knowledge of how dummy numbers are assigned as a\ntemporary bridge for number porting, and that these dummy numbers are eventually reassigned. The combination of factors giving rise to the Incident was foreseeable and I do\nnot think that the combination is obscure. The impact of the Incident was contained because\nof its prompt action in implementing a temporary fix.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n14\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\n\nPDPA, I took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative during the investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the impact of the Incident by\n\nimplementing a temporary fix within 11 hours; and\n(c)\n\nalthough the Personal Data of 750 individuals were at risk, only 39 of such\n\nindividuals’ Personal Data were subject to unauthorised disclosure.\n15\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, I hereby direct the\n\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of $9,000 within 30 days from the date of the directions,\nfailing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n16\n\nAs the Organisation had completed its migration on 19 August 2018 and there are no\n\nfurther risks to the Personal Data arising from the retrieval of Subscriber information from the\nOrganisation’s Existing System, I have assessed that the remedial actions set out at [8] had\nsufficiently addressed the risks to the Personal Data arising from the Incident. I have therefore\nnot made further directions for the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to L’Oreal Singapore for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of individuals on its website.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nL’Oreal Singapore Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) operated a website which had a login\nportal that enabled its customers to view their profile information, redeem vouchers and\nmake enquiries about customer points (“Customer Login Page”). The customers’\nprofile information included their name, email address, postal address, mobile number\nand date of birth (the “Personal Data”). The development and maintenance of the\nwebsite was carried out by a vendor engaged by the Organisation.\n\n2.\n\nTo improve the loading speed of the website, the Organisation instructed its vendor to\nmake some changes to the website in November 2018. However, the Organisation failed\nto scope the User Acceptance Tests (“UATs”) to include the normal functioning of the\nwebsite, in particular the login and caching functions of the Customer Login Page, after\nthe code changes were introduced. As a result, when a customer (“Customer A”) logged\ninto the Customer Login Page, his or her Personal Data would be cached. Customer A’s\nPersonal Data would then be disclosed to customers who subsequently logged in to the\n\n\fCustomer Login Page until the cache was refreshed. Similarly, the Personal Data of the\nsecond customer (“Customer B”), who logged in after the cache refresh, would be\ncached, leading to disclosure of Customer B’s Personal Data to the third customer who\nlogs in next, and all subsequent customers until the next cache refresh. When the\nOrganisation came to know of this, the Organisation disabled the Customer Login Page.\nThe Organisation also engaged a consultant to assist in its investigations into the matter\nand to provide recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\n3.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”) found that Personal Data of\n7 individuals had been exposed to the risk of unauthorised disclosure as a result of the\nOrganisation’s failure to ensure appropriate testing of its website or make other security\narrangements to protect the Personal Data. The Commission notes the Organisation’s\nrepresentations that it had completed all necessary and appropriate UATs based upon the\nreasonably foreseeable impact of the requested changes to its website. However, as\nmentioned at [2] above, the scope of the UATs was inadequate because it did not simulate\nthe normal operating environment of the website. In particular, the UATs only provided\nfor a limited test case of a single user logging into the website, and failed to include the\nforeseeable scenario of multiple users logging in sequentially.\n\n4.\n\nHaving considered the representations and taking into account all the relevant\ncircumstances, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection found the\nOrganisation in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and\ndecided to give a warning to the Organisation.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $15,000 was imposed on Creative for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of users of its online support forum.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty"],"date":"2020-01-09","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Creative-Technology-Ltd--020120.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Creative","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2020/01/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-creative","timestamp":"2020-01-09","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2020] SGPDPC 1\n\nCase No DP-1811-B3058\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCreative Technology Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fCreative Technology Ltd\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1811-B3058\n2 January 2020\nFacts of this Case\n1\n\nThis case concerns an online support forum (the “Forum”) operated and hosted by\n\nCreative Technology Ltd (the “Organisation”). In November 2018, the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) was informed that the Forum had been hacked\nsometime in mid-2018 resulting in the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of users of the\nForum (the “Incident”).\n2\n\nThe Organisation first set up the Forum some time in 2004 to help users share ideas and\n\ninformation relating to the Organisation’s products. In 2011, the Organisation adopted a thirdparty forum software known as “vBulletin” to operate and host the forum internally. Unknown\nto the Organisation, the vBulletin software had a SQL vulnerability which could allow hackers\nto extract information hosted on the platform using SQL injection techniques. The developers\nof the vBulletin software released patches to address this SQL vulnerability in 2016. However,\nthe Organisation had not installed these patches at the time of the Incident.\n3\n\nOn 25 May 2018, an unknown hacker used SQL injection techniques to obtain personal\n\ndata of Forum users from the Forum’s database. In particular, the hacker exploited the\nvulnerability in the vBulletin software to launch SQL injection attacks by using the\n“Forumrunner” add-on1.\n4\n\nThe Organisation first came to know of the Incident on 4 June 2018, when it was\n\nnotified by a security researcher that he had received a set of user data extracted from the Forum.\nThe Organisation subsequently found that 484,512 users’ account information had been\naccessed and extracted in the Incident.2 Of these, only 173,763 appeared to be legitimate email\naddresses with the remainder, in the Organisation’s view, being “disposable” or otherwise not\n\n1\n\nThe Forumrunner add-on allows users to use forums hosted using vBulletin on their mobile devices.\n\n2\n\nThe Commission has not verified the number of user accounts affected for reasons explained at [14].\n\n2\n\n\fCreative Technology Ltd\nlegitimate 3 email addresses. Further, of the accounts with legitimate email addresses, the\nOrganisation found that there were 8,258 active users4 (“Active Users”) who had accessed or\nposted on the forum between 2014 and 2018 and, amongst these Active Users, approximately\n2,600 had email addresses which contained either the names or partial names of individuals.\n5\n\nAccording to the Organisation, the following data of Forum users (the “Personal Data”)\n\nwere accessed and extracted by the hacker:\n(a)\n\nusername;\n\n(b)\n\npassword, salted and hashed by the vBulletin software (each password was\n\nhashed using the MD5 algorithm, and the resulting password was hashed for a second\ntime by MD5 and salted with random characters)5;\n\n6\n\n(c)\n\nemail address; and\n\n(d)\n\nInternet Protocol address (IP address).\n\nIn addition, optional personal data which the Forum user may choose to enter (the\n\n“Optional Data”), including age, date of birth, other contact details (e.g. ICQ number, AIM\nscreen name, Skype name, and MSN and Yahoo! Messenger handles), location, occupation,\ncould be accessed when the password was used to log in to a user’s account. These data were\nviewable by other Forum members, with the exception of date of birth, which the individual\ncould choose to hide from, or disclose to, other Forum users.\nRemedial actions\n7\n\nUpon discovering the Incident, the Organisation undertook the following remedial\n\nmeasures:\n\n3\n\nSuch as email addresses from the Mailinator Service and addresses which contained gibberish or profanities.\n\n4\n\nAccording to the Organisation, users whose (i) accounts were activated (by clicking on a verification link in an\nemail sent to them during the Forum registration process); and (ii) had logged into the Forum with their user\naccount, or had uploaded at least one post in the Forum.\n5\n\nSee paragraph 11.\n\n3\n\n\fCreative Technology Ltd\n(a)\n\nit conducted a review of all its systems, servers, and software used by its IT and\n\nInternet Marketing teams and determined that the incident was an isolated occurrence,\nand the other systems had been subject to regular security reviews and security patches;\n(b)\n\nit notified the 8,258 Active Users of the Incident; and\n\n(c)\n\nit shut down the Forum temporarily on 4 June 2018 to prevent further incursions,\n\nand shut it down permanently shortly thereafter (by 20 June 2018).\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation complied with the Protection Obligation\n8\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) requires an\n\norganisation to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). It is not in dispute that\nthe Personal Data and the Optional Data were in the Organisation’s possession and under its\ncontrol at the time of the Incident.\n9\n\nThe Organisation had failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect\n\nthe Personal Data for the following reasons.\n10\n\nFirst, the Organisation had not patched or updated its version of vBulletin since 2 May\n\n2015, three years prior to the Incident. This was a significant factor leading to the Incident. As\nstated in the Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised\n20 January 2017, at [16]), regular security patching is important for organisations to keep their\nsystems and databases current and minimise their vulnerabilities.\n11\n\nSecondly, the use of the MD5 algorithm is no longer sufficiently secure for password\n\nhashing, as compared with other available algorithms. Passwords hashed with MD5 are\nsusceptible to some forms of attacks and, if they are compromised, this could lead to the\ndisclosure of other personal data. Individuals may face additional risks if they had used the\nsame email address and passwords for other online accounts. In this regard, the developers of\nvBulletin no longer used MD5 hashed password by default, opting for the more secure bcrypt,\n\n4\n\n\fCreative Technology Ltd\nsince the March 2014 version of vBulletin. This reinforces the point that if the Organisation\nhad implemented the updates, the users’ hashed passwords would be more secure.\n12\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner found the Organisation in breach of section 24\n\nof the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n13\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative in the investigations and had provided prompt\n\nand detailed responses to the Commission’s requests for information;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation implemented reasonable remedial and corrective actions to\n\naddress the Incident, which includes notifying the affected Active Users;\n(c)\n\neven though the Organisation had deleted the database, it made the effort to go\n\nthrough its email logs to determine the number of affected user emails which contained\neither names or partial names.\n14\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations\n\nhighlighting the low sensitivity of the personal data that was disclosed and the fact that the\ndisclosure was unlikely to have caused serious or substantial harm or injury. The type of\npersonal data involved in the Incident (as set out at [5] above) has already been taken into\nconsideration when deciding on the quantum of the financial penalty to be imposed and, as\nsuch, no further reduction in the quantum is warranted.\n15\n\nThe Organisation’s deletion of the user database is an aggravating factor that affected\n\nthe Commission’s investigations. The number of affected individuals estimated by the\nOrganisation could not be verified given their deletion of the user database. The Organisation\nwas notified about the Incident by a security researcher on 4 June, verified that user account\ninformation had been exfiltrated, and by 20 June it had shut down the forum and deleted the\nuser database: see [8]. These decisions were made within a short period of 2 weeks but cast a\nshadow stretching far into the future. By the time the Organisation was formally notified that\n\n5\n\n\fCreative Technology Ltd\nthe Commission was commencing investigations in November 2018, the user database had\nbeen expunged for 5 months.\n16\n\nIn Re NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 10, the Commission\n\nstated that all organisations have the duty to preserve evidence and that it does not look\nfavourably on the destruction or deletion of potentially relevant documents and records. The\ndecision sets out some of the factors that the Commission would take into account in\ndetermining whether or not an organisation would be sanctioned for such deletion or\ndestruction. These factors include whether or not the deletion prejudiced a fair investigation\nand whether or not legal proceedings were anticipated or contemplated. In this case,\ninvestigations were prejudiced given that the number of affected individuals could not be\nverified.\n17\n\nThe Organisation made representations stating that it had deleted the user database to\n\ncomply with section 25 of the PDPA, which imposed an obligation on organisations to cease\nretention of personal data once the purpose for its collection is met, and retention is no longer\nnecessary for legal or business purposes. The Organisation submitted that section 25 applied\nto a situation where there was an ongoing legal course of action or a risk of potential litigation,\nneither of which existed at the time. The Organisation’s interpretation of section 25 is\nunnecessarily narrow. As the Commission held in NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd,\nsection 25 allows for the retention of personal data where it is required for legal purposes such\nas investigations by the Commission.\n18\n\nThe question is whether, in June 2018 when the user database was deleted, the\n\nOrganisation could have anticipated an investigation by the Commission. There are a number\nof facts that the Organisation should have considered before deciding to delete the user\ndatabase. First, the source of information about the exfiltration was an external security\nresearcher; second, the nature of notification was that the security researcher had received\npersonal data extracted from the Forum from a third party source; third, the Organisation\nverified that personal data from 484,512 user accounts had been exfiltrated: see paragraph 4.\nCollectively, these facts point to a not insignificant data breach that affected a significant\nnumber of users, anyone of whom might initiate a complaint.\n\n6\n\n\fCreative Technology Ltd\n19\n\nThe Organisation ought to have retained the user database offline for a period, but could\n\nhave limited access to it. It is not necessary at this point to venture an opinion about how long\nthe Organisation ought to have preserved the user database. The necessity of preservation and\nthe period of preservation is determined on the facts of each case. What can be said is that the\ndecision to delete the user database within 2 weeks of discovering the Incident was taken too\nhastily.\n20\n\nThe Organisation made representations stating that it had not deleted the user database\n\nin bad faith. Whilst it has been said that the decision was taken too hastily, there is no evidence\nto suggest that the decision was taken in bad faith or in order to put evidence beyond the reach\nof investigations. These are not considerations that factored in the determination of the\ndirections.\n21\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $15,000\n\nwithin 30 days, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full.\n22\n\nThe Commissioner decided not to impose any other direction as the Organisation has\n\nceased to operate the Forum and no longer retains the database of Forum users.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions, including a financial penalty of $20,000, were imposed on Society of Tourist Guides for breaches of the PDPA.

Tourist guides registered with STB may sign up as members of the Organisation\n(“Members”). In May 2018, the Organisation engaged a Vietnam-based IT company (the\n“Vendor”) to develop its website https://societyoftouristguides.org.sg (the “Website”).\n\n3\n\nOne of the Organisation’s purposes for the Website was to collect personal data from\n\nits Members. Personal data was collected from Members through their respective user accounts\non the Website and included their names, photographs, contact numbers, e-mail addresses and\n2\n\n\fa write-up of themselves (for example, with the type of services they provided) (“Profile\nData”). Members could also upload images of their identification documents (e.g. NRIC,\nemployment pass, driving and vocational licences) which contained various personal data (“ID\nData”).\n\n4\n\nMembers’ Profile Data were published on their respective public profile pages on the\n\nWebsite. This enabled members of the public to find and engage a Member with the necessary\nexperience and expertise to provide services that he or she required.\n\n5\n\nAs regards the ID Data, these were used by the Organisation for a few purposes. These\n\nincluded (i) applying for SkillsFuture grants for training programmes conducted for Members;\n(ii) facilitating arrangements for Members to gain access to secure locations when required\n(e.g. transit areas in airports); and (iii) verifying that the Members were qualified to provide\ntransport services based on his or her driving and vocational licences.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation did not specify any requirements to its Vendor with respect to the\n\nstorage and protection of Members’ personal data collected through the Website. The Website\nwas launched on 1 October 2018. Since its launch, the Organisation has been managing the\nWebsite, with the Vendor’s role limited to ad-hoc technical assistance.\n\n7\n\nOn 3 March 2019, the Commission received a complaint that there had been disclosure\n\nwithout consent of sensitive information of individuals, such as Singapore National\nRegistration Identity Card (“NRIC”), Driving Licence and photographs, through links on the\nWebsite (the “Incident”). The Commission’s investigations revealed that a total of 111 unique\n\n1\n\n\fMembers were affected by the Incident (the “Affected Members”)1. In this regard, the publicly\naccessible directories on the Website (“Web Directories”) were found to store images of\nidentification documents set out below which contained ID Data of the Affected Members (the\n“Disclosed Data”):\nS/N. Type of Identification\nDocument\n\n1\n\nType of Personal Data in the\nIdentification Document\n\nNumber of\nMembers\nAffected\n\n1.\n\nSingapore National\nRegistration Identity\nCard (“NRIC”)\n\nName, NRIC number,\nphotograph, thumbprint, address,\ndate of birth, country of birth,\nrace, gender and date of issue.\n\n97\n\n2.\n\nSingapore Armed\nForces Identity Card\n\nName, NRIC number/colour,\n1\nphotograph, address, date of birth,\ncountry of birth, race, gender,\nblood group, service status and\nmilitary rank status.\n\n3.\n\nVietnamese Identity\nCard\n\nName, card number, photograph,\ndate of birth, place of birth, place\nof residence, fingerprints, ethnic\ngroup, religion and date of issue.\n\n1\n\n4.\n\nSingapore Employment Name, photograph, occupation,\nPass\nForeign Identification Number,\ndate of application, date of issue,\ndate of expiry and employer.\n\n1\n\n5.\n\nSingapore Driving\nLicence\n\nName, licence number (same as\nNRIC number), photograph, date\nof birth, classes of vehicles the\nindividual is licensed to drive and\neach pass date and date of issue.\n\n47\n\n6.\n\nSingapore Vocational\nLicence\n\nName, licence number (same as\n16\nNRIC number), photograph, date\nof issue and type and description\nof each vocational licence held,\nand their respective dates of issue.\n\nA Member could have uploaded images of more than one type of identification document on the Website.\n\n2\n\n\f8\n\nIt also emerged in the course of the Commission’s investigations that the Organisation\n\nhad not appointed any data protection officer (“DPO”), and had not developed and put in place\nany data protection policies that are necessary for it to meet its obligations under the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n9\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nAppointed two DPOs;\n\n(b)\n\nWith the assistance of its Vendor, disabled public access to the Web Directories\n\nand contacted Google to remove all cached images of the Disclosed Data; and\n(c)\n\nDeveloped a data protection policy.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n10\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned and managed the Website, and had\n\npossession and control over the Disclosed Data at all material times. While the Vendor had\nbeen engaged to develop the Website and subsequently provided technical assistance on an adhoc basis, the Vendor had not processed any personal data collected via the Website on the\nOrganisation’s behalf. The Vendor was therefore not a data intermediary of the Organisation,\nand the Organisation was solely responsible for the protection of the Disclosed Data under the\nPDPA.\n\n3\n\n\f11\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n\n12\n\nIn this regard, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had failed to put in place\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Disclosed Data for the following reasons. First,\nas mentioned at [6], the Organisation did not specify any requirements to its Vendor with\nrespect to the storage and protection of personal data (including the ID Data) which was\ncollected from Members through the Website. The Organisation had intended for the Website\nto have public profile pages for which Members’ Profile Data were displayed for public access,\nbut at the same time ID Data was collected and to be used for administrative purposes like\napplying for training grants, facilitating access to secure location and verifying driving\nqualifications. Clear requirements could and should have been communicated to its Vendor\nthat ID Data collected through the Website was not meant to be publicly accessible. This can\nbe done by the Organisation from the perspective of the business owner of the Website, while\nrelying on the Vendor to propose the technical implementation that will meet this business\nrequirement.\n\n13\n\nThe Commission’s investigations also revealed that security testing had never been\n\nconducted since the launch of the Website in October 2018. In this regard, the Organisation\nadmitted that it failed to take into consideration the security arrangements of the Website due\nto its lack of experience. As observed in WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26\nat [24], while an organisation may not have the requisite level of technical expertise, a\n4\n\n\fresponsible organisation would have made genuine attempts to give proper instructions to its\nservice providers. The gravamen in the present case was the Organisation’s failure to do so.\n\n14\n\nThe Commission’s Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018)\n\nprovides guidance on what is expected from organisations contracting professional services to\nbuild their corporate websites or other online portals. In particular, organisations that engage\nIT vendors to develop and/or maintain their websites should emphasize the need for personal\ndata protection to their IT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms.2\n\n15\n\nSecondly, and as observed in Re Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5 at [21] to [23], where\n\ndocuments containing personal data have to reside on web servers, folder or directory\npermissions are common and direct methods of controlling access and preventing unauthorised\naccess by public users and web crawlers. Depending on its business needs and circumstances,\nthe Organisation could have instructed the Vendor to implement any of the following\nreasonable technical security measures to protect the Disclosed ID Images:\n(a)\n\nplace documents containing the Disclosed ID Images in a non-public\n\nfolder/directory.\n(b)\n\nplace documents containing the Disclosed ID Images in a non-public folder or\n\ndirectory, with access to these documents controlled through web applications on the\nserver.\n(c)\n\nplace documents containing the Disclosed ID Images in a sub-folder within the\n\nPublic Directory but control access to files by creating a .htaccess file within that subfolder. This .htaccess file may specify the access restrictions (e.g. implement a\npassword requirement or an IP address restriction).\n\n2\n\nGuide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1]\n\n5\n\n\f16\n\nIn view of the above, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had contravened\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA\n\n17\n\nIn relation to the Organisation’s failure to appoint a DPO and develop and implement\n\nany data protection policy, these are required under sections 11(3) and 12 respectively of the\nPDPA. In particular, section 11(3) requires organisations to designate one or more individuals\n(typically referred to as a DPO) to be responsible for ensuring that they comply with the PDPA.\nSection 12 of the PDPA requires organisations to (among other things):\n(a)\n\ndevelop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the\n\norganisation to meet the obligations of the organisation under the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\n18\n\ncommunicate information about such policies to its staff.\n\nThe importance of these requirements have been emphasised multiple times in previous\n\ndecisions. For example, it is important for an organisation to documents its data protection\npolicies and practices in writing as they serve to increase awareness and ensure accountability\nof the organisation’s obligations under the PDPA (Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [32]).\nSimilarly, appointing a DPO is important in ensuring the proper implementation of an\norganisation’s data protection policies and practices, as well as compliance with the PDPA (see\ne.g. Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37]).\n\n6\n\n\f19\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation was clearly in breach of sections 11(3) and 12\n\nof the PDPA. While it has since appointed DPOs, it has not yet developed written policies and\npractices necessary to ensure its compliance with the PDPA.\n\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n\n20\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations on the\n\namount of financial penalty which the Commissioner intended to impose, and requested that\nthe financial penalty be paid in instalments. The Organisation raised the following factors for\nthe Commissioner’s consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had limited funds in its bank account and does not have any\n\ntangible assets which may be sold to raise funds to pay the financial penalty;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had been making losses in the preceding 3 months; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation has been seeking funding assistance from the Singapore\n\nTourism Board.\n\n21\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has decided to\n\nmaintain the financial penalty set out in [23(a)]. The matters raised by the Organisation in [20]\nare not additional mitigating factors that justify a reduction in the financial penalty. However,\nthe Commissioner is agreeable to the Organisation’s request that the financial penalty be paid\nin instalments.\n\n7\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Directions\n\n22\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation under section\n\n29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative in the investigations and provided\n\ninformation promptly;\n(b)\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took action to disable\n\npublic access to the Web Directories, and notified its Members of the Incident; and\n(c)\n\nThere was limited unauthorised access and disclosure of the Disclosed ID\n\nImages as the Web Directories had only been accessed a total of 6 times.\n\n23\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby directs\n\nthe Organisation to:\n(a)\n\nPay a financial penalty of $20,000 in 8 instalments by the due dates as set out\n\nbelow, failing which, the full outstanding amount shall become due and payable\nimmediately and interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until the financial penalty is paid in full:\n(i)\n\n1st instalment of $2,500 on 1 February 2020;\n\n(ii)\n\n2nd instalment of $2,500 on 1 March 2020;\n\n(iii)\n\n3rd instalment of $2,500 on 1 April 2020;\n\n8\n\n\f(iv)\n\n4th instalment of $2,500 on 1 May 2020;\n\n(v)\n\n5th instalment of $2,500 on 1 June 2020;\n\n(vi)\n\n6th instalment of $2,500 on 1 July 2020;\n\n(vii)\n\n7th instalment of $2,500 on 1 August 2020; and\n\n(viii) 8th instalment of $2,500 on 1 September 2020.\n(b)\n\nComplete the following within 60 days from the date of this direction:\n\n(i)\n\nReview the security of the Website and implement appropriate security\narrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or control;\n\n(ii)\n\nPut in place written internal policies and practices as required under\nsection 12 of the PDPA;\n\n(iii)\n\nDevelop and implement a training policy for employees of the\nOrganisation handling personal data to be trained to be aware of, and to\ncomply with the requirements of, the PDPA when handling personal\ndata; and\n\n(iv)\n\nRequire all existing employees to attend such training.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n9\n\n\f","decision":"Directions, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of S$5,000 was imposed on PeopleSearch for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data of its clients.

Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 47\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1903-B3521\n26 December 2019\nIntroduction\n1\n\nPeopleSearch Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a subsidiary of a listed Singapore\n\ncompany (“Listed Company”) that provides professional recruitment and flexible staffing\nservices in Asia. On 15 March 2019, the Listed Company notified the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) of a ransomware attack suffered by the Organisation on 1 to\n2 March 2019, which resulted in the Organisation not being able to access its clients’ personal\ndata (the “Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nAt the material time, the Organisation had a business division that managed outsourced\n\npayroll for the Organisation’s clients. In order to do so, the Organisation used a payroll software\ninstalled in a server in a virtual machine environment (the “VM Server”). The Organisation’s\nclients would connect to the VM Server through remote desktop protocol to use the payroll\nsoftware. All the information (including personal data) in the payroll software was stored in a\ndatabase that was hosted in the VM Server.\n3\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the database included the following personal data of 472\n\nindividuals employed by 2 of the Organisation’s clients1 (collectively, “Employee Data”):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nResidential address;\n\nThe payroll information of the Organisation’s other clients had been migrated from the VM Server to another\nserver. This was in preparation for the Organisation’s business division managing outsource payroll being\nincorporated into a separate legal entity.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fPeopleSearch Pte. Ltd.\n\n4\n\n(d)\n\nContact number;\n\n(e)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(f)\n\nBank account number; and\n\n(g)\n\nSalary details.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 47\n\nThe database also included the following personal data of the employees’ next of kin\n\n(“Next of Kin Data”)2:\n\n5\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nAge;\n\n(c)\n\nContact number; and\n\n(d)\n\nRelationship to the respective individual.\n\nTaking into consideration the individuals whose information were stored as Next of Kin\n\nData, it is estimated that a total of 944 individuals (comprising the 472 individuals with\nEmployee Data and 472 individuals with Next of Kin Data) were affected by the Incident (the\n“Affected Individuals”).3\n6\n\nThe Organisation discovered the Incident on 4 March 2019 when a ransom note\n\nappeared when it attempted to access the VM Server. The ransom note informed the\nOrganisation that its files had been encrypted, and required payment in Bitcoins in exchange\nfor the decryption key. The Organisation refused to pay the ransom to the cyber-attacker and\nrestored its business operations by using a backup of the VM Server as at 1 March 2019.\n7\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the Organisation promptly carried out the following\n\nremedial actions:\n\n2\n\nSome or all of the Next of Kin Data may also constitute Employee Data in that it may be data about the employee\n(namely, who is their next of kin) which may enable the employee to be identified. However, as the total number\nof Affected Individuals includes both the employees and their next of kin, the two sets of data are identified\nseparately for the purposes of this Decision.\n3\nThe Organisation was unable to provide the Commission with the number of individuals who were listed as\n“next of kin” in the payroll information of the 472 individuals as it was no longer in possession of the relevant\ncustomer data file. It is estimated that each of the 472 individuals would have provided Next of Kin Data of at\nleast 1 individual.\n\n3\n\n\fPeopleSearch Pte. Ltd.\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 47\n\nDisabled remote desktop accounts and/or changed passwords to mitigate any\n\nrisks relating to credentials; and\n(b)\n8\n\nInstalled the latest windows server updates on the restored VM Server.\n\nBased on the Organisation’s internal investigations, there was no spike in the outgoing\n\ntraffic logs from the VM Server at the time of the Incident. This suggested that the risk that\nEmployee Data (including the Next of Kin Data) was exfiltrated by the cyber-attacker was\nimmaterial. On 1 April 2019, the Organisation’s business division managing outsource payroll\nwas incorporated into a separate legal entity and the VM Server was decommissioned.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisations had breached section 24 of the PDPA\n9\n\nIt is undisputed that Employee Data and Next of Kin Data constitutes “personal data”\n\nas defined in section 2(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”). The\nOrganisation had possession and/or control over the Employee Data and Next of Kin Data at\nall material times, and accepted its responsibility for protecting such data under the PDPA.\nWhile there may have been no exfiltration of the Employee Data, as mentioned at [8], there\nwas unauthorised modification of the Employee Data as the ransomware rendered it\ninaccessible to the Organisation.\n10\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. In assessing the standard of reasonable security arrangements required, I considered the\nfact that Employee Data included NRIC numbers and personal data of a financial nature (i.e.\nbank account numbers and salary details).4 When it comes to the protection of such personal\ndata, there is a need to put in place stronger security measures because of the actual or potential\nharm, and the severity of such harm, that may befall an individual from an unauthorised use of\nsuch data.5 In my view, the Organisation failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements\nto protect the Employee Data and Next of Kin Data for the reasons explained below.\n\n4\n5\n\nRe Aviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 4 at [17]\nRe Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [25]\n\n4\n\n\fPeopleSearch Pte. Ltd.\n11\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 47\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had not carried out any security scans, penetration\n\ntesting or patching of the VM Server for at least 12 months preceding the Incident. According\nto the Organisation, its omission was due to a departure of an employee who was responsible\nfor oversight of the VM Server. This explanation is not accepted.\n12\n\nAs emphasized in previous decisions and the Commission’s Guide to Securing Personal\n\nData in Electronic Medium (revised 20 January 2017) at [16.3] and [16.4], regular security\ntesting and patching of IT systems are important security measures that organisations should\nimplement to guard against a possible intrusion or attack.6 The Organisation’s failure to have\nany process in place to ensure regular security testing and patching of the VM Server resulted\nin a system that had vulnerabilities and gaps that were exploited by the attacker in planting the\nransomware to encrypt the Employee Data. In view of the fact that the VM Server stored\npersonal data of a sensitive nature, this fell far short of the standard of protection required. In\nthe circumstances, I find the Organisation in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n13\n\nNevertheless, I note that the Organisation had a good practice of having regular backups\n\nof the VM Server. This significantly mitigated the impact of the Incident on the Organisation’s\nbusiness operations. The Organisation was able to restore the VM Server from a backup as at\n1 March 2019, and only lost access to the Employee Data for approximately 2 days from 2\nMarch 2019 to 4 March 2019.\n14\n\nIn today’s digital age where organisations store information (including personal data)\n\nonline and move towards a paperless future, it is critically important that they have processes\nin place to backup their data at frequent and regular intervals. The failure to do so may result\nin crippling consequences to an organisation’s business operations in the event of a cyberattack.\nIn this case, the Organisation’s good practice of having regular backups is a strong mitigating\nfactor that I have taken into account in determining the quantum of financial penalty to impose.\n\n6\n\nSee for example Re Genki Sushi Singapore Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 26 at [20] and [21]\n\n5\n\n\fPeopleSearch Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 47\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n15\n\nHaving found the Organisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA, I took into account\n\nthe following mitigating factors in determining the directions to be imposed on the\nOrganisation:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation’s regular backup process of the VM Server which significantly\n\nmitigated the impact of Incident as discussed at [13] and [14];\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation’s prompt actions to mitigate the effects of the Incident and\n\nprevent recurrence of a similar breach;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation’s full cooperation with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(d)\n\nThere did not appear to be any exfiltration of Employee Data from the VM\n\nServer; and\n(e)\n\nThe Commission did not receive any complaints about the Incident and there\n\nwas no indication that the Incident caused harm to the Affected Individuals.\n16\n\nHaving considered all the relevant facts and circumstances of this case, I hereby direct\n\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $5,000 within 30 days from the date of this\ndirection, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $6,000 was imposed on National Healthcare Group for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect a list containing the personal data of partner doctors and members of the public from being publicly accessible online.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Healthcare"],"date":"2020-01-09","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---National-Healthcare-Group-Pte-Ltd---261219.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by National Healthcare Group","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2020/01/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-national-healthcare-group","timestamp":"2020-01-09","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nCase No DP-1802-B1703 and DP-1802-B1765\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1802-B1703 and DP1802-B1765\n\n26 December 2019\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 10 February 2018, the National Healthcare Group Pte Ltd (the\n\n“Organisation”) notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) about a complaint it had received in relation to a list containing\npersonal information of partner doctors of the Organisation (the “List”) which\nwas accessible on the Internet (the “Incident”). Subsequently, on 28 February\n2018, the Commission received a separate complaint over the Incident.\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nOn 17 March 2015, the Organisation awarded a developer (“Website\n\nDeveloper”) a contract to develop its website (the “Website”). The\nOrganisation specified the Website’s functional requirements and contents. A\ncompany specialising in IT services (“IT Services Provider”) provided the\nOrganisation with IT support. In this regard, the IT Services Provider ensured\nthat the IT specifications of the Organisation were complied with by the Web\nDeveloper, which included coordinating and verifying bug fixes and remedies\n\n2\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nof security vulnerabilities implemented by the Web Developer. During the\nprocess of developing the Website, a section for restricting access to the Website\n(including the List) was not included in a web configuration file. 1 The\nOrganisation, Website Developer and IT Services Provider signed off on the\nWebsite’s functional requirements specification, user acceptance test cases, and\nwebsite commissioning. The relevant web configuration file was not examined\nbefore the Website went “live” in December 2015.\n3\n\nAround June or July 2016, a vendor (the “Vendor”) was engaged to\n\nconduct a penetration test of the Website. The penetration test report (the\n“Penetration Test Report”) highlighted the unrestricted access to the List\nthrough the Internet as a vulnerability. The Penetration Test Report also\nrecommended the remedy, which was to ensure that the authorisation rules be\nconfigured to restrict Internet access to authorised users only.\n4\n\nOn 7 February 2018, a general practitioner (“GP”), who had signed up\n\nto be a partner doctor of the Organisation, found the List through a Google\nsearch of her name and notified the Organisation. The List contained personal\ninformation of 129 GPs who had registered to be partner doctors of the\nOrganisation via an online form on the Website (“NHG Partners”), and\npersonal information of 5 members of public which were generated when they\nsubmitted feedback on the Website.\n\n1\n\nWeb configuration files determine the way a website or directory on a website behaves. Web\nconfiguration files placed in the root directory of a website will affect the behavior of the entire\nsite.\n\n3\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n5\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nThe types of information contained in the List (collectively, the\n\n“Disclosed Data”) include:\n(a)\n\nWith respect to the 129 GPs:\n(i)\n\ntheir full names (128 GPs), mobile numbers (111 GPs),\n\nmailing address (14 GPs), email address (117 GPs) and clinic\naddress (115 GPs) (collectively, “GP’s Contact Information”);\n(ii)\n\nSingapore Medical Council (“SMC”) registration\n\nnumbers of 129 GPs (“GP’s Registration Numbers”); and\n(iii)\n\nNRIC numbers (111 GPs), dates of birth (112 GPs) and\n\nphotographs (41 GPs) (collectively, “GP’s Other Data”).\n(b)\n\nWith respect to the 5 non-GPs, full names and email addresses,\n\nas well as mobile numbers of 3 of them (“Other Individual’s Data”).\n6\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident on 7 February 2018, the\n\nOrganisation promptly carried out the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nOn 8 February 2018, the Organisation took the Website offline,\n\nas well as found and fixed the cause of the Incident;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation sent several requests to Google to remove\n\ncached copies of the List indexed from 9 to 13 February 2018. From 21\nFebruary 2018, the Organisation performed daily Google searches on\nthe 129 affected records until the cached links could no longer be found\non 5 March 2018. Thereafter, the Organisation conducted periodic\nGoogle searches until 8 May 2018; and\n\n4\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n(c)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nFrom 19 February 2018 to 6 March 2018, the Organisation\n\ncontacted all affected GPs to inform them of the Incident.\n7\n\nIn addition, to prevent a recurrence of a similar Incident, the\n\nOrganisation has also adopted the following practices:\n(a)\n\nTwo additional checks at front-end publishing site for\n\nSharePoint websites will be carried out during user acceptance test and\nprior to going “live”:\n(i)\n\nThe project manager would check for configuration\n\nwhich controls publishing of “visible” pages (lists) after the\nvendor submits the web configuration prior to the deployment;\nand\n(ii)\n\nThe test script would include testing of authorised access\n\nto the relevant web pages. The web pages would also generally\nbe tested to ensure non-public web pages cannot be accessed by\nnon-authorised users.\n(b)\n\nPerforming penetration tests prior to websites going “live”.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA applies to the\nDisclosed Data\n8\n\nWhile the Disclosed Data is personal data as defined in section 2(1) of\n\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24 did not apply to the following 2 categories of Disclosed Data\n– GP’s Contact Information and GP’s Registration Numbers.\n\n5\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n9\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nIn relation to GP’s Contact Information, pursuant to section 4(5) of the\n\nPDPA, Parts III to VI of the PDPA do not apply to business contact information.\nGP’s Contact Information falls within the definition of “business contact\ninformation” as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA because it was provided by\nthe GPs to the Organisation for the purposes of registration as NHG Partners,\nand as a means of contacting them in their professional capacity.\n10\n\nIn relation to GP’s Registration Numbers, the same information is\n\ngenerally available to the public on the SMC website and hence it is “publicly\navailable” as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA. The raison d’etre for making\nsuch information available is to assist in the identification of licensed medical\npractitioners and the nature of their qualification and practice. The register of\nmedical practitioners is maintained by the Singapore Medical Council under\nsection 19 of the Medical Registration Act. It is maintained as multiple lists, i.e.,\nlocally-trained\n\ndoctors,\n\ninternational\n\nmedical\n\ngraduates,\n\nprovisional,\n\nconditional, temporary or full registrations, as well as specialist registration and\nfamily physician registration. This information enables an inquisitive patient to\nverify the nature of medical practice that a physician is permitted to practice. To\nmy mind, this is information that falls under the “other similar information about\nthe individual” limb of the definition of business contact information as it assists\nin the identification of the medical practitioner to whom the business contact\ninformation relates.\n11\n\nIn the circumstances, the Protection Obligation only applied to GP’s\n\nOther Data and Other Individual’s Data (collectively, the “Disclosed Personal\nData”).\nWhether the Organisation had breached the Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA\n\n6\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n12\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n13\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned the Website and had\n\npossession and control over the Disclosed Personal Data at all material times.\nWhile the Website Developer was engaged to develop the Website and the IT\nServices Provider provided IT support to the Organisation (including\nmaintenance and technical support for the Website), the investigations revealed\nthat neither of these parties processed the Disclosed Personal Data on the\nOrganisation’s behalf with respect to the Website. The IT Service Provider and\nWebsite Developer were accordingly not data intermediaries with respect to the\noperation of the Website, and the Organisation was solely responsible for the\nprotection of the Disclosed Personal Data.\n14\n\nBased on the investigations, the Organisation had failed to put in place\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Disclosed Personal Data as\nexplained below.\n15\n\nThe Penetration Test Report expressly pointed out that web services\n\ncould be used to access SharePoint data (which included the List containing the\nDisclosed Personal Data) via the Internet and recommended that this\nvulnerability be remediated by reconfiguring the web configuration to restrict\naccess to authorised users only. The Penetration Test Report was issued more\nthan a year prior to the Incident. This was more than sufficient time for the\nOrganisation to remedy the vulnerability which caused the Incident.\n\n7\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n16\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nAccording to the Organisation, the vulnerability was inadvertently left\n\nunfixed as it was not sufficiently highlighted by the Vendor in the Penetration\nTest Report. This was an unsatisfactory excuse. First, the relevant findings and\nrecommendations were the first item in the Penetration Test Report. Second,\nthey were expressed in terms that no technical expertise was required for their\nsignificance to be understood. If the Organisation did not understand the\nfindings and/or recommendations, it should have consulted the Vendor for\nclarifications.\n17\n\nThe Organisation also asserted that it had relied on IT Services Provider\n\nand Website Developer to act on any issues identified in the Penetration Test\nReport. It should be reiterated that while an organisation may delegate work to\nvendors to comply with the PDPA, the organisation’s responsibility for\ncomplying with its statutory obligations under the PDPA may not be delegated.2\nIn this case, the Organisation failed to exercise reasonable oversight with\nrespect to the review of the Penetration Test Report and rectification of the\nvulnerabilities of its Website.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n18\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made\n\nrepresentations and asked that a warning to be imposed in lieu of a financial\npenalty. The Organisation raised the following factors in its representations:\n(a)\n\nAs the appointed public healthcare shared services provider, the\n\nIT Services Provider was responsible for the overall management,\n\n2\n\nSee WTS Automobile Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 26 at [14] and [23].\n\n8\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\ndeployment and maintenance of the Organisation’s IT systems,\nincluding the Website. Similar to the facts of Re Singapore Health\nServices Pte Ltd & Ors [2019] PDPC 3, the IT Services Provider’s staff\nwas deployed to the Organisation to support day-to-day operations and\nprovide technical support. As there was no IT staff employed by the\nOrganisation, it had to rely on the technical expertise provided by the IT\nServices Provider. In particular, the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”)\nand Cluster Information Security Officer (“CISO”) for the Organisation\nwas employed by the IT Services Provider and seconded to the\nOrganisation;\n(b)\n\nThe IT Services Provider was a data intermediary. The Website’s\n\ndatabase was hosted on the Healthcare Data Centre (H-Cloud) network\nwhich was (and is still) operated, maintained and managed by the IT\nServices Provider;\n(c)\n\nThe IT Services Provider was in charge of the penetration test,\n\nas well as coordinating and deploying the fixes. The vulnerability on the\nWebsite that caused the Incident was not highlighted to the\nOrganisation; and\n(d)\n\nThe Disclosed Personal Data was not medical data, and therefore\n\nnot personal data of a particularly sensitive nature which should be\naccorded a higher standard of protection.\n19\n\nHaving considered the representations, I have decided to maintain the\n\nfinancial penalty set out in [21] for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nWhile the IT Services Provider’s staff deployed to fill the CIO\n\nand CISO role may have been employed by the IT Services Provider, to\n9\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nthe extent that they were carrying out the functions of the Organisation’s\nCIO and CISO in accordance to the terms of their secondment, they were\nacting on behalf of the Organisation. As such, I find that their actions\nshould be attributed to the Organisation and not the IT Services\nProvider;\n(b)\n\nThe Incident did not arise from a compromise of the Healthcare\n\nData Centre (H-Cloud) network that hosted the Website’s database.\nInstead, and as mentioned at [2], the cause of the Incident was that a\nsection for restricting access to the Website (including the List) was not\nincluded in a web configuration file. While the IT Services Provider\nprovided technical support for the Website, it did not process the\nDisclosed Personal Data through the Website. The IT Services Provider\nwas accordingly not a data intermediary with respect to operation of the\nWebsite;\n(c)\n\nAs explained at [15] to [17], the Organisation failed to exercise\n\nreasonable oversight with respect to review of the Penetration Test\nReport and rectification of vulnerabilities of the Website. In this regard,\nthe Penetration Test Report had expressly pointed out that web services\ncould be used to access SharePoint data (which included the List\ncontaining the Disclosed Personal Data) and recommended that this\nvulnerability be remediated by reconfiguring the web configuration to\nrestrict access to authorised users only; and\n(d)\n\nThe fact that the Disclosed Personal Data was not medical data\n\nhad already been taken into account in the quantum of financial penalty\nset out in [21], which would have been higher if the Disclosed Personal\nData had been of a more sensitive nature, such as medical data.\n\n10\n\n\fNational Healthcare Group Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 46\n\nDirections\n20\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder section 29 of the PDPA, I took into account the following mitigating\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following the\n\nIncident as set out in [6] and [7];\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation was fully cooperative during the investigations;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation took immediate steps to notify the affected\n\nindividuals of the Incident; and\n(d)\n\nthere was unauthorised disclosure to one individual and no\n\nmodification or exfiltration of the Disclosed Personal Data.\n21\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, I hereby direct\n\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $6,000 within 30 days from the\ndate of the directions, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the\noutstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid\nin full.

An employee of the Organisation (the “Employee”) who had sent out two\nseparate batches of e-mails attaching an Excel spreadsheet (the “Spreadsheet”) containing the\npersonal data of certain members of the Organisation’s shooting club (the “SSC”) to other\nmembers (the “Incident”).\n2\n\nAccording to the Employee, his job scope included sending mass e-mails to SSC\n\nmembers. He has been sending such e-mails since September 2016 at least once a month.\nAccording to him, he was not aware of any SOPs for sending of such mass emails. The\nEmployee claims that his supervisor had instructed him verbally on the process. First, prepare\nproposed e-mail, and attach a spreadsheet containing intended recipients’ e-mail addresses\nextracted from another internal system. Next, send this draft email from his individual work email account to the official SSC e-mail account. Thereafter, copy the intended recipients’\nemails addresses into the draft email, and delete the attached spreadsheet, before sending out\nthe mass email. This is the process that the Employee has been following whenever he sends\nmass e-mails to SSC members, as was the case during the Incident.\n3\n\nThe Organisation claims that it was not aware of this process for mass e-mails.\n\nHowever, its staff were briefed on the practice of using the bcc function when sending mass emails and were verbally instructed to “check and ensure that no unnecessary information or\ndocument (including those which contain personal data) has been enclosed before sending an\nemail to members”.\n4\n\nThe Incident occurred on 9 September 2018. The Employee followed this procedure to\n\npublicise an upcoming event. After copying the e-mail addresses from the Spreadsheet and\npasting it in the bcc field of the e-mail, the Employee tried to delete the Spreadsheet. He was\n2\n\n\fprompted by the webmail that “the attachment could not be removed and to try again”. This\nwas the first time he encountered such an error message. The Employee claims that upon trying\nto delete the Spreadsheet again, “the Spreadsheet disappeared from the email draft” and he\nproceeded to send the first batch of mass e-mails. The same thing happened for the second\nbatch of mass e-mails sent by the Employee. According to the Employee, he was notified by\nan SSC member right after sending the second batch of mass e-mails that the Spreadsheet had\nbeen attached to the mass e-mails. Upon checking the “Sent Items” folder on the SSC e-mail\naccount, he realised that the Spreadsheet was attached in the sent e-mails.\n5\n\nThe Incident resulted in the Spreadsheet containing the personal data of 780 SSC\n\nmembers being sent to 491 SSC members. The types of personal data in the Spreadsheet (the\n“Personal Data”) included the following:\n\n6\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(d)\n\nAddress;\n\n(e)\n\nTelephone number; and\n\n(f)\n\nE-mail address.\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a)\n\nCompleted the masking of members’ NRIC number in its internal systems and\n\nreports, which it was in the process of undertaking;\n(b)\n\nCirculated the Commission’s guidelines on Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\n(the “PDPA”) with reminders to be mindful when handling personal data;\n(c)\n\nNotified all affected SSC members about the Incident via e-mail and SMS, and\n\nprovided an e-mail address and phone number for members to contact for any queries\non the Incident;\n\n3\n\n\f(d)\n\nPut up an announcement on the Organisation’s website regarding the Incident;\n\n(e)\n\nSet up an incident response team and incident management hotline and prepared\n\nan FAQ for its frontline staff; and\n(f)\n\nFollowed up with phone calls to the SSC members who received the\n\nSpreadsheet to delete the attachment.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n7\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks\n(“Protection Obligation”).\n8\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation alleges that it had replicated the steps taken by\n\nthe Employee to confirm whether or not the Employee’s version of events was accurate. The\nOrganisation claimed that, in replicating these steps, it had similarly encountered the issue as\nset out in paragraph 4 above. When the Commission requested for evidence of the tests\nconducted, the Organisation provided some screenshots of emails with attachments, and stated\nthat the test results were not saved, although “[the investigation team] had witnessed [the test]\nbut no screen shot or video recording was made”. However, these screenshots were\ninconclusive in demonstrating that the Organisation managed to replicate the issues. As part of\nits investigations, the Commission contacted the Organisation’s webmail software service\nprovider who informed that it had not encountered such an issue nor had it encountered or\nreceived any enquiry on such an issue from users of its webmail software at the material time.\nOn a balance of probabilities, based on a review of the evidence before me, I am unconvinced\nthat there was a software glitch. It is more likely that the Employee had simply failed to delete\nthe attached Spreadsheet prior to sending the emails out.\n9\n\nThe key issue in this case revolves around the practice adopted by the Organisation for\n\nsending mass e-mails. The Organisation’s method of drafting the mass e-mail using the\nindividual work e-mail address of the relevant employee and then sending it to the official SSC\ne-mail address with the Spreadsheet attached gave rise to the risk of accidental disclosure of\nthe Personal Data in the Spreadsheet. Manual processes such as this give rise to risks of human\n4\n\n\ferror. Having in mind that this is a task that the Employee had to perform at least once a month,\nand the fact that the Organisation had already digitized its membership records, the task could\nhave been partially automated. There are readily available technical solutions like mail-merge\nfunctions or the creation of frequently used mailing lists. The Commission’s Guide to\nPreventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending Personal Data (published 20\nJanuary 2017) states (at [2.1]) that organisations may implement automated processing of\ndocuments or communications containing personal data (e.g. merging content or populating\nfields from various sources) to ensure destination information is correct. Organisations are also\nreminded to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the automated processing implemented by\nchecking these systems and processes regularly.\n10\n\nFurther, the Guide on Printing Processes for Organisations (published 3 May 2018) also\n\nprovides guidance (at page 11) on how organisations may use Mail Merge when emailing to\nensure the accuracy of the list of intended recipients and the corresponding merged fields in\nthe email.\n11\n\nAdditionally, the Organisation was unaware of this manual process that its Employee\n\nhad been using since September 2016 (and potentially earlier, by other employees or by his\nsupervisor) to send out mass e-mails. As stated in [3], the Organisation claimed that it had\ngiven certain verbal instructions to its staff on data protection handling practices pertaining to\ne-mail correspondence. In general, verbal instructions are insufficient as employees would be\nunable to refer to them in the course of their duties and may very well be unable to recall such\ninstructions after some time. For a regular and perhaps even frequent task like the present\nmonthly mass e-mail to members to publicise upcoming events, the Organisation should have\na properly documented process and consider the use of process automation tools.\n12\n\nIn light of the foregoing, I am satisfied that the Organisation had contravened section\n\n24 of the PDPA.\n13\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission after the preliminary Decision in this\n\nmatter was issued to the Organisation that the following measures have since been put in place:\n(a)\n\nMass emails will no longer be sent using the Organisation’s generic email\n\naccount and will only be sent out by a designated Executive or authorised personnel\napproved by the Club Manager using his or her individual work email account;\n5\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe downloading of the list of members from the Organisation’s system will be\n\ncarried out by the Executive personally;\n(c)\n\nThe categories of personal data in the list of members that may be downloaded\n\nfrom the system has been reduced;\n(d)\n\nThe frequency of mass emails to update members on programmes and events\n\nwill be reduced from monthly to bi-monthly or quarterly;\n(e)\n\nAll new staff will undergo an orientation programme on the operations of the\n\nshooting club within the 1st week of joining and only selected staff will be allowed to\nhandle email updates and will also be trained within the 1st week of joining the club;\n(f)\n\nMore stringent access controls to the Organisation’s databases have been\n\nimplemented;\n(g)\n\nThe 1st 5 characters of members’ NRIC numbers are masked in the\n\nOrganisation’s internal systems;\n(h)\n\nThe IT Policy has been updated to include guidelines for the protection,\n\nencryption and sharing of the Organisation’s database. As part of this update, databases\nare to be encrypted or password protected before they are shared and may only be\nshared with the written consent of a Head of Department or custodian; and\n(i)\n14\n\nTraining has been provided to staff on data handling.\n\nThe Organisation also informed that it was in the midst of enhancing its existing system\n\nto automate the sending of mass emails. The Organisation asked for an extension of the\ntimeframe for implementation of the second direction set out in the next section. The Deputy\nCommission has decided to accede to the Organisation’s request and has lengthened the\ntimeframe to the period set out below.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n15\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\n\nPDPA, I took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation voluntarily notified the Commission of the Incident;\n6\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative and had provided prompt responses to the\n\nCommission’s requests for information;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation implemented remedial actions swiftly to address the Incident;\n\nand\n(d)\n\nthere was no evidence of any further unauthorised use of the Personal Data in\n\nthe Spreadsheet.\n16\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, I hereby direct the\n\nOrganisation:\n(a)\n\nto pay a financial penalty of $10,000 within 30 days of the date of this direction,\n\nfailing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full; and\n(b)\n\nto conduct a review of its email system and processes to put in place process\n\nsafeguards and written internal standard operating procedures to protect the personal\ndata of its members within 120 days of the date of this direction.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n7\n\n\f","decision":"Directions, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $34,000 was imposed on Globalsign.in for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data supplied by its clients.

DP-1708-B1066; DP-1708-B1086\n19 November 2019\n\nIntroduction and Material Facts\n\n1.\n\nMSIG Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“MSIG”) notified the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) on 22 August 2017 that the mass emailing system of\nits service provider, Globalsign.in Pte Ltd’s (“GSI”), had been accessed without\nauthorisation and used to send spam emails (the “Incident”) to 149,172 email addresses\nwhich belonged to MSIG’s customers (“Impacted Customers”).\n\n2.\n\nGSI runs and hosts an email marketing platform known as “Global2Mail Online\nMarketing Web Application” (the “G2M” platform). GSI uses the G2M platform to send\nmass marketing emails to email addresses supplied by its clients.\n\n3.\n\nMSIG, an insurance provider, had engaged GSI to send marketing emails to its\ncustomers via the G2M platform. For this purpose, MSIG and GSI had entered into an\nagreement dated 1 October 2013. An addendum to the said agreement was entered into\non 16 May 2014 to take into consideration the obligations of both organisations under\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”). GSI’s services were renewed by\nMSIG, with MSIG and GSI entering into a new agreement on 1 August 2017 (the\n“Agreements”).\n\n4.\n\nMSIG provided GSI with a list of email addresses of its customers each time an email\nmarketing campaign was launched. For some of the email addresses, MSIG also\nprovided the first and last names to GSI and these would be captured in the G2M\nplatform. According to MSIG, the email addresses and names (where applicable)\nprovided to GSI were password-protected.\n\n2\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n5.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nAlthough no specific retention period for the email addresses provided by MSIG to GSI\nwas stated in the Agreements, MSIG required GSI to delete and purge the email\naddresses and other personal data from its server after each marketing campaign. This\nis seen from emails sent by MSIG to GSI on 9 December 2016, 30 May 2017 and 5 June\n2017 where MSIG asked GSI to confirm that it had purged the email addresses which\nhad been provided by MSIG to GSI for specific marketing campaigns.\n\n6.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, the administrator account of the G2M platform was accessed\nwithout authorisation. By accessing the administrator account, the intruder was also able\nto access the email addresses and, in certain instances, names of individuals (the\n“Compromised Data”) that were stored on the G2M platform.\n\n7.\n\nOn 19 August 2017, the G2M platform sent spam emails to 359,364 email addresses\nthat were stored on the G2M platform (the “Spam Emails”). 149,172 of these email\naddresses were email addresses of MSIG’s Impacted Customers (which MSIG had\nprovided to GSI) and 201,192 were email addresses of customers (“Other Impacted\nIndividuals”) provided to GSI by three of GSI’s other clients for use with the G2M\nplatform. Each of the Spam Emails:\n(a)\n\npurported to provide tips on how to win a lottery;\n\n(b)\n\ncontained a link under “clickbank.net” that redirected its users to a video on\n“lotterydominator.com”;\n\n(c)\n\nappeared be sent from “MSIG Insurance” with the address “service@sg.msigasia.com”;\n\n8.\n\n(d)\n\nwas only sent to one email address; and\n\n(e)\n\ncontained no other personal data other than the email address of the recipient.\n\nAfter MSIG informed the Commission about the Incident on 22 August 2017, MSIG and\nGSI jointly engaged a cyber-security consultancy to investigate into the data breach.\n\n9.\n\nThe cyber-security consultancy’s investigations concluded that the Spam Emails did not\ncontain phishing or malware content. It would appear that the end users who clicked on\nthe links in the Spam Emails were simply redirected to the video on the\n“lotterydominator.com” website and there were no complaints from the users of any\nfurther negative consequences from clicking the links.\n\n10.\n\nMSIG took the following remedial action after the Incident:\n\n3\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nOn 21 August 2017, MSIG posted an alert on the Spam Emails on its corporate\nwebsite and Facebook page.\n\n(b)\n\nOn 22 August 2017, MSIG instructed GSI to purge all email addresses and names\nof its customers in GSI’s database, save for those customers that were affected,\nas they wanted to send out an apology email;\n\n(c)\n\nFAQs were included from 28 August 2017. MSIG also instructed GSI to deactivate\nits email account service@sg.msig-asia.com which had been used to send the\nSpam Emails;\n\n(d)\n\nOn 24 August 2017, MSIG worked with GSI on an email sent by the latter to all\n149,172 affected MSIG customers to apologise for the breach. The email included\ninstructions on removing any malware from the link in the Spam Email. It provided\na point of contact for any queries. MSIG instructed GSI to purge the email\naddresses and names of its affected customers thereafter.\n\n11.\n\nBetween 21 to 30 August 2017, MSIG addressed queries from 92 customers who had\nbeen affected by the Incident.\n\n12.\n\nSeparately, GSI took the following remedial action after the Incident:\n(a)\n\nBlocked the Spam Email link at server level to prevent recipients being re-directed\nto the site;\n\n(b)\n\nImmediately disabled the compromised administrator account to ensure no data\nwould be exported and subsequently restored the account after putting in place\nadditional security measures;\n\n(c)\n\nChanged password to the administrator account before restoring the account and\nimplemented two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts whereby users\nwould have to key in a one-time password sent either sent to their mobile number\nby SMS or Google Authenticator Application;\n\n(d)\n\nTransferred the application database to a new server, hosted in Amazon Web\nServices in Singapore in an encrypted database;\n\n(e)\n\nEnforced HTTPS so that all traffic from end-users to GSI’s website would be\nencrypted;\n\n(f)\n\nImproved logging of access, whereby I.P. addresses used to access G2M would\nbe properly logged at application server level, and added logging of web attacks\nthat had been blocked by the server firewall; and\n\n(g)\n\nEngaged a consulting company to assist GSI in implementing policies that meet\nthe ISO 27001 standards.\n\n4\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Compromised Data included Personal Data\n\n13.\n\nThe personal data found in the Compromised Data included (i) the first and last names\nof some MSIG customers, (ii) the email addresses of those customers (i.e. which were\nstored with the names of the customers) and (iii) the email addresses of other customers\nwhich contained their full or partial names (the “Compromised Personal Data”). In\nrelation to the latter set of email addresses, as set out in Re Credit Counselling [2017]\nSGPDPC 18 at [9], email addresses are personal data if they disclose the full name or\npartial name of individuals which allows for the identification of such individuals.\n\n14.\n\nThe Compromised Data also included other email addresses which were not linked to,\nor did not contain, the name of the customer (“Other Email Addresses”). It was also\nnoted in Re Credit Counselling (at [10]) that an email address coupled with other\ninformation which enables identification of an individual, such as information obtained\nfrom a search on the Internet, is personal data.\n\nWhether MSIG or GSI had breached section 24 of the PDPA\n\n15.\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether MSIG and GSI had done enough to protect the\nCompromised Personal Data which was in their possession or under their control.\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires organisations to make reasonable security\narrangements to protect personal data in their possession or under their control by\nmaking reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection,\nuse, disclosure, copying, modification or similar risks.\n\n16.\n\nAs MSIG had provided the personal data relating to MSIG’s Impacted Customers to GSI\nin order to make use of the G2M platform for its purposes, both MSIG and GSI are\nrequired to comply with section 24 of the PDPA. However, the scope of their respective\nobligations under that section differs. In addition, GSI would be required to comply with\nsection 24 in respect of all Compromised Personal Data (that is, personal data relating\nto MSIG’s Impacted Customers and the Other Impacted Customers).\n\n17.\n\nIn relation to MSIG, as they had engaged GSI to send marketing emails using the G2M\nplatform, the scope of their obligations would relate to the arrangements MSIG\n5\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nestablished in order to ensure that GSI protected the personal data in the G2M platform.\nIn respect of MSIG, the Commissioner found that MSIG had complied with its obligations\nunder section 24 of the PDPA for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nMSIG imposed security requirements on GSI under the Agreements to protect\npersonal data. An express clause in the Agreements provides that GSI shall\n“implement sufficient and appropriate measures to guard against accidental or\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, misuse, loss, destruction,\ndeletion, alteration, modification and processing of the Personal Data”;\n\n(b)\n\nMSIG also had the right under the Agreements to inspect and audit GSI; and\n\n(c)\n\nThere was evidence that MSIG followed through with these contractual obligations\nwith operational processes, for example, there were emails showing that MSIG\nrequired GSI to purge the personal data it provided after each marketing campaign.\nIn this regard, MSIG had sent emails to GSI on at least three separate occasions\nbetween December 2016 and June 2017 asking GSI to purge email addresses\nprovided by MSIG from its system.\n\n18.\n\nIn relation to GSI, as GSI was operating the G2M platform, it was required to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements in the form of technical or administrative measures\nto protect the personal data in the G2M platform. In this regard, the Commissioner found\nthat GSI had not made the appropriate security arrangements and was therefore in\ncontravention of section 24 of the PDPA for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nGSI had not implemented administrative or technical measures to require a\nregular change to the passwords to its administrator and client accounts in the\nG2M platform. In addition, GSI recognised that there was a risk that if accounts of\nstaff who had left the employment of GSI were not disabled, these former staff\nmay continue to have access to its applications. The need for an effective\npassword expiry mechanism has been discussed in past decisions such as Re\nOrchard Turn Developments Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 12;\n\n(b)\n\nWhen the administrator account changed hands, there were no logs to record the\nfact that passwords had been changed;\n\n(c)\n\nUsers were encouraged to choose strong passwords but GSI did not enforce any\npassword strength requirements. The need for strong passwords is discussed in\nRe Singhealth and anor [2019] SGPDPC 3;\n\n(d)\n\nAll the users of the administrator account shared the same administrator account\nand the same set of login credentials. This made it difficult to determine which\nstaff had accessed the account or identify who had made changes to the system\n\n6\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nduring each log-in session. Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte. Ltd. [2017]\nSGPDPC 12 explains why the sharing of administrator account credentials can\ngive rise to an increased risk of data breaches;\n(e)\n\nIt was found that no security scans were carried out over the 12 months before\nthe Incident. Security scans are important in light of the type of personal data likely\nto be held by MSIG as an insurer. In Re Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 4, the Respondent’s lack of regular testing and scanning for security\nissues were taken into account as factors to find a breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n(f)\n\nGSI claimed that it had complied with MSIG’s express instructions to “delete and\npurge the data after each marketing campaign”. However, this cannot be true as\nthe G2M platform still retained at least 149,172 email addresses provided by\nMSIG which had been used in this Incident.\n\nWhether GSI had complied with section 25 of the PDPA\n\n19.\n\nAs noted above, it appeared that GSI had not deleted 149,172 email addresses provided\nby MSIG after the relevant marketing campaigns were completed and notwithstanding\nemail reminders from MSIG. Section 25 of the PDPA requires an organisation to cease\nretaining documents containing personal data, or to remove the means by which the\npersonal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable\nto assume that:\n(a)\n\nThe purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served\nby retention of the personal data; and\n\n(b)\n\n20.\n\nRetention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.\n\nAs GSI was required to delete email addresses provided by MSIG once the relevant\nmarketing campaigns were completed, GSI ipso facto ceased to have any purpose for\nretaining the email addresses in the G2M platform once the relevant marketing\ncampaigns were completed. Accordingly, the Commissioner found that GSI was in\ncontravention of section 25 of the PDPA.\n\nGSI’s Representations\n21.\n\nAfter the Commissioner’s preliminary decision was issued to MSIG and GSI, GSI\nsubmitted representations in relation to the quantum of financial penalty which the\nCommissioner proposed to impose in relation to its breach of section 24 of the PDPA\n7\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nand against the Commissioner’s determination that it had breached section 25 of the\nPDPA. However, GSI did not disagree with, or make any representations relating to, the\nCommissioner’s findings that it had breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n22.\n\nFirst, GSI raised the following points as to why certain numbers of email addresses\nshould not be taken into consideration in determining the number of affected individuals:\n(a)\n\n4,488 of the email addresses which were stored on the G2M platform and which\nreceived the Spam Emails did not include the name or any other identifier of the\nindividuals;\n\n(b)\n\napproximately 12,000 Spam Emails sent to the email addresses stored on the\nG2M platform had bounced;\n\n(c)\n\napproximately 145,338 Spam Emails were sent to GSI’s overseas based clients;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nOnly 18,113 recipients opened the Spam Emails and, of these, only 339 recipients\nclicked on the link contained within the Spam Emails.\n\n23.\n\nIn relation to sub-paragraph (a) above, the Commissioner accepts GSI’s representation\nand has taken the reduced number of impacted individuals into account in determining\nthe financial penalty quantum specified below. In relation to (b), the fact that the Spam\nEmails bounced is not conclusive that the email addresses were invalid as the emails\nmay have bounced due to other reasons, such as the recipient’s email inbox being full\nat that time. In relation to (c), GSI is required to protect personal data in its possession\nor under its control and it is immaterial whether the relevant individuals were resident in\nSingapore or overseas. Finally, in relation to (d), it has already been taken into account\nthat there was no harm suffered by the recipients (see paragraph 32 below) and the\nOrganisation’s point at (d) above does not provide further mitigation of the\nOrganisation’s breach\n\n24.\n\nSecondly, GSI represented that MSIG had access to the G2M platform and could\nexercise functions such as verifying the content of the platform, creating and sending\nout email campaigns and deleting content and emails. However, the fact that MSIG had\naccess to the G2M platform does not absolve GSI from its obligations under the PDPA.\nThe fact remains that MSIG had engaged GSI to send marketing emails using the G2M\nplatform and GSI was obliged under the PDPA to protect the personal data that was in\nits possession or under its control for the purposes of this engagement. Furthermore,\nMSIG had specifically instructed GSI to delete the email addresses after each marketing\ncampaign and this is something that GSI is contractually bound to do.\n8\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n25.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nThirdly, GSI raised the following additional points as mitigating factors for the\nCommission’s consideration:\n(a)\n\nGSI had been fully cooperative during the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nThere was no evidence of exfiltration, further disclosure or modification of the\nCompromised Data;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Spam Emails sent to the Impacted Customers did not contain any personal\ndata;\n\n(d)\n\nThere was no evidence of actual loss or damage suffered by any of the\nImpacted Customers;\n\n(e)\n\nGSI has also sent an email notification to all Impacted Customers of the Spam\nEmails;\n\n(f)\n\nGSI has in place internal data protection policies prior to the Incident; and\n\n(g)\n\nGSI has since taken further steps to tighten and strengthen its data protection\npolicies and mechanisms, including sending additional employees for further\nPDPA training, engaging external vendors to conduct advisory sessions and\ngap analysis, completing a surveillance audit and implementing various internal\nprograms and workshops to promote data responsibility.\n\n26.\n\nThe matters in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) above had already been taken into\nconsideration in determining the financial penalty (see paragraph 32 below). With\nregards to (f), organisations are required under the PDPA to implement policies and\npractices necessary for them to meet their obligations under the PDPA, and mere\ncompliance with the PDPA is not a mitigating factor.\n\n27.\n\nGSI’s notification of the affected individuals is a relevant consideration and the further\nsteps set out in (g) are relevant mitigating factors and the quantum of the final financial\npenalty set out below has been reduced.\n\n28.\n\nFourthly, GSI sought to compare the facts of this case with prior decisions such as Re\nAvant Logistic Service Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 28, Re AIA Singapore Private Limited\n[2019] SGPDPC 20, Re InfoCorp Technologies Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 17, Re Option\nGift Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 10 and Re AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd & Toppan\nForms (S) Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 2. It should be borne in mind, that none of these\ncited cases dealt with a similar scale of breach and cannot be relied upon to argue for a\nlower financial penalty.\n9\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n29.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nGSI also made the following representations against the Commissioner’s determination\nthat it had breached section 25 of the PDPA:\n(a)\n\nGSI sent an email to MSIG on 5 June 2017 confirming the deletion or purging of\ndata from previous campaigns. This email read as follows:\n“Yes, we are in the midst of purging the most recent campaigns. The older\nones have been purged.”\nThe above email does not confirm that all completed campaigns have been purged,\nand only indicated that GSI was in the midst of doing so, and shows that some\nemail addresses from recently concluded campaigns had not been removed from\nthe system. This is, at best, evidence that GSI was trying to purge customer data\nafter each campaign, but was not particularly prompt.\n\n(b)\n\nGSI asserted that MSIG was an active client and, hence, the G2M platform\nretained 149,172 email addresses of MSIG’s customers even after data from\nprevious campaigns had been purged. However, this is contrary to the evidence\nwhich shows that MSIG had requested GSI to delete all email addresses after\neach email marketing campaign; and GSI’s representations that it was putting in\neffort to do so (albeit with some delays).\n\nIn the final analysis, the representations in relation to the breach of section 25 of the\nPDPA did not warrant a review of the Commissioner’s findings.\nOutcome\n30.\n\nAfter considering the facts of this case, the Commissioner hereby directs GSI to pay a\nfinancial penalty of $34,000 within 30 days from the date of the directions, failing which\ninterest shall be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty at such\nrate as specified in the Rules of Court.\n\n31.\n\nIn determining the amount of the financial penalty set out above, the Commissioner\nrecognised that not all of the 359,364 email addresses targeted by the Spam Emails in\nthe Incident constituted personal data and it was not possible for the Commission to\ndetermine the exact number of email addresses which did constitute personal data.\nNevertheless, taking into account the GSI lapses and the other facts of the case detailed\n10\n\n\fRe MSIG Insurance (Singapore) and another\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 43\n\nabove, the Commissioner considered that a financial penalty of $34,000 would be\nappropriate.\n\n32.\n\nIn coming to this decision, the Commissioner also had regard to the following mitigating\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nGSI was cooperative in the course of the Commission’s investigation and had\nprovided prompt responses to the Commission’s requests for information;\n\n(b)\n\nGSI implemented the remedial actions set out paragraphs 10 to 12 above to\naddress the Incident quickly, including notifying the affected individuals; and\n\n(c)\n\n33.\n\nThere was no harm caused by the disclosure of the Compromised Personal Data.\n\nThe Commissioner was of the view that no further directions are required given the\nremedial actions already taken by MSIG and GSI.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Saturday Club was found in breach of the PDPA for failing to put in place written policies and practices necessary to ensure its compliance with the PDPA.

(the “Organisation”) provides a mobile application (the “Mobile\n\nApp”) designed to connect learners and teachers in Singapore, Australia and India.\nOn 31 July 2018, the Organisation notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) of a cyberattack (the “Incident”) which had compromised the personal data\nof about 2,213 users of the Mobile App, including some users in Singapore (the “Affected\nIndividuals”).\n\nMaterial Facts\n\n2\n\nOn 30 July 2018, the Organisation noticed that the Mobile App had stopped responding.\n\nIt was found that an unauthorised party had deleted its database containing the personal data of\nthe Affected Individuals (the “Chizzle Database”) and left a ransom demand in text. The\npersonal data in question included the names, dates of birth, genders, email addresses and some\nmobile numbers and residential addresses of the Affected Individuals (the “Compromised\n\n2\n\n\fChizzle Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 44\n\nPersonal Data”). Before this, on 9 July 2018, the Organisation had changed the Chizzle\nDatabase from Amazon’s Relational Database Service to the MySQL relational database.\n\n3\n\nSince 2016, the Organisation had a “L.A.M.P.” stack (i.e. Linux operating system,\n\nApache HTTP server, MySQL server and PHP) (collectively with the Mobile App, the\n“System”) as part of its IT infrastructure. “phpMyAdmin”, a MySQL database administration\ntool, was installed with the L.AM.P stack. The tool was configured to allow remote access to\nit from the Internet. The Organisation believed that the unauthorised party gained entry into the\nChizzle Database through the phpMyAdmin tool by a brute force attack. However, it did not\nhave the logs to prove that a brute force attack had taken place. Regardless, the unauthorised\nparty gained entry to the Chizzle Database through the phpMyAdmin tool. This gave the\nunauthorised party full control, including reading, writing and deleting data.\n\nRemedial actions by the Organisation\n\n4\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation has taken measures to prevent unauthorised\n\naccess to the Chizzle Database in the future, including the following:\n(a)\n\nIP address access via phpMyAdmin (i.e. use of IP address to find and reach the\n\nChizzle Database) was turned off and the phpMyAdmin tool was uninstalled;\n(b)\n\nThe IP address of the Organisation’s servers, including the Chizzle Database\n\nserver, were changed; and\n\n3\n\n\fChizzle Pte Ltd\n(c)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 44\n\nThe Mobile App and Chizzle Database were moved to new hardware in case\n\nany residual malware or Trojans remained in the old hardware.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached its obligation to protect personal data under section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”)\n\n5\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires organisations to protect personal data in their\n\npossession or under their control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation had failed to conduct any security review of its System although past\n\ndecisions by the Commission had made clear the need for such reviews (see e.g. WTS\nAutomotive Services Pte Ltd.

It also claimed it had no need of the tool. A reasonable security review\nwould have included a review of all web-connected features of the System. Through such a\nreview, the Organisation would have found the phpMyAdmin tool and could have decided\nwhether to remove or keep it. If the Organisation had decided to retain the tool, the review\nwould have given opportunity for the Organisation to review its security against web-based\nthreats.\n4\n\n\fChizzle Pte Ltd\n8\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 44\n\nHowever, as found above, the Organisation failed to conduct a security review. It\n\ntherefore missed the opportunity to determine its need for the phpMyAdmin tool and to address\nthe security requirements of the tool, if retained. A security review would have been the\narrangement through which the Organisation could reasonably have prevented the unauthorised\nentry into the Chizzle Database through the tool.\n\n9\n\nOn the facts above, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had not made\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Compromised Personal Data and was\naccordingly in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n\n10\n\nAfter the preliminary decision was issued, the Organisation submitted representations\n\nrequesting for a reduction to the quantum of financial penalty. In support of its assertion that\nthe proposed penalty was “more than likely to push [it] to a brink of closing the business”, the\nOrganisation submitted copies of its financial statements and bank account statements. The\nOrganisation did not disagree with, or make any representations relating to, the\nCommissioner’s findings that it had breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n11\n\nIn general, financial penalties imposed under the PDPA reflect the seriousness of the\n\nbreach and do not take into account the financial position of the organisation in question.\nHowever, a financial penalty is not meant to impose a crushing burden on the organisation and\ncause undue hardship: Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 at [34]. In the\npresent case, the financial standing that was gleaned from the submitted financial statements\n5\n\n\fChizzle Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 44\n\nand bank account statements was dire. In order to avoid imposing a crushing burden on the\nOrganisation, the Commissioner has decided to reduce the financial penalty. For this reason,\nthe financial penalty imposed in this case should not be taken as establishing a precedent for\nfuture cases.\n\n12\n\nIn order to ensure that the Mobile App is robust and secure, the Organisation should\n\nadopt a data protection by design approach. While the optimal approach is to do so from the\ncommencement of every developmental project, it is nevertheless still possible to do so during\nthe maintenance phase, whenever there are enhancements: Data Protection by Design Guide,\nat p 35. The Organisation is directed to review its developmental processes in order to adopt a\ndata protection by design approach for future enhancements to the Mobile App. Making\nchanges to its practices will help the Organisation scale its Mobile App for future growth, and\nwill pay longer term dividends than a hefty financial penalty.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n\n13\n\nIn view of the above findings, the Commissioner decided to direct the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $8,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction, failing which,\ninterest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is\npaid in full.\n\n14\n\nIn addition, the Commissioner decided to issue the following directions to the\n\nOrganisation to ensure its compliance with the PDPA:\n6\n\n\fChizzle Pte Ltd\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 44\n\nEngage duly qualified personnel to conduct a security audit of its mobile\n\napplication and accompanying IT system;\n(b)\n\nFurnish a schedule stating the scope of risks to be assessed and the time within\n\nwhich a full report of the audit can be provided to the Commission within 30 days of\nthis direction;\n(c)\n\nRectify security gaps identified in the security audit;\n\n(d)\n\nDevelop an IT security policy to guide its employees on the security of personal\n\ndata on its mobile applications and accompanying IT systems within 60 days from the\ndate of completion of the above-mentioned security audit;\n(e)\n\nWithin 120 days of this decision, review and revise its developmental processes\n\nin order to adopt a data protection by design approach for future enhancements to its\nmobile application; and\n(f)\n\nInform the Commission in writing of the completion of each of the above\n\ndirections within 1 week of completion.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n7\n\n\f","decision":"Directions, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $12,000 was imposed on The Travel Corporation (2011) for breaches of the PDPA.

Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 42\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No. DP-1810-B2821\n19 November 2019\nIntroduction and Material Facts\n\n1\n\nThe Travel Corporation (2011) Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) offers travel packages\n\nboth directly to Singapore customers and via third party travel agencies. On 1 October 2018,\nthe Organisation notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nregarding the loss of a portable hard disk (the “Hard Disk”) which contained unencrypted files\nwith the personal data of the Organisation’s customers, employees and suppliers (the\n“Incident”). The facts and circumstances of the Incident are as follows.\n\n2\n\nOn 25 July 2018, a new employee of the Organisation left the office with her laptop\n\nand the Hard Disk; and misplaced both these devices on her way home. She initially only\ninformed the Organisation about the loss of the laptop and a police report was made on 31 July\n2018. The misplaced laptop did not contain any personal data. She eventually informed the\nOrganisation about the loss of the Hard Disk on 21 September 2018 and the Organisation made\nanother police report that day.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe table below summarises the number of affected individuals and their corresponding\n\ntypes of personal data contained in the Hard Disk:\nS/N. Category\n\nTypes of Personal Data in the\nHard Disk\n\n1.\n\nName, Email Address, Phone\nNumber, Date of Birth and Postal\nAddress\n\nCustomers\n\nNumber of\nIndividuals\nAffected\n5,437\n\n2.\n\nSame as item 1 plus Passport\nNumber\n\n21\n\n3.\n\nSame as item 1 plus NRIC\nNumber\n\n242\n\n4.\n\nProspective Customers\n\nSame as item 1\n\n11,000\n\n5.\n\nEmployees\n\nName, Office Email Address and\nOffice Phone Number\n\n30\n\n6.\n\nSuppliers\n\nNames, Company Address, Email\nAddress, Mobile Number, Office\nNumber\n\n1,900\n\nTotal number of individuals 18,630\n\n4\n\nIt also emerged in the course of the Commission’s investigations that the Organisation\n\nhad not appointed any data protection officer (“DPO”) prior to the data breach incident on 25\nJuly 2018.\n\nRemedial actions by the Organisation\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation subsequently took the following remedial measures:\n\n1\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Organisation ceased the use of portable storage devices and implemented\n\nthe use of cloud-based storage for personal data in its possession; and\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation appointed a DPO on 22 October 2018.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached its obligation to protect personal data under section\n24 of the PDPA\n\n6\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements. A review of the\nevidence disclosed that business contact information of the Organisation’s own employees and\nits suppliers comprised about 10% of the total number of affected individuals. Pursuant to 4(5)\nof the PDPA, section 24 of the PDPA did not apply to such personal data. However, the\npersonal data of the Organisation’s customers and prospective customers (the “Customers’\nPersonal Data”) have to be protected under the PDPA.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation failed to protect its Customers’ Personal Data as it failed to implement\n\nappropriate internal policies governing the use of portable storage devices containing personal\ndata. While the Organisation has a Portable Computer and Storage Devices Policy that\nstipulated that ‘portable computing and storage devices used for business purposes must have\ndesignated custodians’, the Organisation did not have any operational frameworks or\nprocedures in place that effectively implements this policy in its individual business units. The\nOrganisation only relied on verbal instructions to instruct its employees not to bring any\n\n2\n\n\fportable storage devices out from the office premises. Further, the Organisation did not\nimplement any password protection policies or data encryption policies for its portable storage\ndevices, including the Hard Disk, although it had clear guidelines in its Acceptable User Policy\nand Information Sensitivity Policy to do so.\n\n8\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had not made\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect its Customers Personal Data. The Organisation is\naccordingly in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 11(3) of the PDPA\n\n9\n\nSection 11(3) of the PDPA requires organisations to designate one or more individuals\n\n(typically referred to as a DPO) to be responsible for ensuring that they comply with the PDPA.\nAppointing a DPO is important in ensuring the proper implementation of an organisation’s data\nprotections policies and practices, as well as compliance with the PDPA: see e.g. Re M Stars\nMovers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37].\n\n10\n\nAs the Organisation failed to appoint a DPO prior to the data breach incident, the\n\nCommissioner found the Organisation in breach of section 11(3) of the PDPA.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n\n11\n\nIn view of the above findings, the Commissioner directs the Organisation to pay a\n\nfinancial penalty of $12,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction, failing which,\ninterest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and\n\n3\n\n\fbe payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is\npaid in full.\n\n12\n\nIn coming to this finding, the following mitigating factors were taken into account:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation notified the Commission of the Incident and fully co-operated\n\nwith the Commission’s investigations;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation promptly implemented remedial measures, as set out at\n\nparagraph 5, to address the breach;\n(c)\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation\n\nis\n\nactively\n\naddressing\n\nsystem\n\nsecurity\n\nrelated\n\nrecommendations provided by an external auditor; and\n(d)\n\n13\n\nthe Commission had not received any complaints as a result of the Incident.\n\nIn view of the remedial measures taken by the Organisation, the Commissioner decided\n\nnot to impose any other directions.\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n\n14\n\nAfter the preliminary decision was issued to the Organisation, it made representations\n\nfor a warning be issued instead of an imposition of a financial penalty. The Organisation did\nnot dispute the finding that it had breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\f15\n\nIn support of its request for a warning instead of the imposition of a financial penalty,\n\nthe Organisation represented that it had taken the following rectification and remediation\nmeasures:\n(a)\n\nconducting a PDPA impact and gap analysis;\n\n(b)\n\ndeveloping and enhancing internal PDPA policies and procedures;\n\n(c)\n\nimproving current back-up systems and disaster recovery plans across the\n\nbusiness promptly following the Incident;\n(d)\n\nnotifying the affected individuals as soon as possible after the Incident;\n\n(e)\n\nfiling a police report in case of potential misuse, ransom and/or other criminal\n\nactivity;\n\n16\n\n(f)\n\narranging for PDPA training for employees;\n\n(g)\n\npublishing a privacy notice / statement on its website; and\n\n(h)\n\ndemonstrating proper coordination and practices in place; and\n\n(i)\n\nappointing a DPO.\n\nThe majority of the matters raised in mitigation are essentially remediation measures\n\nfollowing from the gap analysis that the Organisation had performed. Due consideration had\nalready been given to the prompt action that the Organisation took when the quantum of\nfinancial penalty was initially determined. None of the measures warrants an adjustment to the\n\n5\n\n\fquantum of the financial penalty. Hence, the Organisation did not provide sufficient\njustification for the financial penalty to be replaced with a warning.\n\n17\n\nIn its representations, the Organisation had provided an explanation for its failure to\n\nappoint a DPO. It had sent 2 employees to attend a data protection certification course. The\nOrganisation explained that it did not appoint a DPO at the material time as its employees who\nattended the Certified Information Privacy Manager (“CIPM”) course had failed to pass the\nCIPM exams despite multiple attempts and the Organisation was under the impression that they\ncould not be appointed as DPOs without passing the relevant exams.\n\n18\n\nThis misapprehension conflates the obligation to appoint a DPO and what is a\n\nreasonable way to go about it. The obligation for organisations to designate a DPO to ensure\ncompliance with the PDPA under section 11(3) of the PDPA is a mandatory requirement under\nlaw. In the ideal case, the person appointed would be qualified to perform the role and\nundertake the responsibilities of a DPO at the time of appointment. The PDPA does not specify\nwhat these qualifications are. Furthermore, the pool of qualified DPOs, while growing, is small.\nThere will be many instances where organisations will not be able to identify a member of staff\nor management who is already qualified. It is, therefore, perfectly acceptable to appoint a DPO\nand then send her for the necessary courses. In these situations, the Organisation should monitor\n\n6\n\n\fthe DPO’s progress to ensure that there is no tardiness in completing the courses and\nachieving the requisite qualification.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $6,000 was imposed on i-vic International (i-vic) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of individuals which it had processed on another organisation’s behalf.  i-vic as the data intermediary did not put in place diligent and properly scoped testing of software which led to the disclosure of personal data of individuals via email.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Employment"],"date":"2019-12-05","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---i-vic-International.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by i-vic International","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/12/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-i-vic-international","timestamp":"2019-12-05","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2019] SGPDPC 41\n\nCase No. DP-1804-B1991\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\ni-vic International Pte.

It was also\nrequired to develop and/or maintain the IT infrastructure and customer relationship\nmanagement (“CRM”) software (collectively, the “System”) used to operate and manage e2i’s\n\n\fmailbox. As part of this, the Organisation was required to either reply to the emails from\nmembers of the public (providing the appropriate responses) or escalate the queries in the\nemails to the relevant e2i representatives. Where an email query needed to be escalated, an\nemployee of the Organisation would submit an escalation request in the System. The System\nwould then automatically generate two emails for the Organisation’s employee to send (the\n“Automated Email Generation Process”). The first was a holding reply email to the person\nwho had sent the email query to e2i’s mailbox and the second was an email to escalate the\nquery to the relevant e2i representative. For the second email, the System would automatically\nretrieve the relevant documents that were stored in the Organisation’s servers and attach them\nto the email.\n\n4\n\nOn the 1st of every month, the Organisation ran a batch process on the System, after\n\nnormal working hours, to generate reward programme emails for an another client (the\n“Reward Programme Process”). While this was being done, the Automated Email Generation\nProcess was unable to run any instructions to generate and send emails. During this time, any\ninstructions by the Organisation’s employees to generate emails with respect to the\nEngagement would be queued and the Automated Email Generation Process would process\nthese instructions as a batch once the Reward Programme Process had been completed.\n\n5\n\nOn 1 April 2019, while the Reward Programme Process was being run, one of the\n\nOrganisation’s employees attempted to generate some new emails using the Automated Email\nGeneration Process. These instructions to generate the relevant emails were queued, to be acted\nupon only after the Reward Program Process was completed. However, due to an error in the\nAutomated Email Generation Process code for processing emails as a batch, the System\n\n\fattached the wrong documents containing personal data of the Affected Individuals to the\nemails in the queue and sent these out to 9 different individuals.\n\n6\n\nThe documents that were sent to the 9 individuals contained the names, NRIC numbers,\n\nsignatures, residential addresses, mobile numbers, email addressed, age and race of all three\nAffected Individuals, the bank account number of two of the Affected Individuals and the\nhighest academic qualifications, work trial company details and work experience details of one\nof the Affected Individuals (collectively referred to as the “Disclosed Personal Data”).\n\nRemedial actions by the Organisation\n\n7\n\nAfter becoming aware of the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial\n\naction to prevent it from reoccurring:\n\n(a)\n\nFixed the error in the code of the Backlog Clearing Process which caused the\n\nIncident; and\n\n(b)\n\nRewrote the relevant code to enable automated encryption of attachments (so\n\nthat unauthorised recipients would not be able to view the contents of the attachments)\nand to ensure that the wrong files would not be attached to emails.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n8\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\n\n\funauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks\n(the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n9\n\nAs a preliminary point, it is noted that e2i was acting on behalf of WSG in relation to\n\nthe collection, use and disclosure of personal data for administration of the work trial\nprogramme. As such, pursuant to section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA, e2i was not subject to Part III\nto VI of the PDPA, including section 24, in relation to such collection, use and disclosure of\npersonal data.\n\n10\n\nThe Organisation was a data intermediary of e2i as it processed personal data on behalf\n\nof e2i for the purpose of the Engagement. The Organisation was thus required to protect\npersonal data in its possession or under its control in accordance with section 24.\n\n11\n\nIn relation to the cause of the Incident, the Organisation asserted that it had tested the\n\ncode of the Automated Email Generation Process. However, the Organisation also admitted\nthat it had not tested how the code acted when the Automated Email Generation Process\nprocessed instructions to generate and send emails which were queued while the Reward\nProgramme Process was running. In this regard, the Organisation explained that they expected\nsuch emails to be processed and sent out individually and not queued while the Reward\nProgramme Process was running. Nevertheless, as the Organisation ought to have known that\nthe Automated Email Generation Process was unable to run while the Reward Programme\nProcess was running on the 1st of every month, the Organisation ought to have tested whether\nthis had an effect on the Automated Email Generation Process. Diligent and properly scoped\ntesting would have simulated the circumstances leading to the Incident and would therefore\n\n\flikely have detected that documents containing personal data were being incorrectly attached\nto the emails in queue.\n\n12\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation’s failure to put in place diligent and properly\n\nscoped testing amounted to a failure to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect\nthe personal data which was in its possession and/or under its control. I therefore find that the\nOrganisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n\n13\n\nIn view of the above findings, I hereby direct the Organisation to pay a financial penalty\n\nof $6,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction, failing which, interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the\noutstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n14\n\nI have decided not to issue any further directions as the Organisation has taken the\n\nactions set out at paragraph 7 above to remedy the cause of the Incident.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $60,000 was imposed on Learnaholic for failing to put in place reasonable measures to protect the personal data of students, students’ parents and staff of various schools.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Education"],"date":"2019-12-05","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Learnaholic.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Learnaholic","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/12/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-learnaholic","timestamp":"2019-12-05","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\nCase No DP-1703-B0567\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\f[This is a redacted version of the Decision which omits certain\nconfidential details]\nLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1703-B0567\n\n26 August 2019.\nBackground\n1\n\nThe Organisation is an IT vendor that was providing attendance-taking\n\nand e-learning systems to schools pursuant to a contract with the Ministry of\nEducation (“MOE”). The central issue to this case, in so far as it is related to\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), is whether the Organisation\nhad made reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of\napproximately 47,802 students, students’ parents and staff of various schools\nthat it had in its possession and control at the material time.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation was responsible for the maintenance and installation\n\nof the attendance-taking system installed in [redacted] (“the School”). The\nSchool’s attendance-taking system was designed such that the attendance\nrecords would be updated each time a student “taps in” with his or her student\npass at any one of the card readers located around the School. This attendancetaking system consisted of an attendance server (the “Attendance Server”)\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nconnected to clusters of attendance controllers linked to card readers. One such\ncluster was located at the guard post of the School (the “Guard Post Cluster”).\n3\n\nIn or around March 2016, the School informed the Organisation of an\n\nintermittent problem with the Guard Post Cluster: students’ names were not\nbeing displayed despite them tapping in at the Guard Post Cluster. In order to\ninvestigate into the issues reported by the School, the Organisation decided to\ntroubleshoot the problem remotely as this was more convenient than sending\nsomeone down to the School. In order to do so, it installed VNC Server, a remote\ndesktop software, at the Guard Post Cluster. Using VNC Viewer to remotely\nconnect to the VNC Server so that the Organisation would be able to\ntroubleshoot the Guard Post Cluster without having to be physically present at\nthe School (the “Remote Troubleshooting” method).\n4\n\nIn addition to installing the VNC Server, the Organisation also took the\n\nfollowing steps to facilitate its Remote Troubleshooting:\n(a)\n\nModifying the configuration of the School’s Intranet firewall by\n\nopening a specific port (“Port”) to allow external access to the Guard\nPost Cluster from the internet via the VNC Viewer software.\n(b)\n\nDisabling the password for the VNC Server software installed at\n\nthe Guard Post Cluster (i.e. no password was required to gain access to\nthe Guard Post Cluster via the VNC Server software). While the\nOrganisation claimed to have disabled the input feature at the client side\nwhen using the VNC Viewer program, this would have only affected the\nOrganisation’s ability to make changes and would not have affected a\nhacker’s ability to do the same. If the Organisation had disabled the input\nfeature at the server side, it would have been very unlikely that a hacker\ncould have exploited the vulnerability in the Organisation’s system as\n2\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nexplained immediately below. The only other potential manner in which\nthe hacker could have exploited the said vulnerability would have been\nwhere the Organisation opened all the ports to the system instead of just\nthe VNC specific port.\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s actions would come to have significant\n\nconsequences. Prior to the opening of the Port, the Guard Post Cluster was only\naccessible internally from the School network. The opening of the Port was\nmeant to be temporary for the purposes of the Remote Troubleshooting, but the\nOrganisation’s Representative (the “Representative”) conducting the\ntroubleshooting forgot to close the Port and restore the School’s original firewall\nconfiguration after the troubleshooting was completed. The disabling of the\npassword for the VNC Server software meant that access to the Guard Post\nCluster could be easily gained simply with knowledge of the Port number and\nthe IP address of the Attendance Server. This combination of actions led to the\ncreation of a vulnerability in the School’s Guard Post Cluster (the\n“Vulnerability”) – a vulnerability that would later be exploited by a hacker.\n6\n\nThe Organisation took the view that the hacker exploited the\n\nVulnerability to retrieve a configuration file stored on the Guard Post Cluster.\nThe Commissioner believes that this is a logical explanation of how the hack\noccurred. This configuration file was supposed to be stored only on the School’s\nAttendance Server, but had inadvertently been copied to the Guard Post Cluster.\nThis had occurred as the Organisation had stored the configuration file in a\nfolder on the Attendance Server that also held firmware update files for the\nGuard Post Cluster (the “Update Folder”); the Update Folder would be\nperiodically synced with the relevant components of the Guard Post Cluster in\nthe School in order to “push down” firmware updates from the Attendance\nServer to these components at the Guard Post Cluster. A copy of the\n\n3\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nconfiguration file was therefore copied to the Guard Post Cluster during one of\nthe periodic firmware updates.\n7\n\nThe purpose of the configuration file was to enable the School’s\n\nAttendance Server (using the Representative’s work email as a relay) to send\nattendance reports to the School’s staff. To facilitate this function, the\nconfiguration file contained the login credentials of the Representative’s work\nemail. The hacker was thus able to obtain the login credentials from the copy of\nthe configuration file retrieved from the Guard Post Cluster, and thereby gain\naccess to the Representative’s work email account. The Representative’s work\nemail account contained the unencrypted personal data of approximately 47,802\nstaff, students, and students’ parents of various schools (the “Personal Data”).\nThe Personal Data exfiltrated by the hacker included information such as:\n(a)\n\nNames;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC numbers;\n\n(c)\n\nContact numbers;\n\n(d)\n\nEmail addresses;\n\n(e)\n\nAddresses; and\n\n(f)\nMedical information, which relate to approximately 372\nstudents.\n8\n\nThe Personal Data was in the Representative’s email as the Organisation\n\nhad assisted the schools to upload the data onto the respective schools’\nattendance taking and/or e-learning systems. The Representative had received\nthe Personal Data via email for the purposes of uploading, but had not deleted\nthese emails after performing the upload as it was thought that it might be useful\nto retain the Personal Data for future reference.\n\n4\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n9\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nThe breach of the School’s attendance taking system and the\n\nRepresentative’s work email, together with the resulting exfiltration of the\nPersonal Data, were only discovered in February 2017 by the Singapore Police\nForce (“SPF”) in the course of investigating a separate hacking incident 1. The\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) was informed of the matter\nand thereafter commenced its own investigations.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nThe Relevant PDPA Provisions\n10\n\nIn respect of this matter, the relevant provision is Section 24 of the\n\nPDPA. Section 24 requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\nPreliminary Issues\n11\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data is “personal data” as defined in\n\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA. There is no question or dispute that the Organisation\nfalls within PDPA’s definition of an “organisation”. There is also no dispute\nthat Personal Data was, at all material times, in the Organisation’s possession\nand that the Organisation was responsible for the Personal Data.\n12\n\nIn the course of investigations, it was determined that the Organisation\n\nwas at all material times an independent third party service provider to, and\n\n1\n\nThis hacking incident, and the Singapore Police Force’s investigations, are not the\nsubject of these Grounds of Decision.\n\n5\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\ntherefore was not acting on behalf of, MOE or any of the various schools it\nprovided IT services to. The Organisation also did not raise the applicability of\nsection 4(1)(c) of the PDPA at any time. In the circumstances, section 4(1)(c)\nof the PDPA does not apply.\n13\n\nThe key issue is therefore whether the Organisation had protected the\n\nPersonal Data in its possession by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access and similar risks.\nThe Organisation failed to make reasonable security arrangements\n14\n\nAfter a review of all the evidence obtained by PDPC during its\n\ninvestigation and for the reasons set out below, the Commissioner is of the view\nthat the Organisation had failed to make reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect the personal data in its possession, and has thereby breached the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. This data breach incident\noccurred due to a series of lapses on the part of the Organisation, all of which\ncould have been reasonably averted.\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation opened a Port and reconfigured the School’s\n\nIntranet Firewall to allow remote access to the School’s Guard Post Cluster,\nwhile simultaneously disabling the password for remote access to the Guard\nPost Cluster, thereby creating the Vulnerability. In addition, the Representative\nconducting the Remote Troubleshooting forgot to close the Port, leaving the\nVulnerability exposed from March 2016 until end-April 2016, when the\nVulnerability was discovered because the Organisation was subsequently\nrequested to troubleshoot the Guard Post Cluster again in or around April 2016.\n\n6\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n16\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nIt bears noting that the Organisation did not inform the School that it had\n\nmade changes to the configuration of the School’s Intranet firewall during the\nRemote Troubleshooting. The changes made to the configuration of the Intranet\nfirewall in this matter was a clear security lapse borne from convenience; in\nattempting to get around the need to be physically present in the School, the\nOrganisation undermined the security arrangements in place and allowed the\nhacker to obtain the configuration file. This was exacerbated by the\nOrganisation’s failure to inform the School of these configuration changes.\n17\n\nSecond, the configuration file (containing the login credentials of the\n\nRepresentative’s work email account) was supposed to be stored only in the\nSchool’s Attendance Server. As described at [6] above, this configuration file\nhad been inadvertently copied to the Guard Post Cluster, where the\nVulnerability existed as a point of entry for the hacker, which allowed the hacker\nto consequently gain access to the configuration file.\n18\n\nThe hacker was thus able to obtain the login credentials of the work\n\nemail account where the unencrypted Personal Data was stored. The\nOrganisation has represented to PDPC that the email accounts and passwords\ncontained in the configuration file were listed in a jumbled up or random\nmanner, such that it would not have been apparent which email account\ncorresponded with which password. Such an approach falls far below the level\nof sophistication which one would expect login credentials to be secured with.\nA relatively low degree brute-force attack (i.e. trial and error) would be all that\nwas required to match an email account with its corresponding password. The\nOrganisation failed to appreciate the consequences of placing the configuration\nfile with the login credentials – a file that effectively contained the proverbial\nkeys to the kingdom – in the Update Folder of the Attendance Server. Allowing\na file that contained sensitive information such as login credentials to be copied\n\n7\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nto each of the clusters represents a clear lapse in the Organisation’s security\narrangements. The less-than secure manner in which the login credentials were\nstored and dealt with within their own system was an issue that the Organisation\nshould and could have been reasonably alive to.\n19\n\nThird, the Personal Data was sent to and stored in the Representative’s\n\nwork email account in an unencrypted form. The PDPC encourages the\nencryption of personal data that is sensitive or when sent in bulk. As this case\ndemonstrated, personal data sent in bulk were stored in the clear in the\nRepresentative’s email account effectively giving the hacker free rein to access\nthe information once access to the email account was obtained. The originator\nof the Personal Data shared some of the blame in failing to encrypt the file. But\nthe risks would not have materialised had the Representative deleted the email\ncontaining the Personal Data once his task was completed (e.g. uploading of\ndata). This he failed to do. He kept the email containing the Personal Data, just\nin case he needed it in the future. If there was a valid legal or business purpose\nfor retaining a copy of the Personal Data for an extended period of time, it\nshould not have been retained in the Representative’s work email account in an\nunencrypted format. The Organisation could have downloaded a copy of such\ndata into a computer and encrypted the same if it needed to retain it (and\nthereafter deleting the originating email and attachment). This is a basic security\narrangement that could have been reasonably expected of the Organisation.\n20\n\nThe Organisation’s inadequate security measures were therefore directly\n\nresponsible for the breach and exfiltration of the Personal Data. Any of the\nindividual lapses on their own would have been a cause for concern; combined\ntogether, the lapses created the perfect opportunity for any opportunistic hacker\narmed with basic hacking tools to strike.\n\n8\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n21\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation\n\nhas breached the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n22\n\nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give\nthe Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA.\n23\n\nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on the\n\nOrganisation, the Commissioner has taken into account the following\naggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nIn the course of its work with the schools and MOE, the\n\nOrganisation was handling large volumes of personal data relating to\nminors, including sensitive personal data such as their medical\ninformation, family structure and NRIC numbers. The unauthorised\ndisclosure of such data could potentially have caused significant harm.\n(b)\n\nThe Vulnerability was left unattended for a period of more than\n\na month during which other hackers could have easily obtained access\nto the Personal Data2.\n(c)\n24\n\nActual data exfiltration had taken place.\n\nTo its credit, the Organisation acted fairly swiftly to address the causes\n\nof the breach once they were made aware of the same, a response which carries\n\n2\n\nDuring the investigations, there had been some uncertainty as to the duration for which\nthe Vulnerability was left uncorrected. This is further discussed at [27] below.\n\n9\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nsome mitigating value. The following remedial actions taken by the\nOrganisation have therefore been taken into account:\n(a)\n\nChanged the passwords for all the Organisation’s work email\n\naccounts;\n(b)\n\nActivated\n\nTwo\n\nFactor\n\nAuthentication\n\nfor\n\nall\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s work email accounts after being informed of the data\nbreach by SPF;\n(c)\n\nDeleted all emails with the Personal Data from the Organisation\n\nRepresentative’s work email account;\n(d)\n\nDeleted the configuration file from the Guard Post Cluster;\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented a new practice of having the Organisation’s\n\nrepresentatives delete emails from their work email account once action\nhas been taken in respect of the same; and\n(f)\n\nPut in place a script to ensure that the Update Folder of the\n\nAttendance Server only contains essential php files such as system\ncodes, and that any non-essential files are automatically deleted prior to\nthe syncing of the Update Folder with the other attendance clusters in\nthe School.\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n25\n\nThe Organisation made representations to the PDPC, in particular to\n\nreduce the quantum of the financial penalty imposed, after the preliminary\ndecision was issued to the Organisation. The Organisation’s representations are\naddressed as follows.\n\n10\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n26\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nFirst, the Organisation represented that the total number of individuals\n\naffected was 35,000 (and not 60,000 according to initial calculations), and that\nthe total number of students whose medical data was accessed and exfiltrated\nwas 372. PDPC has reviewed the evidence and determined that the number of\nunique individuals affected by the incident was 47,802. The Commissioner\naccepts that 372 individuals’ medical data was accessed. The financial penalty\nhas, therefore, been adjusted to take into account the number of individuals\nwhose medical data was accessed and exfiltrated and the reduction in the\nnumber of affected individuals.\n27\n\nSecond, the Organisation represented that the Vulnerability had been\n\ndiscovered and fixed sometime at the end of April 2016 when the Organisation\nwas requested to troubleshoot the Guard Post Cluster again (as described in\n[15]). The Organisation had previously indicated that they were unaware of the\nduration during which the Vulnerability was left uncorrected. In the\ncircumstances, the financial penalty quantum was initially based on the\nVulnerability having only been corrected on or about February 2017 when the\nOrganisation was notified of the incident by SPF in the course of investigating\na separate hacking incident. The Commissioner has given the Organisation the\nbenefit of the doubt as to the period of time the Vulnerability existed and has\nadjusted the quantum of the financial penalty accordingly.\n28\n\nThird, the Organisation also represented that the medical information\n\nsubject to unauthorised access relates to types of medical conditions3 which it\n\n3\n\nFor instance, colour vision; whether the student was on regular medication; respiratory\ndisorders; allergies; asthma; epilepsy; heart condition; ear disorder; hearing loss;\nperiodic loss of consciousness; and modified exercise.\n\n11\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nasserts are non-sensitive in nature. However, the medical data that was accessed\nwas those of minors, ie less than 21 years of age. Medical data and personal data\nof minors is treated as being sensitive in nature4. For such sensitive personal\ndata, organisations are required to take extra precautions and ensure higher\nstandards of protection under the PDPA.\n29\n\nFourth, the Organisation represented that it had requested the schools to\n\nupload personal data on their own, to limit any personal data sent to the\nOrganisation to what is absolutely necessary, and if the schools were to send\ndata via email, to password protect the data file attachments. However, the\npreferred practice of many of the schools was to send unencrypted personal data\nto the Organisation for it to be uploaded. To give the Organisation the benefit\nof doubt, even if it is accepted that the Organisation had informed the schools\nto password protect data file attachments sent by email, the evidence shows that\nthis policy was not observed in practice. Merely having a policy is not a\nsufficient security arrangement particularly when this policy is observed only\nin its breach.\n30\n\nAs a corollary to the above point, the Organisation also represented that\n\n“as a vendor and a small enterprise serving the educational institutions, [the\nOrganisation was] understandably subservient to the decisions of their\ncustomers”. If the Organisation chooses to accede and upload the personal data\nthat was sent to its email account, then it ought to have reviewed its policies and\nimplemented different security arrangements to protect such personal data, e.g.\nby deleting file attachments containing personal data promptly.\n\n4\n\nSee Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act for Selected Topics at\n[8.12] and Singapore Taekwondo Federation [2018] SGPDPC 17 at [22] to [27].\n\n12\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n31\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nFifth, the Organisation represented that its practices were to delete\n\nemails containing personal data when no longer required (e.g. after uploading\nonto the appropriate databases), and that the reason that the attacker was able to\ngain access to so many email attachments containing Personal Data is because\nhe had access to the email account for 3 months. While this may be true, the\nOrganisation previously admitted that emails containing Personal Data would\nstill be required to address enquiries from schools, and thus, were retained in\nthe Representative’s email account for months (and not immediately deleted\nafter uploading). As stated in [19], the fact that the Personal Data was retained\nin such a manner facilitated the hacker’s access to the Personal Data; if the\nOrganisation needed to keep the Personal Data for operational purposes, it\nshould have properly secured it.\n32\n\nSixth, the Organisation represented that the following should be taken\n\ninto account as mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nit was a victim of a cyberattack that had maliciously exploited\n\nthe lapses on the part of the Organisation;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation tried their even best to secure personal data, but\n\nits lone efforts were insufficient without reciprocation from the schools;\nand\n(c)\n\nbased on SPF’s investigations there was no evidence of further\n\nexploitation, use or disclosure of the Personal Data by the attacker.\n33\n\nWith respect to [32(a)], it should be reiterated that being a cyberattack\n\nvictim is not in itself a mitigating factor, especially in this case where the lapses\nof the Organisation, including the existence of the Vulnerability, were such that\n\n13\n\n\fLearnaholic Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 31\n\nthe attacker would not require sophisticated means to obtain unauthorised\naccess to the Personal Data.\n34\n\nParagraph [32(b)] has been addressed above5. With respect to [32(c)],\n\nwhile there was actual exfiltration of the Personal Data in this case6, there was\nno evidence of further exploitation, use or disclosure of the Personal Data by\nthe attacker. This has been taken into account in the revised financial penalty.\n35\n\nFinally, the Organisation also sought to compare the penalty imposed\n\nagainst it with that of previous cases7. However, the cases cited dealt with\nidentification data while this case involved medical data of minors. The\nCommissioner is satisfied that the financial penalty imposed in this case is\njustified, in particular given the aggravating factors set out above at [23].\n36\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$60,000.00 within\n30 days from the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which interest at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n5\n\nSee [29] and [30].\n\n6\n\nThis has been taken into account as an aggravating factor, see [23(c)].\n\n7\n\nSpecifically, Re K Box Entertainment Group Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 1, Re JP\nPepperdine Group Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 2, and Re Orchard Turn Developments\nPte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 12.\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to CampVision for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of individuals.

Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 40\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1809-B2790\n\n24 October 2019\n\nIntroduction and Material Facts\n\n1.\n\nSearchAsia Consulting Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a recruitment company\n\nestablished in Singapore which matches job seekers with organisations that are\nlooking to recruit employees for a specific role. On 26 September 2018, the\nOrganisation notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nof a data breach incident involving the inadvertent disclosure of résumés (the\n“Incident”) which were uploaded by individual job seekers to the Organisation’s\nwebsite, www.searchasia.com.sg (the “Website”). Specifically, when a search was\nconducted on the names or email addresses of affected individuals using an Internet\nsearch engine, the search results would include links to the affected individuals’\nrésumés which had been uploaded to the Website. These résumés were accessible\nby clicking on the listed links.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation provided job seekers with the ability to upload their résumés\n\non the Website so that the Organisation could assess their suitability for roles which\nthe Organisation has been engaged to fill. The résumés would generally include\npersonal data such as the name, phone numbers, employment history, educational\nqualifications, achievements and skillset of the job seekers. In one instance, it was\ndiscovered that a job seeker included additional information such as nationality, date\nof birth, marital status and current salary. (The personal data on the affected\nindividuals’ résumés is collectively referred to as the “Personal Data”.)\n\n1\n\n\fSearchAsia Consulting Pte. Ltd.\n3.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 40\n\nThe résumés uploaded to the Website were intended to only be accessible by\n\nrecruitment agents employed by the Organisation. However, in practice résumés\nwhich were uploaded to the Website were stored in a folder (“the Folder”) on the\nWebsite’s server which was not secured by access controls. As a result, these\nrésumés were indexed by bot crawlers and could be found and accessed by the\ngeneral public when a search was done via an Internet search engine.\n\n4.\n\nThe Organisation asserted to the Commission that it had instructed its third\n\nparty web developer (the “Developer”) to restrict access to the Folder to only 1 of the\nOrganisation’s employees. However, the Organisation did not provide the Commission\nwith any documentary evidence supporting its assertion and the Developer, in its\nstatement to the Commission, denied receiving any specifications on security from the\nOrganisation. Further, the Organisation had not conducted any checks or tests to\nensure that access to the Folder was restricted or that the data in the Folder was\nencrypted. The Organisation admitted that the Developer had not processed any\npersonal data on its behalf.\n\n5.\n\nIn its representations to the Commission, the Organisation stated that it had\n\nasked the Developer whether the résumés uploaded to the Website would be\nencrypted and the Developer responded saying that “it was safe”. This does not\ndetract from the fact that the Organisation did not set out its instructions to the\ndeveloper in writing. As stated in Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2018]\nSGPDPC 26 (at [17]), when engaging a service provider, it is important for the\norganisation to clarify their obligations and thereafter documenting them in writing prior\nto the provision of services. As set out in Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and others\n[2016] SGPDPC 19 at [51]:\n“[t]here must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service provider has agreed\nto undertake, and this should be properly documented. Data controllers should follow through\nwith the procedures to check that the outsourced provider is indeed delivering the services.”\n\n2\n\n\fSearchAsia Consulting Pte. Ltd.\n6.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 40\n\nFurther, the Organisation’s failure to conduct any checks on whether or not\n\naccess controls were put in place was in itself a breach of its protection obligations:\nsee Re Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5 at [16].\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation also asserted that it had relied on its web hosting and\n\ntechnical support services provider (“Web Host”), to ensure that the Website had\nadequate security features. However, the Organisation had not informed the Web Host\nthat the contents of the Folder were meant to be protected. Hence, while the Web Host\nhad performed some security reviews on the Website, they had not been engaged to\nadvise on or implement measures to protect the personal data stored in the Folder.\n\n8.\n\nAfter being informed of the Incident, the Organisation undertook the following\n\nremedial actions:\na.\n\nThe Organisation requested the Web Host to assist in disabling the\ndirectory listing function of the Website;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation also engaged an external web developer to add a\nmechanism to the Website to help prevent future indexing by search\nengine crawlers;\n\nc.\n\nPublic access permissions were removed from sensitive file directories\nto avoid similar incidents from reoccurring; and\nd.

This case concerns the disclosure of personal data via a delivery\norder tracking function on the Organisation’s website (the “Tracking Function Page”).\n2\n\nOn 23 April 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint that the Tracking Function Page could potentially be used to harvest\npersonal data of the Customers. By changing a few digits of a Tracking ID, the complainant\ncould access personal data of another Customer (the “Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation first set up the Tracking Function Page in December 2014 to allow\n\nCustomers to (i) enquire on the delivery status of their parcels; and (ii) confirm the identity of\nindividuals who collect parcels on their behalf (where applicable). Generally, for a delivery,\nonly a Retailer and the relevant Customers of the Retailer would be provided with a Tracking\nID for parcels sent by the Retailer that were to be delivered by the Organisation to the\nCustomer.\n4\n\nThere were 2 types of Tracking IDs used by the Organisation, namely sequential and\n\nnon-sequential Tracking IDs. According to the Organisation, the reason for having sequential\nnumbers in some of the Tracking IDs was for recording and business analytics purposes. Since\nthe launch of the Tracking Function Page, the Organisation was aware that Tracking IDs could\npotentially be manipulated by changing the last few digits of the Tracking ID. While Tracking\nIDs with non-sequential numbers may have a lower risk of manipulation, a random generation\n\n2\n\n\fof any 9 digits that happened to match a valid Tracking ID could still result in unauthorised\naccess and disclosure of personal data.\n5\n\nFor a period of approximately 3 months from launch of the Tracking Function Page,\n\nthe Organisation unsuccessfully experimented with 2 methods as a second layer of\nauthentication to the Tracking IDs. These methods involved using either the last 4 digits of a\nCustomer’s mobile number or the Customer’s last name to verify the identity of the person\nusing a Tracking ID. According to the Organisation, these methods were not workable due to\ndifficulties such as the Retailers not having, or not wishing to disclose, the mobile number of\ntheir Customers or the Customers not being able to recall the name they had provided at the\ntime of purchase. Hence, the Organisation ceased using a second layer of authentication in\n2015.\n6\n\nAt the material time, the Tracking IDs were thus the sole means of using the Tracking\n\nFunction Page. Upon the entry of a valid Tracking ID, the following types of information (the\n“Disclosed Data”) could be accessed from the Tracking Function Page, depending on the\ndelivery status of the parcel in question (as indicated below):\n(a)\n\nFor parcels with a “Pending Pickup” status:\n(i)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nonly the Tracking ID;\n\nFor parcels with a “On Vehicle for Delivery” status:\n(i)\n\nthe Tracking ID; and\n\n(ii)\n\nthe Customer’s Address; and\n\nFor parcels with a “Completed” status:\n(i)\n\nthe Tracking ID;\n\n(ii)\n\nthe Customer’s address; and\n\n(iii)\n\nthe name and signature of the Customer or other individual who had\n\ncollected the parcel on behalf of the Customer (this was upon clicking on\n“Retrieve Proof of Delivery” hyperlink).\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nSave for the one-time archival of 2.6 million Tracking IDs on 31 August 2016, the\n\nOrganisation did not have any procedures to remove records of completed deliveries from the\nTracking Function Page (i.e. those with the “Completed” status). The Organisation estimated\nthat, at the time of the Incident, there were 1,262,861 unique individuals with valid Tracking\nIDs at the “Completed” status (the “Affected Individuals”).\n8\n\nUpon being notified by the Commission of the Incident, the Organisation took the\n\nfollowing remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nRemoved the Customer’s address for the “Pending Pickup” and “On Vehicle\n\nfor Delivery” delivery statuses;\n(b)\n\nAs of 23 August 2018, the Organisation implemented a system such that\n\nTracking IDs would expire 14 days after the completion of the delivery1;\n(c)\n\nIn August 2018, the Organisation engaged a Crest-certified security\n\norganisation for a one-year period to assist with establishing an overarching security\nframework with a data protection focus, which includes working out a data protection\ntraining program for the Organisation’s employees who will all receive formal training\non the Organisation’s obligations with respect to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”); and\n(d)\n\nEngaged a law firm to improve and document the Organisation’s personal data\n\nprotection policies.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Disclosed Data for parcels with “Pending Pickup” and “On\n\nVehicle for Delivery” delivery statuses did not include any data that could identify a Customer.\nHowever, the Disclosed Data for parcels with the “Completed” delivery status included the\nCustomers’ names, address and signature. Hence, such data constituted personal data where it\nrelated to an identified Customer. In particular, the Incident resulted in the exposure of the\nfollowing personal data to unauthorised access (the “Exposed Personal Data”):\n\n1\n\nThe Organisation has since received feedback from some Retailers requesting to lengthen the validity period of\nthe Tracking IDs, and is considering lengthening the validity period from 14 days to 45 days, but this has yet to\nbe implemented.\n\n4\n\n\f(a)\n\nthe names and signatures of Affected Individuals who had signed for parcels\n\nwhen collecting them; and\n(b)\n\npotentially, the addresses of Affected Individuals who were Customers.\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened Section 24 of the PDPA\n10\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. The Commissioner found that the Organisation had failed to put in place reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Exposed Personal Data for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nFirst, and as mentioned at [4], the Organisation was aware from the outset that\n\nTracking IDs may be manipulated and had tried unsuccessfully to introduce a second\nlayer of authentication. Notwithstanding its knowledge of the risk of unauthorised\naccess and disclosure of the Exposed Personal Data through manipulation of the\nTracking IDs, there was a glaring failure by the Organisation to operationalise an\neffective method of second layer authentication. Given the foreseeable risk of using\nTracking IDs as the sole means of accessing and using the Tracking Function Page, it\nis inexcusable for the Organisation to neglect its obligations to implement a workable\nsecurity arrangement to protect the Exposed Personal Data. This resulted in the Exposed\nPersonal Data of a significantly large number of individuals being exposed to the risk\nof unauthorised access and disclosure for a period of close to 2 years; and\n(b)\n\nSecondly, the Organisation did not have a procedure to remove the Exposed\n\nPersonal Data from the Tracking Function Page after the completion of a delivery. The\nOrganisation could have easily done so by setting a fixed period upon completion of a\ndelivery after which the Tracking ID would no longer be valid (as they have done after\nbeing informed of the Incident). This would have significantly reduced the risk of\nunauthorised access and disclosure to the Exposed Personal Data.\n11\n\nAccordingly, the Commissioner found that the Organisation had contravened section\n\n24 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\n\fRepresentations by the Organisation\n12\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made representations for the\n\nCommissioner to issue a warning in lieu of a financial penalty, or in the alternative, to reduce\nthe quantum of financial penalty imposed for the reasons set out below.\n13\n\nFirst, on 31 August 2016, the Organisation archived a significant number (2.3 million)\n\nof Tracking IDs. As such, only Tracking IDs issued after 31 August 2016 were accessible at\nthe date of the Incident (i.e. the Exposed Personal Data was subject to risk of unauthorised\naccess and disclosure for less than 2 years)2.\n14\n\nSecondly, keeping the Exposed Personal Data accessible from the Tracking Function\n\nPage was “well-meaning and intended to be an additional feature of its platform to differentiate\nitself from its competitors”, and this allowed the Retailers and their Customers to access such\ninformation as and when required without having to contact the Organisation. Furthermore,\nsome Retailers may not receive feedback from its customers promptly and would require the\nTracking IDs to be accessible for a longer period in order to respond to feedback or conduct\ninvestigations.\n15\n\nThirdly, the Organisation raised the following factors for the Commissioner’s\n\nconsideration:\n(a)\n\nThe names in the Exposed Personal Data may not be the full names of Affected\n\nIndividuals and is “considerably less sensitive and complete than other published\ncases”;\n(b)\n\nThere was only a single finding of breach of one obligation under the PDPA\n\n(i.e. Section 24); and\n(c)\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest any actual unauthorised access and/or\n\nexfiltration of data leading to loss or damage.\n\n2\n\nPrior to the Organisation providing information in relation to the archiving of Tracking IDs on 31 August\n2016, the Commissioner preliminarily found that the Exposed Personal Data was subjected to the risk of\nunauthorised access and disclosure for more than 2 years.\n\n6\n\n\f16\n\nFinally, the Organisation also compared the present case with Re K Box Entertainment\n\nGroup Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 1 (“K Box”) and Re Horizon Fast Ferry Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 27 (“Horizon Fast Ferry”). The Organisation represented that the circumstances of\nthese 2 cases were far more aggravated in comparison and the financial penalties imposed was\n$50,000 in K Box and $54,000 in Horizon Fast Ferry. The Organisation also represented that\nRe Challenger Technologies Limited and others [2016] SGPDPC 6 (“Challenger”) is more\nsimilar to the present case, and a financial penalty was not imposed in Challenger.\n17\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, the Commissioner has decided to\n\nmaintain the quantum of financial penalty set out at [20(a)] for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nWhile the Organisation did archive 2.6 million Tracking IDs on 31 August\n\n2016, this was a one-off exercise. The Organisation did not have any procedures to\nremove records of completed deliveries from the Tracking Function Page (i.e. those\nwith the “Completed” status). Notwithstanding the archival of the 2.6 million Tracking\nIDs, Exposed Personal Data of 1,262,861 unique individuals with Tracking IDs had\nbeen accumulated over a period of close to 2 years. This was not reasonable considering\nthat the delivery information which Retailers and Customers may want to access would\nbe for a limited post-delivery period (which was likely to be in the order of weeks rather\nthan years);\n(b)\n\nAs for the factors in [15] raised by the Organisation, these had already been\n\ntaken into consideration in the Commissioner’s determination of the quantum of\nfinancial penalty; and\n(c)\n\nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations comparing the present case\n\nto K Box, Horizon Fast Ferry and Challenger, the key distinguishing factor is the\nvolume of personal data involved. The present case involves over 1 million Affected\nIndividuals, which far exceeds the number of affected individuals in K Box, Horizon\nFast Ferry and Challenger.3 These cases therefore do not support the Organisation’s\nrepresentations for a warning to be issued in lieu of a financial penalty or a reduction\nin financial penalty.\n\n3\n\nAs compared to 1,262,861 unique individuals in this case, the number of affected individuals was found to be\napproximately 317,000 in Re K Box Entertainment Group, 295,151 in Re Horizon Fast Ferry and 165,306 in Re\nChallenger Technologies Limited\n\n7\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Directions\n18\n\nIn determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation under section 29 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner took into account the following aggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cognisant of the risks of unauthorised access and\n\ndisclosure to the Exposed Personal Data through the Tracking Function Page but failed\nto resolve the issue for more than 2 years;\n(b)\n\nThe Exposed Personal Data of a significantly large number of individuals were\n\nexposed to the risk of unauthorised access and disclosure for close to 2 years; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation failed to remove Exposed Personal Data of a significantly\n\nlarge number of individuals from the Tracking Function Page when it was no longer\nnecessary to keep them accessible online.\n19\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative in the investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation had, in effect, adopted an approach consistent with data\n\nprotection by design by controlling the amount of information disclosed at different\nstages of the delivery process, thereby decreasing the risk of unauthorised access and\ndisclosure; and\n(c)\n20\n\nthere was no evidence of exfiltration of the Exposed Personal Data.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby directs\n\nthe Organisation to:\n(a)\n\nPay a financial penalty of $90,000 within 30 days from the date of the directions,\n\nfailing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full; and\n\n8\n\n\f(b)\n\nWithin 30 days from the date of this direction, implement a reasonable validity\n\nperiod for the Tracking IDs after completion of each delivery, which should be as\nreasonably short as possible while meeting business needs.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n9\n\n\f","decision":"Directions, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"iClick was found in breach of the PDPA for failing to put in place written policies and practices necessary to ensure its compliance with the PDPA. iClick was directed to put in place a data protection policy to comply with the provisions of the PDPA; to develop a training programme for its employees and require them to attend the training.","tags":["Accountability","Directions","Information and Communications"],"date":"2019-11-04","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Summary-Decision---iClick-Media.pdf","nature":"Accountability","title":"Breach of the Accountability Obligation by iClick Media","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/11/breach-of-the-accountability-obligation-by-iclick-media","timestamp":"2019-11-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-1901-B3254\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\niClick Media Pte.

Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 38\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1901-B3254\n4 October 2019\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 14 January 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint that personal data of EU Holidays Pte. Ltd.’s (the “Organisation”)\ncustomers was accessible through its website (the “Incident”).\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nPursuant to a Quotation of Services dated 16 May 2017 (“Contract”), the Organisation\n\nengaged an IT vendor (the “Vendor”) to develop a new website with e-commerce capabilities\n(the “Website”). One of the purposes of the Website was to allow the Organisation’s customers\n(“Customers”) to make online reservations for tour packages either directly or through the\nOrganisation’s partner agents. Information relating to travel reservations received from\nCustomers were stored in 2 web directories. For reservations made directly by Customers on\nthe Website, the tax invoice generated would be stored in a web directory (“Web Directory\n1”). As for reservations made through the Organisation’s partner agents on the Website, the tax\ninvoice generated would be stored in another web directory (“Web Directory 2”).\n3\n\nThe scope of work in the Contract did not specify any requirements with respect to the\n\nstorage and protection of Customers’ personal data which was collected through the Website.\nThe Website was launched on 9 December 2017. Since its launch, the Organisation has been\nmanaging the Website, with the Vendor’s role limited to maintenance and technical\ntroubleshooting.\n4\n\nOn or around 5 January 2019, a member of the public (“Complainant”) discovered\n\ncopies of tax invoices containing Customers’ personal information while browsing for tour\npackages on the Website. The Complainant notified the Commission of the Incident on 14\nJanuary 2019.\n2\n\n\fEU Holidays Pte. Ltd.\n\n5\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 38\n\nBased on the Organisation’s internal records, from 9 December 2017 to 14 January\n\n2019, tax invoices containing information of 1,077 Customers were exposed to unauthorised\naccess and disclosure through links to Web Directory 1 and Web Directory 2.1 The information\ncontained in the invoices include the following personal data (collectively, the “Disclosed\nPersonal Data”):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(c)\n\nAddress;\n\n(d)\n\nContact number;\n\n(e)\n\nBooking date;\n\n(f)\n\nTravel destination;\n\n(g)\n\nDeparture date;\n\n(h)\n\nGender;\n\n(i)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(j)\n\nPassport details (including number, date of issue and expiry);\n\n(k)\n\nRooming arrangement (i.e. whether travellers are adults / children and the type\n\nof beds required); and\n(l)\n6\n\nAmount payable.\n\nUpon being notified of the Incident, the Organisation promptly carried out the following\n\nremedial actions:\n(a)\n\nDeleted all tax invoices stored on Web Directory 1; and\n\n(b)\n\nDisabled public access to Web Directory 2.\n\n1\n\nSpecifically, the information of 336 Customers were stored in Directory 1 and the information of 741\nCustomers were stored in Directory 2.\n\n3\n\n\fEU Holidays Pte. Ltd.\n\n7\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 38\n\nSeparately, the Commission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation had not\n\ndeveloped or implemented any internal data protection policies that are necessary for it to meet\nits obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the PDPA\n8\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation owned and managed the Website and had\n\npossession and control over the Disclosed Personal Data at all material times. While the Vendor\nhad been engaged to develop the Website and subsequently provided maintenance and\ntechnical troubleshooting services, the Vendor had not processed the Disclosed Personal Data\non the Organisation’s behalf. The Vendor was therefore not a data intermediary of the\nOrganisation, and the Organisation was solely responsible for the protection of the Disclosed\nPersonal Data under the PDPA.\n9\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. In the Commissioner’s view, the Organisation failed to put in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect the Disclosed Personal Data as explained below.\n10\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to assess the risks to the Disclosed Personal Data collected\n\nthrough its Website and stored in Web Directory 1 and Web Directory 2. The investigations\nrevealed that the Organisation had left it to the Vendor to put in place the appropriate security\narrangements to protect the Disclosed Personal Data. Consequently, as mentioned at [3], the\nscope of work in the Contract did not include any requirements with respect to how the\nDisclosed Personal Data was to be stored or protected. The Organisation also did not review\nthe standard of security of the Website and left it completely to the Vendor. In particular:\n(a)\n\nIn relation to Web Directory 1, prior to the Incident, since the Organisation did\n\nnot provide any instructions to the Vendor on the storage of tax invoices generated from\ndirect reservations on its Website, it was unaware that such tax invoices were stored in\nWeb Directory 1 which was publicly accessible. In this regard, the Organisation’s\nassertion was that it had intended for these tax invoices to be stored in a backend\n4\n\n\fEU Holidays Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 38\n\nContent Management System which only authorised staff could log into and access. Its\nintention was not translated into action.\n(b)\n\nIn relation to Web Directory 2, the Organisation intended for tax invoices\n\ngenerated from reservations through its partner agents to be stored in Web Directory 2,\nand accessed by partner agents using their respective email addresses and password.\nThe Organisation asserted that did not intend for Web Directory 2 to be publicly\naccessible. However, since the Organisation did not provide any instructions to the\nVendor in relation to access controls for Web Directory 2, none was implemented.\n11\n\nWhat is expected from organisations contracting professional services to build their\n\ncorporate websites or other online portals is explained in the Commission’s Guide on Building\nWebsites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018). In particular, organisations that engage IT vendors\nto develop and/or maintain their websites should emphasize the need for personal data\nprotection to their IT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms.2 Given that the\ndevelopment of the Website was for the purposes of e-commerce (including the collection of\nCustomers’ Disclosed Personal Data in relation to reservations for tour packages), the\nOrganisation’s failure to specify clear requirements with respect to the protection of personal\ndata is particularly glaring in this case.\n12\n\nSecondly, and as observed in Re Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5 at [21] to [23], where\n\ndocuments containing personal data have to reside on web servers, folder or directory\npermissions are common and direct methods of controlling access and preventing unauthorised\naccess by public users and web crawlers. Depending on its business needs and circumstances,\nthe Organisation could have instructed the Vendor to implement any of the following\nreasonable technical security measures to protect the Disclosed Personal Data:\n(a)\n\nplace documents containing the Disclosed Personal Data in a non-public\n\nfolder/directory.\n(b)\n\nplace documents containing the Disclosed Personal Data in a non-public folder\n\nor directory, with access to these documents controlled through web applications on the\nserver.\n\n2\n\nGuide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1]\n\n5\n\n\fEU Holidays Pte. Ltd.\n\n(c)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 38\n\nplace documents containing the Disclosed Personal Data in a sub-folder within\n\nthe Public Directory but control access to files by creating a .htaccess file within that\nsub-folder.

The current version of the Organisation’s\nMobile App does not have this design issue as it has been fixed.\n2\n\nOn 17 May 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received information from an anonymous informant alleging that\nthere was a vulnerability in the Organisation’s Mobile App, which allowed the\ninformant to access the account details of other customers (the “Data Breach”).\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found the\nOrganisation to be in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”). The Commissioner sets out below his findings and grounds of\ndecision.\n\n1\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nMaterial Facts and Documents\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a telecommunications company in Singapore. The\n\nMobile App was developed by the Organisation’s IT team to enable its customers\nto track their account information and manage add-on services. Communications\nbetween the Mobile App and the Organisation’s servers are conducted via\nApplication Programming Interfaces (“API”).\n4\n\nThe Organisation’s customers can login to the Mobile App via the\n\nfollowing methods:\n(a)\n\nMobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number\n\n(“MSISDN”) login: where a customer’s mobile phone is connected to the\nOrganisation’s mobile data network (3G/4G), the Organisation’s servers\nwill verify that the MSISDN and IP address of the mobile phones are\ncorrect before granting the customer access to the Mobile App;1\n(b)\n\nOne Time Password (“OTP”): through validation of the OTP sent\n\nto customers via SMS and entering it in the Mobile App (“OTP Login\nMethod”); and\n(c)\n5\n\nOnePass: by using their OnePass login and password.\n\nCustomers that login to the Mobile App via the MSISDN or OTP login\n\nmethod have access to the following data relating to their own account:\n\n1\n\nEach MSISDN is assigned a unique IP address. When a user logs in to the Mobile App via the\nMSISDN login method, the backend server will verify the MSISDN assigned to that IP address.\nOnce verified, the login attempt will be deemed to be authenticated and the user will be granted\naccess to the Mobile App.\n\n2\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\n(a)\n\nthe mobile number used to access the Mobile App;\n\n(b)\n\nrelated service plan information (i.e. data, talktime and SMS\n\nusage);\n\n6\n\n(c)\n\noutstanding bill amount;\n\n(d)\n\nbill payment due date; and\n\n(e)\n\nbilling account number.\n\nIn addition to the data mentioned at paragraph 5 above, customers that\n\nlogin to the Mobile App via the OnePass method also have access to all the service\ninformation for all Singtel services registered under that Singtel OnePass ID. In\naddition, if such customers had opted for electronic billing, they would have\naccess to the following data relating to their own account:\n(a)\n\nthe customer’s name;\n\n(b)\n\nthe customer’s billing address; and\n\n(c)\n\nall Singtel services and corresponding usage (where applicable)\n\nunder the same billing account number.\n7\n\nThe anonymous informant claimed that the API on the server could be\n\nmanipulated by using specialised tools to gain unauthorised access to the account\ndetails of other customers through the following methods:\n(a)\n\nThe MSISDN is a string of numbers that incorporates within it the\n\ncustomer’s mobile phone number. By logging in using a legitimate Singtel\naccount via the MSISDN login method and changing the value in the\n\n3\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nMSISDN field (i.e. to another customer’s mobile phone number)2 that was\nsent from the Mobile App’s API to the Organisation’s servers, the\ninformant was able to retrieve the account details (such as the billing\naccount number and billing cycle) of the other customer.\n(b)\n\nThereafter, by logging in using a legitimate Singtel account via the\n\nOnePass method and changing the value in the billing account number and\nbilling cycle fields, the informant was able to obtain the customer’s bill,\nwhich contains further personal data such as the customer’s name, billing\naddress and all Singtel services and corresponding usage (where\napplicable) under the same billing account number3.\n8\n\nThe informant accessed four billing accounts and extracted the customer’s\n\nname, billing address, billing account number, mobile phone number as well as\ncustomer service plans (including data, talk time and SMS usage). While there\nwas no further evidence of unauthorised access, the personal data of\napproximately 330,000 of the Organisation’s customers who were using the\nMobile App at the material time were put at risk of disclosure.\n9\n\nAlthough the Organisation had engaged a third party security vendor to\n\nconduct regular security penetration tests on the Mobile App and backend systems\n(including the API), the tests had not detected the design issue in the API that led\nto the Data Breach and the Organisation was unaware of it.\n\nThe subscriber’s mobile phone number was used by the Organisation’s servers to retrieve the\nsubscriber’s account and billing details.\n2\n\n3\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 6 above.\n\n4\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n10\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nDuring the investigation, the Organisation admitted that the Data Breach\n\nwas caused by a design issue in the API – the application input4 was not validated\nagainst the login credential used to access the Mobile App before performing the\nrequested operation (the “Direct Object Reference Vulnerability”). Because all\nrequest parameters sent by the Mobile App to the Organisation’s server during a\nvalid login session were assumed to be valid, once a user was legitimately\nauthenticated to initiate a valid login session on the device (via the MSISDN, OTP\nor OnePass login methods), the user would be able to intercept and change the\nfield parameters in the API requests between the Mobile App and the server.\nNotwithstanding, the Organisation asserted that such an action was “not\nsomething that a normal user of the App would attempt” and the attacker must be\n“technically competent” as the changing of the parameters could only be\nperformed on a workstation.\n11\n\nSoon after it was notified of the Data Breach, the Organisation took\n\nremedial actions to resolve the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability. The\nOrganisation enhanced the API in order to tightly couple the Mobile App user’s\nidentifiers to the authenticated session. In this manner, should the parameters be\nmodified during the same authenticated session such that they do not match the\nMobile App user’s identifiers (e.g. the MSISDN field is changed to another\nnumber and service information such as data usage of that other number is\nrequested), the user will see an error message and be logged out.\n\n4\n\nSuch as the MSISDN for the MSISDN or OTP login method, and the MSISDN, billing account\nnumber, billing payment due date for the OnePass login method.\n\n5\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n12\n\nIt is not disputed that the subscriber’s name, billing address, billing\n\naccount number, mobile phone number as well as customer service plans\n(including data, talk time and SMS usage) are “personal data” as defined in section\n2(1) of the PDPA (“Personal Data”). There is also no dispute that the PDPA\napplies to the Organisation as it falls within the PDPA’s definition of\n“organisation”. The key issue to be determined in this case is therefore whether\nthe Organisation had complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under section 24 of the\nPDPA\n13\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks. It is not disputed that the Personal Data\nwas in the Organisation’s possession and/or control.\n14\n\nHaving considered the material facts, the Commissioner finds that even\n\nthough the Organisation had engaged a third party security vendor to conduct\nregular penetration tests on the Mobile App and backend systems (including the\nAPI), the Organisation failed to put in place reasonable security arrangements with\nrespect to the said API to protect the Personal Data.\n15\n\nFirst, by the Organisation’s own admission, the Data Breach was caused\n\nby the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability, which was a design issue in the API.\nThe Organisation failed to take into account the risk of manipulation to the\nparameters sent from the Mobile App’s API to the Organisation’s servers when\n\n6\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\ndesigning the Mobile App. The validation of parameters (whether input or noninput fields), which could have prevented unauthorised access to the Personal\nData, were not implemented as part of the API’s initial design.\n16\n\nThe Direct Object Reference Vulnerability is a relatively basic design\n\nissue and well-known security risk that a reasonable person would have\nconsidered necessary to detect and prevent. It was one of Open Web Application\nSecurity Project (“OWASP”) 2013’s top 10 most critical web application security\nrisks and OWASP recommended, among other things, the usage of Indirect Object\nReference as a prevention method.\n17\n\nFurthermore, as highlighted in the Commission’s Guide to Building\n\nWebsites for SMEs (at [6.5]), programmers should be aware of the common\nwebsite vulnerabilities and adopt the appropriate programming techniques and\npractices to ensure that personal data cannot be exposed through such\nvulnerabilities. Although the Guide to Building Websites for SMEs sets out key\nconsiderations for the process of setting up a website, the same principles are\nsimilarly applicable when programming a mobile application. This is because the\nsame issues arise when a server responds to requests from a mobile app as when\nit responds to requests from a web browser.\n“6.5 Website Programming\n\n6.5.1 When programming the website, programmers should be aware of\nthe common website vulnerabilities, and adopt the proper programming\ntechniques and practices to avoid them. Programmers can use the\nOWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities list as guide and some common\nvulnerabilities include:\n\n7\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\n\n\nInjection (e.g. SQL Injection)\n\n\n\nCross-site scripting\n\n\n\nBuffer overflows\n\n\n\nPoor authentication & session management\n\n6.5.2 Organisations and any engaged IT vendors should ensure that\npersonal data cannot be exposed, either accidently or by design,\nthrough any such vulnerabilities. The website functions should be\nthoroughly tested or scanned for vulnerabilities, before the website is\nlaunched.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n18\n\nBy failing to take into account the risk of manipulation to parameters sent\n\nfrom the Mobile App’s API to the Organisation’s servers, the Commissioner finds\nthat Organisation subjected its customers to the risk of actual and potential\nunauthorised access of their personal data.\n19\n\nAt this juncture, the Commissioner would like to deal with the\n\nOrganisation’s claim that exploiting the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability\nwas “not something that a normal user of the App would attempt” and that the\nattacker must be “technically competent” as the changing of the parameters could\nonly be performed on a workstation.\n20\n\nWhile the changing of parameters would require a person to have some\n\nknowledge of the tools and methods for doing so, anyone with working knowledge\nof how a mobile app communicates with the servers through an API could have\nexploited the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability. The tools and software\nrequired to manipulate the parameters are available online.\n\n8\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n21\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nThe Organisation was aware that direct object reference vulnerabilities had\n\nbeen discovered in its Mobile App. Despite having received professional advice\nto take precautions against such vulnerabilities, the Organisation omitted to\nconduct a full code review on the input and non-input fields and hence failed to\ndiscover the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability that was exploited in this case.\n22\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 9 above, the Organisation had engaged a third\n\nparty security vendor to conduct regular security penetration tests on the Mobile\nApp and backend systems.5 The Direct Object Reference Vulnerability was not\ndetected prior to the Data Breach but a variation of it was found in the October\n2015 penetration test (“2015 Penetration Test Report”) and rectified in\nNovember 2015. In the 2015 Penetration Test Report, the security vendor cited\nthree examples of Direct Object References vulnerabilities in the API\n(collectively, the “2015 DOR Vulnerabilities”).\n23\n\nDuring the investigation, the Organisation represented that the 2015 DOR\n\nVulnerabilities were specific to the API accepting input fields (i.e. parameters\nkeyed in by users at the user interface level), whereas the Direct Object Reference\nVulnerability did not validate non-input fields (i.e. parameters not keyed in by\nusers such as automatically generated URL at the backend). As the Organisation\nhad only conducted a code review for the 2015 DOR Vulnerabilities on APIs\naccepting input fields, the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability that caused the\nData Breach was not discovered at the time. However, contrary to the\nOrganisation’s representation, a review of the 2015 Penetration Test Report\nshowed that both input and non-input fields were affected by the 2015 DOR\n\n5\n\nAt the time of the Data Breach, the most recent penetration tests on the Mobile App and backend\nsystems were conducted in October 2015 and January 2017.\n\n9\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nVulnerabilities, and even non-input fields could be manipulated by the Mobile\nApp’s call to the API and that this should be remedied.\n24\n\nBased on the findings and recommendations in the 2015 Penetration Test\n\nReport, the Organisation ought to have been more diligent in performing a\nthorough assessment of the security posture of the API and the server. The\nOrganisation should have examined all other functions to determine whether they\ncould be exploited by changing the input parameters and implement the relevant\nfixes, but it had failed to do so.\n25\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation is in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA as it failed to make reasonable security\narrangements with respect to the said API to protect the personal data in its\npossession and within its control.\n26\n\nThe Organisation submitted representations after a preliminary grounds of\n\ndecision was issued and raised four points. First, the Organisation asserted that it\nwas reasonable that any request parameters sent by the Mobile App during a login\nsession was treated as valid without having to re-validate the request parameters\nduring the session, given that the user was required to be legitimately\nauthenticated via one of the three login methods. This does not address the Direct\nObject Reference Vulnerabilities which could be exploited by a third party.\nParagraphs 15 to 25 above, deal with this point.\n27\n\nSecondly, the Organisation asserted that not all of its 330,000 customers’\n\ndata was put at risk of disclosure as the informant would have had to use the\ncorrect combination of the mobile number of the customer, the customer’s billing\naccount number, billing account ID and billing cycle date in order to generate a\nbill specific to that customer or a correct mobile phone number to generate the\n\n10\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\nrelevant subscription information. The Organisation thus asserts that the decision\nshould be narrowed to only the 4 accounts that were successfully accessed. The\nmanner in which the informant was able to access the records of the said 4\naccounts is set out above at paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b). While the informant only\naccessed 4 accounts, the informant or someone with similar skillset and access to\nthe same resources could potentially have access to the personal data of all\n330,000 subscribers who were using the Mobile App during the material time of\nthe Incident. In the circumstances, it is correct that the full size of the database\nwas one of the factors taken into consideration in assessing the financial penalty\nquantum.\n28\n\nThirdly, in reference to paragraph 19 above, the Organisation asserted that\n\nthe technical expertise required by someone to exploit the Direct Object Reference\nVulnerability was underestimated in this Decision. For the avoidance of doubt, it\nis agreed that some level of technical expertise would have been required for\nsomeone to exploit the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability. While this level of\ntechnical expertise is not uncommon, what cannot be ignored is that the\nvulnerability is well known and the requisite knowledge, tools and software to\nexploit the Direct Object Reference Vulnerability can be acquired online. This\nincreases the likelihood that someone with the wrong motivation could have\nexploited the vulnerability.\n29\n\nFinally, the Organisation also restates that the Direct Object Reference\n\nVulnerability was not detected in the security penetration tests. This is dealt with\nat paragraph 21 above.\n30\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner decided to maintain his finding\n\nthat the Organisation was in contravention of section 24 of the PDPA.\nNevertheless, the Commissioner has decided to impose a reduced financial\n\n11\n\n\fSingapore Telecommunications Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 36\n\npenalty quantum as set out at paragraph 32 below, given that the exploitation of\nthe vulnerability requires some level of technical expertise.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n31\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the\nPDPA to issue such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\nThis may include directing the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of such\namount not exceeding S$1 million.\n32\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $25,000 within 30\ndays from the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at the\nrate specified in the Rules of Court6 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full. The Commissioner has not set out any further directions\ngiven the remediation measures that the Organisation has already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n12\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $40,000 was imposed on Marshall Cavendish Education for failing to put in place reasonable measures to protect the personal data of users of its learning management system.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty"],"date":"2019-11-04","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Marshall-Cavendish-Education-Pte-Ltd.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Marshall Cavendish Education","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/11/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-marshall-cavendish-education","timestamp":"2019-11-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2019] SGPDPC [34]\nCase No DP-1704-B0699\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under\nsection 50(1) of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012\nAnd\nMarshall Cavendish Education Pte.

This was pursuant to a contract between\nMCE and MOE.\n\n3.\n\nOn 1 February 2017, ransomware affected a substantial portion of MCE’s\n\nnetwork (“Incident”). On 3 February 2017, MCE informed MOE of the Incident.\nThe relevant government agencies were notified of the Incident accordingly,\nincluding the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). The ransomware\nhad encrypted the files found on MCE’s servers, including files containing personal\ndata of individuals stored in the LMS, and made them inaccessible until a payment\nwas paid to decrypt them.\n\n4.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the ransomware was an executable file on 1\n\nserver. However, it affected data on 11 servers and network storage devices in\nMCE’s network. These 11 affected servers and network storage devices mostly held\nteaching material. However, the server in question and a network storage device\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\neach held copies of the database of 206,240 active and 44,688 inactive users. The\ndatabase held the following personal data of its users, which were mandatory fields\nthat every user who signed up for accounts on the Website had to provide:\n\na.\n\nLogin ID comprising an individual’s full or partial birth certificate or\nNRIC no.;\n\nb.\n\nName;\n\nc.\n\nSchool name;\n\nd.\n\nSchooling level; and\n\ne.\n\nClass.\n\n5.\n\nUsers could also opt to supply additional personal data using optional fields.\n\nAccording to MCE, however, users rarely provided such additional information,\nwhich comprised:\n\na.\n\nEmail address;\n\nb.\n\nAddress;\n\nc.\n\nNRIC;\n\nd.\n\nMobile Number;\n\ne.\n\nFather/Mother/Guardian’s Name;\n\nf.\n\nFather/Mother/Guardian’s NRIC/Passport Number;\n\n3\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte.

MCE’s internet service provider’s network logs would have captured the\ndownloading of a database of that size.\n\n7.\n\nHowever, as access had been gained to MCE’s servers to upload and execute\n\nthe ransomware, it meant that the personal data in MCE’s servers were exposed to\nunauthorised access. Further, the encryption of the personal data by the ransomware\nwas an unauthorised modification of the personal data in MCE’s servers.\n\nCauses of the Incident\n\n8.\n\nThe primary cause of the Incident was due to a change made to a firewall\n\nrule to allow internet access to the server. This allowed the external perpetrator to\ngain entry into the system to upload and execute the ransomware.\n\n9.\n\nMCE had employed a senior system engineer (“SE”) to, amongst other\n\nthings, maintain MCE’s servers. The SE was part of the Organisation’s IT team that\nalso comprised of another system engineer and a manager (“IT Manager”) who\nhad supervisory duties over the said system engineers. According to the\nOrganisation, the IT Manager together with the SE and a program manager was also\nresponsible for managing the services in the Organisation’s datacentre.\n\n4\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n10.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nThe SE had found that the backup server’s anti-virus definition was not\n\nupdating automatically. The SE thought that the anti-virus’ auto-update function\nwas not working properly due to the limited or restricted access to the Internet, and\nthus the SE changed a firewall rule to allow direct access from the Internet to the\nserver in question (the “Firewall Rule Change”). The Firewall Rule Change had\nlifted the restrictions that were in place to prevent external access to the MCE\nbackup server and the data it held.\n\n11.\n\nCritically, although the Firewall Rule Change was intended to be temporary,\n\nthe SE had failed to reinstate the firewall rule after completing his investigation,\nthereby allowing the server to be continuously exposed to internet access. This\nincreased the risk of an external perpetrator being able to gain entry into the server,\nas had transpired in this case.\n\n12.\n\nPDPC’s investigations revealed that the perpetrator had gained entry to the\n\nserver through brute force attacks on the server. As a result of these brute force\nattacks, the perpetrator had uploaded and executed the ransomware on the server\non 1 February 2017.\n\nRemedial actions by the Organisation\n\n13.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently took the following remedial measures:\na. Put in place security arrangements to protect the personal data held in its\nservers after assessment of their need for remote internet access;\n\nb.

Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nIssue for determination\n\n14.\n\nThe issue to be determined is whether MCE had complied with its\n\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA in this case.\n\n15.\n\nThere is the preliminary issue of whether MCE was a data intermediary for\n\nMOE and whether it could avail itself of the exception under section 4(1)(c) of the\nPDPA, which states that Parts III to VI of the PDPA, including section 24 of the\nPDPA, shall not impose any obligation on any public agency or organisation in the\ncourse of acting on behalf of a public agency (in this case, MOE). Investigations\ndisclosed that MCE was a vendor providing IT tools and hosting services for\nMOE’s teaching and administrative programmes. MCE was not acting on behalf of\na public agency for the purposes of section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA and is subject to\nthe full gamut of obligations under the PDPA qua its capacity as a data\nintermediary.\n\n16.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect personal\n\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nWhether MCE breached section 24 of the PDPA\n\n17.\n\nThe personal data in question was stored on MCE’s backup server. It was\n\nin MCE’s possession or under its control. MCE therefore had a duty to protect that\ndata by making reasonable security arrangements against unauthorised access or\nmodification.\n\n7\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n18.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nMCE did not fulfil its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA when the\n\ncircumstances are viewed in totality. The SE had intended the Firewall Rule Change\nto be temporary. However, the SE had failed to reverse the Firewall Rule Change\nas he was interrupted by other work matters in the middle of attempting to establish\nthe reason for the failure of the antivirus software to update automatically. This was\na critical mis-step.\n\n19.\n\nThis was exacerbated by the fact that the SE had, at some time prior to this,\n\nalready installed remote access software on the backup server. Only the Remote\nDesktop Protocol (RDP) server was meant to be configured to be accessible\nremotely. However, it appears that the SE had configured the backup server as a\nsecondary RDP server.\n\n20.\n\nWhile the Firewall Rule Change in and of itself was a security risk as it\n\nopened the MCE’s backup server to a wide range of possible attacks, the installation\nof remote access software on the server and its configuration as a secondary RDP\nserver would have allowed an attacker a greater chance of success in infiltrating it,\nespecially where no safeguards were implemented to mitigate this risk. These\nthreats are real – as has been exemplified in this case where the perpetrator had\nmanaged to use brute-force attacks to gain access to the backup server in order to\nupload and execute the ransomware.\n\n21.\n\nAs an organisation, MCE bore responsibility for putting in place the\n\nrequisite measures to prevent data breaches from taking place. As mentioned in Re\nAviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 4, relying solely on employees to perform their tasks\ndiligently is not a sufficiently reasonable security arrangement, and the organisation\nwould need to take proactive steps to protect personal data. In this case, the SE was\npart of the Organisation’s IT team supervised by an IT Manager. However, it\nappears that the IT Manager did not exercise competent supervision over the IT\nteam. In this regard, the Organisation admitted, through a written statement made\n\n8\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nby the Organisation’s General Manager of Product Development (“GM of Prd.\nDevpt.”), that:\n\na.\n\nUser accounts in the data centre for former staff, including that of a staff\nwho had left in 2014, had not at the material time been removed;\n\nb.\n\nThe SE was not familiar with the new firewall and that this may have\ncontributed to the Incident. If the Organisation was aware of the SE’s\nunfamiliarity with the new firewall, the IT manager ought to have\nsupervised the SE more closely; and\n\nc.\n\nThat there were no standard operating procedures in place to document\nchanges to the firewall configurations and there were no measures in\nplace to monitor for the installation of unauthorised software. We have\naddressed this issue in paragraphs 35 to 37 below in addressing the\nrepresentations made by the Organisation.\n\n22.\n\nIn these circumstances, the IT Manager may not have been able to\n\neffectively supervise the daily operational actions of the SE.\n\n23.\n\nWhat is required on the part of the Organisation are practicable steps, and\n\nthese can take the form of identifying areas of risks that require higher level\napproval and adequate supervision of such risky areas. One such area that ought to\nhave been identified was the installation of remote access software as every\ninstallation of remote access software is a channel for web-based threats that have\nto be guarded against. In this regard, the Organisation did not implement a process\nwhich provided adequate supervisory oversight over the installation of the remote\naccess software, apart from identifying the installation of remote access software as\nan act that required higher level approval. Records of any installation of the remote\naccess software could also be, but were not, maintained. This would have been a\npracticable step that MCE could have put in place. Of course, this cannot prevent\n\n9\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nthe situation where the SE wilfully disregarded such a policy and proceeded to\ninstall remote access software on the backup server without authority, but the\nanalysis of the facts and conclusion on MCE’s liability might well be different had\nsuch supervisory measures been implemented.\n\n24.\n\nSimilarly, MCE could also have implemented some form of approval\n\nprocess for changes to firewall configuration. In this case, a manual record of\nfirewall changes in a log book or other form of supervisory monitoring, for\nexample, could have been practicable steps put in place by MCE. This would have\nheightened the awareness of the SE that changes to firewall rules cannot be made\nin a cavalier manner, and that his actions were subject to scrutiny. Again, this will\nnot prevent wilful disregard of such control measures but the lack of such\npracticable steps deprived MCE room to raise a credible claim that it had put in\nplace reasonable security measures to protect the personal data.\n\n25.\n\nIn addition to the failure of supervision, 15 accounts with remote access to\n\nMCE’s system through the primary RDP server were found during MCE’s postIncident review. MCE reduced this number of accounts to 5. The unnecessary\nnumber of permitted users with remote access to the system pointed to a less than\nadequate appreciation of the risk that comes with remote access. This buttresses the\nCommissioner’s findings that MCE has not adequately met its section 24 obligation\nto protect personal data. The personal data stored on the server was not only subject\nto unauthorised access, it was modified without authorisation through the\nencryption process of the ransomware.\n\n26.\n\nIn the premises, the Commissioner is satisfied that MCE failed to make\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its servers from risk\nof unauthorised access, modification and disposal. The Commissioner therefore\nfinds MCE in breach of its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n10\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nDirections\n\n27.\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the\n\nOrganisations such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Organisations’\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the organisations to pay a\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the Commissioner\nthinks fit.\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and the investigation and assessment\n\nof this matter having been completed, the Commissioner is satisfied that MCE did\nnot make reasonable security arrangements and is in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n29.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs that MCE pays a financial penalty of S$40,000 within\n30 days from the date of the directions, failing which interest shall be payable on\nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\n30.\n\nIn assessing the breach as determining the directions to be imposed on MCE\n\nin this case, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n\na.\n\nMCE was cooperative in the investigations;\n\nb.\n\nThere was no misuse of the affected personal data that was reported or\nindicated; and\n\nc.\n\nMCE had put in place several remedial measures as indicated at\nparagraph 13 above.\n\n11\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nHowever, the Commissioner had to balance these mitigating factors against the fact\nthat MCE’s failure to protect in this case led to loss of personal data in the\npossession of the organisation to the control of the ransomware attacker.\n\n31.\n\nRepresentations were made by MCE after being informed of the proposed\n\ndecision in this case, submitting that they had complied with the Protection\nObligation under section 24 of the PDPA. In the alternative, MCE requested for a\nwarning in lieu of a financial penalty or to otherwise reduce the quantity of the\nfinancial penalty imposed.\n\nCompliance with the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n32.\n\nIn support of the assertion that MCE had complied with section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, MCE made the following representations:\n\na. By installing remote access software on the backup server and\nchanging the firewall configuration without higher level approval\nfrom MCE’s IT manager, the SE wilfully disregarded MCE’s IT\nsecurity policy;\n\nb. As acknowledged by the Commission at paragraph 23, no\npracticable steps can be taken to prevent a situation of wilful\ndisregard; and\n\nc. MCE had adequate supervisory measures, as seen by the fact that\nthe Incident was discovered after MCE carried out its routine\nmonitoring of the system, and MCE subsequently took prompt\naction to investigate the Incident.\n\n12\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n33.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nThe Commissioner has considered the representations and maintains his\n\nfinding that MCE is liable under section 24 of the PDPA for the actions of the SE.\n\n34.\n\nAt the outset, it is crucial to note that the breach was not one-off, as the SE’s\n\ninstallation and usage of the unauthorised remote access software on the backup\nsever took place on more than one occasion, but went undetected. In fact, the SE\nhad fully configured the backup server to function as an RDP server, should the\nprimary server fail, without the knowledge of his supervisor. This shows the\ninadequacy of MCE’s supervisory mechanisms.\n\n35.\n\nIt should be noted that the Organisation, through a written statement made\n\nby its GM of Prd. Devpt. on 2 June 2017, had admitted that:\n\na. “At the time of the incident, there were no measures in place to\nprevent system engineers to install unauthorised software, such as\nTeamviewer [a remote access software]”; and\nb. “They [the IT team] were not required to notify anyone else if\nchanges were made to the firewall configurations. There are no\nstandard operating procedures to document such changes.” The\nOrganisation also admitted that this was a lapse on their part and\nhave tightened their process following a security audit by their\nvendor.\n\n36.\n\nThe Organisation in its representations has stated that it had a policy in place\n\nwhich required the SE to seek higher level approval from the IT Manager for the\ninstallation of remote access software and the Firewall Rule Change. Assuming that\nthe statement made by the GM of Prd. Devpt. on 2 June 2017 and the statements\nmade in the representations are true and are consistent with each other, the\nreasonable conclusion is that, while there was a policy requiring such higher level\napprovals, this policy was not adequately implemented and there was a lack of\n\n13\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nsupervision and monitoring over both the installation of remote access software and\nthe Firewall Rule Change. In practice, the SE was allowed to take whatever action\nhe deemed fit without any supervisory oversight from the IT Manager or any other\nsupervisor even if this resulted in compromising the Organisation’s IT security.\n\n37.\n\nIn this regard, the fact that the SE was able to wilfully disregard MCE’s\n\nprocedures on more than one occasion over a period of time, without this activity\nbeing detected, highlighted MCE’s failure to translate the policy into a process\nwhich sufficiently complies with section 24 of the PDPA. Merely putting in place\npolicies is insufficient to fulfil MCE’s obligation under section 24 of the PDPA –\nMCE must also have taken practicable steps to implement these policies, for\nexample, as set out above at paragraph 21 through adequate supervision and/or\nmonitoring.\n\nImposition of financial penalty\n\n38.\n\nIn support of their request that the Commission should issue a warning\n\ninstead of a financial penalty or otherwise reduce the quantity of the financial\npenalty imposed, MCE made the following representations:\n\na. The Commission failed to consider all relevant mitigating factors in\narriving at the preliminary decision;\n\nb. The proposed financial penalty is manifestly excessive in light of\nprevious decisions issued by the Commission for similar or even\nmore serious breaches; and\n\nc. It would be extremely prejudicial for MCE if the Commission were\nto issue a decision and impose penalties on MCE almost two years\nafter the Incident, as the public may have the misconception that the\nIncident took place recently and MCE currently does not have\n\n14\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect personal data that is in\nits possession.\n\n39.\n\nMCE raised the following mitigating factors in its representations:\n\na. There was clearly no loss of personal data;\n\nb. No personal data was accessed by the perpetrator or any third party\nand no individual can or will be affected by the Incident;\n\nc. MCE took immediate steps to reduce the damage caused by the\nIncident;\n\nd. There were no prior breaches of the PDPA on the part of MCE; and\n\ne. MCE had not acted deliberately or wilfully.\n\n40.\n\nAs the personal data had been rendered inaccessible by encryption, MCE\n\nhad in fact lost access and control of the personal data. Also, because of the\nunauthorised encryption of files containing the personal data, MCE was forced to\ndelete these encrypted files in accordance with its data protection policy. The main\ndatabase was modified because it was encrypted, and there would have been a loss\nof new incremental data created during the interval between the last backed up copy\nand ransomware attack. Furthermore, personal data was put at risk as the perpetrator\nof the ransomware attack could access the personal data if they chose to do so.\n\n41.\n\nNevertheless, as noted at paragraph 30 above, the Commission took into\n\naccount the fact that there was no misuse of the affected personal data that was\nreported or indicated, and the fact that MCE had put in place remedial measures\nfollowing the Incident. The fact that there were no prior breaches of the PDPA is\nnot a mitigating factor in itself. On the contrary, if MCE had breached the PDPA\n\n15\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nrepeatedly, this would have been an aggravating factor, and it is trite that the\nabsence of an aggravating factor is not a mitigating factor.\n\nIn addition, the\n\ndeliberateness or wilfulness of MCE in breaching the PDPA is not a relevant\nconsideration in this case.\n\n42.\n\nFurthermore, the three cases cited by MCE – Challenger Technologies Ltd\n\nand Xirlynx Innovations [2016] SGPDPC 6 (“Challenger”), Institute of Singapore\nChartered Accounts [2018] SGPDPC 28 (“ISCA”) and Bud Cosmetics [2019]\nSGPDPC 1 (“Bud Cosmetics”) are not analogous to the present facts.\n\n43.\n\nFirstly, MCE submitted that only a warning was imposed in Challenger\n\nalthough the personal data of more than 165,000 individuals was compromised.\nHowever, the personal data leaked in Challenger was limited – it comprised only\nindividuals’ names, membership expiry dates and accumulated points. However,\nthe personal data in the present case includes personal data of minors and NRIC\nnumbers, and is thus of a more sensitive nature.\n\n44.\n\nSecondly, MCE submitted that the personal data compromised in ISCA was\n\neven more sensitive as it included employment records and exam results, however\na financial penalty of only $6,000 was imposed. Employment and exam results are\nnot treated as sensitive data. Furthermore, the number of affected individuals in\nISCA was substantially lesser – 1,906 individuals as opposed to more than 250,000\nindividuals in the present case, and the unauthorised disclosure was limited to a\nsingle unintended recipient for a short period of 10 minutes. This consequentially\naffects the quantity of the financial penalty imposed.\n\n45.\n\nThirdly, MCE submitted that in Bud Cosmetics, the Commission imposed a\n\nfinancial penalty of only $11,000 despite the fact that the Commission found\nbreaches under sections 12, 24 and 26 of the PDPA. As with Challenger, the\npersonal data compromised in Bud Cosmetics was not sensitive. Furthermore, the\n\n16\n\n\fRe Marshall Cavendish Education Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34\n\nnumber of affected individuals in Bud Cosmetics was substantially lesser – 2,457\nindividuals as opposed to more than 250,000 individuals in the present case.\n\n46.\n\nLastly, the time taken to complete investigations into PDPA breaches and\n\nissue decisions may vary from case to case due to a myriad of factors. The present\ncase involved substantial technical complexities requiring a longer a period of time\nto complete investigations, consider representations and issue the decision. The\npresent Grounds of Decision clearly state the date of the Incident and the remedial\nmeasures taken by MCE. This would address MCE’s concerns that the public would\nbe of the view that the incident took place recently or that it has not remediated the\nbreach.\n\n47.\n\nIn view of the remedial measures taken by MCE, no further directions are\n\nnecessary.\n\n48.\n\nThe Commissioner urges organisations to take the necessary action to\n\nensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. Appropriate\nenforcement action against non-compliant organisations will be taken.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n17\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Barnacles Pte.

These documents contain the policyholders’ personal data such as their\nnames, addresses, car registration numbers, genders, nationalities, NRIC numbers, dates\nof birth and contact numbers (the “Personal Data”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily informed the Personal Data Protection Commission on 15\nOctober 2018 that it had earlier discovered, on 11 September 2018, that some of its\ninsurance intermediaries had been incorrectly sent documents of policyholders who were\nrepresented by other insurance intermediaries (the “Incident”). The Incident arose when\nsome insurance intermediaries (the “Intermediaries”) requested for documents of\npolicyholders which they represent through the Portal. However, the Organisation’s\napplication and printer servers had been shut down for a scheduled system downtime and\nwhen they were restarted, the Organisation’s employees had failed to follow the correct\nrestart process. They were supposed to start both servers at the same time but this was\n\n\fnot done as the starting of the printer server initially failed. This resulted in documents\nwith duplicate document IDs being generated and hence the wrong documents being sent\nto the Intermediaries. As a result of the Incident, the Personal Data of 57 individuals were\nmistakenly disclosed to the Intermediaries.\n\n3.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission found that the Organisation did not have in\nplace a clearly defined process to restart its application and printer servers and a\nsufficiently robust document ID generation process (such as including a timestamp as\npart of the document ID) to prevent the duplication of document IDs.

(“Zero1”) is a Mobile Virtual Network Operator\n\nfounded in 2017. In order to deliver its SIM cards to its customers, Zero1\ncontracted XDEL Singapore Pte Ltd (“XDEL”) for courier services. In the\ncourse of delivering the SIM cards, XDEL inadvertently disclosed the personal\ndata of Zero1’s customers. Central to this case is the question of whether XDEL\nand Zero1 (collectively referred to as the “Organisations”) had made\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of Zero1’s\ncustomers pursuant to their obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nIn March 2018, XDEL was appointed by Zero1 to deliver SIM cards to\n\nthe latter’s subscribers. Zero1’s subscribers would register for mobile services\nusing Zero1’s website. After their application had been processed, Zero1 would\nprovide to XDEL the subscriber’s information (including the subscriber’s name,\nNRIC number, delivery address and contact number), the SIM card number and\nthe subscriber’s preferred time of delivery. In the event that the customer had\nauthorised another person to receive the SIM card on his or her behalf (an\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\n“authorised recipient”), the authorised recipient’s information (name, NRIC\nnumber, contact number and delivery address) would additionally be provided\nto XDEL.\n3\n\nEach Zero1 subscriber was provided with a unique URL link which\n\nwould allow them to access a customised delivery notification webpage through\nwhich they could monitor the status of their SIM card delivery (the\n“notification webpage”). It was through the notification webpages that the\ninformation of the subscribers and authorised recipients (the “Personal Data”)\nwere accessed.\n4\n\nThe first batch of SIM card deliveries took place between 8 and 9 March\n\n2018. 333 URLs linking to notification webpages containing the Personal Data\nof 292 individuals were sent out in support of this first batch of deliveries.\nInvestigations revealed that there was unauthorised access (“Unauthorised\nAccess”) to 175 of the URLs which contained Personal Data. These URLs were\naccessed by 82 unique IP addresses over a span of about 34 hours, between 12\nand 13 March 2018.\n5\n\nThe Unauthorised Access was discovered after a post on an online forum\n\nthread warned other users not to reveal their Zero1 account numbers in public,\nindicating that it was possible to access another individual’s delivery\nnotification if one was able to determine another subscriber’s membership\nnumber. The membership number of another subscriber was not difficult to\ndetermine as the membership numbers were generated in sequential order.\n6\n\nFurther investigations uncovered the following causes leading to the\n\nunauthorised access of the Personal Data:\n\n2\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\nEach notification webpage URL comprised of what XDEL\n\ncalled an “A code” and a “B code”. A sample notification webpage URL\ntook\n\nthe\n\nfollowing\n\nform:\n\n“https://www.xdel.com/ib/?A=00000000&B=4CC5”. In this example,\nthe A-code is 00000000 and the B-code is 4CC5.\n(b)\n\nThe A code is a Zero1 subscriber’s membership number and also\n\nthe consignment note value, which, as noted above, is a sequentially\ngenerated number.\n(c)\n\nThe B code is the last 4 characters of a calculated code, generated\n\nusing a SHA1 hash on the consignment note number, with a secret salt.\nThe B code served as a confirmation code. It was meant to secure the\nURLs against unauthorised access. The webpage was supposed to return\nthe delivery status only when the correct B code of 4-character length\nwas presented. The calculated B code of 4 characters meant that it was\nunlikely that an individual would be able to guess the correct code based\non the A code, as there would have been 65,536 possible combinations.\n(d)\n\nAccording to XDEL, the notification webpage system was\n\ndeveloped in-house. In the course of investigations, XDEL admitted that\nits developer had failed to test for the scenario where a blank B code was\npresented.\n(e)\n\nIf B codes containing less than 4 characters were presented, the\n\nsystem would only check that the partial code presented matched the\nending characters of the correct code. As such, if someone guessed the\nA code of a subscriber (which as mentioned above was easy enough to\ndo given that the A code is a sequentially generated subscriber number)\nand left the B code blank, the system would identify this as a correct\n\n3\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\ncode, and unauthorised access would be granted to the subscriber’s\npersonal data. By altering the A code values, this allowed individuals to\nsee another person’s delivery orders and their personal data.\nAccordingly, the Unauthorised Access would likely have been prevented if the\nsystem was programmed to check the complete B Code instead of a partial code.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nThe Relevant PDPA Provisions\n7\n\nIn respect of this matter, the relevant provision is Section 24 of the\n\nPDPA. Section 24 requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\nPreliminary Issues\n8\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data is “personal data” as defined in\n\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA. There is no question or dispute that the Organisations\nfall within PDPA’s definition of an “organisation”.\n9\n\nIt is also not disputed that the Protection Obligation applies to both\n\nZero1 and XDEL:\n(a)\n\nThe personal data of the Zero1 customers and the authorised\n\nrecipients originated from Zero1 and was under Zero1’s possession\nand/or control. For this reason, Zero1 had the obligation under section\n\n4\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\n24 of the PDPA to protect the personal data of its customers and that of\nthe authorised recipients.\n(b)\n\nXDEL was the data intermediary for Zero1. XDEL had entered\n\ninto the “Service Agreement for the Provision of Domestic Courier\nServices” on 1 March 2018 (the “service agreement”). Pursuant to the\nagreement, XDEL was to provide for the storage of SIM cards, packing\nmaterials, and delivery service. Clause 11 of the Agreement stated that\nXDEL would “process the Personal Data” strictly for the purposes of\nproviding the stated services to Zero1. This would necessarily\nencompass the processing of the personal data of Zero1’s subscribers for\nthe purposes of delivery. By virtue of section 4(2) of the PDPA, XDEL\nhad the same obligation under section 24 of the PDPA to protect the\npersonal data Zero1’s subscribers and that of the authorised recipients.\n10\n\nThe key issue is therefore whether the Organisations had protected the\n\nPersonal Data in its possession and under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access and similar risks.\nBoth Organisations failed to make reasonable security arrangements\n11\n\nAfter a review of all the evidence obtained by PDPC during its\n\ninvestigation and for the reasons set out below, the Commissioner is of the view\nthat both Organisations had failed to make reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect the personal data in its possession and control, and both have thereby\nbreached the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\nA. Breach of the Protection Obligation by Zero1\n\n5\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n12\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\nZero1 was aware of the use of the notification webpage and had defined\n\nthe type of information contained on the webpage. Presumably, Zero1 had\nassessed the necessity and risks of the personal data displayed on the\nnotification webpage. Zero1 ought also to have satisfied itself that XDEL had\nput in place the reasonable security arrangements indicated in the service\nagreement, before allowing the webpage to be put into use. Zero1 failed to\ndemonstrate it had done the above. It had relied entirely on the warranty with\nregard to data protection in the service agreement, as well as customer\nreferences provided by XDEL.\n13\n\nReasonable security arrangements in this case would entail minimally\n\nmaking an effort to identify the possible risks and seeking assurance that the\ndata intermediary had taken steps to protect against those risks. Unfortunately,\nZero1 failed to do either. In fact, Zero1 were not even aware of the security\narrangements undertaken by XDEL; neither did it make any effort to identify\npotential risks associated with the notification webpage. Zero1 has cited a lack\nof ability and expertise to audit XDEL’s notification webpage source code as a\nreason for not doing so. This cannot be a valid defence as what is required is not\ntechnical oversight but an identification of foreseeable risks, and then requiring\nXDEL to take reasonable measures to address them. The extent of Zero1’s due\ndiligence in the circumstances did not require technical knowledge, but risk\nidentification and assessment. For instance, Zero1 could have identified the risk\nas whether a stranger coming across the website would be able to makes changes\nto it and retrieve a subscriber’s information; similarly, whether all information\ndisplayed on the notification page was necessary for the subscriber to monitor\nhis SIM card delivery. Having articulated the risks, Zero1 ought to have worked\nwith XDEL on assessing the likelihood of their occurrence, impact on\nsubscribers should the risk occur and what steps XDEL could propose that\nwould be reasonably effective in preventing the occurrence of the identified\n6\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\nrisks and, should they nevertheless occur, minimise the impact of the risks. This\nprocess does not require technical expertise on the part of Zero1; and allows it\nto rely on XDEL to provide the technical expertise during the risk assessment\nand mitigation discussion.\n14\n\nIt is therefore assessed that Zero1 did not meet the standard of having\n\nreasonable security arrangements in place.\nB. Representations submitted by Zero1\n15\n\nZero1 submitted its representations to the PDPC after a preliminary\n\ndecision was issued:\n(a)\n\nZero1 had taken measures to identify and mitigate potential\n\nrisks. As Zero1 did not have technical capabilities in coding, cyber\nsecurity or data encryption, it relied on XDEL’s declarations and\nassurances of its capabilities and track record. Zero1 also visited\nXDEL’s operation centre to audit its processes and was satisfied that\nthere were no foreseeable risk; and\n(b)\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect Zero1 to pinpoint the possible\n\navenues by which personal data could be compromised. The Incident\ncould not have been pre-empted by Zero1 without the relevant\nexperience and technical knowledge.\n16\n\nZero1 had previously highlighted that they lack technical expertise and\n\nthis has already been dealt with at paragraph 13 above. It should be pointed out\nthat while Zero1 may have audited the operation centre, this does not detract\nfrom the matters raised in paragraph 12 above.\n\n7\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n17\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\nIn relation to the 2nd point raised in paragraph 15(b), what was required\n\nis for Zero1 to have engaged XDEL on the security arrangements that it had put\nin place to protect the personal data on the notification webpage, including\ngenerating URLs using the membership number and the B Code. This did not\nrequire technical expertise on the part of Zero1. It is in the failure to do so that\nthe present breach is found.\n18\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner maintained his finding that\n\nZero1 is in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nC. Breach of the Protection Obligation by XDEL\n19\n\nXDEL created the notification webpage system knowing that it would\n\nbe used to contain the personal data of Zero1 subscribers and their designated\nauthorised recipients.\n20\n\nXDEL ought to have taken reasonable security arrangements to protect\n\nthe personal data from unauthorised access. The reasonable arrangements in this\ncase include adequate testing to verify that the measures were correctly\nimplemented. In this regard, XDEL had implemented the B code to prevent\nunauthorised access of the notification webpage. The B code would have\nprevented unauthorised access had it worked as intended.\n21\n\nHowever, while XDEL tested the notification webpages to make sure\n\nthey could not be accessed by an incorrect B code, they failed to test for\nscenarios where the B code was absent or when an incomplete B code was used.\nSince the B code was, by design, a 4-character field, it would seem obvious that\nthe module should have been designed to cater for the situation where the B\ncode did not meet this condition and thereafter to test for this scenario. Given\nthat the B code was crucial to the verification of the user and granting the user\n\n8\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\naccess to the user's personal data, tests should have been conducted to ascertain\nthe behaviour of the webpage in the absence of the B code. Their failure to do\nsuch tests rendered their efforts to reasonably secure the Personal Data hosted\non the notification webpage insufficient.\n22\n\nAccordingly, it is assessed that XDEL, like Zero1, did not meet the\n\nstandard of having reasonable security arrangements in place. XDEL’s failure\nto meet this standard is more serious than that of Zero1, given that XDEL was\nthe party that was responsible for the webpage notification system that failed.\nD. Representations by XDEL\n23\n\nXDEL submitted representations to the PDPC on the quantum of the\n\nfinancial penalty only. It asked for a reduction of the financial penalty quantum\nas it had recently incurred expenses to relocate to new premises. As this is not\na mitigating factor or relevant in determining the financial penalty quantum, the\nCommissioner has decided to maintain the initial financial penalty quantum.\nGiven its current cash flow considerations, the Commissioner has varied his\ndirections to XDEL, as set out below, to allow XDEL to pay the financial\npenalty in instalments.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n24\n\nHaving found the Organisations to be in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give\nthe Organisations such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n9\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n25\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on each of the\n\nOrganisations, the Commissioner has taken into account the following\naggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nThe Personal Data disclosed, which included the personal\n\naddresses of the subscribers and authorised recipients, as well as their\nNRIC numbers, was sensitive in nature.\n(b)\n\nApproximately\n\n292\n\nindividuals\n\nwere\n\naffected\n\nby\n\nthe\n\nunauthorised access.\n26\n\nThe following mitigating factors have also been taken into account:\n(a)\n\nZero1 voluntarily notified the PDPC that the Personal Data of\n\nthe subscribers and authorised individuals had been breached.\n(b)\n\nXDEL acted swiftly to rectify the notification webpage system.\n\nBy 13 March 2018, they had managed to modify the code checking\nfunction on the webpage to check for the length of the confirmation\ncode, thereby correcting the technical vulnerability. XDEL also added\nan “alert trigger” that would notify its IT department if an IP address\nentered 3 or more consecutive wrong codes, as an additional control to\nprevent any further unauthorised access.\n27\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, including the\n\nrelative responsibilities and culpabilities of both organisations,\n\nthe\n\nCommissioner hereby makes the following directions:\n(a)\n\nZero1 is to pay a financial penalty of $4,000.00 within 30 days\n\nfrom the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which interest at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\n\n10\n\n\fZero1 Pte. Ltd. and XDEL Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 37\n\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount until the financial\npenalty is paid in full; and\n(b)\n\nXDEL is to pay a financial penalty of $7,000.00 in 3 instalments\n\nas set out below, failing which, the full outstanding amount shall become\ndue and payable immediately and interest at the rate specified in the\nRules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable\non the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full:\n(i)\n\n1st instalment of $2,500 within 30 days from the date of\n\nthe Commissioner’s direction;\n(ii)\n\n2nd instalment of $2,500 within 60 days from the date of\n\nthe Commissioner’s direction; and\n(iii)\n\n3rd instalment of $2,000 within 90 days from the date of\n\nthe Commissioner’s direction,\n28\n\nGiven the remediation efforts undertaken by the Organisations, no\n\nfurther directions relating to the breach itself are issued.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $1,000 was imposed on Advance Home Tutors for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data collected from its tutors and for not developing and implementing data protection policies and practices necessary to ensure its compliance with PDPA.","tags":["Protection","Accountability","Financial Penalty","Education","Tuition"],"date":"2019-10-10","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Advance-Home-Tutors.pdf","nature":"Protection, Accountability","title":"Breach of the Protection and Accountability Obligations by Advance Home Tutors","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/10/breach-of-the-protection-and-accountability-obligations-by-advance-home-tutors","timestamp":"2019-10-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nCase No DP-1806-B2218\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nAdvance Home Tutors\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1806-B2218\n\n12 September 2019\nFacts of the Case\n1\n\nOn 7 June 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a complaint that personal data of many individuals\nhad apparently been disclosed without authorisation on the Organisation’s\nwebsite, www.advancetutors.com.sg (the “Website”). Upon investigation, the\nCommission found the following facts leading to this apparent unauthorised\ndisclosure of personal data.\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a sole proprietor who provides “matching services”\n\nthrough the Website between freelance tutors and prospective clients seeking\ntuition services.\n\n3\n\nIn January 2017, the Organisation engaged a freelance web developer\n\nbased in the Philippines (the “Developer”) to provide the following services:\n(a)\n\nto design and develop the Website; and\n\n(b)\n\nto migrate the existing databases and files of the Organisation’s\nold website to the Website.\n\n1\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n4\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nAt that point in time, 834 freelance tutors had signed up with the\n\nOrganisation and some of these tutors had chosen to upload their educational\ncertificates to the Website’s server (the “Server”) via the Website. These\ncertificates would be used by the Organisation to evaluate the suitability of the\ntutors for prospective jobs. In addition, copies of a tutor’s certificates were to\nbe disclosed on the tutor’s public profile on the Website if the tutor consented\nto such disclosure. Out of the tutors who had uploaded educational certificates,\na total of 152 tutors (the “Affected Individuals”) had not consented to\ndisclosure of their educational certificates on their public profile.\n\n5\n\nThe Developer subsequently migrated the educational certificates of the\n\ntutors who had uploaded them to the Website and stored them in an image subdirectory of a public directory found on the Server (the “Image Directory”).\nThese directories were not secured with any form of access controls and were\naccessible by the public via the Internet if the path to the relevant directory was\ntyped into a web browser. Furthermore, no measures were taken to prevent\nautomatic indexing of the Image Directory by Internet search engines. This\nresulted in the contents of the Image Directory, including the educational\ncertificates of the Affected Individuals, showing up in search results on Google\nafter the Website went live on 17 October 2017.\n\n6\n\nOn 6 April 2018, the Organisation informed the Developer to make\n\ncertain changes to the Website in order to disclose the education certificates of\nconsenting tutors on their public profile pages on the Website. The Organisation\nprovided written instructions to the Developer to “migrate all existing tutor\nprofiles from the [old website] to the [Website]”, and to “impose all pre-existing\nconditions in the [old website] to the [Website] when migrating the tutors”.\n\n2\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nAccording to the Organisation, one of the pre-existing conditions of the old\nwebsite was to only disclose educational certificates of tutors who had consent.\n7\n\nThe Organisation also represented that it had provided the following\n\nverbal instructions to the Developer:\n(a)\n\nto “hide the educational certificates of tutors who did not give\nconsent”;\n\n(b)\n\nto “respect and protect the privacy and confidentiality of all the\ndata that is present in AHT website”;\n\n(c)\n\nit “should not disclose or share any of the personal data or AHT\nAdmin user account details with a third party”; and\n\n(d)\n\nto “ensure users’ data is protected as AHT had entrusted them\nfor the purpose of IT services”.\n\n8\n\nActing on the Organisation’s instructions, the Developer wrote a coding\n\nscript to enable the retrieval and display of the educational certificates from the\nImage Directory. However, the coding script lacked a validation condition to\nensure that only educational certificates of tutors who had consented to\ndisclosure were disclosed on the tutors’ profile pages on the Website. This\nresulted in all of the educational certificates found in the Image Directory,\nincluding those of the Affected Individuals, being retrieved and publicly\ndisclosed on the Website through the tutors’ respective profile pages.\n\n9\n\nThe disclosure of the Affected Individuals’ educational certificates\n\n(described at [5] and [8] above) resulted in the unauthorised disclosure their\npersonal data which were found on their respective educational certificates (the\n“Incident”). The disclosed personal data included data such as the individual’s\nname and NRIC number, educational institutions attended and grades attained\nfor each subject (the “Disclosed Data”).\n\n3\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n10\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nSeparately, during the Commission’s investigations, the Organisation\n\nadmitted that it had not developed or implemented any data protection policies\nrelating to its compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”).\n\nRemedial measures taken by the Organisation\n\n11\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following\n\nsteps to mitigate the effects of the breach and to prevent its reoccurrence:\n(a)\n\ndeleted all the educational certificates that were stored in the\nImage Directory;\n\n(b)\n\nceased retention of any educational certificates received from the\ntutors;\n\n(c)\n\nrequested Google to remove any cached copies of the\neducational certificates from the Image Directory;\n\n(d)\n\nconducted a penetration test to discover and address any gaps in\nrespect of its security arrangements in respect of the Website and\nits server;\n\n(e)\n\nremoved all front-end access to the “Search Tutor” and “Tutor\nProfile” pages of the Website;\n\n(f)\n\nengaged an external system analyst to check the work which may\nbe performed by the Developer in future; and\n\n(g)\n\ndeveloped a data protection policy.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached section 24 of the PDPA\n\n4\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n12\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nAlthough the Organisation had engaged the Developer to provide\n\nvarious services, the Organisation retained possession and control over the\nDisclosed Data at all material times. It was responsible for the security\narrangements to be implemented on the Website and its back-end system, as\nwell as to protect the Disclosed Data.\n13\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal and similar risks.\n\n14\n\nTo determine whether the Organisation was in breach of section 24, the\n\nrelevant question is whether it had put in place reasonable security arrangements\nto safeguard the Disclosed Data hosted on the Website and its Server. As the\nDisclosed Data included the NRIC numbers of the tutors concerned, it should\nbe borne in mind that NRIC numbers are of special concern as they are “a\npermanent and irreplaceable identifier which can be used to unlock large\namounts of information relating to the individual”.1 Further, the Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on the PDPA for NRIC and Other National Identification\nNumbers (issued 31 August 2018) at [2.4], albeit not effective at the time of the\nbreach, points to the risks and potential impact of any unauthorised use or\ndisclosure of personal data associated with an individual’s NRIC; and the\nexpectation that organisations are to provide a greater level of security to protect\nNRIC numbers in its possession or control.\n15\n\nAs the Organisation had engaged the Developer to develop the Website,\n\nthe onus is on the Organisation to ensure that its security requirements for the\n\n1\n\nRe Habitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 9 at [19]\n\n5\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nWebsite and Server will be and have been met by the Developer. As part of this,\nthe Organisation could have done the following2:\n(a)\n\nemphasised the need for personal data protection to the\nDeveloper by making it part of the written contract;\n\n(b)\n\nwhen discussing the Developer’s scope of work, required that\nany changes the Developer made to the Website did not contain\nvulnerabilities that could expose the personal data, and to discuss\nwhether the Developer had the necessary technical and nontechnical processes in place to prevent the personal data from\nbeing exposed, accidentally or otherwise; and\n\n(c)\n\ntested the Website before any new changes went live to ensure\nthat the Organisation’s instructions to the Developer were\nproperly implemented and that the Website was sufficiently\nrobust and comprehensive to guard against a possible\ncyberattack.\n\n16\n\nThe Organisation admitted to the Commission that “there was a lack of\n\ntechnical expertise within Advance Home Tutor to protect personal data”,\nincluding the lack of expertise “on how to make the technical assessment and\nensure that the assessment is robust enough for adequate protection for\npersonal data”. This is also evident from the fact that the Organisation had\nrequired the Developer to migrate the information of its then-existing tutors\nfrom the old website to the Website “with the exact same conditions imposed”\n\n2\n\nFurther information on the steps that the Organisation should have taken when outsourcing the\ndevelopment of its Website may be found in the Commission’s Guide to Building Websites for\nSMEs.\n\n6\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\non the old website, without having any idea of how its old website had been\nconfigured.\n17\n\nSimilar to Re Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5 (“Tutor City”), the\n\nOrganisation also did not:\n(a)\n\ncommunicate any specific security requirements to the\nDeveloper to protect the personal data stored on the Server;\n\n(b)\n\nmake reasonable effort to find out and understand the security\nmeasures implemented by the Developer for the Website;\n\n(c)\n\nattempt to verify that the security measures implemented had\nindeed\n\n“respect[ed]\n\nand\n\nprotect[ed]\n\nthe\n\nprivacy\n\nand\n\nconfidentiality of all the data that is present on the Website” to\nthe extent expected by the Organisation; and\n\n(d)\n\n18\n\nconduct any reasonable security testing (e.g. penetration tests).\n\nTo be clear, the lack of knowledge on the PDPA or expertise in the area\n\nof IT security is not a defence against the failure to take sufficient steps to\ncomply with section 24 of the PDPA. There were resources, including the\nguides published by the Commission, and skilled personnel available that the\nOrganisation could have relied on to increase its knowledge in the relevant areas\nor to assist it in complying with its obligations under the PDPA.\n\n19\n\nRelated to the above, I note that the Organisation’s purported instruction\n\nto the Developer to “respect and protect the privacy and confidentiality of all\nthe data that is present on the Website” does not constitute a security measure.\nThe Organisation should have reviewed the security standard implemented on\n\n7\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nthe Website and provided its Developer the intended use cases and identify\nforeseeable risks.3\n\n20\n\nMore generally, although the Organisation asserted that it had provided\n\nverbal instructions to the Developer (see [7] above), these have not been\nsubstantiated by any evidence. According to the document entitled “Project\nScope” entered into between the Organisation and the Developer, there was no\nspecification relating to the security arrangements that the Developer was\nrequired to design into the Website and its back-end system. The Organisation\nought to have entered into a written agreement with the Developer that clearly\nstated the standard of compliance that the Organisation expected its Website\nand Server to have with the PDPA, and the Developer’s responsibilities in this\nregard.\n\n21\n\nAs regards security testing, while the Organisation had conducted some\n\ntesting of the Website from the functionality perspective, i.e., to verify that\ncertificates of consenting tutors were disclosed on their profile pages, it did not\ncheck the profile pages of non-consenting tutors to ensure their certificates were\nnot disclosed. It also did not check if the Website contained any other\nvulnerabilities that posed a risk to the personal data hosted on the Server. Had\nthe Organisation done a proper security test, the lack of access controls for the\ncertificates hosted on the Image Directory and the unauthorised disclosure of\nthe certificates of non-consenting tutors on their profiles would have been\napparent. It would then have been able to take the necessary steps to rectify\nthese security issues. That said, I understand that the Organisation has, since the\nIncident, procured the Developer to conduct a penetration test and resolve the\nhigh risk issues identified by it.\n3\n\nRe Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5 at [18]\n\n8\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n22\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nAs regards the lack of access controls, it has been observed in Tutor City\n\n(at [21] to [23]) that technical measures are available that prevent indexing of\nimages by web crawlers: viz,\n\n23\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the Organisation could have placed these\ndocuments in a folder of a non-public folder/directory.\n\n(b)\n\nSecond, the Organisation could have placed these\ndocuments in a folder of a non-public folder or directory,\nwith access to these documents being through web\napplications on the server.\n\n(c)\n\nThird, the Organisation could have placed these\ndocuments in a sub-folder within the Public Directory\nbut control access to files by creating a .htaccess file\nwithin that sub-folder. This .htaccess file may specify the\naccess restrictions (e.g. implement a password\nrequirement or an IP address restriction).\n\nIn view of the above, I find the Organisation in breach of section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA.\n\nRole of the Developer\n\n24\n\nThe Developer’s role in data migration constitutes “processing” within\n\nthe meaning of the PDPA. One of the causes for the breach of the protection\nobligation may be traced to the migration of educational certificates to the\nImage Directory which was publicly accessible and could be indexed by search\nengines: see discussion at [4] above. As the Developer is in, and supplied the\nServices from, the Philippines, I intend to refer this aspect of the case to the\nPhilippines National Privacy Commission.\n\n9\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nWhether the Organisation had breached section 12 of the PDPA\n\n25\n\nSection 12 of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop and\n\nimplement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet\nits obligations under the PDPA.\n\nAlthough the Organisation is a sole\n\nproprietorship with no employees, it collects a significant amount of personal\ndata from the tutors and clients seeking tuition services via the Website. As\nsuch, it is required to have an external data protection policy which sets out its\npractices relating to such personal data and the purposes for which the tutors’\nand students’ personal data are collected, used and disclosed by the\nOrganisation.\n26\n\nIn view of the Organisation’s admission that it had not developed and\n\nimplemented any such policies, I also find the Organisation in breach of section\n12 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n27\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made\n\nrepresentations to waive the imposition financial penalty for the following\nreasons:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation is a small home business which does not\ngenerate much revenue. If the proposed financial penalty is\nimposed, the Organisation would take 5 to 6 years to recover the\nfinancial penalty amount based on its annual revenue;\n\n(b)\n\nAs a sole proprietor, the Organisation’s director neglected\noperational duties of the business in order to assist the\n\n10\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nCommission with the investigations into the Incident. This\nresulted in a significant drop in the Organisation’s annual\nrevenue in 2018 and its revenue has yet to recover;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation incurred significant costs in undertaking\nremedial and preventive actions following the Incident;\n\n(d)\n\nThis is the first time a data breach involving the Organisation has\noccurred; and\n\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation compared the present case to Tutor City with\nsimilar facts where only a warning had been issued taking into\naccount the number of affected individuals, the type of and\nduration for which personal data was at risk, and the remedial\nactions taken.\n\n28\n\nWhile accepting full responsibility of its breach of Section 12, the\n\nOrganisation also asserted in its representations that based on the grounds of\ndecision of Tutor City, it “…implicitly understood that [Tutor City] also had no\npolicies and practices meeting the PDPA obligations set in place. However,\nthey were not found in breach of the Section 12”.\n\n29\n\nWith respect to the Organisation’s representations comparing the\n\npresent case to Tutor City, I would like to emphasize that my decision is based\non the unique facts of each case. While the facts may appear similar in 2 cases,\nmy decision in each case takes into consideration the specific facts of the case\nand the totality of the circumstances so as to ensure that the decision and\ndirection(s) are fair and appropriate for that particular organisation. In this\nregard, I would highlight that Section 12 of the PDPA was never an issue of\n\n11\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nconcern in Tutor City as the organisation in question did, in fact, have the\nrequisite policies and processes. Accordingly, this is not a point that would need\nto be reflected in Tutor City. Unlike Tutor City, I have decided that a financial\npenalty is warranted in this case because the Organisation has been found in\nbreach of Sections 12 and 24 of the PDPA, and there was a larger number of\nindividuals’ personal data at risk in the present case. I have also taken into\nconsideration the fact that the duration for which personal data was at risk in the\npresent case is significantly shorter than Tutor City.\n\n30\n\nHaving carefully considered the representations, I have decided to\n\nreduce the financial penalty to $1,000. The quantum of financial penalty has\nbeen calibrated after due consideration of the Organisation’s financial\ncircumstances and to avoid imposing a crushing burden on the Organisation.\nAlthough a lower financial penalty has been imposed in this case, the quantum\nof financial penalty should be treated as exceptional and should not be taken as\nsetting any precedent for future cases.\n\nOutcome\n\n31\n\nIn assessing the breaches and determining the directions to be imposed\n\non the Organisation in this case, I also took into account the following\nmitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation fully cooperated with the Commission’s\ninvestigations; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the effects of the\nbreaches and prevent reoccurrence of similar breaches.\n\n12\n\n\fAdvance Home Tutors\n\n32\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 35\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the present\n\ncase, I hereby direct the Organisation:\n\n(a)\n\nto put in place a data protection policy to comply with section 12\nof the PDPA within 60 days of this direction;\n\n(b)\n\nto inform the Commission within 7 days of implementing the\nabove; and\n\n(c)\n\nto pay a financial penalty of $1,000 within 30 days from the date\nof this direction failing which, interest at the rate specified in the\nRules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty\nuntil the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n13\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Amicus Solutions and a financial consultant were issued directions, including to pay financial penalties of $48,000 and $10,000 respectively, for breaches of the PDPA.

Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1610-B0290\n30 August 2019\n\n1\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint regarding the unauthorised collection and use of personal\ndata to market financial products. Investigations were commenced into the\nalleged unauthorised sale and disclosure of personal data by a data broker and\nthe unauthorised collection and use of the personal data for telemarketing\npurposes. Upon conclusion of investigations and consideration of the totality of\nevidence, the Commissioner found Amicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. (“Amicus”) and\nMr Ivan Chua Lye Kiat (“Mr Chua”) to be in breach of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) for the reasons set out in these grounds.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nAn independent life insurance brokerage company (the “Insurance\n\nBrokerage”) appointed Mr Chua as a financial adviser director to provide\nfinancial advisory services and to market financial products distributed by the\nInsurance Brokerage to prospective clients in accordance with the terms set out\nin a Financial Adviser Representative Agreement. He oversees a team of\nfinancial adviser representatives. Their main products are Eldershield related\ninsurance policies targeted at individuals over 40 years old.\n\n2\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n3\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nIt is undisputed that Mr Chua and the financial adviser representatives\n\nin his team are not employees of the Insurance Brokerage but independent\nagents. As independent agents, they receive a commission for each sale but are\nnot in an employer-employee relationship with the Insurance Brokerage nor are\nthey entitled to any employee benefits such as employer Central Provident Fund\ncontributions and/or medical benefits.\n4\n\nOne of Mr Chua’s primary roles as a financial adviser director is to seek\n\nout new customers. Mr Chua mainly relied on referrals from existing customers\nbut he also engaged telemarketers to make cold calls to potential customers.\nThese telemarketers are independently sourced with no assistance of or referrals\nfrom the Insurance Brokerage; telemarketers are directly engaged by Mr Chua\nor the financial adviser representatives in his team.\n5\n\nAmicus is an organisation that provides business and consultancy\n\nmanagement services and claims to be able to provide business opportunities\nand marketing plans with its database. It claims to have 1.8 million contacts\nwhich it markets as being in compliance with the PDPA and the Personal Data\nProtection (Do Not Call Registry) Regulations 2013. Aside from the sale of\ndata, Amicus also offers a range of services such as purchasing property\nownership information (including caveats) on behalf of property agents, data\nmining and Do Not Call (“DNC”) Registry scrubbing services.\n6\n\nDuring investigations, Mr Chua was upfront in admitting that he had\n\npurchased telemarketing leads from Amicus both before and after 2 July 2014,\nthe date when Parts III to VI of the PDPA (“Data Protection Provisions”) came\ninto effect (the “Appointed Day”). Mr Chua represented that before the\nAppointed Day, Amicus sold personal data (including the individual’s name,\nmobile number, gender and birthday) at S$0.50 to S$1.00 per record. After the\n\n3\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nAppointed Day, the products that were offered by Amicus changed. The\nprevious product was no longer offered but it now offered different products.\nFor Mr Chua’s commercial purposes, the product that he was interested in was\nthe sale of telephone numbers of individuals above 40 years old (which was his\nteam’s target demographic), each of which was sold for between S$0.01 to\nS$0.02.\n7\n\nMr Chua provided two datasets that he claimed to have purchased from\n\nAmicus after the Appointed Day. The information disclosed in these datasets\nare set out in the table below:\n\nInformation Disclosed\n\nList 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\nof\nrecords in the\nList\npartial NRIC number, i.e. 11,384\nthe first 4 digits (for some\nentries);\npartial date of birth (for\nthose that did not include a\npartial NRIC number);1\ngender; and\nmobile phone number\npartial NRIC number, i.e. 10,074\nthe first 4 digits (for some\nentries);\npartial date of birth;\ngender; and\nmobile phone number\n\n1\n\nAmicus admitted that the information it sold to Mr Chua included partial NRIC numbers (i.e.\nthe first 4 digits) but denied that the information contained the individuals’ date of birth.\n\n4\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n8\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nTelemarketers engaged by Mr Chua and his team relied on the\n\ninformation in these datasets to help generate leads and sales for the team by\nmaking cold calls to the individuals in the datasets. Mr Chua informed the\nCommission that Amicus had sold both Lists 1 and 2 to him and confirmed that\nhe did not purchase such lists from any other source at the time. While Amicus\nadmitted that it sold Mr Chua two datasets, it disputed Mr Chua’s account that\nboth Lists 1 and 2 were sold to him after the Appointed Day. By Amicus’\naccount, it only sold Mr Chua one dataset after the Appointed Day though it was\nunable to identify which of the two lists (i.e. Lists 1 and 2) it had sold to Mr\nChua.\n9\n\nAmicus also admitted to selling the following dataset to another\n\nindividual on another occasion after the Appointed Day at S$0.10 per record in\nthe course of the investigations:\n\nInformation Disclosed\n\nList 3\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\nage;\ngender; and\nmobile phone number\n\nNumber\nof\nrecords in the\nList\n1,200\n\nHowever, Amicus denied any wrongdoing in selling the datasets with\n\nthe type of personal data found in Lists 1, 2 and 3 (the “datasets”) as it\ncontended that the information in the datasets was not personal data to begin\nwith. It also argued that the information in the datasets was publicly available\ndata that it collected from public sources such as Government Gazettes and\nrecords of the Singapore Land Authority (“SLA”) and the Accounting and\nCorporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”), and the information in the datasets\n\n5\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nwas collected before the Data Protection Provisions came into effect on the\nAppointed Day.\n11\n\nDuring investigations, Amicus was unable to give a satisfactory\n\nexplanation regarding the source of the information in the datasets.\nInvestigations were not able to establish with any degree of certainty when the\nlists were compiled or obtained, nor where the lists were sourced from\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Mr L), who is in charge of the day-to-day operations\nof Amicus, gave evidence on behalf of Amicus and initially claimed that the\npersonal data was obtained from publicly available sources. However, he\nsubsequently claimed that the personal data was obtained from organisers of\nsurveys, meetings and seminars as well as call centres but was unable to name\nany of the seminars or meetings from which Amicus had purportedly collected\nthe information or the organisations that conducted the surveys or operated the\ncall centres when queried. Thereafter, he claimed that the personal data was\nobtained from telemarketing and Multi-Level Marketing (“MLM”) companies,\nthough he was again unable to name any of these companies, nor provide any\nproof of purchase. Finally, upon further questioning, Amicus represented that\nthe information in the datasets was actually collected before the Appointed Day.\nHe confirmed that he did not collect personal data found in the datasets from\npublicly available sources.\nNumber of datasets sold\n12\n\nAs a preliminary issue, while Amicus and Mr Chua disagreed over the\n\nnumber of datasets that Amicus sold Mr Chua after the Appointed Day2, an\n\n2\n\nSee paragraph 8 above.\n\n6\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nevaluation of the evidence in its entirety shows Mr Chua’s evidence to be more\ncredible for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nMr Chua offered the two lists that he claimed to have purchased\nfrom Amicus after the Appointed Day even though it was to his\ndetriment. The Commission had commenced investigations on\nthe basis of information provided by a complainant who had\nrequested for anonymity. At the time Mr Chua volunteered the\ntwo lists, he was only aware that a complaint had been made\nagainst him but was not aware of the information which was\nprovided to the Commission. Hence, the fact that he volunteered\ninformation that he knew could be detrimental to himself spoke\nto his openness and willingness to cooperate with investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nalthough both lists were not dated and he was unable to produce\nany receipts, Mr Chua was able to produce a screenshot of an\nemail dated 22 March 2016 containing List 1 from one\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Mr N) from Amicus;\n\n(c)\n\nboth Lists 1 and 2 only contain partial NRIC numbers, partial\ndate of births, gender and mobile phone numbers. They did not\ncontain names of the individuals. The evidence is that Amicus\nonly started selling lists without names after the PDPA came into\neffect. Before the PDPA came into effect they sold lists with full\nnames and these lists were more valuable than those sold after\nthe PDPA came into effect. Given that Lists 1 and 2 do not\ncontain full names, it is more likely than not that both these lists\nwere sold after the PDPA came into effect; and\n\n7\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n(d)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nMr Chua was very cooperative throughout the investigation and\nthere was no evidence to suggest that he had been anything less\nthan forthcoming.\n\n13\n\nIn contrast, as described in paragraph 11 above, Amicus had\n\nprevaricated during investigations and was unable to give a satisfactory\nexplanation regarding the source of the information in the datasets and was\nunable to provide any documentary evidence on the dates Lists 1 and 2 were\nsold. Further, Amicus appeared to have intentionally limited the documentary\ntrail in respect of the sale of Lists 1 and 2. According to Mr Chua, despite\nallowing its clients, including Mr Chua, to pay for its DNC scrubbing services\nby cheque, Amicus required cash payment for the lists. Amicus confirmed that\nit required Mr Chua to pay cash. It is suspicious that a company that has two\ncommercial transactions with the same customer will allow payment for one by\ncheque but require payment by cash for the other. This conduct is less than\nstraightforward. The reason provided by Amicus for requiring cash payment\nwas that Amicus needed Mr Chua to verify the data in person. The reason\nprovided does not in any way explain why Amicus could not accept cheque\npayments from Mr Chua when he collected the lists in person.\n14\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the following assessment is based on Mr\n\nChua’s evidence that Amicus had sold him two datasets (i.e. Lists 1 and 2) after\nthe Appointed Day.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n15\n\nThe issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the information disclosed in the Lists constituted\npersonal data;\n8\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nwhether Amicus had collected, used and/or disclosed personal\ndata without consent and/or notification; and\n\n(c)\n\nwhether Mr Chua used and/or disclosed the personal data without\nconsent and/or notification.\n\nWhether the information disclosed constituted personal data\n16\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” to be data, whether\n\ntrue or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from\nthat data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\naccess.\n17\n\nThe information disclosed in all three datasets are as follows:\nInformation Disclosed\n\nList 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList 2\n\n\n\n\nNumber\nof\nentries in the\nList\n\npartial NRIC number, i.e. 11,384\nthe first 4 digits (for some\nentries);\npartial date of birth (for\nthose that did not include a\npartial NRIC number);3\ngender; and\nmobile phone number\npartial NRIC number, i.e. 10,074\nthe first 4 digits (for some\nentries);\npartial date of birth;\n\n3\n\nAmicus admitted that the information it sold to Mr Chua included partial NRIC numbers (i.e.\nthe first 4 digits) but denied that the information contained the individuals’ date of birth.\n\n9\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\nList 3\n\n18\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\n\n\n\ngender; and\nmobile phone number\n\n\n\n\n\nage;\ngender; and\nmobile phone number\n\n1,200\n\nAs mentioned at paragraphs 11 and 12 above, although Amicus admitted\n\nthat it sold datasets containing individuals’ mobile phone numbers, age range\nand gender, it contended that no personal data was disclosed in the datasets\nbecause it was “sufficiently anonymised”. The datasets did not disclose the\nindividual’s name, NRIC number, address or any unique personal information\nbut only included truncated NRIC numbers (i.e. only the first 4 digits) and dates\nof birth (i.e. only the month and year of birth).\n19\n\nThere are certain types of information that are unique identifiers, which\n\nare capable of identifying an individual in and of themselves. The Advisory\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA sets out a non-exhaustive list of\ninformation that the Commission generally considers to be unique identifiers (at\n[5.10]):\n(a)\n\nFull name;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number or FIN (foreign identification number);\n\n(c)\n\nPassport number;\n\n(d)\n\nPersonal mobile telephone number;\n\n(e)\n\nFacial image of an individual (e.g. in a photograph or video\n\nrecording);\n\n10\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n20\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\n(f)\n\nVoice of an individual (e.g. in a voice recording);\n\n(g)\n\nFingerprint;\n\n(h)\n\nIris image; and\n\n(i)\n\nDNA profile.\n\nIn Re My Digital Lock Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 3 (at [11]), the\n\nCommission observed that information will generally only be considered to be\na unique identifier if there is a one-to-one relationship between the information\nand the individual, i.e. the information is not typically associated with more than\none individual:\nThere are certain types of information that in and of\nthemselves are capable of identifying an individual. The\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised on\n27 July 2017) (“Key Concepts Guidelines”) at [5.10] provides a\nlist of information that is considered to be capable of doing so.\nWhile such information is capable of identifying an\nindividual, it does not necessarily mean that anyone in\npossession of the information will be able to do so. The\ntouchstone used to compile the list is the one-to-one\nrelationship of the information and the individual.\nInformation on the list is not typically associated with more\nthan one individual, either scientifically (eg biometric signature\nand DNA profile), by convention (eg NRIC number) or as a\nmatter of social norms (eg personal mobile phone number).\n[Emphasis added.]\n21\n\nThe lists were sold for the purpose of generating leads for the sale of\n\nEldershield and other personal insurance policies. A natural inference is that the\nmobile numbers in the lists were personal mobile numbers. As a personal\nmobile phone number is generally tied to an individual subscriber who uses it\n\n11\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nas his/her individual contact number to the exclusion of others, it is prima facie\npersonal data given its one-to-one relationship.\n22\n\nThe “redacted” or truncated NRIC numbers in the datasets do not\n\nconform to the Commission’s published advisory guidelines on redaction of\nNRIC numbers which are designed to minimise the risk of re-identification. On\nthe contrary, the key piece of information that the “redacted” NRIC number was\nintended to convey was the age of the person that it is associated with given that\nit is well known that the first 4 digits of the NRIC discloses the year of\nregistration (and accordingly, the age) of the individual. It is trite that NRIC\nnumbers are the same as Birth Certificate numbers that are assigned upon\nregistration of birth, which has to take place within x days/weeks of birth.\nHence, there was every intention to convey information about the year of birth\nof the individual associated with the personal mobile phone number.\n23\n\nAccordingly, although the information disclosed in the datasets did not\n\ninclude the names of the individuals, the information is still personal data as\ndefined in section 2(1) of the PDPA because the individuals in List 1 and 2 were\nidentifiable directly or indirectly through their year of birth and personal mobile\nnumbers.\n24\n\nLikewise, the individuals in List 3 were directly identifiable through\n\ntheir personal mobile phone numbers.\nWhether the Organisations breached section 13 and/or section 20 of the PDPA\n25\n\nAs the PDPA defines “organisation” to include “any individual,\n\ncompany, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”, each of\nMr Chua and Amicus is an organisation under the PDPA. As mentioned in Re\n\n12\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nSpring College International [2018] SGPDPC 15 (at [10]), the PDPA adopts a\nconsent-first regime and the concepts of notification of purpose and consent are\nclosely intertwined. Pursuant to section 13 of the PDPA, unless an exception to\nconsent is applicable, organisations are generally required to obtain the consent\nof an individual before collecting, using and/or disclosing the individual’s\npersonal data (“Consent Obligation”). Consent must be obtained from the\nindividual with reference to the intended purpose of the collection, use or\ndisclosure of the personal data. The organisation’s collection, use and disclosure\nof personal data are limited to the purposes for which notification has been made\nto the individuals concerned. In this regard, organisations have an obligation\nunder section 20 of the PDPA to inform individuals of the purposes for which\ntheir personal data will be collected, used and/or disclosed, on or before\ncollecting the personal data in order to obtain consent (“Notification\nObligation”).\n26\n\nAs observed in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at\n\n[13]), the buying and selling of leads that comprise personal data of individuals\nare activities that fall under the scope of the PDPA:\nThe PDPA governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal\ndata by organisations. Given that the leads which the Respondent\nhad purchased or sold comprised of personal data of individuals,\nthese were activities that fell under the scope of the PDPA. In\nrespect of the purchase of leads by the Respondent, in which\nthe Respondent acquired personal data from the seller of the\ntransaction, this amounted to a “collection” of personal data\nunder the PDPA by the Respondent. In respect of the sale of\nleads by the Respondent, in which the Respondent provided\npersonal data to the buyer of the transaction, this amounted\nto a “disclosure” of personal data under the PDPA by the\nRespondent.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n13\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nAmicus\n27\n\nAs the organisation with possession and control in respect of the\n\npersonal data in the datasets that it compiled and sold, Amicus has a duty to\ncomply with the data protection obligations under the PDPA, specifically the\nConsent and Notification Obligations. However, Amicus contended that it was\nnot necessary for it to obtain consent or to notify individuals before selling the\ndatasets because, among other things4:\n(a)\n\nthe information was collected before the Consent and\nNotification Obligations came into force; or\n\n(b)\n28\n\nthe information was publicly available.\n\nAs stated above, Amicus had been prevaricating during investigations\n\nwithout providing a clear and consistent explanation as to when and how the\npersonal data in the Lists were obtained, nor their source. Taking its case at the\nhighest, the following analysis takes each of these possible defences separately\nas each, if successful, can stand independently.\nPersonal data collected before the Appointed Day\n29\n\nOne of Amicus’ main defences was that the information in the datasets\n\nwas collected before the Data Protection Provisions came into force and Amicus\nwas therefore not subject to the Consent and Notification Obligations in relation\nto the personal data that it collected, used and/or disclosed. Section 19 of the\nPDPA allows organisations to continue to use personal data collected before the\n\n4\n\nAmicus also argued that it was not required to obtain consent and notify the individuals before\nselling the datasets because the information contained in the datasets are not personal data. We\nrefer to our findings on this issue at paragraphs [18] to [24] above.\n\n14\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nAppointed Day for the same purposes for which the personal data was collected\nwithout obtaining fresh consent, unless consent for such use is withdrawn. As\nsuch, it may be possible for an organisation to continue using personal data that\nwas purchased or obtained before the Appointed Day without consent or\nnotification if such use falls within the purposes of collection, provided that\nthere was no indication that the individual did not consent to the continued use5.\n30\n\nHowever, section 19 of the PDPA only covers the use of personal data\n\ncollected before the Appointed Day and not the disclosure of personal data. As\nwas held in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang (at [22] and [23]), the\ngrandfathering provision in section 19 of the PDPA would not apply to instances\nwhere the organisation had been selling personal data before the Appointed\nDay, and continued to sell personal data after the Appointed Day:\nHowever, in this case, the Respondent went beyond using the\npersonal data for her own telemarketing purposes, and proceeded\nto sell personal data to third parties. The “grandfathering”\nprovision only permits the continued “use” of personal data for\nthe purposes for which the personal data was collected. Such\n“use” does not extend to “disclosure” of personal data unless, as\nset out at paragraph 23.1 of the Advisory Guidelines, the\ndisclosure “is necessarily part of the organisation’s use of such\npersonal data”. In the case of the sale of personal data, the\ndisclosure of personal data is the main activity being carried\nout, and is not incidental to any of the organisation’s own uses\nof the personal data. Thus, it is not a disclosure “that is\nnecessarily part of the organisation’s use of such personal\ndata”. The Commission has stated this position in its Advisory\nGuidelines as an example:\nOrganisation XYZ has been selling databases containing\npersonal data. This would be considered a disclosure of\n\n5\n\nRe Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang (at [20])\n\n15\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\npersonal data and not a reasonable existing use under\nsection 19. After the appointed day, XYZ needs to ensure\nthat consent has been obtained before selling these\ndatabases again.\n[Emphasis added.]\nConsequently, the grandfathering provision would not apply\nto the instances where the Respondent had been selling\npersonal data before the Appointed Day, and continued to sell\npersonal data after the Appointed Day. In respect of personal\ndata that was not sold before the Appointed Day, it is all the more\nso that the Respondent cannot rely on the grandfathering\nprovision, because there was never an existing practice of selling\nthe personal data in the first place, and hence there is no “use” to\nbe carried on in respect of the personal data.\n[Emphasis added.]\n31\n\nMoreover, even if Amicus had collected the personal data before 2 July\n\n2014, that permitted it to disclose by way of sale, it would have had to obtain\nfresh consent for such purposes of disclosure after the Appointed Date. Needless\nto say, Amicus was not able to provide evidence of either during the course of\ninvestigations. As mentioned at paragraph 11 above, Amicus was unable to\nsatisfactorily explain the source of the personal data in the datasets. During the\ncourse of the investigation, Amicus first claimed that the information was\ncollected from surveys, meetings and seminars, but subsequently represented\nthat it was collected from telemarketing and MLM companies. Nevertheless,\neven if the individuals had provided their personal data during surveys or at\nmeetings and seminars, or even if the personal data was collected from\ntelemarketing or MLM companies, Amicus did not provide any evidence that\nthe individuals concerned had provided fresh consent after the Appointed Date\nfor their personal data to be disclosed by way of sale to telemarketers. In this\nregard, Amicus acknowledged that it could have sought consent given that it\n\n16\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\npossessed the individuals’ full NRIC numbers and personal mobile phone\nnumbers but conceded that it did not do so.\n32\n\nIn the circumstances, there was a clear breach of the Consent and\n\nNotification Obligations under the PDPA in respect of Amicus’ sale of the\ndatasets containing personal data after the Appointed Day.\nPublicly available exception\n33\n\nThe alternate defence that Amicus raised during the investigations, but\n\nwhich it subsequently dropped, was that the information in the datasets was\npublicly available information obtained from public sources, such as records of\nregistered doctors, lawyers and engineers published on Government Gazettes,\nand records from SLA and ACRA. The PDPA sets out an exception for the\ncollection, use and disclosure of personal data that is publicly available.6\nHowever, by Amicus’ own admission, the Government Gazettes only contained\nthe names and organisations of certain individuals, which did not form part of\nthe information that was found in the datasets it sold after the Appointed Day.\nRepresentations by Amicus and an affiliated company\n34\n\nAmicus and an affiliated company, Ilied.com Pte. Ltd. (“Ilied”),\n\nsubmitted written representations to the Commission (the “Representations”)\nafter Amicus received a copy of the Preliminary Decision. The Representations\nwere signed off by Mr L. In the Representations, Ilied and Amicus raised the\nfollowing three points:\n\n6\n\nParagraph 1(c) of the Second Schedule to the PDPA; paragraph 1(c) of the Third Schedule to\nthe PDPA; and paragraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule to the PDPA.\n\n17\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\n(a)\n\nIlied was the organisation that sold the datasets, and not Amicus;\n\n(b)\n\nList 1 was transacted before the Appointed Day; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe datasets did not contain personal data as they had been\n\ntruncated and anonymised, and further, that personal mobile phone\nnumbers are not personal data per se.\nThe identity of the organisation which sold the datasets\n35\n\nThe Representations enclosed two invoices issued by Ilied in support of\n\nthe assertion that it was Ilied which had sold the data (the “Invoices”). The first\nInvoice, for the sum of $1,900, was dated 25 June 2014 and was issued for\n“Leads Born 1973, 1975”. The second Invoice, for the sum of $1,138, was dated\n22 March 2016 and was issued for “Data Sales”.\n36\n\nIlied is an affiliate of Amicus and together with Amequity Solutions Pte\n\nLtd (“Amequity”), are part of a group of closely related companies managed\nby Mr L, with some of the shareholders and directors being common across the\nsaid affiliated companies.\n37\n\nThe Commission has reviewed the Representations and the additional\n\nevidence and finds that on a balance of probabilities, Amicus sold the data.\n38\n\nIlied attempted to use the Invoices as incontrovertible proof that it was\n\nIlied, and not Amicus, which had sold the datasets. However, Mr L, Mr N and\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Ms J), the Director and shareholder of Amicus, Ilied\nand other affiliated companies, stated in their statements to the Commission that\nAmicus, Ilied and all affiliated companies operated as a single entity, with no\nclear demarcation between the companies. The entire group of companies was,\n\n18\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nin effect, headed by Mr L. Ilied individually had no real function but was merely\nused “for receipt purpose”7 and it did not even have a bank account.8 The facts\nsuggest that Ilied’s issuance of the Invoices was merely an administrative\narrangement and that Ilied, in fact, did not engage in data sales.\n39\n\nFurthermore, Amicus’ vacillation in its responses to the Commission\n\nalso suggests that Amicus’ new claim that Ilied was the data seller should be\ntreated with circumspection. As noted at paragraph 52(d) below, Amicus was\ninconsistent in its responses and kept changing its account of the facts. In\nparticular, Amicus provided inconsistent accounts on the source of the personal\ndata, initially claiming that it was collected from publicly available sources,\nsubsequently claiming that it was collected from surveys, meetings and\nseminars, and finally claiming that it was collected from telemarketing and\nMLM companies. Amicus was also inconsistent in its statements concerning\nAmequity. Amicus stated in the Representations that Amequity “is not into data\nbusiness, but credit collection by banks”. However, in the same\nRepresentations, Amicus also stated that one of the lists of personal data, dated\n5 March 2014, had been sold by Amequity.\n40\n\nAmicus, through its representatives Mr N and Mr L, admitted initially\n\nthat it was Amicus that sold the datasets. This was corroborated by Mr Chua.\nMr N explained Ilied’s issuance of the receipt by stating that Ilied, like\nAmequity, had no real function but was used for “receipt purpose”. Mr L also\nadmitted in his statement given on 3 February 2017 that “data selling is purely\n\n7\n\nMr N’s statement dated 30 April 2019.\n\n8\n\nMr L’s statement dated 30 April 2019.\n\n19\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\ndone by Amicus”. There is no reason to distrust the consistent evidence of all\nthree individuals, reflected in separate statements recorded at different times.\n41\n\nAmicus subsequently tried to explain this away by saying that Mr L’s\n\nstatement referred to above at paragraph 40 were made “with reference to the\nbusiness done by Amicus vis-à-vis Amequity”, and that “the term Amicus was\nused loosely to refer to company that do data sales [sic]”. Amicus further\nclaimed that it had “confused itself” to be the seller because the Commission’s\nNotice to Require Production of Documents and Information (“NTP”) was\naddressed to it. If it was true that both Amicus and Ilied engaged in data selling,\nthis would have been operative on Mr L’s mind when answering the NTP and\nat the very least raised the possibility that it may have been Ilied which sold the\ndata instead, earlier in the investigations. The fact that all three individuals, Mr\nN, Mr L and Mr Chua, were consistent in omitting to mention Ilied during the\ninvestigations shows that it was only Amicus that was engaged in data sales.\nThe reasonable explanation is that while the invoices may have been issued by\nother companies affiliated to Amicus, such as Ilied or Amequity, it was Amicus\nthat in fact engaged in data sales and Ilied and Amequity’s part in the\narrangement was to merely issue invoices.\n42\n\nFor the above reasons, it is more likely than not that Amicus sold the\n\ndata to Mr Chua. Accordingly, the assertion in the Representations that it was\nIlied which had sold the data cannot be accepted.\nDate of transaction for List 1\n43\n\nIlied claimed that the first Invoice was a receipt for List 1, and as the\n\nfirst Invoice was dated 25 June 2014, List 1 was transacted before the Appointed\nDay. However, it is unlikely that the first Invoice was a receipt for List 1. The\n\n20\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nquantity reflected on the first Invoice is 19,000, whereas the quantity of records\nin List 1 was 11,384. On the facts, it is more likely that List 1 was transacted on\n22 March 2016, i.e. after the Appointed Day, for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nAs noted at paragraph 12(b) above, Mr Chua was able to produce\n\na screenshot of an email from Mr N, containing List 1. The email was\ndated 22 March 2016, which was the same as the date on the second\nInvoice;\n(b)\n\nThe second Invoice, which was dated 22 March 2016, was more\n\nlikely to be the receipt for List 1;\n(c)\n\nMr N corroborated in his statement that List 1 was sold on\n\n22 March 2016;\n(d)\n\nList 1 contained personal data of individuals born in 1976\n\nwhereas the first Invoice was issued for “Leads Born 1973, 1975”;\n(e)\n\nThe second Invoice reflected a quantity of 11,380, which was\n\ncloser to the quantity of records in List 1 than the quantity reflected in\nthe first Invoice; and\n(f)\n\nAs noted at paragraph 18 above, List 1 contained truncated\n\npersonal data. As noted in paragraph 45 below, the truncation had\napparently been done in an attempt to comply with the requirements of\nthe PDPA and, as such, List 1 was more likely to have been transacted\nafter the Appointed Day.\n44\n\nIn view of the above factors, the weight of the evidence points to the fact\n\nthat List 1 was transacted after the Appointed Day.\n\n21\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nWhether the datasets contained personal data\n45\n\nIn the Representations, Ilied claimed that it sought to comply with the\n\nrequirements of the PDPA by truncating and anonymising the personal data. As\nnoted at paragraph 22 above, the “redacted” or truncated NRIC numbers in the\ndatasets do not conform to the Commission’s published advisory guidelines on\nredaction of NRIC numbers. The “redacted” NRIC numbers were intended to,\nand did in fact, convey information about the year of birth of the individual\nassociated with the personal mobile phone number.\n46\n\nIlied further claimed in the Representations that its research showed that\n\nan individual’s mobile phone number is likely to be personal data as it may be\nuniquely associated with an individual, but stopped short of admitting that all\nmobile phone numbers were personal data. In this regard, Ilied has not raised\nany evidence or arguments to suggest that the personal mobile phone numbers\ndisclosed in the datasets were not personal data. As stated at paragraphs 19 to\n21 above, personal mobile numbers are prima facie personal data as they are\nunique identifiers.\nMr Ivan Chua\n47\n\nAs observed in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang (at [13]), the purchase\n\nof leads, in which the buyer acquired personal data from the seller of the\ntransaction amounts to a “collection” of personal data under the PDPA by the\nbuyer. It is not disputed that Mr Chua collected personal data when he bought\nthe Lists from Amicus and used the personal data to market his team’s financial\nproducts. By his own admission, the personal data was collected and used in\nbreach of the Consent and Notification Obligations. Mr Chua also admitted that\nwhile he received verbal assurance from Amicus that the information in the\n\n22\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\ndatasets was obtained from caveats and was “legal”, he did not probe further as\nto how, where and when Amicus obtained the personal data, or whether Amicus\nhad obtained consent and provided notification to the individuals concerned.\n48\n\nIn this regard, reference is made to the UK Information Commissioner’s\n\nOffice’s (“ICO”) decision in The Data Supply Company, where a data broker\nwas found to be in breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 for obtaining\ncustomer data from various sources and selling the data to third party\norganisations for the purposes of direct marketing. The individuals were not\ninformed that their personal data would be disclosed to the data broker, or the\norganisations to which the data broker sold the data on to, for the purpose of\nsending direct marketing text messages. The ICO issued a monetary penalty of\n£20,000 and gave the following guidance in the Monetary Penalty Notice (at\n[22] to [25]):\nData controllers buying marketing lists from third parties\nmust make rigorous checks to satisfy themselves that the\nthird party obtained the personal data fairly and lawfully,\nthat the individuals understood their details would be passed\non for marketing purposes, and that they have the necessary\nconsent.\nData controllers must take extra care if buying or selling a list that\nis to be used to send marketing texts, emails or automated calls.\nThe Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 20003\nspecifically require that the recipient of such communications has\nnotified the sender that they consent to receive direct marketing\nmessages from them. Indirect consent (ie consent originally given\nto another organisation) may be valid if that organisation sending\nthe marketing message was specifically named. But more generic\nconsent (eg marketing ‘from selected third parties’) will not\ndemonstrate valid consent to marketing calls, texts or emails.\nData controllers buying in lists must check how and when\nconsent was obtained, by whom, and what the customer was\n\n23\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\ntold. It is not acceptable to rely on assurances of indirect\nconsent without undertaking proper due diligence. Such due\ndiligence might, for example, include checking the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow and when was consent obtained?\nWho obtained it and in what context?\nWhat method was used – eg was it opt-in or opt-out?\nWas the information provided clear and intelligible? How\nwas it provided – eg behind a link, in a footnote, in a popup box, in a clear statement next to the opt-in box?\nDid it specifically mention texts, emails or automated\ncalls?\nDid it list organisations by name, by description, or was\nthe consent for disclosure to any third party?\nIs the seller a member of a professional body or accredited\nin some way?\n\nData controllers wanting to sell a marketing list for use in text,\nemail or automated call campaigns must keep clear records\nshowing when and how consent was obtained, by whom, and\nexactly what the individual was told (including copies of privacy\nnotices), so that it can give proper assurances to buyers. Data\ncontrollers must not claim to sell a marketing list with consent for\ntexts, emails or automated calls if it does not have clear records\nof consent. It is unfair and in breach of the first data protection\nprinciple to sell a list without keeping clear records of consent, as\nit is likely to result in individuals receiving noncompliant\nmarketing.\n[Emphasis added.]\n49\n\nWhile there is no uniform industry standard in relation to how a buyer\n\nshould verify whether the seller has obtained the consent of the individuals, the\npositions articulated by the ICO must be right. A reasonable person would likely\nundertake proper due diligence, such as seeking written confirmation that the\npersonal data sold was actually obtained via legal sources or means, or inquire\nfurther as to whether the individuals had provided their consent and were\n\n24\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nnotified of the disclosure, and if so, obtain a sample of such consent and\nnotification.\n50\n\nSimilarly, organisations that sell datasets should ensure that they obtain\n\nand maintain clear records of consent so that proper assurances can be given to\nbuyers.\nDirections\n51\n\nHaving found Amicus and Mr Chua to be in breach of sections 13 and\n\n20 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\nto give such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n52\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nAmicus, the following aggravating factors were taken into account:\n(a)\n\nthe personal data disclosed included NRIC numbers which\nconstitute personal data of a sensitive nature;\n\n(b)\n\nAmicus profiteered from the sale of personal data. It admitted\nthat it sold the personal data to others besides Mr Chua;\n\n(c)\n\nAmicus was unhelpful and was not forthcoming in its responses\nto the Commission during the investigation; and\n\n(d)\n\nAmicus was inconsistent in its responses and kept changing its\naccount of the facts.\n\n53\n\nThe following aggravating and mitigating factors were taken into\n\naccount in assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\nMr Chua:\n\n25\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nAggravating factors\n(a)\n\nthe personal data was purchased with the intention to market\ngoods and services to individuals for financial gain; and\n\nMitigating factors\n(b)\n\nMr Chua had cooperated fully with the investigation and played\nan important and integral role in the investigation. He was\nforthcoming and admitted to his wrongdoing at the first instance.\n\n54\n\nThere are strong policy reasons for taking a hard stance against the\n\nunauthorised sale of personal data, which were set out in Re Sharon Assya\nQadriyah Tang (at [30]):\nThe Commissioner likewise takes a serious view of such\nbreaches under the PDPA. There are strong policy reasons\nfor taking a hard stance against the unauthorised sale of\npersonal data. Amongst these policy reasons are the need to\nprotect the interests of the individual and safeguard against\nany harm to the individual, such as identity theft or nuisance\ncalls. Additionally, there is a need to prevent abuse by\norganisations in profiting from the sale of the individual’s\npersonal data at the individual’s expense. It is indeed such\ncases of potential misuse or abuse by organisations of the\nindividual’s personal data which the PDPA seeks to safeguard\nagainst. In this regard, the Commissioner is prepared to take such\nstern action against organisations for the unauthorised sale of\npersonal data.\n[Emphasis added.]\n55\n\nThe profiting from sale of personal data by organisations without\n\nconsent of individuals is the kind of activity which the PDPA seeks to curb and\nwill be dealt with severely. In order to prevent abuse by organisations profiting\n\n26\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 33\n\nfrom the sale of personal data at the individual’s expense, the Commission may\ntake into account any profits from the unauthorised sale of personal data in\ncalculating the appropriate financial penalty to be imposed.\n56\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the following\n\ndirections are made:\nTo Amicus:\n(a)\n\nto pay a financial penalty of $48,000 (including $2,900 for the\nprofit made from the sale of Lists 1 and 2) within 30 days from\nthe date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of\nsuch financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full;\n\n(b)\n\nto cease the disclosure (sale) of the personal data of all the\nindividuals immediately;\n\n(c)\n\nto cease the retention of the said personal data within seven (7)\ndays from the date of the Commissioner’s direction, to the extent\nthat such personal data was collected and/or disclosed in breach\nof the PDPA; and\n\n(d)\n\nto submit a written confirmation to the Commission by no later\nthan 1 week after each of the above directions in (b) and (c) have\nbeen carried out.\n\nTo Mr Ivan Chua:\n\n27\n\n\fAmicus Solutions Pte.

Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fO2 Advertising Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 32\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1807-B2376\n28 August 2019\n\nBackground\n1\n\nAn individual found certain of his personal data accessible over the\n\nInternet without his consent. In particular, the individual found that when he\nconducted a search on Google using his name and National Registration\nIdentification Card (“NRIC”) number, the search results included a URL link\n(the “URL Link”) to a database maintained by O2 Advertising Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”). The database contained the personal data of numerous\nindividuals including the individual’s (the “Affected Individuals”). On 10 July\n2018, the individual lodged a complaint with the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (“Commission”) over the incident.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation provides advertising and marketing services in\n\nSingapore. In 2015, the Organisation collected the Affected Individuals’\npersonal data during an advertising campaign conducted on behalf of one of its\nclients. The Organisation stored the collected personal data in two databases.\n\n1\n\n\fO2 Advertising Pte. Ltd.\n\n3\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 32\n\nThe incident resulted in the following types of personal data of the\n\nAffected Individuals being either exposed to unauthorised access or at risk of\nunauthorised access (the “Disclosed Data”) depending on which database the\nDisclosed Data was stored in:\n\n4\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nemail address;\n\n(d)\n\nresidential address;\n\n(e)\n\ngender;\n\n(f)\n\ndate of birth;\n\n(g)\n\nmobile number;\n\n(h)\n\nage; and\n\n(i)\n\nskin type.\n\nThe Disclosed Data of 403 Affected Individuals was stored in one\n\ndatabase (“Database A”) and exposed to unauthorised access through the URL\nLink found by the complainant. The Disclosed Data of 1,165 Affected\nIndividuals was stored in another database (“Database B”) which was at risk of\nunauthorised access. This was because after accessing Database A using the\nURL Link, a party with knowledge of how to navigate the root directory could\npossibly gain access to Database B. In addition, there was a risk of unauthorised\naccess to 2 php files found in a directory containing user names and passwords\nto the Organisation’s email system and another database (“Exposed\n\n2\n\n\fO2 Advertising Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 32\n\nCredentials”). Using the same URL Link, a party with knowledge of how to\nnavigate the root directory could also possibly gain access to the Exposed\nCredentials.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n5\n\nThe issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation breached the Protection Obligation\n\nunder section 24 of the PDPA;\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation complied with its Retention\n\nLimitation Obligation under section 25 of the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nwhether the Organisation complied with its Accountability\n\nObligation under sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA\n6\n\nDatabases A and B which contained the Disclosed Data were maintained\n\nby the Organisation. Hence, the Organisation had possession and control of the\nDisclosed Data at all material times and therefore had an obligation to protect\nthem. Database A was in the Public_HTML directory of a server, and was not\nsecured with any form of access controls. This enabled internet search engines\nlike Google to index the URL Link to Database A, resulting in it showing up in\nsearch results. As stated above, this also exposed Database B to risk of\nunauthorised access. The Organisation asserted that the server hosting Database\nA and Database B was password protected. However, this was not a security\narrangement to restrict access to the databases which had been stored in the\nPublic_HTML directory.\n\n3\n\n\fO2 Advertising Pte. Ltd.\n\n7\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 32\n\nAs observed in Re Tutor City [2019] SGPDPC 5 (at [21] to [23]), there\n\nare a number of technical security measures that can be implemented to prevent\ndocuments from being indexed by web crawlers:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the Organisation could have placed these\ndocuments in a folder of a non-public folder/directory.\n\n(b)\n\nSecond, the Organisation could have placed these\ndocuments in a folder of a non-public folder or directory,\nwith access to these documents being through web\napplications on the server.\n\n(c)\n\nThird, the Organisation could have placed these\ndocuments in a sub-folder within the Public Directory\nbut control access to files by creating a .htaccess file\nwithin that sub-folder. This .htaccess file may specify the\naccess\n\nrestrictions\n\n(e.g.\n\nimplement\n\na\n\npassword\n\nrequirement or an IP address restriction).\n8\n\nSince its website went live over 5 years ago, the Organisation had not\n\nconducted any vulnerability scanning. The flaws in the security of its website\nthat had been discovered during investigations would have been revealed in a\nvulnerability scan. Had one been conducted, the Organisation would have been\nin a position to put in place reasonable security arrangements mentioned in the\npreceding paragraph.\n9\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\fO2 Advertising Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 32\n\nWhether the Organisation breached section 25 of the PDPA\n10\n\nUnder section 25 of the PDPA, an organisation is obliged to cease\n\nretaining personal data once the purpose for which the personal data was\ncollected has been served, unless further retention can be justified for legal or\nbusiness purposes. The Organisation admitted that it had overlooked deleting\nthe Disclosed Data and that there were no reasonable grounds to continue\nretaining them after the engagement with its client ceased in 2016. The\nDisclosed Data was only deleted by the Organisation after it was informed by\nthe Commission of the complaint. The Commissioner therefore finds the\nOrganisation in breach of section 25 of the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation breached sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA\n11\n\nSection 11(3) of the PDPA requires the Organisation to a data protection\n\nofficer; Section 12 of the PDPA imposes an obligation on organisations to\ndevelop and implement data protection policies and practices. The Organisation\nadmitted that at the material time, it did neither of these. In the circumstances,\nthe Commissioner finds that the Organisation failed to meet its obligations\nunder sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n12\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made\n\nrepresentations on the amount of financial penalty which the Commissioner\nintended to impose. In the beginning of 2016, the Organisation discovered it\nwas a victim of a fraud involving the misappropriation of company funds\namounting to approximately $3.2 million, resulting in massive retrenchment\nand significant cash flow issues for the Organisation. Consequently, the\n\n5\n\n\fO2 Advertising Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 32\n\nOrganisation’s financial performance for the past few years has been weak, and\nis currently in dire financial straits. The director is 72 years old and is the\nOrganisation’s sole employee since 1 March 2018.

Ltd.\n…Organisation(s)\n\nDECISION\n\n\fExecutive Link Services Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\nMr Yeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner – Case No DP-1806-B2237\n\n23 August 2019\n\nBackground\n\n1.\n\nOn 11 June 2018, Executive Link Services Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”)\n\nreported a data breach to the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) concerning the unintended disclosure of personal data of\nindividuals that were stored on the Organisation’s server (“Incident”). The\nCommission investigated the Incident and determined that the Organisation had\nbreached its obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nMaterial facts\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation is an employment agency. Sometime before 8 June 2018,\n\none of the Organisation’s clients engaged a cybersecurity company to scan the\nInternet for information relating to the client. During this scan, the cybersecurity\ncompany was able to gain access and retrieve copies of draft contracts of job\ncandidates from the Organisation’s server. The Organisation was alerted on 8 June\n2018. In total, resumes of 367 individuals (the “Affected Individuals”) and around\n150 draft contracts relating to some of those individuals, together with the personal\ndata therein (the “Compromised Personal Data”), were exposed to unauthorised\ndisclosure in this manner.\n\n3.\n\nThe Compromised Personal Data included the following:\n\n\fRe Executive Link Services Pte Ltd\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\n\nthe individual’s name, address, contact number, email address(es),\neducation level, salary expectation and employment history (in\nrelation to the resumes); and\n\n(b)\n\nthe individual’s name, address and salary information (in relation to\nthe draft contracts).\n\nEvents leading to the Incident\n\n4.\n\nThe Organisation had implemented remote access for staff to access internal\n\nfiles stored on its data storage server. This required the use of a Virtual Private\nNetwork (“VPN”) service. The server was supplied by Blumm Technology Pte.\nLtd. (“Blumm”) and installed and set up by the Organisation’s information\ntechnology (“IT”) vendor, SShang Systems (“SShang”). SShang provided IT\nsupport services to the Organisation, eg upgrading and configuration of hardware,\nand general IT troubleshooting. When staff had difficulties with VPN access, the\nOrganisation approached SShang for assistance. SShang was, in turn, advised by\nBlumm to adopt a workaround, by opening and enabling file access through the\nserver’s file transport protocol (“FTP”) port (the “VPN Workaround”). Blumm\nalso advised SShang to password-protect the folders within the server after the FTP\nport was opened.\n\n5.\n\nWhen SShang implemented the VPN Workaround, it did not advise the\n\nOrganisation about password-protecting the folders on the server because it\nassessed that there was little or no risk of unauthorised access to the folders since\nremote access was limited to staff. Although the Organisation had only intended to\ntest the VPN Workaround for a few days, it was during this period that its client\ndiscovered the Compromised Personal Data on its server.\n\n3\n\n\fRe Executive Link Services Pte Ltd\n\n6.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\n\nIn the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Organisation also\n\nadmitted that it had not appointed a DPO and that it did not have any policies,\ninternal guidelines or procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of personal\ndata and other matters required under the PDPA.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nIssues for determination\n\n7.\n\nBased on the facts of the case, the issues to be determined are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligation to protect\npersonal data under section 24 of the PDPA; and\n\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with the obligations to\nappoint a data protection officer (“DPO”) and develop and implement\ndata protection policies and practices under sections 11(3) and 12\nrespectively of the PDPA;\n\nWhether the Organisation complied with its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA\n\n8.\n\nAt all material times, the Compromised Personal Data was in the\n\nOrganisation’s sole possession and control. SShang was engaged to provide IT\nsupport services but was not engaged to process personal data. Blumm supplied the\nserver and had assisted to open the server’s FTP port to enable the VPN\nWorkaround, but it was not engaged to process personal data. Hence, both SShang\nand Blumm were not data intermediaries. Hence, the responsibility to protect the\nCompromised Personal Data fell squarely and solely on the Organisation.\n\n4\n\n\fRe Executive Link Services Pte Ltd\n\n9.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\n\nThe question is whether the Organisation had failed to take reasonable steps\n\nto protect the Compromised Personal Data. It should be noted from the outset that\nthis was not a case involving a server hosting a website that was meant to be\naccessible on the World Wide Web. It was an internal server that was meant to be\naccessed by staff remotely through the Internet. There are subtle but significant\ndifferences between the two. A website on the World Wide Web is by its nature\nintended to be more easily linked from other websites, and to be discovered by\nsearch engines and directories. Remote access to a server via the Internet requires\nthe member of staff to use VPN software or know the precise Internet Protocol\n(“IP”) address. It is not usually crawled by online search engines. But that is not to\nsay that it cannot be discovered. It can be, by using the right tool to scan a known\nset of IP address range, as was done in this case by the cybersecurity company. The\nfootprint is smaller and the risk is lower, but that does not in any way mean that the\nrisk does not exist.\n\n10.\n\nThe Organisation did not have requisite IT knowledge and depended on its\n\noutsourced IT support services provider. Its duties as owner of the server and\ncontroller of the Compromised Personal Data include making its requirements\nknown to SShang and asking the right questions from the perspective of a business\nowner. It can rely on SShang’s technical know-how. In this case, the Organisation\nwas aware of the risks and had implemented VPN access for its staff. When there\nwere difficulties with the VPN access and SShang was called upon to troubleshoot,\nit was a natural and reasonable expectation that any workaround recommended\nwould not materially compromise its requirement for security. It is not unreasonable\nfor the Organisation to have expected that any such material deviation– particularly\nwhen the security level is lowered – would be drawn to its attention.\n\n11.\n\nOf course, the Organisation could have asked about the security of VPN\n\nWorkaround. But is it reasonable to expect this level of pedantry? I am mindful that\nwhen troubleshooting IT issues, there is a degree of urgency and need for speed to\nimplement workarounds, identify root causes and implement permanent solutions.\n\n5\n\n\fRe Executive Link Services Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\n\nIn these circumstances, the operating assumption should be that existing business\nrules continue to be relevant. However, I am of the view that since the VPN\nWorkaround touched on secured remote access, the Organisation could have sought\nclarification of the impact of the VPN Workaround on its requirements for security.\n\n12.\n\nIn this case, SShang had been advised by Blumm to enable password\n\nprotection. SShang had assessed that there was no need to do so as remote access\nwas limited to staff and there was little or no risk of unauthorised access to the\nfolders. We do not know what SShang would have informed the Organisation had\nthe Organisation sought clarification. However, even if SShang shared its\nassessment and maintained its advice that it was not necessary to enable password\nprotection, the Organisation would not have known better and would have relied on\nthe advice. In light of these circumstances, I am giving the Organisation the benefit\nof doubt and will not make a finding of breach of its protection obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under sections 11(3) and\n12 of the PDPA\n\n13.\n\nThe remaining two issues are straightforward. Section 11(3) of the PDPA\n\nrequires an organisation to designate one or more individuals to be responsible for\nensuring that the organisation complies with the PDPA. This individual is typically\nreferred to as the DPO. Further, section 12 of the PDPA requires organisation to\ndevelop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation\nto meet its obligations under the PDPA, and to communicate information about such\npolicies and practices to its employees (among other obligations). The importance\nof these requirements have been emphasized multiple times in previous decisions.1\n\n1\n\nSee Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [32]; Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n[2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37]; Re Singapore Taekwondo Federation [2018] SGPDPC 17 at [39]\nto [42]; Re AgcDesign Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 23 at [4] to [5].\n\n6\n\n\fRe Executive Link Services Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\n\nIn view of the Organisation’s admissions that it had not appointed a DPO\n\n14.\n\nand had not developed and implemented any policies, internal guidelines or\nprocedures on the collection, use and disclosure of personal data, I find the\nOrganisation in breach of sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\nRemedial Actions by the Organisation\n\n15.\n\nAfter being informed of the Incident by its client, the Organisation closed\n\nthe FTP port on the same day. The Organisation also took the following additional\nsteps:\n\na. Shut down the server permanently and replaced it with a new server;\n\nb. Installed a firewall for the new server and implemented access to the new\nserver via VPN, which requires the use of passwords (thereby limiting\naccess to the data stored on the server);\n\nc. Implemented password policies for its employees for the use of the VPN;\n\nd. Engaged a cyber-security firm to conduct a network vulnerability\nassessment on its new server, which found no vulnerabilities;\n\ne. Appointed a data protection officer;\n\nf. Drafted and implemented policies on the handling of personal data; and\n\ng. Provided data protection training for its employees.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n\n16.\n\nIn assessing the breach, I took into account the following mitigating factors:\n\n7\n\n\fRe Executive Link Services Pte Ltd\n\na.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 30\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission during its\ninvestigation and was prompt and forthcoming in its responses to\nqueries posed by the Commission;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation took swift and extensive remedial action following\nthe Incident;\n\nc.\n\nThe duration that the Compromised Personal Data was at risk was only\nfor a limited time period. The Organisation was alerted to the Incident\nonly a few days after the FTP port was opened to enable the VPN\nWorkaround, and the Organisation took swift action thereafter to\nremove such access; and\n\nd.\n\nThe VPN Workaround was only intended to be a temporary measure,\nand the Organisation had intended to revert back to the use of the VPN.\nThus, the potential for unauthorised disclosure of the Compromised\nPersonal data would have been limited in any event.\n\n17.\n\nHaving considered the facts of this case and the factors outlined above, I\n\nhereby direct the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $5,000 within 30 days\nfrom the date of this direction, failing which interest at the rate specified in the\nRules of Court2 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the\noutstanding amount of the financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n2\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Friends Provident International for failing to protect the personal data of its policyholders from unauthorised disclosure via its online portal.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Finance and Insurance"],"date":"2019-09-06","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Ground-of-Decision---Friends-Provident---300719.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Friends Provident International","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/09/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-friends-provident-international","timestamp":"2019-09-06","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 29\nCase No DP-1805-B2112\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nFriends Provident International Limited\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fFriends Provident International Limited\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner – Case No. DP-1805-B2112\n\n30 July 2019\n\nFacts of this Case\n\n1\n\nFriends Provident International Limited is a company established in the Isle of Man\n\nwhich provides life assurance services in Singapore through a registered branch office (the\n“Organisation”). In the course of providing these services, it operates and maintains an online\nportal (the “Portal”) through which its policyholders can request for changes to their\nparticulars, for example, contact details. On 10 May 2018, the Organisation notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach incident involving\nthe disclosure of certain personal data of policyholders obtained from the Portal. The\ncircumstances leading to the incident were as follows.\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation’s policyholders and certain other authorised personnel could access\n\nthe Portal via a “Secured Mailbox” webpage on the Organisation’s website (the “Secured\nMailbox Webpage”). Policyholders could, as noted above, submit certain requests via the\nPortal and the Organisation’s authorised personnel accessed the Portal in order to process these\nrequests. For this purpose, the Organisation’s authorised personnel could generate reports\ncontaining the data of policyholders who had made a request (“Reports”). These Reports were\nstored in the Portal and could be obtained thereafter by the Organisation’s authorised personnel.\n\n1\n\n\f3\n\nThe ability to generate and obtain Reports from the Portal was intended to be restricted\n\nto the Organisation’s authorised personnel. To achieve this, when a user logged in to the\nSecured Mailbox Webpage, the system would determine whether the user was one of the\nOrganisation’s authorised personnel or a policyholder. If the user was one of the authorised\npersonnel, a ‘Report’ tab would be displayed in the Secured Mailbox Webpage which enabled\nthe authorised personnel to generate and obtain Reports. The ‘Report’ tab was hidden from the\nview of policyholders when they accessed the Secured Mailbox Webpage. Apart from hiding\nthe ‘Report’ tab, no additional or separate authorisation was necessary in order to generate and\nobtain Reports from the Portal and there was no subsequent verification (after the user logged\nin) as to whether the user was, in fact, authorised to generate and obtain the Reports via the\n‘Report’ tab.\n\n4\n\nAs a result of a faulty JavaScript within the Secured Mailbox Webpage, the ‘Report’\n\ntab was visible to policyholders when they re-sized their desktop internet browser to a smaller\nsize or if they accessed the Secured Mailbox Webpage via a mobile device. As no verification\nor separate authorisation was required to access the ‘Report’ tab and generate and obtain\nReports, such policyholders were able to generate and obtain Reports from the Portal once the\n‘Report’ tab was visible (collectively referred to as the “Vulnerability”).\n\n5\n\nThe exploitability of the Vulnerability, which had likely existed since 30 September\n\n2017 when the Secured Mailbox Webpage was introduced, was fortuitously resolved on 6\nFebruary 2018 when the Secured Mailbox Webpage was enhanced and backend verification\nwas included. Unfortunately, on 12 December 2017, one of the Organisation’s policyholders\ndiscovered that he could generate and obtain Reports from the Portal that contained the names,\npolicy numbers and regions of residence of other policyholders. He subsequently reported this\nto the Monetary Authority of Singapore which, in turn, notified the Organisation of the incident\n\n2\n\n\f(the “Reported Breach”). The Organisation had been unaware of the Vulnerability until they\nwere notified of the Reported Breach.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation subsequently determined that before the Vulnerability was fixed, 42\n\nReports had been produced and downloaded by 21 policyholders or their advisors. The total\nnumber of individuals affected by this was estimated to be 240, 11 of whom had their policy\nnumbers disclosed. After the Reported Breach, the Organisation undertook the following as\npart of its remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nreviewed the Portal to ensure that the Reports were no longer accessible by\nunauthorised personnel;\n\n(b)\n\nconducted an initial risk assessment and commenced an immediate\ninvestigation into the Reported Breach;\n\n(c)\n\nimposed a requirement that regression testing must be conducted for mobile\ndevices and different screen resolutions;\n\n(d)\n\nensured that backend access validation was in place on top of front-end\nvalidation;\n\n(e)\n\nensured that all employees received training on data protection upon\ncommencement of employment, which would be refreshed annually; and\n\n(f)\n\ncontacted the policyholder who had generated and downloaded Reports on 12\nDecember 2017 to ensure that he no longer held the Reports that he downloaded.\n\n3\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n7\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) requires\n\norganisations to protect personal data in their possession or under their control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure and similar risks.\nI find that the Organisation had not done so, and is in breach of section 24, for two main reasons:\nfirst, the manner in which the Organisation restricted access to the Reports was insufficient to\nprevent unauthorised access to the Reports and the personal data they contained and, secondly,\nthe testing of the Secured Mailbox Webpage was inadequate.\n\n8\n\nOn the first point, what is most striking in this case is the lack of an authorisation\n\nmechanism for access to the ability to generate and obtain Reports. Once a user gained access\nto the Secured Mailbox Webpage and could view the ‘Report’ tab (in the circumstances noted\nabove), no further authorisation or verification was required to generate and obtain Reports\nfrom the Portal via the ‘Report’ tab. The only means the Organisation employed to limit access\nto the Reports was to hide the ‘Report’ tab from the view of unauthorised persons. This was\ninsufficient as there could be various ways in which the hidden tab could be revealed, even\nwithout the faulty JavaScript, such as by manipulating the scripts or widgets running on the\nSecured Mailbox Webpage.\n\n9\n\nOn the second point, given that the Secured Mailbox Webpage was intended for use\n\nacross a variety of devices and screens, testing should have been conducted across multiple\nbrowsers and devices. While organisations are not expected to test across all possible browsers\nand devices, testing should have been done on representative devices (in the present case, with\ndifferent screen or browser sizes) based on the design and intended functionality of the Secured\nMailbox Webpage. The Organisation’s failure to do so meant that its testing was ultimately\ninadequate to address the risk of unauthorised access to the personal data in the Reports. In\n4\n\n\ffact, simply accessing the Secured Mailbox Webpage on a mobile device as part of its tests\nwould have revealed the Vulnerability to the Organisation. Additionally, organisations and\ndevelopers should note that the testing of other browser conditions such as script blocking,\nwhile not mandatory, is highly recommended. In the Organisation’s case, script blocking would\nalso have caused the ‘Report’ tab to become visible.\n\nOutcome\n\n10\n\nTaking the totality of the circumstances into account, I have decided to issue a warning\n\nto the Organisation for its contravention of section 24 of the PDPA. In reaching this conclusion,\nI note that:\n\n(a)\n\nthe potential for misuse of the personal data disclosed was relatively low because the\ndata was not of a nature where identity theft could be committed; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation had promptly notified the Commission and implemented remedial\nactions upon learning of the Reported Breach.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Avant Logistic Service for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of customers' personal data.

Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1802-B1709\n30 July 2019\nBackground\n\n1\n\nOn 25 November 2017, a customer of Ezbuy Holdings Ltd. (“Ezbuy”)\n\nmade a complaint to the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) alleging that her personal data had been disclosed to another\ncustomer of Ezbuy without her consent by an employee of Avant Logistic\nService Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”). The facts of this case are as follows.\n\n2\n\nEzbuy provides an online e-commerce platform that allows its\n\ncustomers to shop for items from various online retailers and platforms around\nthe world. It engaged the Organisation to provide delivery services in Singapore.\nThe Organisation is an affiliate of Ezbuy and its delivery personnel are required\nto adhere to Ezbuy’s Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions in Ezbuy’s\nEmployee Handbook and Ezbuy’s Delivery and Collection Standard Operation\nProcedure (“SOP”).\n\n3\n\nWhen a customer ordered an item through Ezbuy’s platform, they would\n\nbe offered two modes of delivery, (i) delivery to a designated collection point\n1\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\n(referred to by Ezbuy as “self-collection”), or (ii) delivery to the customer’s\naddress. If the customer opted for self-collection, the customer would proceed\nto the designated collection point at a specified time. The delivery personnel\nthere would verify their identity using their Ezbuy user ID or their mobile\nnumber registered with Ezbuy and then hand over the package with their item.\n\n4\n\nOn 9 November 2017, the complainant scheduled to self-collect a\n\npackage that she ordered from Ezbuy at a collection point in Bishan at around\n6.30 p.m. One of the Organisation’s employees (referred to in this Decision as\n“OA”), was assigned to distribute packages there that evening. When the\ncomplainant met OA at the collection point, he gave the complainant two\npackages (the “Packages”) after verifying her identity. The complainant noticed\nthat the Packages were not hers because they bore the user ID and mobile\nnumber of another person (referred to in this Decision as “CA”). According to\nthe complainant, she informed OA of this but was told to take the Packages as\nthey were tagged to her mobile number in the Ezbuy system. The complainant\nalso alleged that OA asked her to inform Ezbuy’s customer service that the\nwrong packages had been sent to her. The complainant then left the collection\npoint with the Packages.\n\n5\n\nCA arrived to collect the Packages shortly after the complainant left. OA\n\ninformed her that someone else had already collected the Packages and told her\n\n2\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nthat he would try to locate them and arrange for their subsequent delivery. At\nthis time, OA did not realise that it was the complainant who had collected the\nPackages.\n\n6\n\nLater that night, OA sent CA screenshots of two delivery lists containing\n\nEzbuy user IDs and mobile telephone numbers of some Ezbuy customers (the\n“Disclosed Data”). The first list that was sent contained the Ezbuy user IDs and\nmobile telephone numbers of eight Ezbuy customers who had been scheduled\nto collect their packages at Bukit Panjang. (This was apparently sent by\nmistake.) The second list contained the user IDs of four Ezbuy customers,\nincluding that of the complainant, who had been scheduled to collect their\npackages at Bishan. The telephone numbers in the second list were redacted by\nOA. However, OA also sent the complainant’s mobile telephone number to CA.\nOA explained to CA that he suspected that the complainant had collected the\nPackages because his records showed that the complainant had not collected her\nown packages.\n\n7\n\nCA eventually managed to find the complainant’s Facebook and\n\nInstagram pages using the complainant’s Ezbuy user ID as the complainant had\nused the same name (which was not her real name) for her Facebook, Instagram\nand Ezbuy user IDs. CA then sent a series of messages to the complainant via\n\n3\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nFacebook Messenger in order to recover the Packages. The complainant\nsubsequently returned the Packages to Ezbuy.\n\nRemedial actions by Ezbuy and the Organisation\n\n8\n\nAfter being informed of the incident by the Commission, Ezbuy and the\n\nOrganisation jointly undertook the following measures to prevent the\nunauthorised disclosure of customers’ personal data in the future:\n(a)\n\nAll delivery personnel are required to request for both a\n\ncustomer’s user ID and mobile telephone number for verification during\nthe self-collection process;\n\n(b)\n\nEzbuy’s Delivery and Collection SOP was updated to comply\n\nwith the provisions of the PDPA and to highlight the importance of the\nPDPA. In particular, a clause was added by Ezbuy stating that no\ncustomer information can be disclosed to any party under all\ncircumstances, and that any unauthorised disclosure will lead to\ndisciplinary action as listed in Ezbuy’s Employee Handbook;\n\n(c)\n\nA briefing was conducted to all delivery personnel to reinforce\n\nthe instruction and policy that no customer’s personal data should be\nprovided to any third party under all circumstances, and this briefing is\nrepeated to all delivery personnel every morning; and\n\n4\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n(d)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nEzbuy revised its Employee Handbook to include detailed\n\nenforcement and disciplinary actions to be taken for breach of\nconfidentiality and employee misconduct, including any leak or sale of\ncustomer data.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWas the Disclosed Data personal data?\n\n9\n\nAs a preliminary issue, I find that most of the Disclosed Data was\n\npersonal data within the meaning of the PDPA. The term “personal data” is\ndefined in section 2(1) of the PDPA as follows:\n“personal data” means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can\nbe identified –\n\n(a)\n\nfrom that data [“Direct Identification”]; or\n\n(b)\n\nfrom that data and other information to which the organisation has or\n\nis likely to have access [“Indirect Identification”].”\n\n10\n\nThe mobile telephone numbers disclosed by OA constitute personal data\n\nsince they enable Direct Identification of the respective individuals.

Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\ntelephone number is a ‘unique identifier’ and capable, on its own, of identifying\nthe individual.\n\n11\n\nOn the other hand, since Ezbuy user IDs do not enable Direct\n\nIdentification, whether they qualify as “personal data” depends on whether they\nenable Indirect Identification. In this case, CA was able to find the\ncomplainant’s Facebook and Instagram pages and identify her using the\ncomplainant’s Ezbuy user ID. The complainant’s Ezbuy user ID therefore\nconstitutes personal data under the PDPA, even though the user ID did not\ncontain complainant’s real name, as it enabled Indirect Identification of the\ncomplainant.\n\n12\n\nAlthough organisations cannot be expected to know in advance if the\n\nuser IDs of their customers enable Indirect Identification, they should not\nassume that user IDs per se do not constitute personal data as such an\nassumption may not, in fact, be true (as seen from this case). Organisations\nshould therefore exercise prudence in handling user IDs. As there is no evidence\nthat the other Ezbuy user IDs in the Disclosed Data allowed for Indirect\nIdentification, I grant the Organisation the benefit of the doubt and accept that\nthey do not constitute personal data. Nevertheless, it remains that the personal\ndata of nine individuals (corresponding to the nine mobile telephone numbers\n\n6\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\ndisclosed) was disclosed without their consent or the authorisation of the\nOrganisation.\n\nWhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements\n\n13\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires organisations to protection personal\n\ndata in their possession or under their control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised use, disclosure and similar risks.\nAlthough the Organisation’s delivery personnel were required to comply with\nEzbuy’s Privacy Policy and Employee Handbook, this was, at the time of the\nincident, inadequate as they did not inform employees of exactly what they were\nrequired to do in order to protect customers’ personal data:\n(a)\n\nEzbuy’s Privacy Policy only stated its commitment to ensuring\n\nsecurity of customer information and that “suitable physical, electronic\nand managerial procedures” had been put in place to safeguard customer\ninformation; and\n(b)\n\nEzbuy’s Employee Handbook only included a provision\n\nhighlighting that customer information (among others) was confidential.\n\n14\n\nAt the time of the incident, the Organisation had not made any effort to\n\nimpress upon its delivery personnel the need to protect personal data in their\npossession. The Organisation did not have measures in place, such as policies\n\n7\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nor standard operating procedures, to prohibit the unauthorised use or disclosure\nof personal data by its delivery personnel. The Organisation also had not\nprovided any instruction or training to its delivery personnel on the proper\nhandling of personal data and on compliance with the PDPA.\n\n15\n\nIn the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Organisation\n\nsought to rely on a clause in OA’s employment contract which prohibited him\nfrom disclosing confidential information, including customer information,\nwithout the Organisation’s prior consent (the “Confidentiality Clause”). While\nsuch clauses are relevant to an organisation’s security arrangements to protect\npersonal data, they are insufficient on their own because they typically do not\nelaborate on what constitutes personal data, nor how employees should handle\nand protect it. Organisations are expected to provide their staff with specific,\npractical instruction on how to handle personal data and comply with the PDPA\n(Re Hazel Florist & Gifts Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 9 at [18]). This is particularly\nimportant for the Organisation’s delivery personnel who frequently handle\npersonal data and are on the frontline of the Organisation’s customer-facing\noperations where the potential for improper use and disclosure of personal data\ncannot be ignored.\n\n16\n\nIn the circumstances, I find that the Organisation had not made\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data comprised in the\n\n8\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nDisclosed Data. The Organisation is accordingly in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n17\n\nOne additional point I wish to address is that when OA was asked about\n\nthe incident, he claimed that he had given the complainant the Packages as the\ncomplainant had provided him with CA’s Ezbuy user ID and mobile telephone\nnumber for verification. As there is no evidence that the complainant and CA\nwere known to each other, I do not find OA’s recollection of the events to be\ncredible or acceptable. In any case, this does not detract from the above\nconclusion that the Organisation had failed to make reasonable security\narrangements as required under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nOutcome\n\n18\n\nTaking the totality of the circumstances into account, I have decided not\n\nto impose a financial penalty in this case. In particular, I note that:\n(a)\n\nThe breach was a one-off incident, with few affected individuals\n\nand relatively little personal data disclosed (comprising the nine mobile\ntelephone numbers and user IDs);\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions to prevent a\n\nrecurrence of such an incident; and\n\n9\n\n\fAvant Logistic Service Pte. Ltd.\n\n(c)\n\n19\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 28\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations.\n\nInstead, I have decided to issue the following directions to the\n\nOrganisation to ensure its compliance with the PDPA:\n(a)\n\nTo put in place the appropriate written policies and process\n\nsafeguards which are necessary for it to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control within 30 days from date of this direction;\n(b)\n\nTo arrange for personal data protection training for its staff\n\nwithin 60 days from date of this direction; and\n(c)\n\nTo inform the Commission in writing of the completion of each\n\nof the above within 1 week of completion.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $54,000 was imposed on Horizon Fast Ferry for failing to appoint a data protection officer, develop and implement data protection policies and practices, and put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data collected from its customers.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Transport and Storage"],"date":"2019-08-02","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Decision---Horizon-Fast-Ferry---250719.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Horizon Fast Ferry","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/08/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-horizon-fast-ferry","timestamp":"2019-08-02","pdf-content":"COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 27\nCase No DP-1710-B1202\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nHorizon Fast Ferry Pte.

Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 27\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1710-B1202\n25 July 2019\n1\n\nOn 9 October 2017, the Complainant informed the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (the “Commission”) that by entering her passport number in the booking form on\nthe Organisation’s website, her name, gender, nationality, date of birth and passport expiry date\nwere automatically populated in the corresponding fields on the form on the Booking Site\nwithout any requirement for further authentication (the “Incident”).\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a Singapore-based ferry operator with ferry services running\n\nbetween Singapore and Batam.\n3\n\nAs part of its service offerings, the Organisation operates a website that allows\n\npassengers to purchase ferry tickets directly from the Organisation online (“Booking Site”).\nAt the material time, passengers who wanted to purchase ferry tickets through the Booking Site\nwere required to provide the following personal data (the “Personal Data Set”) as set out in\nthe form on the Booking Site (“Booking Form”):\n(a)\n\nthe passenger’s full name;\n\n(b)\n\ngender;\n\n(c)\n\nnationality;\n\n(d)\n\ndate of birth;\n\n(e)\n\npassport number; and\n\n(f)\n\npassport expiry date.\n\n\f4\n\nThe same Personal Data Set was collected from passengers and entered into the\n\nOrganisation’s Counter Check-In System (“CCIS”) when they checked in at the check-in\ncounter. The CCIS is an internal system used by the Organisation’s counter staff to manage the\npassenger check-in process and is only accessible by authorised counter staff.\n5\n\nAs a matter of practice, all Personal Data Sets collected from the Booking Site and the\n\nCCIS were stored and retained on the Organisation’s internal database (the “Database”) even\nafter the last travelling date of the passenger’s itinerary to facilitate and speed up subsequent\ncheck-ins for passengers who have previously travelled with the Organisation (“Returning\nPassengers”).1\n6\n\nIn this regard, one of the features of the CCIS was the auto-retrieval of the personal\n\ndata of Returning Passengers. By entering a Returning Passenger’s passport number, the CCIS\nwould automatically retrieve the Personal Data Set associated with a Returning Passenger’s\npassport number from the Database and populate the remaining fields in the Booking Form.\nCounter staff would no longer need to manually enter the Returning Passenger’s personal data.\nThe personal data retrieved from the Database was only meant to be accessible by authorised\ncounter staff on the CCIS.\nBooking Site revamp\n7\n\nIn or around May 2017, the Organisation engaged an independent contractor (the\n\n“Contractor”) on an informal basis to revamp the Booking Site, specifically to improve the\nuser interface and user experience, such as when purchasing ferry tickets online. The parties\ndid not enter into any written contract for the revamping of the Booking Site and all instructions\nand requirements for the revamp of the Booking Site were conveyed either verbally or through\nWhatsApp text messages. The Organisation did not inform or instruct the Contractor of its data\nprotection obligations in relation to the personal data in the Database.\n8\n\nUnbeknownst to the Organisation and contrary to its intention, the Contractor replicated\n\nthe auto-retrieval and auto-population feature (which was only meant to be used in the internal\nCCIS) in the Booking Site as part of the website revamp. Consequently, whenever a user\nentered a passport number which matched a Returning Passenger’s passport number in the\n1\n\nThe Organisation also represented that the Personal Data Sets were retained on the Database for audit and\naccounting and internal reporting purposes.\n\n\fDatabase, the system would automatically retrieve and populate the remaining fields in the\nBooking Form with the Personal Data Set associated with the Returning Passenger’s passport\nnumber. As the Organisation failed to conduct proper user acceptance tests before launching\nthe revamped Booking Site, the Organisation was not aware of this function until it was notified\nof the Incident.\n9\n\nAt the time of the investigation, there were a total of 444,000 Personal Data Sets stored\n\nin the Database.2 However, the Organisation represented that out of the 444,000 Personal Data\nSets, there were only a total of 295,151 unique passengers whose Personal Data Sets were\nstored in the Database as a number of passengers had made bookings under different passport\nnumbers (valid and expired).3\n10\n\nThe Organisation took the following remedial actions shortly after it was notified of the\n\nIncident:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation commenced investigations and removed the auto-retrieval and\n\nauto-population feature from the Booking Site a little more than a week after the\nOrganisation was first notified of the Incident;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation conducted checks to ensure that the auto-retrieval and auto-\n\npopulation feature was disabled from the Booking Site; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation implemented administrative measures to protect the personal\n\ndata in their possession, such as ensuring that documents containing booking data and\npassenger manifests were properly shredded at the end of the day, that monthly reports\nwith passenger data were kept in a locked room and sent for mass disposal at the end of\nthe financial year and the Organisation appointed a data protection officer to be\nresponsible for ensuring the Organisation’s compliance with the PDPA.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n11\n\n2\n\nThe two main issues for determination are:\n\nApproximately three months after the date of the Complaint, on 12 December 2017.\nOther than the Personal Data Sets, some users also supplied their mobile phone numbers. There were 5,218\nunique mobile numbers collected and stored in the Database as at 12 December 2017.\n3\n\n\f(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under sections 11(3) and\n\n12(a) of the PDPA; and\n(b)\n12\n\nwhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Personal Data Sets stored in the Database are “personal data” as defined in section\n\n2(1) of the PDPA. In particular, given that the unauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data Set\nas a whole could have led to an increased risk of such personal data being used for illegal\nactivities such as identity theft or fraud, they are personal data of a more sensitive nature.4\nWhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under sections 11(3) and 12(a) of the\nPDPA\n13\n\nSection 11(3) of the PDPA requires an organisation to designate one or more\n\nindividuals to be responsible for ensuring compliance with the PDPA. In a similar vein, section\n12(a) of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop and implement policies and practices\nthat are necessary to meet its obligations under the PDPA (collectively, the “Openness\nObligation”).\n14\n\nAs mentioned above, all passengers who purchased ferry tickets from the Organisation\n\nwere required to provide the personal data in the Personal Data Set to the Organisation either\nat the time of booking through the Booking Site or at the Organisation’s check-in counter.\n15\n\nHowever, even though the Organisation routinely collected and processed large\n\nvolumes of personal data in the course of its business, the Organisation demonstrated a blatant\ndisregard for its data protection obligations.\n16\n\nBy its own admission, at the time of the Incident, the Organisation did not designate\n\nany individual to be responsible for ensuring that the Organisation complies with the PDPA,\ni.e. a data protection officer (“DPO”). The Organisation’s current DPO was only appointed\nafter 6 November 2017, when the Organisation was first informed of the Incident.\n17\n\nSimilarly, the Organisation’s privacy policy was only implemented and uploaded on its\n\nBooking Site after it was informed of the Incident. While the Organisation represented that it\n\n4\n\nSee Re: Singapore Management University Alumni Association [2018] SGPDPC 6 at [20]\n\n\fhad an internal guideline titled “Workplace policies: confidentiality” in place at the time of the\nIncident, apart from a reference to its commitment to “[e]stablish data protection practices\n(e.g. secure locks, data encryption, frequent backups, access authorization)”, the internal\nguidelines do not set out any actual practices or processes to protect the personal data in the\nOrganisation’s possession.\n18\n\nThe development and implementation of data protection policies is a fundamental and\n\ncrucial starting point for organisations to comply with their obligations under the PDPA. This\nwas highlighted in Re M Star Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 (at\n[25]) (“M Star Movers”):\nAt the very basic level, an appropriate data protection policy should be drafted\nto ensure that it gives a clear understanding within the organisation of its\nobligations under the PDPA and sets general standards on the handling of\npersonal data which staff are expected to adhere to. To meet these aims, the\nframers, in developing such policies, have to address their minds to the types of\ndata the organisation handles which may constitute personal data; the manner in,\nand the purposes for, which it collects, uses and discloses personal data; the\nparties to, and the circumstances in, which it discloses personal data; and the\ndata protection standards the organisation needs to adopt to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA.\nAn overarching data protection policy will ensure a consistent minimum data\nprotection standard across an organisation’s business practices, procedures and\nactivities (e.g. communications through social media).\n19\n\nLikewise, the DPO plays a vital role in building a robust data protection framework to\n\nensure the organisation’s compliance with its obligations under the PDPA regardless of the size\nof the organisation.5\n20\n\nAs highlighted in M Stars Movers (at [34]), the responsibilities of a DPO include, but\n\nare not limited to:\n(a) ensuring compliance with the PDPA when developing and implementing\npolicies and processes for handling personal data, including processes and\nformal procedures to handle queries and/or complaints from the public;\n(b) fostering a data protection culture and accountability among employees and\ncommunicating personal data protection policies to stakeholders;\n\n5\n\nM Stars Movers at [37].\n\n\f(c) handling and managing personal data protection related queries and\ncomplaints from the public, including making information about the\norganisation’s data protection policies and practices available on request to the\npublic;\n(d) alerting management to any risks that might arise with regard to personal\ndata; and\n(e) liaising with the Commissioner on data protection matters, if necessary.\n21\n\nIn the circumstances, it is clear that the Organisation failed to meet its obligations under\n\nsections 11(3) and 12(a) of the PDPA. Had the Organisation met its Openness Obligation under\nthe PDPA, the Organisation would have had a clearer understanding of its data protection\nobligations under the PDPA and appropriate measures may have been put in place earlier which\ncould have prevented the Incident from occurring.\nWhether the Organisation breached the Protection Obligation under the PDPA\n22\n\nAs a preliminary point, although the Contractor appears to have been responsible for\n\ncarrying out the Booking Site revamp, seeing as the parties did not enter into any written\nagreement and there was no evidence to suggest that the Contractor stored, held or managed\nthe personal data in the Database on behalf of the Organisation, the Contractor is not a data\nintermediary of the Organisation. The Organisation is solely responsible for complying with\nall the data protection obligations under the PDPA, including the obligation to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control under\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n23\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Database was shared by the Booking Site and the CCIS.\n\nHowever, the Organisation conceded that it omitted to inform the Contractor of its data\nprotection obligations and did not instruct the Contractor to put in place proper safeguards to\nprotect the personal data in the Organisation’s possession or control.\n24\n\nIn this regard, one of the key considerations for organisations as highlighted in the\n\nGuide on Building Websites for SMEs (at [4.2.1]) is the importance of emphasising the need\nfor personal data protection to their IT vendors:\nOrganisations should emphasise the need for personal data protection to their IT\nvendors, by making it part of their contractual terms. The contract should also state\nclearly the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the PDPA. When\n\n\fdiscussing the scope of outsourced work, organisations should consider whether the\nIT vendor’s scope of work will include any of the following:\n\n25\n\n\n\nRequiring that IT vendors consider how the personal data should be handled as\npart of the design and layout of the website.\n\n\n\nPlanning and developing the website in a way that ensures that it does not\ncontain any web application vulnerabilities that could expose the personal data\nof individuals collected, stored or accessed via the website through the Internet.\n\n\n\nRequiring that IT vendors who provide hosting for the website should ensure\nthat the servers and networks are securely configured and adequately protected\nagainst unauthorised access.\n\n\n\nWhen engaging IT vendors to provide maintenance and/or administrative\nsupport for the website, requiring that any changes they make to the website do\nnot contain vulnerabilities that could expose the personal data. Additionally,\ndiscussing whether they have technical and/or non-technical processes in place\nto prevent the personal data from being exposed accidentally or otherwise.\n\nEven more concerning was the fact that the Organisation did not put in place reasonable\n\narrangements to discover risks to its personal data when changes were made to the Booking\nSite that was linked to the Database which held the personal data of close to 300,000\nindividuals. The Organisation did not conduct any proper user acceptance testing prior to the\nlaunch of the revamped Booking Site. The only test that the Organisation carried out was to\nkey in a simulated passport number to test the new user interface. However, as the simulated\npassport number did not match any record in the Database, the Organisation failed to detect the\nauto-retrieval and population feature in the revamped Booking Site.\n26\n\nWebsites connected to the Internet are subject to a multitude of cyber threats that may\n\ncompromise the website and expose any personal data it collects. Organisations should\ntherefore ensure that the protection of the personal data and the security of the website is a key\ndesign consideration at each stage of the website’s life cycle – be it during the requirements\ngathering, design and development stage or when conducting user acceptance testing or\ndeployment and operations and support.6\n27\n\nAs a result of the Organisation’s failure to conduct proper user acceptance tests, the gap\n\nin the revamped Booking Site which allowed for the unauthorised access to personal data stored\n\n6\n\nSee PDPC’s Guide on Building Websites for SMEs at [3.2] to [3.3].\n\n\fin the Database went undetected. This was not rectified for approximately one month, thereby\ncausing the personal data of close to 300,000 of the Organisation’s passengers to be exposed\nto the risks of unauthorised disclosure.\n28\n\nAs a matter of good practice, organisations should consider whether there is a need to\n\nconduct a data protection impact assessment whenever a new system or process is being\nintroduced, developed or implemented that involves the handling of personal data or an existing\nsystem or process is being reviewed or substantially redesigned.7\n29\n\nIn this regard, the Guide to Data Protection Impact Assessments (published on 1\n\nNovember 2017) (at [1.2]) states that:\nA [Data Protection Impact Assessment] involves identifying, assessing and\naddressing personal data protection risks based on the organisation’s functions,\nneeds and processes. In doing so, an organisation would be better positioned to\nassess if their handling of personal data complies with the PDPA or data\nprotection best practices, and implement appropriate technical or organisational\nmeasures to safeguard against data protection risks to individuals.\n30\n\nIn adopting this view, the Commissioner agrees with the observations in the Joint\n\nGuidance Note issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the Office of the\nInformation and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta and the Office of the Information and\nPrivacy Commissioner for British Columbia on the proper use of risk assessment tools for all\nnew projects involving personal information:8\nPrivacy risks evolve over time. Conducting risk assessments, at least on an\nannual basis, is an important part of any privacy management program to ensure\nthat organizations are in compliance with applicable legislation.\nWe have seen instances of organizations offering new services that collect, use\nor disclose personal information that have not been thoroughly vetted from a\nprivacy perspective. Proper use of risk assessment tools can help prevent\nproblems. Fixing a privacy problem after the fact can be costly so careful\nconsideration of the purposes for a particular initiative, product or service, and\nan assessment that minimizes any privacy impacts beforehand is vital.\n\nSee PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Impact Assessments.\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of\nAlberta and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia, Getting\nAccountability Right with a Privacy Management Program <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacylaws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda-compliancehelp/pipeda-compliance-and-training-tools/gl_acc_201204/>\n7\n8\n\n\fAs a result, such assessments should be required throughout the organization for\nall new projects involving personal information and on any new collection, use\nor disclosure of personal information. Organizations should develop a process\nfor identifying and mitigating privacy and security risks, including the use of\nprivacy impact assessments and security threat risk assessments.\n[Emphasis added.]\n31\n\nIn view of the above and the Organisation’s failure to put in place adequate security\n\narrangements to protect the personal data in the Database, the Commissioner finds that the\nOrganisation was in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n32\n\nFinally, although the Organisation did not intend to offer the auto-retrieval and auto-\n\npopulation function in its Booking Site, organisations that do offer such functions should take\nnote of the following comments made by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”)\nin the Personal Information Online Code of Practice on the use of auto-completion facilities\nfor forms and passwords:\nIf your site offers auto-completion facilities for forms and passwords, it\nis good practice to notify users if this could leave them vulnerable, for\nexample if their mobile device or laptop is stolen. However, ultimately\nusers have a role to play in protecting themselves online, for example by\nadjusting the auto-complete settings on their browser or on a website they\nvisit. Autocompletion can present a particular risk where an individual’s\npayment card details have been retained for ‘auto-fill’ purposes. This\nmay mean not offering auto-completion in certain contexts – e.g. on\npassword fields for authorising payments.\n[Emphasis added.]]\nDirections\n33\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of sections 11(3), 12(a) and 24 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation\nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include\ndirecting the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n34\n\nIn deciding whether to direct an organisation to pay a financial penalty, one of the\n\nCommissioner’s key objectives is to promote compliance with the PDPA. As such, while the\nCommissioner will seek to ensure that the financial penalty imposed is reasonable and\n\n\fproportionate on the facts, the financial penalty should also be sufficiently meaningful to act\nboth as a sanction and as a deterrent to prevent similar contraventions of the PDPA.\n35\n\nIn this regard, as highlighted in the Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of the Data\n\nProtection Provisions (at [24.1]) the Commissioner will take into account factors such as the\nseriousness and impact of the organisation’s breach and will consider if the organisation had\nacted deliberately, wilfully or if the organisation had known or ought to have known of the risk\nof a serious contravention and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent it.\n36\n\nIn adopting this view, the Commissioner agrees with the ICO’s Guidance About the\n\nIssue of Monetary Penalties Prepared and Issued Under section 55C(1) of the Data Protection\nAct 1998 (“ICO Guidance on Monetary Penalties”) (at [34] to [37]):\nThe Commissioner’s aim in imposing a monetary penalty\nThe Commissioner’s underlying objective in imposing a monetary\npenalty notice is to promote compliance with the DPA or with PECR.\nThe penalty must be sufficiently meaningful to act both as a sanction and\nalso as a deterrent to prevent non-compliance of similar seriousness in\nthe future by the contravening person and by others.\nThis applies both in relation to the specific type of contravention and\nother contraventions more generally. Here, the Commissioner will have\nregard to the general approach set out in paragraphs 42 to 46 below.\nThe Commissioner will seek to ensure that the imposition of a monetary\npenalty is appropriate and the amount of that penalty is reasonable and\nproportionate, given the particular facts of the case and the underlying\nobjective in imposing the penalty.\n37\n\nWith the foregoing principles in mind, the Commissioner took into account the\n\nfollowing aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the breach and determining the\ndirections to be imposed:\nAggravating factors\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation routinely collects and processes the personal data of a large\n\nnumber of individuals in the course of its business but did not have adequate data\nprotection policies or practices in place;\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe Personal Data Sets in collected and stored in the Database, such as the\n\nindividual’s nationality, passport number and passport expiry date, are of a sensitive\nnature particularly when disclosed as a whole. In this regard, attention is drawn to the\ndecision in Re: Singapore Management University Alumni Association [2018]\nSGPDPC 6 (“SMU AA”) at [20] where it was stated that “the use of an NRIC Number\ngeneration tool would make it relatively easy for a motivated hacker to systematically\nquery the webpage and, if successful, he would have been able to definitively link the\nNRIC Number to the full name, address and other personal data of the member,\npotentially resulting in significant harm to the individual, such as through identity theft\nor an unauthorised person impersonating the affected member”;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation demonstrated a blatant lack of regard for its data protection\n\nobligations prior to the Incident. Despite the fact that the PDPA came into full force on\n2 July 2014 and advisory guidelines and/or guides which are relevant to the\ncontravention were available, the Organisation only appointed a DPO more than three\nyears after the PDPA came into full force and appears to have ignored or not given these\nguidelines and/or guides the appropriate weight;\n(d)\n\nas a result of the Organisation’s lack of regard for its data protection obligations,\n\nthe personal data of at least 295,151 of the Organisation’s passengers were exposed to\nthe risks of unauthorised disclosure;\nMitigating factors\n(e)\n\nthe Organisation had cooperated fully in the investigation and was forthcoming\n\nand transparent in admitting its mistakes in contributing to the unauthorised disclosure;\n(f)\n\nremedial actions were taken and the Organisation took increased efforts to\n\nheighten employees’ awareness of the Organisation’s data protection obligations under\nthe PDPA;\n(g)\n\nthere was no evidence to suggest any actual unauthorised access and/or\n\nexfiltration of data leading to loss or damage; and\n\n\f(h)\n\nthere was limited disclosure to possibly one individual who would have had to\n\nenter a Returning Passenger’s passport number that matched the passport number in the\nDatabase.\n38\n\nThe Organisation submitted representations, after being informed of the proposed\n\ndecision in this case, requesting a warning in lieu of a financial penalty or otherwise to reduce\nthe quantum of the financial penalty imposed. In support of this, the Organisation made the\nfollowing representations:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation asserted that the revamped Booking Site was only operational\n\nin or around October 2017, and the auto-retrieval and auto-population feature was only\naccessible to users (other than the authorised counter staff) from October 2017 to 14\nNovember 2017. Thus, the Personal Data Sets were only at risk of unauthorised\ndisclosure for this period of time;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation did not deliberately nor wilfully breach the PDPA and upon\n\nnotification of the Incident, the Organisation took remedial actions 9 and was\ncooperative during the investigations, and\n(c)\n\nThe risk of unauthorised disclosure is low as an individual would need to\n\npossess the exact passport number to trigger the auto-complete feature which would\ndisclose the corresponding Personal Data Set.\n39\n\nWith respect to the issue raised in paragraph 38(a), the Commissioner accepted the\n\nclarifications as to the period of time for which the Personal Data Sets were at risk of\nunauthorised disclosure, and the quantum of the financial penalty has been adjusted\naccordingly.\n40\n\nWith regards to paragraph 38(b), the remedial actions taken by the Organisation and\n\nthe fact that the Organisation was cooperative during the investigations, have already been\ntaken into account as mitigating factors at paragraphs 37(e) and 37(f) above in determining the\nappropriate quantum of the financial penalty. Also, the deliberateness or wilfulness of the\nOrganisation in breaching the PDPA is not a relevant consideration in this case where it was\n\n9\n\nIncluding those set out in paragraph 10.\n\n\ffound that the Organisation failed to put in place the necessary security arrangements to protect\nthe Personal Data Set.\n41\n\nWith regards to paragraph 38(c) above, these are matters that had already been taken\n\ninto consideration in assessing the financial penalty and as set out at paragraphs 37(g) and 37(h)\nabove .\n42\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby direct\n\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$54,000 within [30] days from the date of this\ndirection, failing which, interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts, shall be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $16,000 was imposed on Genki Sushi for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data of its employees.

Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1809-B2684\n\n22 July 2019\nBackground\n1\n\nOn 7 September 2018, Genki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd. (the\n\n“Organisation”) notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) that a server on the Organisation’s network which stored the\npersonal data of its employees, among other information, had been the target of\na ransomware attack. This attack resulted in the unauthorised encryption of the\nemployee personal data hosted on that server and the Organisation being\nsubjected to a ransom demand (the “Incident”). The Commission commenced\nan investigation in order to determine whether the Organisation had failed to\ncomply with its obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”).\n\nMaterial Facts\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a sushi chain restaurant. As part of its internal\n\noperations, it used an off-the-shelf payroll software application, “TimeSoft”,\nwhich was developed and licensed to it by Times Software Pte Ltd (“Times”).\nThe TimeSoft application included a web portal and a database. The web portal\nwas used by (a) employees to view their electronic payslips and (b) supervisors\nat the various restaurants to confirm the attendance of their employees during\n\n1\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nthe designated hours. The database contained the personal data of the\nOrganisation’s former and current employees (“Employee Data Files”). The\nTimeSoft application was hosted on a local server belonging to the Organisation\n(the “Server”). The Server also contained financial data files (e.g. financial\nstatements and details on the Organisation’s dealings with its vendors).\n3\n\nOn 30 August 2018, the Organisation’s IT personnel discovered that the\n\nServer was unresponsive. Following internal investigations, the Organisation\nconfirmed that the Server had been subjected to a ransomware attack, resulting\nin most of its hosted files (including the Employee Data Files) being encrypted\nwith a “.bip” extension and their contents being inaccessible to the\nOrganisation. A ransom payment was demanded from the Organisation in\nexchange for the decryption key. Based on its investigations, the Organisation\nsuspected that the Server was infected by the “Dharma” variant of ransomware\nthat had been installed on the Server through its internet link.\n4\n\nThe Incident resulted in the unauthorised modification of the\n\nOrganisation’s data (including the Employee Data Files) as the encryption by\nthe ransomware replaced the original plaintext with ciphertext (which was\nunreadable without the proper cipher to decrypt it). The following types of\npersonal data belonging to approximately 360 current and former employees of\nthe Organisation were affected by the unauthorised modification:\n\n(a)\n\nname;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number, if the employee was a Singaporean;\n\n(c)\n\nForeign Identity Number (“FIN”) and application date, if the\nemployee was a foreigner;\n\n2\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n5\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\n(d)\n\nbank account information, i.e., bank and branch information;\n\n(e)\n\ngender;\n\n(f)\n\nmarital status;\n\n(g)\n\ndate of hire;\n\n(h)\n\ndate of birth; and\n\n(i)\n\nsalary details.\n\nThe Incident also affected the following types of personal data for some\n\nof the Organisation’s current or former employees (who had these types of data\nstored in the Server):\n\n(a)\n\npassport number;\n\n(b)\n\naddress;\n\n(c)\n\ntelephone number;\n\n(d)\n\nmobile phone number;\n\n(e)\n\nnames of relatives;\n\n(f)\n\nemergency contact person’s name and relationship with the\nemployee; and\n\n3\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n(g)\n6\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\ncountry of birth.\n\nThere was no evidence of the encrypted personal data files being\n\nsubjected to exfiltration or unauthorised disclosure.\n\n7\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the Organisation immediately took the\n\nfollowing steps to contain and mitigate the effects of the Incident:\n\n(a)\n\nisolated the Server from its larger IT network;\n\n(b)\n\nperformed anti-virus scans on each computer in the\nOrganisation’s office and restaurants;\n\n(c)\n\nattempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to remove the ransomware and\ndecrypt the infected data files using third party security tools;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nto the best of its ability, notified its affected employees of the\nIncident. In this regard, all full-time employees and most parttime employees were notified by 7 September 2018. The\nOrganisation was unable to notify its affected former employees\ndue to their contact details being encrypted by the ransomware.\n\n8\n\nThe Organisation subsequently also took the following steps to prevent\n\nthe recurrence of the Incident:\n\n(a)\n\nreplaced the Server with a new server that was isolated in a “demilitarised zone” within the Organisation’s IT network;\n\n4\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nintroduced the following safeguards to protect the personal data\nin the new server:\n(i)\n\nencrypting the TimeSoft application’s database;\n\n(ii)\n\nsetting the server’s firewall security policy to allow\ntraffic only via Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure or\nthrough required service ports;\n\n(iii)\n\nenabling an intrusion prevention system on the firewall;\n\n(iv)\n\ninstalling TrendMicro OfficeScan XS anti-virus software\non the new server, with the intent of subsequently\nupgrading this software to TrendMicro Deep Security\nafter improvements to the Organisation’s overall\nenterprise IT structure are completed;\n\n(v)\n\n(c)\n\nenabling audit logging on the new server;\n\nengaged an external vendor to provide security operation centre\nservices, whereby the vendor would monitor the network and\nserver logs and look out for any potential malicious activities on\nthe new server; and\n\n(d)\n\nengaged an IT security vendor to assist with updating the\nServer’s operating system, managing patches for the Server, and\nconducting regular IT vulnerability assessments.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n9\n\nThe main issue for determination is whether the Organisation breached\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA. Section 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to\n\n5\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nprotect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable\nsecurity steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n\n10\n\nAs a preliminary point, it is noted that, during the material time, the\n\nOrganisation was responsible for the maintenance of the Server, while Times\nwas in charge of providing technical support for the TimeSoft application, such\nas maintaining its web portal and database, as well as troubleshooting the\napplication. Times provided its technical support on an ad hoc basis via remote\naccess granted by the Organisation. During this process, the Organisation’s IT\npersonnel would supervise the activities of Times to ensure that there was no\nunauthorised access to, or collection of, the personal data hosted on the Server.\nAccordingly, Times did not have any control or possession of the personal data\nhosted on the Server. In any event, the Incident did not relate to the scope of\nTimes’ services rendered to the Organisation. As such, the Commissioner found\nthat only the Organisation was in possession and control of the personal data,\nincluding the Employee Data Files, hosted on the Server during the material\ntime.\n\n11\n\nTo determine whether the Organisation was in breach of section 24, the\n\nrelevant question is whether it had put in place reasonable security arrangements\nto safeguard the personal data hosted on the Server. The Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) (at\n[17.2]) provide the following examples of factors that are taken into\nconsideration in assessing the reasonableness of an organisation’s security\narrangements:\n\n(a)\n\nthe nature of the personal data;\n\n6\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nthe form in which the personal data has been collected (e.g.\nphysical or electronic); and\n\n(c)\n\nthe possible impact to the individual concerned if an\nunauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the\npersonal data.\n\n12\n\nIn assessing the security arrangements adopted by the Organisation, the\n\nCommissioner considered that the Employee Data Files included sensitive\npersonal data in the form of NRIC numbers, FINs, passport numbers, bank\naccount details and salary details. In this regard, it bears repeating what was\nstated in Re Aviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 4 at [17]:\n“All forms or categories of personal data are not equal;\norganisations need to take into account the sensitivity of the\npersonal data that they handle. In this regard, the Commissioner\nrepeats the explanation in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] (at [18]) on the\nhigher standards of protection that should be implemented\nfor sensitive personal data:\nThe Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the\nPDPA states that an organisation should\n“implement robust policies and procedures for\nensuring appropriate levels of security for\npersonal data of varying levels of sensitivity”.\nThis means that a higher standard of\nprotection is required for more sensitive\npersonal data. More sensitive personal data,\nsuch as insurance, medical and financial data,\nshould be accorded a commensurate level of\nprotection. In addition, the Guide to Preventing\nAccidental Disclosure When Processing and\nSending Personal Data expressly states that\ndocuments that contain sensitive personal data\n\n7\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nshould be “processed and sent with particular\ncare”.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n13\n\nIt should also be borne in mind that NRIC numbers are of special\n\nconcern as they are “a permanent and irreplaceable identifier which can be used\nto unlock large amounts of information relating to the individual” (Re Habitat\nfor Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 9 at [19])\n\n14\n\nThe standard of security arrangements expected in relation to IT systems\n\nwas elaborated upon in Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive\nWorks Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 22 (“Re The Cellar Door”) at [29]; “reasonable\nsecurity arrangements” for IT systems must be sufficiently robust and\ncomprehensive to guard against a possible intrusion or attack:\n“Another important aspect of a “reasonable security\narrangement” for IT systems is that it must be sufficiently\nrobust and comprehensive to guard against a possible\nintrusion or attack. For example, it is not enough for an IT\nsystem to have strong firewalls if there is a weak administrative\npassword which an intruder can “guess” to enter the system. The\nnature of such systems require there to be sufficient coverage\nand an adequate level of protection of the security measures that\nare put in place, since a single point of entry is all an intruder\nneeds to gain access to the personal data held on a system. In\nother words, an organisation needs to have an “all-round”\nsecurity of its system. This is not to say that the security\nmeasures or the coverage need to be “perfect”, but only\nrequires that such arrangements be “reasonable” in the\ncircumstances.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n8\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n15\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nIn this case, the Organisation had failed to put in such “all-round”\n\nsecurity of its system which is accessible via the Internet by all of its branches,\nand which contained sensitive personal data of its employees, e.g. NRIC/FIN\nand passport numbers, bank account details. The Commission’s investigations\nrevealed the following significant gaps in the security measures implemented in\nrelation to the Server during the Incident:\n\n(a)\n\nfirst, the Organisation initially did not have a firewall for the\nServer and, even after a firewall had been installed following its\nrecent IT migration pursuant to its business re-organisation, it\nfailed to configure the Server’s firewall to filter out unauthorised\ntraffic and close unused ports;\n\n(b)\n\nsecond, the Organisation did not conduct periodic penetration\ntests to assess the overall security of its IT infrastructure and\nbolster the effectiveness of its defensive mechanisms and\ndetermine what measures (including patches) may be required to\nfix vulnerabilities; and\n\n(c)\n\nThird, the Organisation failed to ensure that the Server and the\nTimeSoft application were regularly patched.\n\n16\n\nAs regards the failure in paragraph 15(a), although the Server was kept\n\nin a secure physical location with physical access only granted to authorised\npersonnel, the same level of precaution had not been implemented for virtual or\nremote access. There was no firewall for a while, and even when installed, the\nServer’s firewall was not configured to block any unused ports or unauthorised\ntraffic at all material times. In other words, the Server’s firewall was ineffective\nat filtering out any external threats.\n\n9\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n17\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nIn its response to the Commission’s queries, the Organisation had\n\nexplained that the lack of configuration for the firewall was because the\nOrganisation had recently undergone a full IT migration and its IT team was\nwaiting for the IT infrastructure to be refreshed before configuring the\nappropriate firewall settings. Pending this refresh, it had not configured any\nfirewall setting as the Organisation did not have any server firewall before the\nIT migration and therefore no pre-existing configuration it could use for the\nfirewall in the interim period. Thus, there was effectively no firewall in place\nduring the relevant period.\n\n18\n\nThe Commissioner reiterates what was said in Re The Cellar Door (at\n\n[30(a)] and [30(b)]) that “a firewall is fundamental to the security of the server\nto protect against an array of external cyber threats” and “leaving unused ports\non a server open increases the risk of an external hacker exploiting the services\nrunning on these ports”. In this case, the firewall was not configured to close\nany ports.\n19\n\nAs regards the failures in paragraphs 15(b) and 15(c), the Organisation\n\nadmitted that it did not conduct any penetration tests on the Server within the\nlast 12 months prior to the Incident. The Organisation was also unable to\nprovide evidence that it had done any patching on the Server during the same\nperiod. This suggests that the Organisation did not have any processes in place\nto ensure regular security testing and patching of its IT systems.\n20\n\nThe Commissioner emphasises that regular security testing and patching\n\nare important security measures. Patching is one of the common tasks that all\nsystem owners are required to perform in order to keep their security measures\ncurrent against external threats. Moreover, as stated in the Commission’s Guide\n\n10\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nto Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised 20 January 2017) at\n[16.3] and [16.4]:\n“Vulnerabilities discovered [in software] are often published,\nhence cyber attackers are well aware of vulnerabilities available\nfor exploiting.\nIt is therefore important for organisations to keep their software\nupdated or patched regularly to minimise their vulnerabilities.”\n21\n\nGenerally, organisations should, to the extent possible, test and apply\n\nupdates and security patches as soon as they are available to the relevant\ncomponents (e.g. network devices, servers, database products, operating\nsystems, applications, software libraries, programming frameworks and\nfirmware) of the Organisation’s IT system. There should also be processes and\npeople responsible to monitor new patches and updates that become available\nwith respect to such components. In this regard, the arrangement with Times for\nmaintenance and technical support of the TimeSoft application was inadequate.\n22\n\nThe failures highlighted above contributed to a system that had a number\n\nof vulnerabilities and gaps that a hacker could easily exploit. In this case, the\nransomware may have successfully exploited these gaps to reach the Employee\nData Files and the other files on the Server. For a server that held sensitive\npersonal data, the security measures implemented by the Organisation were\ninadequate. In fact, the standard of protection provided was not even sufficient\nfor non-sensitive personal data.\n23\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n11\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n24\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, the Organisation made\n\nrepresentations on the amount of financial penalty which the Commissioner\nintended to impose. The Organisation raised the following factors for the\nCommissioner’s consideration:\n\n(a) There was no evidence that the personal data had been subjected\nto exfiltration, unauthorised disclosure or modification;\n(b) The Organisation did not pay the ransom amount to positively\ndiscourage and disincentivise unauthorised and criminal\nbehaviour by the ransomware attacker; and\n(c) The\n\nIncident\n\noccurred\n\nduring\n\nthe\n\nperiod\n\nwhere\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s new management was in the midst of the IT\nmigration and the strengthening of the IT infrastructure.\n\n25\n\nThe Commissioner has decided to maintain the financial penalty set out\nat [29] for the following reasons:\n(a) As explained at [4], there had been unauthorised modification\nto personal data belonging to approximately 360 current and\nformer employees of the Organisation. In determining the\nquantum of financial penalty, the Commissioner had already\ntaken into consideration that there was no evidence of the\nencrypted Employee Data Files being subjected to exfiltration or\nunauthorised disclosure.\n\n12\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\n(b) Notwithstanding that there was criminal activity on the part of\nthe ransomware attacker, the finding of section 24 breach relates\nto the Organisation’s own failings to put in place reasonable\nsecurity measures. As such, whether the ransom amount is paid\nis not a mitigating factor.\n(c) A transition to a new management team does not lower the\nstandard expected of an organisation to protect personal data in\nits possession and/or control. Notwithstanding that the\nOrganisation was in the midst of IT migration and strengthening\nof IT infrastructure, it was obliged to put in place reasonable\nsecurity measures to protect the Employee Data Files at all times.\nThese are therefore not mitigating factors. In any event, as stated\nat [15], the Commission’s investigations revealed that the\nOrganisation did not have adequate security measures in place\nfor the Server even before the IT migration.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n\n26\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of\nthe PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure its\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay\na financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million.\n\n27\n\nIn determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the Organisation\n\nin this case, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating\nfactors:\n\n13\n\n\fGenki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 26\n\nthe Organisation voluntarily notified the Commission of the\nbreach;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation fully cooperated with the Commission’s\ninvestigations; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the effects of the\nbreach.\n\n28\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account, as an aggravating factor, that\n\nthe failure to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data\nled to a loss of control over the Employee Data Files, which contained sensitive\npersonal data.\n\n29\n\nTaking into account the above mitigating and aggravating factors, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\n$16,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until it is\npaid in full.\n\n30\n\nThe Commissioner has not set out any further directions for the\n\nOrganisation given the remediation measures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions, including a financial penalty of $5,000, were imposed on Championtutor for breaches of the PDPA.

(the “Incident”). The Commission proceeded to\ninvestigate the Incident in order to determine whether the Organisation had\ncomplied with its obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a home tuition agency in Singapore with more than\n\n10 years’ experience matching students and tutors. While the service is free for\nstudents, tutors are required to pay a commission to the Organisation for each\ntuition assignment they accepted.\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.championtutor.com/certs_tutor/1certs1397642794.pdf\n\n\fChampionTutor Inc\n\n3\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 25\n\nIn the course of investigations by the Commission, it was found that the\n\nTutor List contained name, contact number and email address (“Disclosed\nInformation”) of a total of 4,899 individuals, including the Complainant\n(“Affected Individuals”).\n4\n\nIt also emerged in the course of investigations that the Organisation had\n\nnot appointed any data protection office (“DPO”) and had failed to develop and\nput in place any internal data protection policies.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n5\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commissioner in this case are as\n\nfollows:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Disclosed Information is “business contact\n\ninformation” as defined under section 2(1) of the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with the obligations to\n\nappoint a data protection officer (“DPO”) and develop and implement\ndata protection policies and practices under sections 11(3) and 12\nrespectively of the PDPA.\nWhether the Disclosed Information is “business contact information”\n6\n\nUnder section 2(1) of the PDPA, “business contact information” is\n\ndefined as “an individual’s name, position name or title, business telephone\nnumber, business address, business electronic mail address or business fax\nnumber and any other similar information about the individual, not provided by\nthe individual solely for his personal purposes” (emphasis added). Section 4(5)\nof the PDPA provides that the substantive data protection obligations found in\n\n2\n\n\fChampionTutor Inc\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 25\n\nParts III to VI of the PDPA (the “Data Protection Provisions”) shall not apply\nto business contact information (“BCI”).\n7\n\nThe purpose for which the contact information is provided is key in\n\ndetermining whether it is considered BCI. In this regard, the Affected\nIndividuals provided the Disclosed Information to the Organisation for the\npurposes of being contacted for tuition assignments.\n8\n\nUnder section 2(1) of the PDPA, “business” is defined as including “the\n\nactivity of any organisation, whether or not carried on for the purposes of gain,\nor conducted on a regular, repetitive or continuous basis, but does not include\nan individual acting in his personal or domestic capacity”. Tutors carry out a\nbusiness of providing tuition services. In this regard, the tutors registered with\nthe Organisation are freelancers, and are paid directly by the student. For each\ntuition assignment accepted, tutors are required to pay the Organisation a onetime commission.2 Tutors are also responsible for reporting their earnings as a\nfreelance tutor to the tax authority yearly.3 The Inland Revenue Authority of\nSingapore’s “Tax Guide for Tuition Industry” provides guidance for tutors\nproviding tuition services and tuition agencies assigning tutors to students with\nrespect to reporting business income for tax purposes.4\n\n2\n\nSee https://www.championtutor.com/faq.html which provides that agency commission is\ncalculated at 50% of the first payment cycle (4 weeks)\n3\n\nSee https://www.championtutor.com/faq.html\n\n4\n\nhttps://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/uploadedFiles/IRASHome/Businesses/Starter%20Guide\n%20for%20Self%20Employed%20Tuition%20Centre%20or%20Agency%20Operators.pdf\n\n3\n\n\fChampionTutor Inc\n\n9\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 25\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Commissioner finds that the tuition services\n\noffered by the Organisation’s tutors falls within the definition of “business”\nunder section 2(1) of the PDPA. Therefore, the Contact Details provided by the\nAffected Individuals for the purposes of being contacted for tuition assignments\nis BCI, and the Data Protection Provisions do not apply.\nWhether ChamptionTutor complied with its obligations under sections 11 and\n12 of the PDPA\n10\n\nThe Organisation’s admission that it had not appointed a DPO at the\n\nmaterial time is a breach of section 11(3) of the PDPA. In this regard, section\n11(3) requires organisations to designate one or more individuals (typically\nreferred to as a DPO) to be responsible for ensuring that they comply with the\nPDPA. The importance of appointing a DPO in ensuring the proper\nimplementation of an organisation’s data protection policies and practices, as\nwell as compliance with the PDPA was emphasized in Re M Stars Movers &\nLogistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37].\n11\n\nSection 12 of the PDPA requires organisation to develop and implement\n\npolicies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its\nobligations under the PDPA, and to communicate information about such\npolicies and practices to its employees (among other obligations).\n12\n\nAt the material time, the Organisation had a privacy policy to inform\n\ntutors and students on how it collects, use, disclose, manage and safeguard\npersonal information provided by them in the course of accessing and using the\nOrganisation’s website.\n13\n\nThe Organisation did not employ full-time staff but employed part-time\n\nhome-based tuition coordinators to liaise with tutors and students, process e4\n\n\fChampionTutor Inc\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 25\n\ninvoices and follow up on payment. These part-time coordinators had access to\npersonal data of the tutors and students in the course of their work. However,\nthe Organisation did not have any internal data protection policies which specify\nthe rules and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of personal data.\nThis omission meant that part-time tuition coordinators were not provided with\nany form of guidance with the PDPA and amounts to a breach of section 12 of\nthe PDPA. An organisation that relies wholly on part-time staff needs to pay\nespecial attention to ensuring that its policies can be easily accessible and that\nit has an effective system for promoting awareness and training part-time staff\non its data protection policies and practices.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n14\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nsections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under\nsection 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as it deems fit\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nmillion.\n15\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on the Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account\nas a mitigating factor that the Organisation had cooperated with investigations\nand was forthcoming in its response.\n16\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the Organisation to do the following:\n(a)\n\nPay a financial penalty of S$5,000.00 within 30 days from the\n\ndate of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at the rate\n\n5\n\n\fChampionTutor Inc\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 25\n\nspecified in the Rules of Court5 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full; and\n(b)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of the Commissioner’s directions,\n\ndevelop and implement an internal data protection policy and appoint a\nDPO.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n5\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $24,000 and $12,000 was imposed on CDP and Toppan Security Printing respectively for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the data of CDP’s account holders from unauthorised disclosure.

The\nprocess may involve both the organisations and vendors, which requires a concerted\neffort to protect personal data. This case presents the issue of division of\nresponsibility in protecting personal data under the PDPA in such circumstances.\n\nBackground and Material Facts\n\n2.\n\nThis case concerns the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of 1,358\n\naccount holders of the Central Depository (Pte) Limited (“CDP”) when their\npersonal data was wrongly printed in the notification letters of other account holders\nand sent out. The incident occurred on or about 27 June 2017.\n\n3.\n\nThe exposed data included the name and/or CDP securities account number\n\n(“exposed primary identifiers”) which constitute personal data of the individual.\nIn some notification letters, additional information on the securities owned by the\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nindividual (eg name of security and total amount of dividends or distribution for the\nsecurity) was also disclosed. These, when combined with the exposed primary\nidentifiers, also constitute personal data of the individual.\n\nParties\n\n4.\n\nCDP provides integrated clearing, settlement and depository facilities for\n\ncustomers in the Singapore securities market. Toppan Security Printing Pte Ltd\n(“TSP”) was engaged by CDP to carry out secure printing and dispatch of\ndocuments, including notification letters of CDP’s customers. Part of TSP’s\nengagement with CDP included developing the necessary bespoke software to print\nthe relevant documents.\n\nThe printing process between CDP and TSP\n5.\n\nThere were three categories of notification letters to be printed depending\n\non the type of investment(s) held by the account holder – (i) Distribution\nReinvestment Plan – “DRP” or “D Type”, (ii) Scrip Dividend Scheme – “SRP” or\n“S Type”, and (iii) “Others” – “Others” or “O Type”. In this case, only the “DRP”\nor “D Type” notification letters are relevant because the data breach only affected\nthis category of notification letters. Notification letters are sent to account holders\nto notify them of changes to and movements in their accounts.\n\n6.\n\nDuring investigations, CDP and TSP represented to the Personal Data\n\nProtection Commission (“PDPC”) that the notification letters were printed in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n(a)\n\nCDP sent the raw data in files over an encrypted channel to TSP.\nAccording to CDP, each file may have contained raw data for all 3\ntypes of notification letters.\n\n3\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nTSP decrypted the files for processing. The processing included the\npre-processing, layout and printing stages.\n\n(c)\n\nThe file provided by CDP contained the raw data in a plain text file.\nThe data for a single account consisted of multiple lines. Each line\ncomprised a label, which identified the type of data, and the\ncorresponding data.

As can be seen from the above table, the\nlabels were designated “D00001”, “D00002”, “D00004” and\n“D00005”. For the lines with D00001, D00002 and D00005 labels,\nthere was only one such line per account, while there could be more\nthan just one line with D00004 labels for each account. The type of\ndata that correspond to each of the labels is as follows:\n\nLabel\n\nType of data\n\nD00001\n\nname of the security.\n\nD00002\n\naccount number, account holder name and mailing address\n\nD00004\n\ninformation on credits to the account for the security. The data\ncorresponding to the D00004 label can be further categorised into\nTaxable Income, Tax Exempt Income, Capital and Other Gains, such\nthat there could be up to 4 lines with the D00004 label for each account.\n\nD00005\n\ntotal value of the D00004 lines for each individual account\nAt the pre-processing stage, TSP’s program would carry out checks\non the raw data to determine the integrity of the data and format the\ndata into a consistent structure (‘formatted data’), primarily to insert\nD00001 lines where multiple account holders have invested in the\nsame security.\n\n5\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n(d)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nAt the layout stage, a program extracts the formatted data and\npopulates the data in each of the notification letters in the following\nlayout:\n\n(e)\n\nThe final stage is the printing stage where the notification letters are\nprinted as laid out and populated in the layout stage.\n\n7.\n\nBefore the deployment of the printing process, TSP had carried out user\n\nacceptance tests (“UAT”) on behalf of CDP, and the test results were presented to\nand approved by CDP.\n\nThe data breach incident\n\n8.\n\nPrior to the data breach incident in June 2017, TSP had carried out\n\nsuccessful print runs for S Type notification letters.\n\n6\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n9.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nHowever, as indicated at paragraph 2 above, when the D Type notification\n\nletters were printed the first time, they were printed incorrectly. This occurred as\nthe raw data only contained one D00004 line for some accounts instead of the four\nD00004 lines of data for which the layout stage of TSP’s system was programed.\n\n10.\n\nWhere only one D00004 line was present, the notification letter should have\n\nappeared in a format similar to the following sample letter\n\n11.\n\nInstead each incorrectly printed notification letter included data which did\n\nnot belong to that account. An example of a notification letter (using fictitious\ninformation) that was printed and sent out follows:\n\n7\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n12.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nA comparison between the sample notification letter which was correctly\n\nprinted as shown in paragraph 10 above and an example of the incorrectly printed\nletter shown in paragraph 11 above shows that the information marked out within\nthe larger oval ought not to have been printed. The information in the 3rd, 4th and\n5th columns, which has been marked out, shows information relating to another\nindividual, including his name (ie John Smith), securities account number (ie 987600019-24689) and the security invested in (ie LMN Trust Holdings). Also the total\nmarked out within the smaller oval is also incorrect.\n\n13.\n\nThe incorrectly printed notification letters resulted from the programming\n\nof TSP’s system at the layout stage to expect exactly four lines of D00004 data for\neach account, instead of allowing it to accept up to a maximum of four lines of\nD00004 data. As will be discussed below, this was due to TSP misunderstanding\neach account to always consist of four D00004 lines (i.e. the categories of Taxable\n\n8\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nIncome, Tax Exempt Income, Capital and Other Gains). However, in reality each\naccount may consist of between one to four D00004 lines. The manner in which\nthis error resulted in the incorrectly printed notification letters is described as\nfollows:\n\n(a)\n\nTaking the below table of raw data as an example, at the layout stage,\nthe program had correctly read the 1st and 2nd lines, which had the\nD00001 and D00002 labels respectively.\n\nLine\nNo.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nD00001ABC TRUST CO\nD000029876-5432112346\nD00004Taxable Income\nD00005329862520\nD00001LMN TRUST CO\nD000029876-0001924689\nD00004Taxable Income\nD00005000012541\n\n(b)\n\n12345678X\nMR ABC\n\n123 DEF ST\n\n654321\n\nY Singapore\n\n98 WXY ST\n\n987456\n\nY Singapore\n\n329862520\n87654321X\nMR QLM\n000012541\n\nThe program did the same for the 3rd line which had a D00004 label\n(i.e. for the Taxable Income category).\n\n(c)\n\nHowever, as the raw data did not include any D00004 lines for the\n“Tax Exempt Income”, “Capital” and “Other Gains” categories, the\nlayout program instead assigned lines 4 (which was the total credits to\nthe account), 5 (the name of the security for the next account) and 6\n(and the account holder name and residential address of the said next\naccount) to these D00004 categories in respect of the first account.\n\n(d)\n\nThe program then ignored the 7th line from the D00004 label of the\nnext account.\n\n(e)\n\nAccordingly, when the printing was subsequently triggered, the\nnotification letter that was printed had contained the data of the\n\n9\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nD00001, D00002 and D00004 labels from the next account. It also\nskipped the printing of the notification letter for that next account,\nsince parts of the data had been merged with the current notification\nletter and the trailing data field was ignored.\n\n(f)\n\nThis error was repeated for the other notification letters of the affected\naccount holders.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the incident, CDP had issued apology letters to the affected\n\naccount holders, and halted its engagement with TSP in respect of its print services.\n\nFindings and Assessment\n\nIssues for determination\n\n15.\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commissioner are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nWhat obligations did CDP and TSP each owe under the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in respect of the personal data of the\naffected account holders;\n\n(b)\n\nWhether CDP complied with its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA in respect of the data breach incident that occurred;\n\n(c)\n\nWhether TSP complied with its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA in respect of the data breach incident that occurred.\n\n10\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nCDP’s and TSP’s obligations to protect personal data under the PDPA\n\nRelevant provisions under the PDPA\n\n16.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect personal\n\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n17.\n\nThis obligation is also conferred on the data intermediary under Section 4(2)\n\nof the PDPA. Further, Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall\nhave the same obligation under the PDPA in respect of the personal data processed\non its behalf and for its purposes by a data intermediary as if the personal data were\nprocessed by the organisation itself.\n\n18.\n\nThe duties of an organisation and data intermediary under section 24 of the\n\nPDPA has been examined in precedents, e.g. Re Singapore Cricket Association and\nAnother [2018] SGPDPC 19. This case gives occasion to re-state that duty.\n\nRelationship between CDP and TSP in complying with Section 24 of the PDPA\n\n19.\n\nIn this case, CDP is the organisation and TSP is the data intermediary in\n\nrespect of the personal data of the account holders. Both CDP and TSP are obliged\nunder the PDPA to protect the personal data of account holders pursuant to Section\n24 of the PDPA stated above.\n\n20.\n\nThe overlap in obligation for organisation and data intermediary to protect\n\npersonal data means, in practical terms, that organisations and their data\nintermediaries would necessarily have to work together in formulating the right\nprotective measures and processes.\n\n11\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n21.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nThis is especially pertinent in this case because both CDP and TSP had roles\n\nin developing the system or process by which the notification letters were printed.\nAmongst other things, CDP was the one which determined the format of the raw\ndata and the specifications for which TSP would build its program around to\ngenerate the notification letters which required the processing of personal data and\nthe printing and dispatch of those notification letters.\n\n22.\n\nHence, both CDP and TSP had the obligation to ensure that the printing\n\nsystem and process they developed would sufficiently protect the personal data it\nwas handling and processing. As part of this, there needed to be proper testing of\nthe system and implementation of exception handling and checks to prevent errors\nfrom compromising the security of the personal data. In the Commissioner’s view,\nthis responsibility fell on both CDP and TSP.\n\n23.\n\nOne of the ways in which organisations can develop a system which protects\n\npersonal data is by adopting a Data Protection by Design approach in which\norganisations consider the protection of personal data from the earliest possible\ndesign stage of any project and throughout the project’s operational lifestyle. This\nmay be very relevant to organisations which are looking to develop any new\nprocesses that deals with personal data (as in this case). This is a design approach\nthat is advocated in the PDPC’s Guide to Developing a Data Protection\nManagement Programme.1\n\nWhether CDP complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n24.\n\nCDP’s duty under section 24 was to make reasonable arrangements to\n\nprotect the personal data to be processed on its behalf. As explained at paragraphs\n21 and 22 above, CDP had the responsibility in the development, testing and\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/guide-to-developing-adpmp---011117.pdf at p22\n\n12\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nimplementation of exception handling of the system to ensure that they would\nadequately protect personal data. In the Commissioner’s view, this entails:\n\n(a)\n\nProviding clear specifications and representative test data that covered\nthe full range of data to be processed and the various processing\nscenarios. Specific to the present context, this meant making clear that\nthere was a range in the number of D00004 lines (ie between 1 to 4\nlines) per account in the data file supplied by CDP. In Re Singapore\nCricket Association and Another [2018] SGPDPC 19, the Deputy\nCommissioner had found that the provision of proper and clear\ninstructions to a developer of a website that holds personal data should\nform part of the protection obligations of the organisation. In failing\nto do so, the Singapore Cricket Association was found in breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA. The same principles apply here.\n\n(b)\n\nAdvising on the scope of the UAT since the test is based on test data\nprovided by CDP. CDP would therefore need to supply test data that\ncovered the full range of scenarios for processing in order for there to\nbe proper UAT testing. Again, this included supplying test data that\nallowed for a range of D00004 lines to be tested.\n\n(c)\n\nEnsuring that the requirements that it provided anticipated and catered\nfor processes that could handle exceptions and could verify that the\nprocessing was carried out correctly.\n\n25.\n\nThe Commissioner finds that CDP did not discharge its duty under section\n\n24 of the PDPA:\n\n(a)\n\nCDP did not provide reasonably clear specifications to TSP. CDP\nknew that some of its D Type letters had just 1 D00004 line instead of\n\n13\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\n4. However, the specifications that CDP provided to TSP did not make\nthis clear:\n\ni.\n\nThere was no explicit statement by CDP making clear to TSP\nthat the number of D00004 lines may vary.\n\nii.\n\nInstead, what was indicated in CDP’s specification was that the\nD00004 lines was “repetitive”. This could be understood to\nmean that there would be more than one D00004 line, and since\nCDP had only provided TSP with samples which had four\nD00004 lines at that stage, TSP misunderstood this to mean that\nthey would always occur four times, ie four D00004 lines for\neach notification letter. Had there been more clarity from CDP\non what it meant at that point, the issue may have been averted.\n\n(b)\n\nCDP did not ensure that the UAT carried out was robust enough to\ntest for variations in the number of D00004 lines that may be\nencountered in actual cases. This is because CDP had only supplied\ntest data that had exactly four D00004 lines per account, for both\ninitial tests as well as UAT, and, as such, did not detect any problems\nwith variations to the number of D00004 lines of data. The test data\nsupplied also gave the mistaken impression that there were exactly\nfour D00004 lines of data for each notification letter. A wider range\nof test data would have allowed for broader scoping of the UAT,\nwhich is lacking in this case.\n\n(c)\n\nCDP did not specify exceptional scenarios and how the printing\nsystem would handle exceptions or verify that processing was correct.\n\n14\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\ni.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nAs the organisation with primary and supervisory responsibility\nto protect personal data,2 CDP did not ensure that the printing\nsystem could detect and raise alerts when an exception or error\nwas encountered.\n\nii.\n\nAs will be examined below, TSP’s layout program did not detect\nthat there was only one line of D00004 data supplied in respect\nof some accounts, instead of the four D00004 lines it was hard\ncoded to read, and to trigger an alert. Instead, it continued to\nextract or ignore the subsequent lines erroneously. TSP’s layout\nprogram had therefore lacked the capability to handle\nexceptions or issues arising from the data supplied.\n\niii.\n\nAdditionally, CDP also did not satisfy itself during UAT that\nTSP’s system had the means to verify that the data was\nprocessed correctly throughout all the stages of the process.\n\n26.\n\nHaving regard to the above, the Commissioner finds CDP to be in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether TSP complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n27.\n\nThe Commissioner likewise finds that TSP has did not discharge its duty\n\nunder section 24 of the PDPA. First, TSP ought to have ensured that the software it\nused correctly processed and printed out the relevant data. Giving TSP the benefit\nof doubt and assuming that it had processed them correctly, TSP would have\nunderstood the requirements to mean that there were always four lines of D00004\ndata. TSP’s layout program did not detect that in this case, there was only one line\n\n2\n\nSee Re The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3696 and Another [2017] SGPDPC 11\nand Re The Cellar Door and Another [2016] SGPDPC 22\n\n15\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nof D00004 data; and it went on to read the subsequent lines as though they were\nD00004 data. If the program was hardcoded correctly to expect 4 lines of D00004\ndata, it ought to have recognised that some accounts only contained one line of\nD00004 data and the system ought to have raised an alert in cases of deviation.\n\n28.\n\nThe program read the subsequent lines incorrectly as if they were D00004\n\ndata as the program did not check for four occurrences of D00004 labels per account\nbut assumed that this was always the case. Thus, even based on TSP’s\nmisunderstanding that there will always be four D00004 lines per account, TSP’s\nprogram was not designed to detect an exception to this (albeit mistakenly)\nexpected feature. The incorrect processing of the data by TSP’s program at the\nlayout stage was what caused the notification letters to be printed and sent wrongly.\nThere was a lack of exception and error handling such that it cannot be said that\nTSP had implemented a reasonable security arrangement that would protect\npersonal data.\n\n29.\n\nThe incident may have been prevented if the developers of the program had\n\nco-ordinated and adopted the same interpretation of the requirements. In this regard,\nTSP’s program incorporated 2 checksum tests at the pre-processing stage. One\nchecksum test was a check that the value of the D00005 data for each account\ncorrectly totalled the value of the D00004 lines for each account. The second\nchecksum test calculated the total value of the D00005 data of all the accounts sent\nto TSP for printing. The pre-processing stage of TSP’s system would then check if\nthe data it received is accurate by comparing the total value of the D00005 data of\nall accounts CDP sent to TSP with the total value stored in the very last line of the\nfile as a separate record. However, these checksum tests at the pre-processing stage\nwere ineffective to address the unauthorised disclosure in this matter; it was merely\na check on the integrity of the file received by TSP.\n\n30.\n\nUltimately, TSP did not implement the proper capability to detect or handle\n\nexceptions or errors in the processing and printing of the notification letters. It is\n\n16\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nfundamental to the protection of personal data that the system handling personal\ndata is able to detect and carry out exception and error handling. Otherwise, this\nmay lead to a system failure which poses risks of a data leak or data breach (as in\nthis case).\n\n31.\n\nIt is timely for the Commissioner to refer to the PDPC’s Guide to Printing\n\nProcesses for Organisations3, which states that organisations should consider the\nfollowing, amongst other things, for their printing process:\n\n“Appropriate juncture for the check(s) i.e. performed at a suitable stage\nfor corrective actions to be able to reverse and/or eliminate any potential\nerror(s).\nIntensity and extent of check(s) should be proportionate to the volume and\nsensitivity of the personal data present in the printing process.”\n\n32.\n\nTSP did not carry out a proper test on the system. It ought to have tested for\n\nvariations in the number of D00004 lines that is provided to verify whether TSP’s\nprogram is able to handle those variations such as different number of lines for the\nD00004 labels. These variations may occur due to inadvertence or mistake, and\nTSP ought to test whether its program is able to handle them.\n\n33.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds TSP to be in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Guide-to-PrintingProcesses-for-Organisations-030518.pdf\n\n17\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nDirections\n\n34.\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the\n\nOrganisations such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Organisations’\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the organisations to pay a\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the Commissioner\nthinks fit.\n\n35.\n\nPursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and the investigation and assessment\n\nof this matter having been completed, the Commissioner is satisfied that CDP and\nTSP did not make reasonable security arrangements and are in breach of section 24\nof the PDPA.\n\n36.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs:\n\n(a)\n\nThat CDP pays a financial penalty of S$24,000 within 30 days from\nthe date of the directions, failing which interest shall be payable on\nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty;\n\n(b)\n\nThat TSP pays a financial penalty of S$18,000 within 30 days from\nthe date of the directions, failing which interest shall be payable on\nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\n37.\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nCDP in this case, the Commissioner took into account the following aggravating\nand mitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nCDP is the central depository for financial market account information\nin Singapore. Individual account holders must be able to rely on CDP\nto protect their personal data.\n\n18\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nThe personal data that was disclosed comprised of financial\ninformation of the individual, which is sensitive personal data.\n\n(c)\n\nThat said, CDP took steps to prevent recurrence following the data\nbreach incident.\n\n(d)\n\n38.\n\nCDP also promptly notified the affected individuals and the PDPC.\n\nCDP submitted representations on the proposed decision in this case by way\n\nof a letter dated 8 April 2019. In its representations, CDP acknowledged that the\nspecifications, test data and test scope provided to TSP could have been, and should\nbe, improved. However, it was of the view that it had not breached section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n39.\n\nIn this regard, CDP asserts that TSP ought to have reviewed the\n\nspecifications, test data and user acceptance tests (“UAT”) for both the S Type and\nD type letters, instead of just the D Type letters, as the specifications for the print\nprogramme would have been similar. According to CDP, it had provided a S Type\nletter template to TSP which consisted of a maximum of two D00004 lines and\nprovided UAT test data for S Type letters which consisted of one D00004 line. CDP\nasserts that “[f]rom this TSP ought to have been aware that the actual data sent by\nCDP for printing may vary from the templates/test data provided”. Also, CDP\nasserts that it has specified in the specification that the number of the D00004 lines\nwould be “repetitive”, i.e. “not a fixed number of lines of crediting details but with\nvariations within this type of crediting details”. Further, CDP asserts that it had used\nthe word “always” to indicate if a value or the number of lines is fixed or static and\nit did not indicate that the number of D00004 lines “always” consisted of 4 lines.\n\n40.\n\nThe Commissioner agrees that TSP is also liable for unauthorised disclosure\n\nof personal data in the wrongly printed notification letters and has already found\n\n19\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nTSP to be in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. Nevertheless, CDP’s representations\ndo not absolve CDP of its shortcomings in respect of this incident. CDP’s use of\nthe word “repetitive” in its specifications was ambiguous when considered together\nwith the fact that the test data provided to TSP for the D Type letters all contained\nfour D00004 lines per account. This led TSP to assume that “repetitive” meant four\nD00004 lines for each account. It did not help that even though the test data\nprovided had some records with four D00004 lines and others with fewer D00004\nlines, the records with four D00004 lines were associated with D Type letters. Even\nthough CDP intended for the dataset to be applicable for all types of letters, its\nomission to inform TSP led TSP to make the assumption that D Type letters always\nhad four D00004 lines. CDP could have expressly instructed TSP that the test data\nprovided was to be treated as applying across all the various types of letters and not\nmerely the individual types of letters to which the test data corresponded.\n\n41.\n\nCDP also asserted that it had requested TSP to conduct an additional visual\n\ncheck on the notification letters and that if TSP had done so, they would have caught\nthe error. In relation to this, CDP referred to a Document Management Services\nAgreement (“DMSA”) entered into between CDP and TSP to support its assertion.\nHowever, a review of the DMSA does not reveal a specific requirement to conduct\na visual check of the letters that are sent out. In the circumstances, the\nCommissioner did not accept CDP’s representations that it had instructed TSP to\nconduct a visual check of the notification letters.\n\n42.\n\nFinally, CDP requested that, should the Commissioner maintain his finding\n\nthat CDP was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA, the financial penalty imposed\nbe reduced. In this regard, CDP made 2 submissions. First, CDP acknowledged that\nthe disclosed personal data was sensitive but asserted that the potential harm to the\naffected individuals was relatively limited and not likely to lead to any loss or\nprejudice. The Commissioner agrees that there is no evidence of financial loss or\ndamage. The absence of financial loss or damage has already been taken into\nconsideration in determining the financial penalty imposed in this case.\n\n20\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n43.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nSecondly, CDP also referred to its prompt notification of the error to\n\naffected individuals and to the PDPC, as well as to the proactive and prompt steps\nCDP took to remediate the matter. The Commissioner accepts these points and has\nincluded them in paragraph 37(d) above.\n\n44.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner maintains his finding that CDP was\n\nin breach of section 24 of the PDPA. However, taking into account CDP’s\nrepresentations, the Commissioner has decided to reduce the financial penalty from\nthe initial quantum of $30,000 to the amount stated in paragraph 36(a) above.\n\n45.\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on TSP\n\nin this case, the Commissioner took into account the following aggravating and\nmitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nThe personal data that was disclosed comprised of financial\ninformation of the individual, which is sensitive personal data.\n\n(b)\n\nTSP was cooperative and willing to provide information on a timely\nbasis to the Commission;\n\n(c)\n\nTSP took steps to prevent recurrence following the data breach\nincident.\n\n46.\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs CDP to carry out the following within 60\n\ndays:\n\n(a)\n\nFor CDP’s data protection officer (appointed under section 11(3) of\nthe PDPA) to be given authority to assess the data protection\nrequirements in developing new printing processes that involves\npersonal data; and\n\n21\n\n\fRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited & Anor\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 24\n\nFor CDP to provide the full range of expected processing scenarios in\nthe test script during development testing and UAT for all types of\nprinting jobs (except for ad-hoc printing jobs) which are being carried\nout by TSP as at the date of this direction.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n22\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions, including a financial penalty of $5,000, were imposed on AgcDesign for breaches of the PDPA.

(the “Organisation”) provides interior designing\n\nservices for commercial and residential properties. Between 5 and 9 May 2018,\nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received\ncomplaints alleging that the Organisation had used the complainants’ names and\nresidential addresses without the complainants’ consent to send them marketing\nmailers. In the course of investigations by the Commission, it was found that\nthe Organisation had sent the mailers using information from a database of\nproperty-related information obtained from a third party. That database had\nbeen compiled from information on caveats lodged with the Singapore Land\nAuthority, which was publicly available.\n\n2\n\nIt also emerged in the course of investigations that the Organisation had\n\nnot appointed any data protection officer (“DPO”) and it had not developed and\nput in place any data protection policies. Upon being notified of the complaints,\nthe Organisation appointed a DPO and issued certain verbal instructions to its\nemployees concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal data.\n\n1\n\n\fAgcDesign Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 23\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n3\n\nSection 17 of the PDPA, read with the relevant provisions of the Second,\n\nThird and Fourth Schedules to the PDPA, permits organisations to collect, use\nand disclose personal data which is publicly available without the consent of the\nindividuals concerned. The Commission therefore did not proceed further with\nits investigation into the Organisation’s use of personal data in this case and I\nam satisfied that it is unnecessary to do so.\n\n4\n\nIn relation to the Organisation’s failures to appoint a DPO and develop\n\nand implement any data protection policy, these are required under sections\n11(3) and 12 respectively of the PDPA. In particular, section 11(3) requires\norganisations to designate one or more individuals (typically referred to as a\nDPO) to be responsible for ensuring that they comply with the PDPA. Section\n12 of the PDPA requires organisations to (among other things):\n\n(a)\n\ndevelop and implement policies and practices that are necessary\nfor the organisation to meet the obligations of the organisation\nunder the PDPA; and\n\n(b)\n\n5\n\ncommunicate information about such policies and to its staff.\n\nThe importance of these requirements have been emphasised multiple\n\ntimes in previous decisions. For example, it is important for an organisation to\ndocument its data protection policies and practices in writing as they serve to\nincrease awareness and ensure accountability of the organisation’s obligations\nunder the PDPA (Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [32]). Similarly,\nappointing a DPO is important in ensuring the proper implementation of an\n\n2\n\n\fAgcDesign Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 23\n\norganisation’s data protection policies and practices, as well as compliance with\nthe PDPA (see eg Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017]\nSGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37]).\n\n6\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation was clearly in breach of sections\n\n11(3) and 12 of the PDPA. While it has since appointed a DPO, it has not yet\ndeveloped written policies and practices necessary to ensure its compliance with\nthe PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n\n7\n\nHaving found the Organisation in breach of sections 11(3) and 12, I have\n\ndecided to issue it the following directions under section 29 of the PDPA:\n\n(a)\n\nTo develop and implement, within 30 days of the date of this\ndirection, a data protection policy and the appropriate written\ninternal policies and practices to comply with the provisions of\nthe PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\nTo communicate such policies and practices to its employees and\nconduct (or ensure that its employees attend) a suitable training\ncourse in order to ensure that employees handling personal data\nunderstand and comply with the requirements of the PDPA, both\nwithin 60 days of the date of this direction;\n\n(c)\n\nTo inform the Commission of the completion of each of the\nabove within 7 days of completion; and\n\n3\n\n\fAgcDesign Pte.

Spize operates a chain of food &\nbeverage outlets in Singapore. Part of its offering involves allowing customers to\nplace orders through its online portal, https://orders.spize.sg (“Site”). The orders\nplaced online will then be delivered to the customer at the stipulated address.\n\nMaterial facts\n2.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”)\n\nreceived a complaint from a member of the public regarding the Site. A link on the\nSite named “Call Center” (“Link”) had allowed members of the public to view 3\ntabs: “Customer Ordering”, “Restaurants” and “Order Dashboard”. Under the\n“Order Dashboard” tab, approximately 148 customers’ personal data – specifically\ntheir names, contact numbers, email addresses and residential addresses (“personal\ndata sets”) – were disclosed (“Incident”). The Incident was caused by a user\nlogging onto the Managing Director’s administrator account to enable the Link to\nbe publicly accessible on or around 9 February 2017. The Link was intended only\nfor internal use and not accessible to the public.\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n3.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nSpize engaged Novadine, Inc. (“Novadine”) to develop and host their Site\n\nand online ordering system in or around 2012. Personal data sets collected through\nthe online ordering system were stored in databases within Novadine’s servers.\nUpon receiving news of the Incident on 14 August 2017, Spize requested Novadine\nto rectify the weakness in the Site. Novadine subsequently disabled the Link. The\nLink has not been publicly accessible since 16 August 2017.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nIssues for determination\n\n4.\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commission are as follows:\n\na.\n\nWhether Spize had breached section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (“PDPA”);\n\nb.\n\nWhether Spize had breached section 11(3) of the PDPA by failing to\ndesignate an individual (“DPO”) to be responsible for Spize’s\ncompliance with the PDPA, and section 12(a) of the PDPA by failing\nto develop and implement policies and practices necessary to meet its\nobligations under the PDPA;\n\nc.\n\nWhether Novadine was a data intermediary of Spize;\n\nd.\n\nWhether Spize had breached section 12(d)(i) of the PDPA by failing to\nbe in a position to make information available on request about its\npolicies and practices which addressed the processing of personal data\nby Novadine on behalf of Spize; and\n\n3\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\ne.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nWhether Spize had transferred personal data outside of Singapore in\nbreach of section 26 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether Spize had breached its obligation to protect personal data under section\n24 of the PDPA\n\n5.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect personal\n\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n6.\n\nSpize had outsourced the hosting, support and maintenance of its online\n\nordering system to Novadine. However, that did not detract from its obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA. In Re The Management Corporation Strata Title\nPlan No. 3696 [2017] SGPDPC 11, the PDPC had found that an organisation has\nthe primary role and duty to protect personal data, even if the organisation had\nengaged another organisation (a data intermediary) to carry out the processing of\npersonal data on its behalf.\n\n7.\n\nInvestigations revealed that Spize had failed to put in place or ensure the\n\nadoption of reasonable security arrangements to prevent data breaches such as the\nIncident from occurring.\n\n8.\n\nFirst, Spize lacked knowledge of the Novadine system – in particular,\n\nknowledge that enabling the Link could disclose its customers’ personal data to the\npublic. Based on Spize’s responses to the PDPC’s queries during investigations, it\nwas apparent that Spize and its Managing Director, whose account was used to\nenable the Link, did not know about the existence of the Link or the consequences\nof enabling it.\n\n4\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n9.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nSecond, Spize lacked knowledge of the security arrangements that were in\n\nplace within the Novadine system to protect personal data under its control that was\nbeing processed on its behalf. Spize had to rely on the answers provided by\nNovadine in describing how the Site and online ordering system worked. It was also\nunable to describe its arrangements with Novadine to process, protect and manage\nthe personal data.\n\n10.\n\nSpize’s lack of knowledge about how personal data was processed on its\n\nbehalf by Novadine was caused and/or compounded by the lack of records in its\npossession. The staff previously responsible for documenting Spize’s arrangement\nwith Novadine had since left Spize. Spize also did not have any staff responsible to\nmanage the relationship between Spize and Novadine.\n\n11.\n\nThe sum effect of the above is that Spize lacked knowledge of how the\n\npersonal data that was being processed on its behalf by the Novadine system was\nprotected.\n\n12.\n\nThird, Spize’s administrator accounts for the Novadine system, in particular\n\nthe Managing Director’s administrator account, lacked the necessary authentication\nand authorisation measures.\n\n13.\n\nSpize mentioned that there was no password policy in place at the time of\n\nthe Incident. Spize also acknowledged it did not set a mandatory password\nrequirement when Novadine first created the accounts. The Managing Director’s\npassword was rudimentary and made up of 8 digits. According to the PDPC’s\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised on 20 January\n2017), there ought to be at least 1 alphabetical character and 1 numeric character\nfor such passwords. Although the PDPC Guide serves only to provide guidance, it\nis an indicator of how far short the password complexity and security was in this\ncase.\n\n5\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n14.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nSpize also did not mandate that its Managing Director’s administrator\n\naccount password be changed regularly. Nor did Spize monitor and/or ensure there\nwas proper access to the Managing Director’s administrator account. Indeed, Spize\nacknowledged that the account password was shared among several people at the\nmaterial time, but could not provide details on the identity of these people and their\nrespective designations.\n\n15.\n\nThe need for proper password management policies and regular change of\n\npasswords was made clear in the earlier decision of Re Orchard Turn Developments\nPte. Ltd. [2017] SGPDPC 12. In that case, the PDPC had highlighted that an\norganisation’s password management policies and practices, which includes the\nregular change of passwords, formed an integral part of the security arrangements\nto protect personal data. Having failed to implement such proper password policies\nand practices, the PDPC had found the organisation in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n16.\n\nAdditionally, the improper handling and use of administrator accounts\n\nresulted in Spize not having control and to monitor which employees had access to\nthe Managing Director’s account. Consequently, when an unidentified party\nenabled the Link on 9 February 2017, Spize was unable to identify the employee\nresponsible for doing so and discover the full facts surrounding the Incident.\n\n17.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, Spize was found to have failed to make reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect its customers’ personal data under its control or in\nits possession. Accordingly, the Commissioner is satisfied that Spize was in breach\nof section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether Spize had breached the Openness Obligation sections 11(3) and 12(a)\nof the PDPA\n\n6\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n18.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nThe PDPC’s investigations revealed that Spize did not have any data\n\nprotection policies, internal guidelines nor any accompanying terms and conditions\nin place at the material time. Spize also only appointed its Data Protection Officer\non 21 August 2017, one week after the PDPC notified Spize of the weakness in its\nSite. In light of these shortcomings, the Commissioner is satisfied that Spize had\nbreached its Openness Obligation under sections 11(3) and 12(a) of the PDPA.\n\nWhether Novadine was a data intermediary of Spize and whether Spize breached\nsection 12(d)(i) of the PDPA\n\n19.\n\nAn organisation has the same obligations as its data intermediary in respect\n\nof personal data processed on its behalf: see section 4(3) of the PDPA. In this\nregard, an organisation that engages a data intermediary to process personal data on\nits behalf would need to ensure that there are appropriate policies and practices in\nplace (under section 12 of the PDPA) governing the data intermediary’s processing\nof data. The question then is whether Novadine was a data intermediary of Spize\nand, if so, whether Spize has complied with section 12 of the PDPA in respect of\npersonal data processed on its behalf.\n\n20.\n\nNovadine has been in the business of providing software solutions for online\n\nfood retail businesses since 2007. It is based in the USA and offers its enterpriseclass Point-Of-Sale integrated online ordering software to multi-unit restaurant\nchains. When orders are placed on the Site, Novadine processes such orders and\nhosts them on its servers. Novadine is therefore the provider of software-as-aservice, instead of an off-the-shelf software vendor.\n\n21.\n\nSpize had been using the ordering system provided by and run by Novadine\n\nsince 2012 to process online orders from its Singapore customers. During this\nprocess, Novadine collected and processed the personal data of Spize’s customers\nin Singapore. Novadine collected the customers’ personal data through an\n\n7\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\napplication designed, operated and maintained by Novadine through Spize’s\nwebsite. Spize’s website and online ordering system were stored in Novadine’s\nservers. Although Spize, when asked, could not produce any agreements or\ncontracts with Novadine, on the totality of the documents produced by Spize, the\nCommissioner was satisfied that Novadine had processed personal data of Spize’s\ncustomers.\n\n22.\n\nBased on the above, the Commissioner is satisfied of the following. First,\n\nNovadine had processed personal data of Spize’s customers in line with the\narrangement stated above. Novadine was therefore Spize’s data intermediary at the\ntime of the Incident. Section 4(2) of the PDPA imposes on organisations that engage\ndata intermediaries to do so “pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in\nwriting”. Spize was unable to provide documentary record to show that it had in\nplace a contract with Novadine. The PDPC had made various requests for\nproduction of such documentation, but Spize was unable to produce information on\nits contract and/or arrangement with Novadine.\n\n23.\n\nSecond, Spize ought to have ensured that the policies and practices\n\ndeveloped under section 12(a) of the PDPA addressed Novadine’s processing of\npersonal data on its behalf. Given that Novadine was Spize’s data intermediary,\nSpize should also have had policies in place that addressed how Novadine\nprocessed personal data on Spize’s behalf. As discussed in the preceding paragraph,\none specific category of policies and practices is contractual documentation relating\nto the scope of the data intermediary relationship. Another is the category of policies\nand practices relating to the transfer of its clients’ personal data outside Singapore\nthat will be discussed in the next section.\n\n24.\n\nThird, it follows that Spize was also in breach of its obligation under section\n\n12(d)(i) of the PDPA to make information available on request about the policies\nand practices it had implemented, which addressed how Novadine was to process\n\n8\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\npersonal data on its behalf. Accordingly, Spize was in breach of section 12(d)(i) of\nthe PDPA.\n\nWhether Spize had transferred personal data outside Singapore in breach of\nsection 26 of the PDPA\n\n25.\n\nSpize knew that Novadine was a software-as-a-service provider that was\n\nbased in the United States of America. It does not have any operations or other\npresence in Singapore. In choosing to use a data intermediary that is based outside\nSingapore, Spize had to ensure that Novadine was bound by legally enforceable\nobligations to protect personal data that it received to a standard comparable to that\nunder the PDPA: Reg 9(1)(b) of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014\n(PDPR). Pertinent to this case, Spize could have done so either by assessing that\nNovadine was subject to domestic laws in the US that provided comparative\nprotection: Reg 10(1)(a) of the PDPR; or through a contract: Reg 10(1)(b) read with\n10(2) of the PDPR. Alternatively, if Spize determined that the transfer came within\none of the deeming provisions under Reg 9(3) of the PDPR, then the assessment of\ncomparable protection under US law or imposition of comparable protection\nthrough contract will not be necessary. The most pertinent exception in this case is\nReg 9(3)(b) of the PDPR, as the personal data of Spize customers were transferred\nto Novadine for the processing of their online food orders. As such, it could possibly\nbe a transfer that is “necessary for the performance of a contract between the\nindividual and the transferring organisation”: Reg 9(3)(b) of the PDPR.\n\n26.\n\nIn the ordinary case, organisations are expected to make an assessment of\n\nthe risks of trans border transfer of personal data in their possession or under their\ncontrol and come to a conclusion as to how identified risks (if any) can be\naddressed. In this case, it is arguable whether the use of a US-based provider for\nonline ordering system was a question of necessity or a question of commercial\nchoice. This makes a difference whether Spize can benefit from the deeming\nprovision in Reg 9(3)(b) of the PDPR, or whether it ought to have complied with\n\n9\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nReg 10 of the PDPR to ensure comparable protection by contract or through an\nassessment of US law.\n\n27.\n\nThe Organisation’s omission to consider its obligations under section 26 of\n\nthe PDPA when transferring personal data outside Singapore constitutes a breach\nof the transfer limitation obligation under section 26. Assessments that US law\nprovided comparative protection or that the transfer came within one of the deeming\nprovisions under Reg 9(3) of the PDPR, eg contractual necessity under Reg 9(3)(b),\nshould ordinarily be documented as part of the policies and practices that Spize\nought to have developed and maintained. Alternatively, if transfer was on the basis\nof contract, clauses sufficient to meet the requirements of Reg 10(1)(b) read with\n10(2) of the PDPR should have been embodied in the contract between Spize and\nNovadine. The lack of policies and practices (including the lack of contractual\ndocumentations) evidencing the scope of Spize’s engagement of Novadine is\nalready the basis of a finding of breach of section 12(d)(i) of the PDPA.\n\nDirections\n\n28.\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the\n\nOrganisations such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Organisations’\ncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n29.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors noted above, pursuant\n\nto section 29(2) of the PDPA, and the investigation and assessment of this matter\nhaving been completed, the Commissioner is satisfied that:\n\na.\n\nSpize did not make reasonable security arrangements and is in breach\nof section 24 of the PDPA;\n\nb.\n\nSpize breached its Openness Obligation under sections 11(3) and 12(a)\nof the PDPA;\n\n10\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\nc.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nSpize breached its obligation under section 12(d)(i) of the PDPA to\nmake information available on request about the policies and practices\nit had implemented that would address how Novadine would process\npersonal data on its behalf; and\n\nd.\n\n30.\n\nSpize breached its obligation under section 26 of the PDPA.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs that Spize pays a financial penalty of S$20,000 within\n30 days from the date of the directions, failing which interest shall be payable on\nthe outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\n31.\n\nIn assessing the breach as determining the directions to be imposed on Spize\n\nin this case, the Commissioner took into account the fact that the Incident involved\nactual disclosure of customers' personal data through the Link via Spize's website.\n\n32.\n\nThat said, the Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors.\n\n33.\n\nFirst, the Commissioner accepted Spize’s representations that following the\n\nIncident, the organisation had taken steps to:\n\na.\n\nImplement a customised data protection framework;\n\nb.\n\nWith help from external consultants, draft the necessary processes and\npolicies and conduct data protection training for its employees;\n\nc.\n\nEngage a new IT vendor to change the Site (to be hosted locally) and\nonline ordering system; and\n\n11\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\nd.\n\n34.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nPut in place proper access controls within the system.\n\nThe Commissioner is satisfied that the above actions taken are reasonable\n\nand address the breaches that occurred in the present instance. They should also\nprevent recurrences of the Incident.\n\n35.\n\nSecond, Spize took prompt action to inform Novadine to remove the Link\n\nfrom the public domain.\n\n36.\n\nFinally, Spize was largely cooperative during the investigations,\n\nnotwithstanding its inability to explain the technical cause of the breach.\n\n37.\n\nSpize, after receiving the preliminary Decision, made the following\n\nrepresentations in support of its request for a reduction in the quantum of the\nfinancial penalty imposed:\n\na.\n\nSpize reiterated the steps it had taken to comply with the PDPA after\nthe Incident, namely,\ni.\n\nplanning for an annual review of its data protection policy;\n\nii.\n\nplanning for re-training its current employees on the PDPA, in\nparticular its IT team;\n\niii.\n\nplanning to send its employees for talks and seminars on PDPA\nupdates;\n\niv.\n\ninitiating access-code restrictions as well as setting up separate\naccounts for employees; and\n\nv.\n\nterminating its engagement with Novadine and setting up a new\nwebsite hosted by a company in Singapore;\n\nb.\n\nThe incident was unintentional and was a result of human error; and\n\n12\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\nc.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nThe financial penalty is “a hefty price to pay” given a separate incident\nthat Spize suffered last November (which was not related to personal\ndata protection).\n\n38.\n\nThe Commissioner declines Spize’s request for a reduction in the quantum\n\nof the financial penalty for the following reasons:\n\na.\n\nThe Commissioner had already taken into account the steps taken by\nSpize in reaching his decision on the quantum of the financial penalty\n(see paragraph 33 above);\n\nb.\n\nThe unintentional nature of the data breach is not relevant as a\nmitigating factor given that the investigations revealed that the breaches\nrelated to a failure to put in place the necessary processes and practices\nand did not relate to the specific action by the employee; and\n\nc.\n\nAn organisation which has difficulty in paying a financial penalty\nimposed may request that the financial penalty be paid in instalments.\nThe fact that Spize suffered a separate incident is, however, not a\nrelevant consideration in determining the quantum of the financial\npenalty imposed, although its impact on Spize’s cashflow may be a\nrelevant factor to consider in a request for instalment payment of the\nfinancial penalty.\n\n39.\n\nFurther, the Commissioner hereby directs Spize to carry out the following\n\nwithin 60 days:\n\na.\n\nPut in place a data protection policy and internal guidelines to comply\nwith the provisions of the PDPA and, in particular, to prevent future\nrecurrences of the breaches that had occurred in this case;\n\n13\n\n\fRe Spize Concepts Pte Ltd\n\nb.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 22\n\nTrain all employees of Spize handling personal data on the obligations\nunder the PDPA and the organisation’s data protection policies after\ndirection (a) has been completed;\n\nc.\n\nPut in place proper access controls for the management of\nadministrators’ accounts within its food order delivery and catering\nservices website and online ordering system; and\n\nd.\n\nPut in place measures to ensure that it is able to make information\navailable about its policies and practices (including information set out\nin contracts/agreements entered into with its data intermediaries that\ncontractually require the relevant data intermediary to implement\nspecific reasonable arrangements) necessary to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA.\n\n40.\n\nThe Commissioner also directs that Spize informs the PDPC of the\n\ncompletion of each of the above within 1 week of implementation.\n\n41.\n\nThe Commissioner urges organisations to take the necessary action to\n\nensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA.

Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 21\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1901-B3318\n4 July 2019\n\nBackground\n1\n\nOn 31 January 2019, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a complaint from an individual (the “Complainant”)\nin relation to the disclosure of other individuals’ personal data that had been\nprinted on the reverse side of an invoice issued to the Complainant by SME\nMotor Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”).\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe facts of this case and circumstances leading to the breach bear some\n\nresemblance to the cases of Re SLF Green Maid Agency [2018] SGPDPC 27\nand Re Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7.\n3\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of auto repair and servicing. In an\n\neffort to be environmentally friendly, the Organisation had a practice of re-using\nscrap or unwanted paper documents by printing other documents on the reverse\nside.\n4\n\nThe Complainant met with a car accident and brought her vehicle to the\n\nOrganisation’s workshop for repair. The Complainant subsequently discovered\n1\n\n\f[2019] SGPDPC 21\n\nSME Motor Pte. Ltd.\n\nthat the Organisation had printed her workshop repair invoice on a piece of\npaper that contained the personal data of two other individuals (the “Personal\nData”) on the reverse side. On 31 January 2019, the Complainant lodged a\ncomplaint with the Commission in relation to the disclosure of the Personal\nData.\n5\n\nThe Personal Data disclosed to the Complainant included the following:\n(a)\n\nthe first individual’s name, National Registration Identification\n\nCard (“NRIC”) number, and insurance policy number; and\n(b)\n\nthe second individual’s name, insurance policy number, and\n\nclaim number.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n6\n\nThe issue that arises in this case for determination is whether the\n\nOrganisation had complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n7\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation did not dispute that there was\n\nan unauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data. Having considered the material\nfacts and circumstances, the Organisation did not have reasonable security\nmeasures in place to protect the Personal Data in its possession or under its\ncontrol for the following reasons.\n8\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to protect the Personal Data by not\n\npreventing the unwanted or scrap documents that contained personal data from\n2\n\n\f[2019] SGPDPC 21\n\nSME Motor Pte. Ltd.\n\nbeing re-used or given to other customers, and by not providing instructions on\nthe proper handling and disposal of such documents. While the Organisation’s\nInternal Guidelines set out some minimal storage and disposal procedures for\ngeneral documents, there was no mention of any process or system for\nsegregating unwanted or scrap paper containing personal data from the pile of\npapers designated for re-use by the Organisation’s employees. Given its silence\non the practice of using the reverse side of documents containing personal data,\nI find that the Organisation’s Internal Guidelines did not amount to an adequate\nsecurity arrangement.\n9\n\nSecond, the Organisation did not train its employees to be aware that\n\ncustomers’ personal data could be at risk of unauthorised disclosure through the\npractice of re-using unwanted or scrap paper. During the investigation, the\nOrganisation admitted that its employees used the reverse sides of unwanted\ndocuments for “environment protection” reasons. As noted in Re SLF Green\nMaid Agency [2018] SGPDPC 27 at [1], although the practice of re-using scrap\nor discarded paper is “highly commendable and environmentally-friendly…\norganisations must take care to ensure that there is no personal data on the\nscrap or discarded paper set aside for such re-use”. In this regard, the\nOrganisation failed to show that it created employee awareness concerning the\nrisk of unauthorised disclosure of personal data when re-using unwanted or\nscrap paper.\n10\n\nThird, the Organisation did not provide proper data protection training\n\nfor its employees. It is well-established that proper training is a key security\narrangement in an organisation’s compliance with the Protection Obligation.1\n\nRe National University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5 at [15] – [28] and Re SLF Green Maid\nAgency [2018] SGPDPC 27 at [12].\n1\n\n3\n\n\f[2019] SGPDPC 21\n\nSME Motor Pte. Ltd.\n\nProper staff training – which creates data protection awareness amongst\nemployees, imparts good practices in handling personal data, and puts\nemployees on the alert for threats to the security of personal data – is necessary\nto complement an organisation’s data protection policies. Seeing as the\nOrganisation regularly handles sensitive personal data such as NRIC numbers,\ninsurance policy numbers and claims information, it is crucial for the\nOrganisation to provide properly structured, periodic data protection training to\nits employees to help them identify risks and protect the personal data collected,\nused and disclosed in the course of their employment.\n11\n\nTaking all of the above into consideration, I find that the Organisation\n\ndid not comply with its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data in its possession\nor under its control.\nRemedial Actions by the Organisation\n12\n\nAfter being notified of the complaint on 26 February 2019, the\n\nOrganisation undertook the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nimplemented the following additional measures (“Additional\n\nMeasures”):\n(i)\n\nall documents containing personal data are no longer to\n\nbe re-used for printing;\n(ii)\n\nthe office manager to review documents at least once a\n\nweek to ensure that (i) is complied with; and\n\n4\n\n\f[2019] SGPDPC 21\n\nSME Motor Pte. Ltd.\n\n(b)\n\ninstructed the DPO and officer manager to inform all employees\n\nof the Internal Guidelines and Additional Measures, and re-train them in\nthis respect.\n13\n\nHowever, these Additional Measures failed to establish robust data\n\nprotection policies and practices concerning the re-use and secure disposal of\nunwanted or scrap documents containing personal data, which would prevent\nthe recurrence of another unauthorised disclosure of personal data or the\noccurrence of a similar data breach.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Directions\n14\n\nGiven my findings that the Organisation is in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, I am empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation\nsuch directions as I deem fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n15\n\nIn assessing the breach, and determining the directions to be imposed, I\n\ntook into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nonly two individuals were affected by the data breach;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Personal Data was only disclosed to a single individual;\n\n(c)\n\nthere was no evidence to suggest any actual loss or damage\n\nresulting from the data breach; and\n(d)\n16\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative during the investigations.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, I do not think that\n\na financial penalty is warranted and instead make the following directions:\n\n5\n\n\f[2019] SGPDPC 21\n\nSME Motor Pte. Ltd.\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation is to comply with the provisions of the PDPA\n\nby putting in place a data protection policy and internal guidelines,\nwhich include a procedure for the proper control and disposal of\nunwanted or scrap documents containing personal data, within 30 days\nfrom the date of this decision;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation is to conduct training to ensure that its staff are\n\naware of, and will comply with, the requirements of the PDPA when\nhandling personal data within 60 days from the date of decision; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation is to inform the Commission of the completion\n\nof each of the above directions within 1 week of implementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on AIA for failure to take reasonable security arrangements in its letter generation process.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance","Insurance"],"date":"2019-06-20","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---AIA-Singapore-Pte-Ltd---200619.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by AIA","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-aia","timestamp":"2019-06-20","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nCase No DP-1801-B1530\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nAIA Singapore Private Limited\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1801-B1530\n\n20 June 2019\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nOn 5 January 2018, the Organisation notified the Personal Data\n\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) of the potential unauthorised\ndisclosure (the “Incident”) of individuals’ personal data contained in 244 letters\nsent to two individuals due to an error with its letter generation system. In\nparticular, 245 letters meant for various customers that the Organisation\ngenerated on 22 December 2017 and 27 December 2017 were sent to two\ncustomers as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n179 letters were sent to the first customer (“Customer X”), of\nwhich 178 letters were received by him (with one having gone\nmissing in transit); and\n\n(b)\n\n66 letters were sent to, and received by, the second customer\n(“Customer Y”). Customer Y was the intended recipient of only\none of these letters.\n\n2\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter by the Commission, the\n\nCommissioner found the Organisation in breach of section 24 of Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) for the reasons set out below.\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nMaterial Facts\n\n3\n\nThe Incident arose from an error in the Organisation’s “Integral Life\n\nSystem” (the “System”) which was used to automatically generate certain types\nof letters to its customers. The error was introduced into the System as a result\nof the Organisation deploying a software fix (the “Fix”) on 21 December 2017\nto rectify an earlier error (the “First System Error”). The First System Error\nresulted in the Organisation sending duplicate letters to customers who had\nprovided the Organisation with only a foreign despatch address (ie they had not\nprovided any local despatch address in Singapore).\n\n4\n\nUnfortunately, the Fix inadvertently introduced a logic error1 which\n\ncaused the System to extract and reflect the wrong local despatch addresses on\nthe affected letters. This logic error manifested itself when the System generated\n“HealthShield Non-Integrated for Foreigners Policy” letters (“Type A letter”)\nand letters which were not Type A letters (“non-Type A letter”) in a batch; the\nlocal despatch address of the non-Type A letters generated immediately after a\nType A letter incorrectly reflected the local despatch address of that Type A\nletter (the “Error”). A more detailed description of this Error is provided below:\n\n(a)\n\nWhen the System generates Type A letters (ie Letters 1 and 2 in\nTable 1 below), the Type A letters accurately reflect the local\nand/or foreign despatch address of the intended recipients.\n\n(b)\n\nIf the System then generates non-Type A letters (ie Letters 3, 4\nand 5 in Table 1) immediately after a Type A letter, the non-\n\n1\n\nA logic error is a glitch in a computer programme that causes it to operate incorrectly and\nproduce unintended output or other behaviour, but not to crash.\n\n3\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nType A letters wrongly reflect the local despatch address of the\nrecipient of the last Type A letter (ie Letter 2 in Table 1), but\naccurately reflect their foreign despatch address (if any) (eg\nLetters 4 and 5 in Table 1).\n\n(c)\n\nIf the System generates Type A letters after a non-Type A letter\n(ie Letter 6 in Table 1), the Type A letters accurately reflect the\nlocal and/or foreign despatch address of the intended recipients.\n\n5\n\nTable 1 below illustrates the effects of the Error:\n\nTable 1: Illustration of Error\nLetter\nLetter System\nNumber, Type Record\nin\nsequential\nLocal\norder\nAddress\n1\nType\nTampines\nA\n2\nType\nAng Mo\nA\nKio\n3\nNonBedok\nType\nA\n4\nNonUbi\nType\nA\n5\nNonType\nA\n6\nType\nEunos\nA\n7\nType\nEast\nA\nCoast\n8\nType\nA\n\nPolicy Despatch Address Outcome\ngenerated in the\nletters\nForeign Local\nForeign\nAddress Address Address\nTampines India\n-\n\nUSA\n\nAng Mo\nKio\nAng Mo\nKio\nAng Mo\nKio\n\nAustralia Ang Mo\nKio\n-\n\nEunos\n\nFrance\n\nEast\nCoast\n-\n\nVietnam\n\n4\n\nIndia\n-\n\nLetters 3\nto 5 were\nsent\nto\nthe\nlocal\nUSA\ndespatch\naddress\nAustralia reflected\nin Letter\n2 above.\nFrance\nVietnam\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n6\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nIn this case, the letters generated were therefore all addressed to their\n\nintended recipients but 179 letters reflected the local despatch address of\nCustomer X and 66 letters reflected the local despatch address of Customer Y.\nThis is because Customers X and Y were in the position of the recipient of the\nlast Type A letter (eg Letter 2 in Table 1) before the batch of non-Type A letters\nwere generated.\n\n7\n\nAfter the 245 letters were generated, they were converted into PDF\n\nformat and sent to the Organisation’s vendor, DataPost Pte Ltd (“DataPost”),\nfor printing, enveloping and despatch. These letters comprised four Integrated\nShield Plan premium notice reminder letters, 237 Integrated Shield Plan\npremium notice letters, three change of payor letters and one modified terms of\ncoverage letter. These letters were sent to Customers X and Y between 28\nDecember 2017 and 2 January 2018.\n\n8\n\nAs a result of the Error, the following types of personal data for each\n\ncategory of letters were potentially compromised:\n\n(a)\n\nin respect of the modified terms of coverage letters, and\nIntegrated Shield Plan premium notice letters and premium\nnotice reminder letters:\n\n(i)\n\nthe policyholder or insured person’s full name;\n\n(ii)\n\nthe policyholder or insured person’s policy number;\n\n(iii)\n\nthe policyholder or insured person’s type and name of\npolicy;\n\n(iv)\n\nthe policyholder or insured person’s policy premium due\ndate; and\n\n5\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n(v)\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nthe policyholder or insured person’s premium amount.\n\nin respect of the change of payor letters:\n\n(i)\n\nthe intended recipient’s full name;\n\n(ii)\n\nthe intended recipient’s policy number;\n\n(iii)\n\nthe intended recipient’s type and name of policy;\n\n(iv)\n\nthe intended recipient’s policy anniversary date;\n\n(v)\n\nthe insured person’s full name, which differs from the\nintended recipient as the latter was paying the premiums\non behalf of the insured; and\n\n(vi)\n\n9\n\nthe intended recipient’s premium amount.\n\nOn 30 December 2017, the Organisation learnt about the Incident from\n\na social media post by Customer X and discovered the Error. It took the\nfollowing remedial actions to mitigate the damage caused and to prevent the\nrecurrence of similar incidents:\n\n(a)\n\nimmediately implemented a software fix to resolve the Error in\nthe System;\n\n(b)\n\nconducted and completed a scan of the System to check that all\nSingapore\n\ndespatch\n\naddresses for letters\n\nsent\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s customers in 2017 were accurate;\n\n(c)\n\nimplemented a function in the System to enable it to perform,\nand generate daily reports for the purposes of, the following:\n\n6\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n(i)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nchecking and validating that the despatch addresses\nprinted on the automatically generated letters match the\nrecords of the intended recipients, as found in the\nSystem’s database; and\n\n(ii)\n\nflagging out non-conforming cases to automatically stop\nsuch letters from being transmitted to DataPost for\nprinting;\n\n(d)\n\ntook steps to retrieve the 244 letters which were sent to the wrong\naddresses and successfully retrieved 243 unopened letters. One\nletter was never received by Customer X and was determined to\nhave been lost in transit; and\n\n(e)\n\nprinted and re-sent the affected letters to the customers\nconcerned and extended their deadline to respond to the matters\ncontained therein.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n10\n\nThe main issue for determination is whether the Organisation breached\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA. Section 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to\nprotect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable\nsecurity steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n\n11\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Organisation had engaged DataPost to assist\n\nwith the printing, enveloping and despatch of the letters on the Organisation’s\nbehalf. According to the agreement between the Organisation and DataPost, and\n\n7\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nas admitted by the Organisation in its responses to the Commission’s queries,\nthe scope of DataPost’s engagement did not include checking the substantive\ncontents of the letters it printed, enveloped and despatched on behalf of the\nOrganisation; DataPost was only required to conduct sampling checks of the\nprintouts in relation to the quality of presentation and alignment. Accordingly,\nthe Incident did not relate to the scope of DataPost’s engagement under its\nagreement with the Organisation.\n\n12\n\nBefore examining the arrangements put in place by the Organisation, it\n\nshould be noted that the personal data involved in this case includes insurance\ndata, a category of personal data that is considered to be of a sensitive nature. It\nhas been stated in previous decisions2 that personal data of a sensitive nature\nshould be safeguarded by a higher level of protection. To reiterate Re Aviva Ltd\n[2018] SGPDPC 4 at [17]:\n“All forms or categories of personal data are not equal;\norganisations need to take into account the sensitivity of the\npersonal data that they handle. In this regard, the Commissioner\nrepeats the explanation in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] (at [18]) on the\nhigher standards of protection that should be implemented for\nsensitive personal data:\nThe Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the\nPDPA states that an organisation should\n“implement robust policies and procedures for\nensuring appropriate levels of security for\npersonal data of varying levels of sensitivity”.\nThis means that a higher standard of protection\nis required for more sensitive personal data.\nMore sensitive personal data, such as\n2\n\nSee, for example, Re AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd & Toppan Forms (S) Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 2, Re NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 10, Re AIG Asia\nPacific Insurance Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 8, Re Aviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 4, and Re Aviva\nLtd [2017] SGPDPC 14.\n\n8\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\ninsurance, medical and financial data, should be\naccorded a commensurate level of protection. In\naddition, the Guide to Preventing Accidental\nDisclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data expressly states that documents\nthat contain sensitive personal data should be\n“processed and sent with particular care”.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n13\n\nIn this case, in order to determine whether the Organisation was in\n\nbreach of section 24, the relevant question is whether it had put in place\nreasonable security arrangements that would have prevented the Incident. It\nappears from the Commission’s investigations that the Organisation had failed\nto:\n\n(a)\n\nconduct sufficient testing before rolling out the Fix for the First\nSystem Error; and\n\n(b)\n\ninstitute sufficient controls or checks to ensure the accuracy of\nthe letters that the System automatically generated.\n\n14\n\nWith respect to the failure set out above at paragraph 13(a), the tests\n\nwhich the Organisation conducted after developing the Fix were limited to\nensuring that the First System Error was addressed (ie that duplicate letters were\nnot sent to customers who had provided the Organisation with only a foreign\ndespatch address). The scope of these tests was too narrow. Since changes were\nmade to address how the System handled retrieval and insertion of local and\nforeign addresses, these tests should have been designed to ensure that the Fix\ndid not affect other aspects of the System involving the same functionality.\n\n9\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n15\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nAdditionally, the tests were not conducted to mimic real world usage of\n\nthe System. Firstly, the Organisation conducted its tests by generating one letter\nat a time. However, the System was ordinarily required to generate letters in\nbatches which included both Type A and non-Type A letters, and the Error in\nfact only arose when the letters were generated in such batches. If the\nOrganisation had tested the batch processing functionality using test data that\napproximated real world scenarios, the Error would have likely come to light at\nthat stage.\n16\n\nSecondly, the Organisation used a set of test data that was severely\n\nflawed. The test data used a single address, 1 Robinson Road, as the local\ndespatch address for all the letters that were generated. The Organisation\nclaimed to have done this in order to prevent the disclosure of production data.\nThere are proven ways to generate dummy or test data that reflects the\ndistribution of the production data without resorting to using a single address,\neg by swapping3 the data. Further, this measure would also have prevented them\nfrom detecting the Error even if they had tested the generation of letters in\nbatches.\n17\n\nWith respect to the failure set out above at paragraph 13(b), the\n\nOrganisation admitted that it did not have in place any process or personnel\nresponsible for checking the contents of the automatically generated letters. The\nGuide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data states the following in relation to the use of automated processes:\n“Ensure the accuracy and reliability of the automated processing\n3\n\nThe purpose of swapping is to rearrange data in the dataset such that the individual attribute\nvalues are still represented in the dataset, but generally, do not correspond to the original\nrecords. This technique is also referred to as shuffling and permutation. For more details, please\nrefer to the Commission’s Guide to Basic Data Anonymisation Techniques.\n\n10\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nimplemented by checking these systems and processes regularly.\nWhen the data is more sensitive, consider incorporating\nadditional checking mechanisms to cater for unexpected\nsituations and ensure no error arises from the automated\nprocessing.\nAs good practice, establish procedures to include additional\nchecks following the processing, printing and sorting of\ndocuments to ensure that the destination information (e.g.\nmailing address, email address or fax number) is correct and\nmatches that of the intended recipient(s) prior to sending.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n18\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of the personal data involved, the\n\nOrganisation ought to have instituted controls or checks to ensure the accuracy\nof the addressees of the letters. This is something that the Organisation has since\nimplemented.\n\n19\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner found the Organisation in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n\n20\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue\nthe Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n21\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on the Organisation in this case, the following mitigating factors were\ntaken into consideration:\n\n11\n\n\fAIA Singapore Private Limited\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 20\n\nthe Organisation voluntarily notified the Commission of the\nbreach;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation fully cooperated with the Commission’s\ninvestigations;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the effects of the\nbreach; and\n\n(d)\n\n22\n\nthe Organisation managed to retrieve 243 letters unopened.\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the present\n\ncase, the Commissioner directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\n$10,000 within 30 days from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\n23\n\nThe Commissioner has not made any further directions for the\n\nOrganisation given the remediation measures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n12\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Xbot for failing to put in place data protection policies to comply with the provisions of the PDPA.","tags":["Accountability","Warning","Real Estate","Property"],"date":"2019-06-20","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision--Xbot-Pte-Ltd---200619.pdf","nature":"Accountability","title":"Breach of the Openness Obligation by Xbot","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/breach-of-the-openness-obligation-by-xbot","timestamp":"2019-06-20","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\nCase No DP-1803-1781\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nXbot Pte. Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fXbot Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1803-1781\n\n20 June 2019\nIntroduction\n1.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint that Xbot Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) had disclosed the personal data\nof property owners through the Strata.sg mobile application without their consent. The\nCommission commenced an investigation in order to determine whether the Organisation had\nfailed to comply with its obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”).\n\nMaterial Facts\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation developed and operated the Strata.sg mobile application (the “App”)\n\nand an associated website, http://Strata.sg (the “Website”), which provided access to a database\nof residential property transactions (the “Database”). The Database included information on\ntransactions involving both private residential properties (“Private Properties”) and Housing\nDevelopment Board (“HDB”) properties (“HDB Properties”). This information was made\navailable to users of the App and Website and included a partial address (block number, road\nand, for HDB Properties only, a storey range), area, type and price for the properties listed. In\naddition, the complete addresses of the Private Properties (including the specific unit number)\nwas made available to premium subscribers of the App or Website who paid a fee for access to\nthe information in the Database.\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation also collected personal data from users of the Website and users of the\n\nApp in order to grant them access to the Database. The Organisation had a data protection\npolicy for the Website (which it referred to as a “Privacy Policy”) but that policy did not\n1\n\n\fXbot Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\n\nmention or cover the personal data collected from users of the App. The App did not include\nany separate data protection policy nor any link to the Organisation’s data protection policy for\nthe Website. In addition, the Organisation did not have any internal policies or procedures\nrelating to its personal data practices. At the material time, the Organisation was run by a single\nindividual who was also an employee of the Organisation. The Organisation had only one other\nemployee.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n(A)\n\nDoes the information in the Database constitute personal data under the PDPA?\n\n4.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” as “data, whether true or not, about an\n\nindividual who can be identified –\n(a)\n\nfrom that data; or\n\n(b)\n\nfrom that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to\nhave access.”\n\n5.\n\nThe information in the Database would not, on its own, be personal data as none of those\n\ndata could identify an individual (per limb (a) of the above definition). In particular, as there is\nno publicly available means of identifying the owners of the HDB Properties based on the\ninformation available in the Database, the information relating to HDB Properties would not\nconstitute personal data under the PDPA.\n\n6.\n\nHowever, the complete addresses of the Private Properties in the Database could be used\n\nto trace the name of the owners of those properties through the Singapore Land Authority’s\nLand Titles Register. The information in the Database could then be related to the identified or\nidentifiable owners of the Private Properties and reveal the type and size of property they own\nand the price they paid for the property. In light of this, the information in the Database relating\nto Private Properties constitute personal data under the PDPA (per limb (b) of the above\ndefinition).\n\n2\n\n\fXbot Pte. Ltd.\n\n(B)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\n\nIs the Organisation permitted to collect, use and disclose the personal data in the\n\nDatabase?\n\n7.\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA prohibits organisations from collecting, using or disclosing\n\npersonal data about an individual for a purpose unless:\n(a)\n\nthe individual consents, or is deemed to have consented, under the PDPA to such\ncollection, use or disclosure; or\n\n(b) collection, use or disclosure without the individual’s consent is permitted or\nrequired under the PDPA or any other written law.\n\n8.\n\nIn the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Organisation admitted that it had\n\nnot obtained the consent of the individuals concerned for the collection, use and disclosure of\ntheir personal data in the Database. Hence, the key issue is whether the Organisation is\npermitted to do so without the individuals’ consent.\n\n9.\n\nUnder section 17(1) of the PDPA, collection of personal data without consent is permitted\n\nin the circumstances listed in the Second Schedule to the PDPA. In particular, paragraph 1(c)\nof the Second Schedule permits the collection of personal data without consent if the personal\ndata is publicly available. Section 2(1) of the PDPA defines the term “publicly available” (in\nrelation to personal data) as “personal data that is generally available to the public …”. Use\nand disclosure of personal data which is publicly available is similarly permitted without\nconsent under section 17(2) read with paragraph 1(c) of the Third Schedule and section 17(3)\nread with paragraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule respectively.\n\n10.\n\nIn this case, the information in the Database had either been obtained by the Organisation\n\nfrom a source which was generally available to the public or had been derived by the\nOrganisation from information which had obtained from such a source. In particular, the\nOrganisation had obtained information from the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s Real Estate\nInformation System (“REALIS”) portal and the HDB’s Resale Flat Prices portal. The\ninformation in these portals are available to members of the public (in some cases, upon\npayment of a fee). In my view, such information is generally available to the public.\n\n3\n\n\fXbot Pte. Ltd.\n\n11.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\n\nIn the circumstances, I find that the Organisation is permitted under the PDPA to collect,\n\nuse and disclose the personal data in the Database without consent of the relevant individuals.\nThe Organisation is therefore not in breach of section 13 of the PDPA.\n\n(C)\n\nDid the Organisation have in place the necessary data protection policies and practices\n\nunder the PDPA?\n\n12.\n\nSection 12 of the PDPA requires organisations to:\n(a)\n\ndevelop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation\nto meet the obligations of the organisation under the PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\ndevelop a process to receive and respond to complaints that may arise with respect\nto the application of the PDPA;\n\n(c)\n\ncommunicate to its staff information about the organisation’s policies and practices\nreferred to in paragraph (a); and\n\n(d)\n\n13.\n\nmade information available on request about —\n(i)\n\nthe policies and practices referred to in paragraph (a); and\n\n(ii)\n\nthe complaint process referred to in paragraph (b).\n\nIn this case, although the Website and the App collected the same personal data for the\n\nsame purpose, the data protection policy published on the Website was expressly limited to\npersonal data collected via the Website. This, in my view, is insufficient to meet the\nrequirements of section 12 as users of the App would not have a clear indication of how their\npersonal data would be handled by the Organisation. The Organisation should have ensured\nthat its published data protection policy covered personal data regardless of whether it was\ncollected via the Website or the App. This could have been done this with some simple\namendments to the current data protection policy and, as a good practice, the App could have\nincluded a link to the policy published on the Website. Alternatively, the Organisation could\ninclude a separate data protection policy within the App.\n\n14.\n\nIn addition to an organisation’s published data protection policy, the “policies and\n\npractices” referred to in section 12 of the PDPA includes internal policies and processes that\nare necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA. While an\norganisation’s published data protection policy is meant to inform individuals about how their\n4\n\n\fXbot Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\n\npersonal data will be handled by the organisation, the internal policies and practices are meant\nfor the organisation’s employees. Section 12 also requires such policies and practices to be\ncommunicated to the organisation’s staff. These requirements are intended to ensure that all\nemployees of the organisation are aware of the specific practices they must adhere to when\nhanding personal data including, for example, the notifications to be given to individuals when\ntheir personal data is collected, how access and correction requests should be handled, how\npersonal data must be kept and secured and how personal data must be disposed of when no\nlonger required by the Organisation. The specific internal policies and practices which may be\nrequired for a particular organisation would depend on various factors such as the following\n(among other factors):\n(a)\n\nthe type(s) and amount of personal data collected by the organisation;\n\n(b)\n\nthe organisation’s processes for collecting the personal data;\n\n(c)\n\nthe organisation’s purposes for using or disclosing the personal data; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe number and roles of employees who require access to personal data in the course\nof their employment.\n\n15.\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation has one employee (in addition to the sole director).\n\nNevertheless, it should have developed internal policies and practices, having in mind the\nconsiderations enumerated in the preceding paragraph, and communicated them to its\nemployee so as to ensure that its employee adhered to the appropriate practices when handling\npersonal data (and related matters) in the course of his or her employment. Although the\nOrganisation is a small company, size of the organisation is but one determinant of the\ncomplexity of the internal policies and practices required. The types and amount of personal\ndata that it possesses and controls is another relevant consideration. In this regard, the\nOrganisation possess and controls a not insignificant amount of personal data which relate to\nproperty ownership (even if these are publicly available).\n\n16.\n\nIn view of the above, I find the Organisation in breach of section 12 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\n\fXbot Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 19\n\nConclusion\n\n17.\n\nHaving found the Organisation in breach of section 12 of the PDPA, I am empowered\n\nunder section 29 of the PDPA to give to the Organisation such directions as I deem fit to ensure\nits compliance with the PDPA.\n\n18.\n\nTaking the totality of the circumstances into account, I have decided to issue a warning\n\nto the Organisation for its breach of section 12 of the PDPA without further directions or\nimposing a financial penalty. In particular, I noted that-\n\na) the Organisation had ceased operations of both the App and the Website on 16 May\n2018; and\n\nb) the Organisation has been cooperative throughout the investigations.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Cigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V. was found not to be in breach of the PDPA in relation to allegation that it had failed to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of its policy members.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Finance and Insurance"],"date":"2019-06-20","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Cigna-Singapore---200619.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No Breach of Protection Obligation by Cigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/no-breach-of-protection-obligation-by-cigna-europe-insurance-company-s-a--n-v","timestamp":"2019-06-20","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\nCase No DP-1806-B2241\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1806-B2241\n\n20 June 2019\n\nBackground\n\n1.\n\nCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V. is a company established in Belgium\n\nwhich offers health insurance solutions and coverage in Singapore through a registered branch\noffice (the “Organisation”). On 1 June 2018, the Organisation notified the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach incident involving the\ninadvertent disclosure of certain personal data of individuals who had taken up health insurance\ncoverage with the Organisation. The Commission commenced an investigation in order to\ndetermine whether the Organisation had failed to comply with its obligations under the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nMaterial Facts\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation provides health insurance coverage to employees of its clients and\n\ntheir families who decided to take up such coverage (“Members”). In order to provide this\nhealth insurance coverage, it collects, uses and processes personal data of the Members.\n\n3.\n\nIn 2012, the Organisation entered into a services agreement (the “Services\n\nAgreement”) with Cigna European Services (UK) Limited (“CES”) for the provision of\nvarious insurance-related services. CES is a related company of the Organisation within the\nCigna group of companies (“Cigna Group”). The services provided by CES included the\nprocessing of insurance claims (among other services) and this involved activities such as\ngenerating and sending claim settlement letters and letters accompanying cheque payments to\n1\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\nMembers who had made an insurance claim. Such claims were processed through an\ninformation technology (“IT”) system which was operated by CES and used by various\ncompanies in the Cigna Group (the “System”). In order to make use of the System, the\nOrganisation transferred its Members’ personal data to CES and these data were processed in\nthe System.\n\n4.\n\nIt transpired that, in two separate incidents in January 2017 and May 2018, claims\n\nsettlement letters intended for certain Members were erroneously sent by CES to other\nMembers. These incidents were due to technical issues affecting the production of the claims\nsettlement letters by CES. In the second incident, the technical issues also affected the\nproduction of payment accompanying letters which were sent to some Members. CES initially\ndid not inform the Organisation about the first incident. The Organisation only came to know\nabout the two incidents after the second incident occurred.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n5.\n\nThe cause of the data breach incidents in this case may be traced to the technical issues\n\nin the System. As these matters were not within the Organisation’s operational control or even\nits knowledge prior to May 2018, the Organisation does not bear any direct responsibility under\nthe PDPA for the occurrence of the two incidents.\n\n6.\n\nNevertheless, as the processing of the Members’ personal data by CES was pursuant to\n\nthe Services Agreement between the Organisation and CES, the question arises as to whether\nthe Organisation had in place the appropriate measures to ensure protection of the Members’\npersonal data while the data was stored with and processed by CES. In this regard, section 24\nof the PDPA requires organisations to protect personal data in their possession or under their\ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure\nand similar risks.\n\n7.\n\nI find that the Organisation had in place the appropriate measures or could rely upon\n\nmeasures established within the Cigna Group to ensure protection of personal data by CES and\nto monitor CES’ compliance. These measures include the following:\n1\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\nThe Organisation and CES had entered into the Services Agreement and an\nInteraffiliate Data Processing and Transfer Agreement in 2012 which required\nCES to protect personal data transferred to it by the Organisation. For example,\nvarious clauses in these agreements required CES:\n(i)\n\nto protect the confidentiality of the Organisation’s customer data;\n\n(ii)\n\nto take appropriate and commercially reasonable measures to prevent,\ninter alia, unauthorised access or disclosure of such personal data and\nto ensure a level of security commensurate with the risks posed by the\nprocessing of personal data,\n\n(iii)\n\nto comply with a specified set of security safeguards;\n\n(iv)\n\nto notify the Organisation of any events that might impact the quality of\nCES’ services and products;\n\n(v)\n\nto give the Organisation access to the services for the purpose of\nreviewing and monitoring the quality of the services and the\nmanagement of risks; and\n\n(vi)\n\nto give the Organisation’s internal and external auditors access to the\nservices for the purpose of conducting audits;\n\n(b)\n\nThere were various internal frameworks, policies and standards which apply to\ncompanies within the Cigna Group, including CES. These included, among\nothers, the Cigna Information Protection (“CIP”) and General Computing\nControl (“GCC”) governance frameworks. These frameworks, policies and\nstandards addressed various aspects of IT security (amongst other matters); and\n\n(c)\n\nCES was subject to Cigna Group’s corporate audit and annual GCC assessment\nprocesses which include security and data protection, as well as external audits\nwhich may include IT audit reviews.\n\n8.\n\nFinally, as regards the causes of the two incidents, the Organisation has informed the\n\nCommission that the Cigna Group (including CES, the Organisation and other affected\ncompanies within the group) will be improving its processes in order to prevent a reoccurrence\n\n2\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\nof the incidents. The actions of CES that were directly related to the two incidents took place\noutside our jurisdiction and were not part of the Commission’s present investigation.\n\nApplication of section 26(1) of the PDPA to cross-border data transfers\n\n9.\n\nAs this case concerns personal data which had been transferred from the Organisation\n\n(in Singapore) to CES (in the United Kingdom), another question which may arise is whether\nthe transfer meets the requirements of the PDPA. Section 26(1) of the PDPA prohibits\norganisations from transferring personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore\n“except in accordance with requirements prescribed under [the PDPA] to ensure that\norganisations provide a standard of protection to personal data so transferred that is comparable\nto the protection under [the PDPA]”. The relevant requirements are prescribed in Part III of the\nPersonal Data Protection Regulations 2014 (the “PDPR”). In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nRegulation 9(1) of the PDPR requires an organisation (referred to in the PDPR\nas a “transferring organisation”), before transferring personal data from\nSingapore to a country or territory outside Singapore, to “take appropriate steps\nto ascertain whether, and to ensure that, the recipient of the personal data in that\ncountry or territory outside Singapore … is bound by legally enforceable\nobligations (in accordance with regulation 10) to provide to the transferred\npersonal data a standard of protection that is at least comparable to the\nprotection under the [PDPA]”;\n\n(b)\n\nRegulation 10(1) provides that legally enforceable obligations (as referred to in\nregulation 9(1)) includes, among others, a contract in accordance with\nregulation 10(2); and\n\n(c)\n\nRegulation 10(2) provides that a contract referred to in regulation 10(1) must:\n(i)\n\n“require the recipient to provide a standard of protection for the personal\ndata transferred to the recipient that is at least comparable to the\nprotection under the [PDPA]”; and\n\n(ii)\n\n“specify the countries and territories to which the personal data may be\ntransferred under the contract”.\n3\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n10.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\nThe effect of the statutory provisions cited in the preceding paragraph is that when a\n\ntransferring organisation in Singapore and an oversea recipient enter into a contract governing\nthe transfer of personal data from the transferring organisation to the recipient, that contract\nmust meet the two requirements specified in regulation 10(2) of the PDPR in order for the\ntransferring organisation to have complied with section 26(1) of the PDPA. The second of these\nrequirements (reproduced in paragraph 9(c)(ii) above) is self-explanatory. In relation to the\nfirst requirement (reproduced in paragraph 9(c)(i) above), the question is whether the contract\nrequires the recipient to provide the appropriate standard of protection to the transferred\npersonal data.\n\n11.\n\nAs stated in regulation 10(2) (and reproduced above), the standard of protection to the\n\ntransferred personal data must be at least comparable to the protection under the PDPA.\nDetermining the required standard for a particular contract would first involve considering how\nthe PDPA applies to the personal data while it is in the possession or under the control of the\ntransferring organisation (i.e. before the transfer to the recipient). The contract should then be\ndrafted to impose comparable obligations on the recipient in respect of the PDPA’s nine main\ndata protection obligations (as they are referred to in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines\non Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act, in particular, at paragraph 10.2 thereof).\nThese obligations are:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Openness Obligation (sections 11 and 12 of the PDPA);\n\n(b)\n\nThe Consent Obligation (sections 13 to 17 of the PDPA);\n\n(c)\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation (section 18 of the PDPA);\n\n(d)\n\nThe Notification Obligation (section 19 of the PDPA);\n\n(e)\n\nThe Access and Correction Obligations (sections 21 and 22 of the PDPA);\n\n(f)\n\nThe Accuracy Obligation (section 23 of the PDPA);\n4\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n12.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\n(g)\n\nThe Protection Obligation (section 24 of the PDPA);\n\n(h)\n\nThe Retention Limitation Obligation (section 25 of the PDPA); and\n\n(i)\n\nThe Transfer Limitation Obligation (section 26 of the PDPA).\n\nAs a general point, it is not necessary that a contract addresses all nine obligations. This\n\nwould depend on factors such as the purpose of the transfer, the nature of the relationship\nbetween the transferring organisation and the recipient and the scope of data processing\nservices which the recipient may be providing to the transferring organisation. For example, if\nthe recipient will not be assisting the transferring organisation with the handling of access and\ncorrection requests in relation to the transferred personal data, it would not be necessary for the\ncontract to address the requirements of sections 21 and 22 of the PDPA.\n\n13.\n\nIn the present case, the Protection Obligation (section 24) is relevant to the transfer of\n\npersonal data from the Organisation to CES. As discussed in the preceding section of this\nDecision, the Organisation had in place the appropriate security arrangements, including\ncontractual provisions, which met the requirements of section 24 of the PDPA. Those\ncontractual provisions would also meet the requirements of section 26(1) of the PDPA in\nrelation to the Protection Obligation. (As an aside, this position would apply to other\norganisations in a similar relationship and similar circumstances, that is, where the recipient is\na data intermediary of the transferring organisation and is processing personal data on behalf\nof and for the purposes of the transferring organisation.)\n\n14.\n\nAs the present case is concerned with the security arrangements put in place by the\n\nOrganisation and the facts and circumstances of the case do not raise any particular concern as\nregards other aspects of the Organisation’s transfer of personal data to CES, the Commission\ndid not investigate further into the Organisation’s compliance with section 26(1). I am satisfied\nthat it is unnecessary to do so and hence make no finding in relation to that section.\n\n5\n\n\fCigna Europe Insurance Company S.A.-N.V.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 18\n\nConclusion\n\n15.\n\nIn light of the above, I find that the Organisation had not contravened its obligations\n\nunder section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $6,000 was imposed on InfoCorp for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of individuals.

Ltd.\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1802-B1674\n20 June 2019\n\nBackground\n1\n\nThe case concerns the unauthorised access and disclosure of personal\n\ndata arising from a registration exercise for a crypto-currency initial coin\noffering (“ICO”). The Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”)\nreceived six complaints on the matter on 5 February 2018. The Organisation\nalso notified the PDPC of the matter on the same day.\n2\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found the\n\nOrganisation in breach of section 24 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”). The Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision of the matter\nare set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Organisation had conducted a crypto-currency ICO registration\n\nexercise via a website1 (“Website”) which it owned and managed at the material\ntime. The registration exercise was scheduled to take place between 5 and 26\nFebruary 2018.\n\n1\n\nhttps://sentinel-chain.org/.\n\n\fInfoCorp Technologies Pte. Ltd.\n4\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 17\n\nThe registration process involved two main parts.\n(a)\n\nIndividuals (“Participants”) were asked to input name, email\n\naddress, date of birth, identification type and number, nationality,\ncountry of residence and residential address (“Personal Data Set”) on\nthe registration page.\n(b)\n\nParticipants also had to upload Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”)\n\ndocuments. A Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) would be assigned\nto a Participant after he or she had uploaded the KYC documents and\nclicked “Save”. The KYC documents included the following:\ni.\n\nAn identification document with a photograph of the\n\nParticipant;\nii.\n\nDocuments showing proof of residence; and\n\niii.\n\nA photograph of the Participant holding the identification\n\ndocument.\n5\n\nThe incident was caused by a vulnerability in the design of the\n\nregistration form. There was no requirement built into the system to authenticate\nthe individuals downloading the KYC documents. The URL also contained a\nserialised file identity (“FileID”) as the last few characters of the URL in\nrunning numbers. The vulnerability allowed Participants assigned with a URL\nto access other Participants’ saved KYC documents by altering the last few\ncharacters of the assigned URL. The KYC documents of 21 Participants were\ndownloaded by 15 other Participants via this vulnerability.\n6\n\nThe Organisation took the server offline immediately after being\n\ninformed by a Participant. The Organisation also contacted the 15 other\n\n2\n\n\fInfoCorp Technologies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 17\n\nParticipants who had downloaded the KYC documents. They were told to\ndestroy the KYC documents not belonging to them. This includes any personal\ndata of other Participants that they may have retained.\n7\n\nPrior to the incident, the Organisation had engaged a vendor to design\n\nthe registration form for the Website. Data protection elements were considered\nby the Organisation. The Personal Data Sets were to be encrypted and rendered\ninaccessible to third parties. Nonetheless, the same level of diligence with\nrespect to the uploaded KYC documents was not exercised by the Organisation.\n8\n\nThe Organisation conducted standard functional tests on the Website’s\n\nprocess and user flow prior to launching it. However, these did not detect the\nvulnerability that caused the incident. The Organisation also did not conduct nor\narrange for any penetration test or web application vulnerability scan.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nThe issue for determination is whether the Organisation breached\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA. Section 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to\nprotect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable\nsecurity steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n10\n\nThe Organisation had full possession and control over the personal data\n\ncollected from the Participants. Although the Organisation had engaged a\nvendor to design the registration form, the vendor did not process any personal\ndata on behalf of the Organisation. The Organisation managed the Website on\nits own. Thus, it retained full responsibility for the IT security of the Website\nand the personal data contained therein.\n\n3\n\n\fInfoCorp Technologies Pte. Ltd.\n11\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 17\n\nThe Commissioner is satisfied that reasonable security arrangements\n\nhad been made to protect the Personal Data Sets despite the vulnerability.\nEncryption of the Personal Data Sets had prevented unauthorised access by third\nparties.\n12\n\nHowever, insufficient protection was accorded to the KYC documents.\n\nThe Organisation had only performed standard functional tests of the Website\nprior to launching it. No penetration test or web application vulnerability scan\nwas conducted. Had these tests and scans been performed on the Website, the\nwell-known vulnerability could be easily detected.\n13\n\nGiven the type of personal data that the KYC documents contained, it is\n\nunreasonable that the Organisation had omitted the abovementioned security\ntesting prior to the Website launch. The ease with which the vulnerability could\nbe exploited via changing the last few numbers of the URL made this more\negregious.\n14\n\nThe Commissioner therefore finds the Organisation in breach of section\n\n24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n15\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of\nthe PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay\na financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n\n4\n\n\fInfoCorp Technologies Pte. Ltd.\n16\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 17\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on the Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account\nthe following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThe URL was only known to Participants at the material time\n\nand not to the public.\n(b)\n\nThe KYC documents were only downloaded by a small number\n\nof Participants.\n(c)\n\nThe exposure was for a very short time window of about 15\n\nminutes.\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation had taken immediate remedial actions to\n\nprevent further unauthorised access of the KYC documents.\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the investigation.\n\n(f)\n\nThe Organisation had promptly notified the PDPC of the\n\nincident.\n17\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of S$6,000 within 30 days from the date of the Commissioner’s\ndirection, failing which, interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court 2 in\nrespect of judgement debts, shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of the financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n2\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $33,000 was imposed on DS Human Resource for breaches of the PDPA.

Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1802-B1756\n\n13 June 2019.\nBackground\n1\n\nOpen source software is increasing in popularity and prevalence. This\n\ncase illustrates the risks to companies in using default settings of open source\nsoftware without any assessment of the security features. On 25 February 2018,\nDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd. (“DSHR”) informed the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach involving\nunauthorised access and deletion of its database by a hacker. Following an\ninvestigation into the matter, the Commissioner found DSHR in breach of\nsections 12 and 24 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nDSHR specialises in the outsourcing of part-time staff to the food and\n\nbeverage industry in Singapore. Individuals interested in applying for a parttime job would enter their personal data into DSHR’s mobile application. The\npersonal data collected by DSHR’s mobile application was stored on MongoDB\ndatabase, an open source database software used by DSHR since April 2017\n(“Database”).\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n3\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nThe Database is hosted on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) server. The\n\nsource code used by DSHR to perform specific functions on the Database was\nstored in Github, an online code repository. The administration of DSHR’s\nDatabase was handled mainly by DSHR’s director. At the material time, the\nDatabase stored personal data of approximately 2,100 individuals, including:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC Number;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(d)\n\nGender;\n\n(e)\n\nEmergency Contact;\n\n(f)\n\nBank Account Details;\n\n(g)\n\nWork Experience;\n\n(h)\n\nEducational Qualification; and\n\n(i)\n\nImage of front and back of NRIC.\n\n(collectively, “DSHR’s Data”)\n4\n\nOn 24 February 2018, DSHR discovered unauthorised access to the\n\nDatabase and deletion of DSHR’s Data. The hacker demanded payment of 0.25\nbitcoins in exchange for restoring the Database. Notwithstanding DSHR’s\npayment on the same day, the hacker did not restore the Database (collectively,\nthe “Incident”). DSHR did not have a backup and was unable to recover the\ndeleted DSHR’s Data.\n\n2\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n5\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nDSHR took the following remedial actions after the Incident:\n(a)\n\nChanged all of the passwords of its AWS account;\n\n(b)\n\nRestricted connections to DSHR’s AWS server to DSHR’s IP\n\naddresses only;\n(c)\n\nDisabled remote access to the MongoDB server software;\n\n(d)\n\nEngaged consultants to perform vulnerability and penetration\n\ntesting, and remedied the issues found in the tests, such as an issue\nconcerning session management;\n(e)\n\nInstalled HTTPS at www.dshradmin.com;\n\n(f)\n\nChanged the username of it AWS account; and\n\n(g)\n\nNotified all affected individuals via SMS.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n6\n\nIt is not disputed that the DSHR’s Data is “personal data” as defined in\n\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA. There is also no dispute that the PDPA applies to\nDSHR as it falls within PDPA’s definition of “organisation”.\n7\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commissioner in this case are as\n\nfollows:\n(a)\n\nWhether DSHR had complied with its obligations under Section\n\n24 of the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\nWhether DSHR had complied with its obligations under Section\n\n12 of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nWhether DSHR complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n8\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. It is not disputed\nthat DSHR had possession and control of DSHR’s Data stored in the Database,\nand hosted on the AWS Server.\n9\n\nThe investigations found that DSHR failed to put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the DSHR’s Data for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe default settings of the MongoDB open source database\n\nsoftware allowed remote connections through the internet. By using the\ndefault settings, DSHR’s Data stored on the Database was exposed.\nDSHR used the default settings without any assessment of whether this\nwas a reasonable security arrangement to protect DSHR’s Data stored\non the Database. In this regard, DSHR admitted that it focused on the\ninstallation and functional use of the MongoDB database software rather\nthan its security.\n(b)\n\nThere was readily available information and documents on\n\nsecurity of the MongoDB software (e.g. steps to take to enable access\ncontrol and limit network exposure). This included MongoDB’s blog\npost on 6 January 2017 referring to a Security Manual and Checklist\nwhich DSHR should have referred to when installing the MongoDB\nsoftware in April 2017. DSHR failed to do so. As highlighted in the\nCommission’s Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium,\norganisations need to put in place adequate protection for databases that\n\n4\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\ncontain personal data, and consider their security requirements when\nselecting a database product.1\n(c)\n\nDSHR’s Data included bank account details which is personal\n\ndata of a sensitive nature.2 As highlighted in Re Credit Counselling\nSingapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [25], when it comes to the protection\nof sensitive personal data, there is a need to put in place stronger security\nmeasures because of the actual or potential harm, and the severity of\nsuch harm, that may befall an individual from a misuse or unauthorised\nuse of such data. In the circumstances, it was completely inexcusable for\nDSHR to use the default settings in the MongoDB open source database\nsoftware without addressing its mind to the questions whether remote\naccess to DSHR’s Data was necessary and, if not, ensuring that the\nremote access functionality of MongoDB was disabled.\n(d)\n\nMore fundamentally, MongoDB did not have an administrator\n\npassword by default. It is necessary for all organisations making use of\nIT solutions to secure the administrator account by changing its default\npassword to something unique and not easily guessable.\n(e)\n\nThe Commissioner finds that DSHR failed to put in place any\n\nsecurity or access controls to the Database (e.g. through password\nprotection), resulting in DSHR’s Data being exposed to the Internet.\nThis case is analogous to the case Re Propnex Realty Pte Ltd [2017]\nSGPDPC 1, where it was found that the organisation failed to properly\nprotect personal data as it did not have any security controls or\n\n1\n\nPDPC, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium at [13.1]-[13.2].\n\n2\n\nRe AIA Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 10 at [19].\n\n5\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nrestrictions (i.e. proper authentication system) to prevent access from the\nInternet over the webpages that were stored on the server.\n10\n\nThe investigations also revealed that DSHR had inadequate patch\n\nmanagement processes. At the material time, notwithstanding GitHub had\npublished documentation on its website advising periodic manual review by\nusers, DSHR relied completely on GitHub for MongoDB patch alerts. GitHub\nis a portal for collaborative storage and management of source code in the\ndeveloper community. Its features include providing security alerts of common\nvulnerabilities. However, it is not a complete substitute for monitoring IT\nsecurity portals (eg Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system, or CVE)\nand the security and patch information feed direct from the software solution\nprovider (ie MongoDB). DSHR ought to have actively monitored for new\npatches released for software components and from the correct sources. Cyber\nattackers are well aware of vulnerabilities available for exploiting. It is\nimportant for organisations to keep their software updated or patched regularly\nto minimise their vulnerabilities.3\nWhether DSHR complied with its obligations under section 12 of the PDPA\n11\n\nDSHR admitted that it did not have any policies or internal guidelines\n\nwhich specify the rules and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of\npersonal data. DSHR’s omission to do so and consequential failure to\ncommunicate such policies and internal guidelines to its employees amounts to\na breach of section 12 of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\nPDPC, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium at [16.3]-[16.4].\n\n6\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nRepresentations by DSHR\n12\n\nIn the course of settling this decision, DHSR made representations on\n\nthe amount of financial penalty which the Commissioner intended to impose,\nwhile agreeing with the Commissioner’s findings and basis of determination set\nout above.\n13\n\nIn its representations on the amount of financial penalty, DSHR\n\nrequested that the Commissioner consider the following factors:\n(a)\n\nDSHR asserted that the Incident arose due to its director’s\n\nnegligence but hopes that the director’s lack of technical knowledge may\nbe taken into account;\n(b)\n\nThe popularity of MongoDB database software and the fact that\n\nit was used by many big companies worldwide led DSHR’s director to\nbelieve that the database would have reasonable security reliability; and\n(c)\n\nDSHR’s determination to proceed with automation of its\n\nbusiness processes notwithstanding difficulties faced, including hiring a\nfull time developer moving forward;\n14\n\nHaving considered representations, the Commissioner acknowledges\n\nDSHR’s determination to automate its business processes and its director’s\ninitiative to do so in response to the Government’s push for small and medium\nenterprises (“SMEs”) go digital, particularly when difficulties in hiring\ntechnically skilled staff would have discouraged others. The Commissioner\nwould like to take this opportunity to highlight that good data management and\nprotection practices need to be adopted from the onset of the digitalisation\nprocess, and these can be proportionate without being too costly. SMEs are\n\n7\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nurged to tap on available Government funding and support programmes to assist\nSMEs in their digitalisation efforts.\n15\n\nThe Commissioner has decided to maintain the financial penalty set out\n\nin paragraph 19 for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nAn organisation’s lack of technical knowledge cannot be a\n\nmitigating factor. As explained in WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd\n[2018] SGPDPC 26 at [24], the responsibilities of ownership do not\nrequire technical expertise. In this regard, if an organisation does not\nhave the requisite level of technical expertise to manage its IT system,\nthe organisation may either procure technical expertise internally (e.g.\nby training its existing employees or hiring individuals with relevant\nexpertise) or engage competent service providers and give proper\ninstructions; and\n(b)\n\nThe security features or reliability of the MongoDB database\n\nsoftware were not the issue. It was DSHR’s failure to ensure that the\nappropriate security settings were configured to protect DSHR’s Data.\nThis is therefore not a mitigating factor.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n16\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that DSHR is in breach of sections\n\n12 and 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of\nthe PDPA to issue DSHR such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance\nwith the PDPA. This may include directing DSHR to pay a financial penalty of\nsuch amount not exceeding $1 million.\n\n8\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte. Ltd.\n\n17\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 16\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on DSHR in this case, the Commissioner took into account the\nfollowing aggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nThere was actual loss of DSHR’s Data as the hacker managed to\n\naccess and delete the entire Database;\n(b)\n\nThere was also the risk of DSHR’s Data being misused (e.g. the\n\nfront and back image of affected individuals’ NRIC could be used to\ncommit identity theft); and\n(c)\n\nDSHR’s failure to password protect the Database was a serious\n\nlapse of a basic and integral IT security arrangement.\n18\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nDSHR implemented reasonable corrective measures to address\n\nthe technical flaws that resulted in the Incident. DSHR also notified all\naffected individuals via SMS; and\n(b)\n19\n\nDSHR cooperated with the investigations.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs DSHR to pay a financial penalty of $33,000.00 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court4 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and\n\n4\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n9\n\n\fDS Human Resource Pte.

Ltd.\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1801-B1526\n11 June 2019\n1\n\nThis case concerns the unauthorised disclosure of the names and mobile phone numbers\n\nof 120,747 GrabCar Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) customers in marketing emails sent out by\nthe Organisation (the “Incident”). On 5 January 2018, GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd., a related\ncorporation of the Organisation, 1 notified the Personal Data Protection Commission of the\nIncident on behalf of the Organisation. The Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision\nbased on the investigations carried out in this matter are set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is part of the Grab Group, which offers, among other things, ride-\n\nhailing transport services, food delivery and payment services on its mobile platform. As part\nof its marketing strategy, the Organisation regularly conducts marketing campaigns to reach\nout to targeted customers. These frequently involves sending emails offering special\npromotions to selected customers.\n3\n\nOn 17 December 2017, the Organisation sent out 399,751 marketing emails to a\n\ntargeted group of customers as part of a marketing campaign (“Marketing Campaign”). Out\nof the emails sent on that date, 120,747 emails contained the name and mobile phone number2\nof another customer, i.e. the email was sent to User A’s (the intended recipient) email address\nbut User B’s (the mismatched customer) name and mobile phone number was reflected in the\nemail as that of the intended recipient (the “Mismatched Emails”).\n4\n\nShortly after the Mismatched Emails were sent out, the Organisation’s Customer\n\nExperience team reported an increased number of customer queries regarding the unauthorised\ndisclosure of their personal data to other customers. The Organisation commenced\ninvestigations immediately thereafter. It determined that the Incident was caused by the\n1\n\nThe Legal and Compliance team for the Grab Group in Singapore sits within GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd.\nA customer’s mobile phone number is linked to their account and a customer’s email address could be linked\nto several mobile phone numbers. As such, the customer’s mobile phone number was included in the marketing\nemails to allow users to easily identify which of their accounts would be applicable for the promotion.\n2\n\n2\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nerroneous assembly of customer information from different database tables that could, in turn,\nbe traced to changes that had been made to the structure of its customer database since the\nprevious marketing campaign.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation maintains a set of user attributes, i.e. data points that describe every\n\ncustomer such as registration date, bookings and rides, in a database table (the “Main Table”).\nEach customer is assigned a unique “passengers_id” number in the Main Table. For the purpose\nof illustration, the Main Table would have appeared as follows:\n\n6\n\npassengers_id\n\nname\n\npassenger_email passenger_mobile_no\n\n12354567\n\nSally Goh\n\nsal.g@amail.com\n\n81456789\n\n22558866\n\nJohn Tan\n\njt@amail.com\n\n84567894\n\n76543211\n\nAlex Lee\n\nal@amail.com\n\n91111212\n\nOn 24 November 2017, as part of the Organisation’s email verification efforts, 3 the\n\nOrganisation’s Product Analytics team was instructed to add a new user attribute\n“is_email_verified”. The verified email addresses were placed in a database table (the\n“Verified Email Database Table”) which was separate from the Main Table. Each customer\nin the Verified Email Database Table was assigned a unique “verified_email_user_id” number.\nFor the purpose of illustration, the Verified Email Database Table would have appeared as\nfollows:\n\nverified_email_user_id\n\nName\n\nverified_email\n\n22558866\n\nLuke Kang\n\nLuke.k@amail.com\n\n76543211\n\nMindy Ho\n\nMindy.ho@amail.com\n\n12354567\n\nM. Hafiz\n\nHafizm@amail.com\n\nIn the above example, only Luke Kang, Mindy Ho and M. Hafiz had verified their emails and\nwould be included in the Verified Email Database Table. Those customers who did not verify\ntheir emails would not be included in the Verified Email Database Table.\n\n3\n\nThe email verification exercise was undertaken to allow the Organisation to target customers with verified\nemail addresses for future marketing campaigns.\n\n3\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n7\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nThe “passengers_ids” and “verified_email_user_ids” were created separately but both\n\nID numbers are of the same integer length and comprise entirely of numerals (i.e. without\nalphabets or other symbols). Unbeknownst to the Organisation at the time, some\n“verified_email_user_ids” were identical to some “passengers_ids” even though they did not\nidentify the same customer.\n8\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the procedure for using new user attributes to generate and\n\nsend marketing emails was as follows:\n(a)\n\nRegional Marketing provides high-level marketing requirements;\n\n(b)\n\nProduct Analytics creates the corresponding database queries (which were SQL\n\ncommands), that identify and select the attributes to be used in the marketing campaign.\nThis process is subject to some internal tests;\n(c)\n\nData Engineering executes the database query to produce the data for the\n\nmarketing campaign. The data file is then uploaded to an emailing system to generate\nthe actual marketing emails for use in the campaign.\n(d)\n\nRegional Marketing “verifies” the final outcome by looking at the marketing\n\nemails that have already been sent out, typically by including some test account email\naddresses in the email blast.\n9\n\nIn the present case, Product Analytics, who wrote the SQL command for the database\n\nquery for the Marketing Campaign, wrongly equated “verified_email_user_id” with\n“passengers_id” and treated them as the unique identifier for a customer. As a result of this\nerror, the SQL command used “verified_email_user_ids” to select the attributes for producing\nthe data to generate the campaign emails.\n\n10\n\nAs a result, when the Data Engineering team used the SQL command to produce the\n\ndata to generate marketing emails for the campaign, email addresses were drawn from the\nVerified Email Database Table whereas the customer’s name and mobile phone number were\ndrawn from the Main Table on the assumption that the “verified_email_user_id” and\n“passengers_id” referred to the same customer. The Mismatched Emails were therefore created\nwhere the “verified_email_user_id” in the Verified Email Database Table coincided with\n4\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nanother customer’s “passengers_id” in the Main Table. Using the sample information from the\ntables at paragraphs 5 and 6 above, the consolidated table would have appeared as follows:\n\npassengers\n\nname\n\n_id\n12354567\n22558866\n76543211\n\n11\n\nSally\nGoh\nJohn\nTan\nAlex\nLee\n\npassenger_ verified_email verified_email\nmobile_no\n\n_user_id\n\n81456789\n\n12354567\n\nHafizm@amail.com\n\n84567894\n\n22558866\n\nLuke.k@amail.com\n\n91111212\n\n76543211\n\nMindy.ho@amail.com\n\nUsing the above example, M. Hafiz (who had verified his email address) would have\n\nreceived an email at his verified email address, Hafizm@amail.com, with Sally Goh’s name\nand mobile phone number because the SQL command for the database query equated\n“verified_email_user_id” with “passengers_id” and his “verified_email_user_id” is identical\nto Sally Goh’s “passengers_id”. Similarly, Luke Kang (who had verified his email address)\nwould have received an email at his verified email address, Luke.k@amail.com, with John\nTan’s name and mobile phone number as his “verified_email_user_id” is identical to John\nTan’s “passengers_id”. Mindy Ho would have received an email at her verified email address,\nMindy.ho@amail.com, with Alex Lee’s name and mobile phone number as her\n“verified_email_user_id” was identical to Alex Lee’s “passengers_id”.\n12\n\nAlthough a total of 399,751 marketing emails were generated and sent in the Marketing\n\nCampaign, only customers who had verified their email addresses4 received the Mismatched\nEmails as they were the only ones that were assigned a “verified_email_user_id”. Emails were\nnot sent to those who did not verify their email address.\n13\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation implemented more rigorous data validation and checks to the\n\naddition/changing of user attributes process;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation changed its practices to require a third person to perform sanity\n\nchecks of the data before triggering any new campaigns; and\n\n4\n\nThe 120,747 affected individuals.\n\n5\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n(c)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nthe Organisation plans to incorporate privacy by design elements by masking\n\nmobile phone numbers (eg. 9*****11) in future marketing campaigns.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n14\n\nThe key issue for determination is whether the Organisation had complied with its\n\nobligations under section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n15\n\nAs a preliminary point, customer names and mobile phone numbers are personal data\n\nas defined under section 2(1) of the PDPA as it is clearly possible to identify the individuals\nfrom that data. It was also not disputed that the personal data was disclosed mistakenly and\nwithout authorisation.\nWhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n16\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect the personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks\n(the “Protection Obligation”).\n17\n\nThe Commissioner finds that the Organisation did not have adequate measures in place\n\nto detect whether the changes it made to the system that held personal data introduced errors\nthat put the personal data it was processing at risk. As highlighted in Re Flight Raja Travels\nSingapore Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 16 (at [8]):\n“… when an organisation makes changes to a system that processes personal\ndata in its possession or control, the organisation has to make reasonable\narrangements to prevent any compromise to personal data.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n18\n\nFirst, it is not disputed that the root cause of the Incident was an error with the database\n\nquery command which erroneously treated the “verified_email_user_id” as the unique\nidentifier when it joined data from two database tables. Essentially, the Organisation\nconsolidated the Verified Email Database and the Main Table by equating the\n“verified_email_user_id” found in the Verified Email Database Table with the “passengers_id”\nfound in the Main Table and running the command to extract the verified email address of its\n6\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nclients from the Verified Email Database and the name and contact number of its clients from\nthe\n\nMain\n\nTable.\n\nThe\n\nresult\n\nwas\n\nthat,\n\nwhere\n\nthe\n\n“passengers_id”\n\nand\n\nthe\n\n“verified_email_user_id” were coincidentally the same number, the command would have\nextracted the email address corresponding to the “verified_email_user_id” of a client from the\nVerified Email Database and matched it with the name and mobile number corresponding to\nthe “passengers_id” of a different client from the Main Table. Therefore, the 1st client would\nhave been sent an email from the Organisation with the name and mobile number of the 2nd\nclient.\n19\n\nSecond, the Commissioner finds that the Incident arose in part because of\n\nadministrative failures. In this regard, the Organisation itself admitted that the technical\ndocumentation for the new Verified Email Database Table was not sufficiently clear. If the\ndocumentation had been clearer, the employee who wrote the SQL command for the database\nquery might not have made the erroneous assumption and would not have joined the two\ndatabase tables in that way.\n20\n\nFinally, there were shortcomings in the way the Organisation conducted tests. Tests\n\nwere conducted on non-verified email addresses instead of on both non-verified and verified\nemail addresses. The core team of testers did not discover the mismatch between the customer’s\nemail address and his/her name and mobile number because the test email addresses used were\nnot verified email addresses and were therefore not affected by the erroneous joining.\n21\n\nThere was another grave error in this case. Investigations disclosed that there had not\n\nbeen proper user acceptance testing of the SQL script before it was deployed into production.\nProduct Analytics conducted technical tests but Regional Marketing was not involved in user\nacceptance testing. The Regional Marketing team only verified the actual production run of\nemails, i.e. emails that were already sent to customers. Hence, even if they detected any errors\nsuch as the mismatched data, it would have been too late to correct the error.\n22\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation had failed to make\n\nreasonable security arrangements to detect errors when preparing the change, i.e. writing the\ndatabase query, as well as in failing to conduct proper testing before implementing the change.\nIt is therefore in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nDirections\n23\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of the Protection Obligation under\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to\ngive the Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n24\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed, the Commissioner\n\ntook into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative during the investigation and in line with their\n\nimplementation of their data breach management plan they notified the Commission\nvoluntarily;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took immediate effective remedial action in line with their\n\nimplementation of their data breach management plan;\n(c)\n\nthe personal data disclosed compromised only the individual’s name and mobile\n\nphone number, which was not of a sensitive nature; and\n(d)\n\nthe affected customer’s personal data was only disclosed to one individual, i.e.\n\na customer whose “passengers_id” was identical to the affected customer’s\n“verified_email_user_id” number.\n25\n\nThe Organisation made representations to the Commission after the preliminary\n\ngrounds of decision was issued and requested for a reduction in the financial penalty of $16,000\nprovided in the said preliminary grounds of decision. The Organisation based this request on\ntheir prompt voluntary notification and implementation of a remediation plan, and the financial\npenalty amounts imposed in previous cases. In particular, the Organisation cited the cases of\nRe Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14, Re NTUC Income Co-operative Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 10,\nRe Flight Raja Travels Singapore [2018] SGPDPC 16 and Re Challenger Technologies and\nanother [2016] SGPDPC 6.\n26\n\nThe Organisation’s voluntary notification and accountable practices had already been\n\ntaken into account in assessing the financial penalty.\n\n8\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd\n27\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 15\n\nThe cited cases are distinguishable from the present case. In Re Aviva Ltd and Re NTUC\n\nIncome Co-operative Ltd, the financial penalty imposed was $6,000 and $10,000 respectively.\nThe reason that this case warrants a higher financial penalty even though it does not involve\nsensitive personal data (unlike in the previous two cases), is the much higher number of\nindividuals affected. In this case, a total of 120,747 data subjects were affected, while only 2\ndata subjects were affected in Re Aviva Ltd and 214 data subjects were impacted in Re NTUC\nIncome Co-operative Ltd. Similarly, only 72 data subjects were impacted in Re Flight Raja\nTravels Singapore.\n28\n\nRe Challenger Technologies and another was one of the first grounds of decisions\n\nwhich were issued. The Commission had taken into consideration the fact that the incident in\nthat case happened in September 2014, only a few months after the coming into force of the\nPDPA, when organisations may not have understood fully the manner in which they were\nrequired to comply with their obligations. After more than 4 years since the PDPA has come\ninto full force, this consideration is no longer applicable and organisations should not be\nreferring to these early cases in estimating the quantum of the potential financial penalties that\nmay be imposed.\n29\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\n\nS$16,000 in accordance with this direction, failing which interest at the rate specified in the\nRules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n9\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to GrabCar for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements for GrabHitch drivers to protect the personal data of passengers that used GrabHitch services.

Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner – Case Nos DP-1702-B0508/DP-1703B0613\n11 June 2019\nIntroduction and facts of the cases\n\n1\n\nThis decision addresses, in the main, the obligations of an online ride-\n\nsharing platform and drivers who use the platform to provide carpool rides to\npassengers. Grabcar Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) operates an online platform\nthrough the Grab mobile application (the “Grab App”) which enables\nindividuals to book taxis or private cars for transportation services. The Grab\nApp also provides a carpooling option, referred to in the app as “GrabHitch”.\nGrabHitch matches a passenger with a driver who is willing to give a lift to the\npassenger on the way to the driver’s destination in return for a fee. The\nOrganisation states on its website,1 “GrabHitch is a social carpooling platform\npowered by everyday, non-commercial drivers giving you a lift along the way\nto cover petrol costs.”2\n\n2\n\nThis decision relates to separate complaints by two passengers (the\n\n“Complainants”) who used GrabHitch to book carpool rides. The carpool rides\nwere provided by two different drivers (the “Drivers”) on separate occasions.\n\n1\n\nwww.grab.com/sg/hitch/\n\nThe Organisation’s website also states that GrabHitch is provided in compliance with the Road\nTraffic (Car Pools) (Exemption) Order 2015.\n2\n\n2\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nNevertheless, the two complaints are dealt with together in this decision as they\nboth relate to similar issues, in particular, to the issue of disclosure of\npassengers’ personal data without consent by GrabHitch drivers.\n\n3\n\nThe substance of each complaint was, in essence, that the Complainant’s\n\npersonal data had been disclosed without consent on social media by the Driver\nwho gave a ride to the Complainant. The details of the complaints are\nsummarised below:\n\n(a)\n\nThe first complaint alleged that the Driver involved had posted\n\nvarious data relating to the first Complainant on a public Facebook\nGroup named “GrabHitch Singapore Community” (“GHSC”). These\ndata included screenshots of messages between the Driver and the\nComplainant which had been sent through the Grab App and a typewritten post by the Driver which set out details of a dispute between the\nDriver and the Complainant and which identified the Complainant by\nname. The dispute in this case related to whether the Complainant\nshould contribute to the payment of ERP charges and investigations\nrevealed the reason that the Driver had made the posting was to seek\nviews from other carpool drivers on how best to handle disputes relating\nto ERP charges.\n\n(b)\n\nThe second complaint alleged that the Driver involved had\n\nposted various data relating to the second Complainant on a closed\nFacebook Group named “Uber/Grab SG Partners” (“UGSGP”). These\ndata included (i) screenshots of messages between the Driver and the\nComplainant which had been sent through the Grab App and which\nincluded the Complainant’s mobile phone number; (ii) screenshots of\n\n3\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nthe Grab App which showed the name of the Complainant and the\nComplainant’s pick-up and destination points; (iii) a screenshot of the\nComplainant’s Facebook Page which included her photograph, name\nand workplace; (iv) a typed out post by the Driver which detailed his\ndispute with the Complainant and disclosed the Complainant’s pick-up\nand destination points; and (v) a partial screenshot of SMS messages\nsent between the Driver and the Complainant, which included the\nComplainant’s mobile number. The Driver’s post in this case was about\nhis dispute with the second Complainant on the payment of GrabHitch\ncharges. It appeared that the Complainant had insisted that she pay for\nthe ride by card through the Grab App although the app indicated that\nthe complainant was to pay for her ride in cash. Investigations revealed\nthat the reason that the Driver had posted the above information was\nbecause the Organisation could not contact the Complainant to inform\nher of the situation and because the Driver was of the view that this was\na case of non-payment.\n\n4\n\nInvestigations also revealed that similar postings had also been made by\n\nother drivers on GHSC. Generally, these postings disclosed information such as\npassengers’ names, photographs, ride details and the details of disputes between\nthe drivers and their passengers.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation did not create or operate either the GHSC or UGSGP\n\nFacebook pages and investigations did not reveal any apparent link between the\npersons operating those pages and the Organisation.\n\n4\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nIssues arising\n\n6\n\nUnder section 13 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n\n“PDPA”), organisations are prohibited from collecting, using or disclosing\npersonal data about an individual unless the individual’s consent is obtained or\ncollection, use or disclosure without consent is authorised or required under the\nPDPA or any other written law.\n\n7\n\nIn addition, under section 24 of the PDPA, organisations are required to\n\nprotect personal data in their possession or under their control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure and\nvarious other listed risks.\n\n8\n\nIn the circumstances, two main issues arise:\n\n(a)\n\nwhether the Drivers are “organisations” under the PDPA and if\n\nso, whether they had contravened section 13 of the PDPA in relation to\nthe disclosure of the Complainants’ personal data on the GHSC and\nUGSGP Facebook pages; and\n\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened section 24 of the\n\nPDPA with respect to the protection of the Complainants’ personal data.\nFirst Issue - Are the Drivers “organisations” under the PDPA?\n\nGrabHitch drivers provide carpool rides in a personal capacity\n\n9\n\nThe PDPA applies to organisations as defined under the PDPA. It is\n\n5\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nclear from the definition of “organisation” in section 2 of the PDPA that an\nindividual may be an “organisation” for the purposes of the PDPA. However,\nsection 4(1) of the PDPA further provides that Parts III to VI of the PDPA\n(which includes section 13) do not impose any obligations on any individual\nacting in a personal or domestic capacity.\n\n10\n\nGrabHitch drivers provide carpool rides on a non-commercial and non-\n\nprofit basis in accordance with the Road Traffic (Car Pools) (Exemption) Order\n2015 and as such are not required to obtain a Private Hire Car Driver’s\nVocational Licence. In this regard, paragraph 3(1) of the said Order states that:\n“Subject to sub‑paragraph (2), the provisions specified in the\nSchedule do not apply to a person who uses a private motor car\nfor the carriage of a passenger for hire or reward in the case\nwhere —\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(g)\n\nthe person does not solicit for the passenger on a road or\nat a parking place or a public stand;\nthe carriage of the passenger is incidental to the person’s\nuse of the private motor car;\nthe person informs the passenger, before the start of the\ncarriage, of the person’s destination;\nthe person agrees with the passenger, before the start of\nthe carriage, on the date of, pick‑up and drop‑off points\nof, and the payment (whether in cash or in kind) for, the\ncarriage;\nthe amount or the value of any benefit in kind that the\nperson collects from the passenger as payment does not\nexceed the cost and expenses incurred for the carriage of\nthe passenger;\nif there is more than one passenger, the aggregate of the\namount or the value of any benefit in kind that the person\ncollects from each of the passengers as payment does not\nexceed the cost and expenses incurred for the carriage of\nall the passengers; and\nthere is nothing in or on the private motor car displaying\nor referring to the fares for hiring the private motor car.”\n\n6\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n11\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nConsistent with this, the Organisation has a Driver’s Code of Conduct\n\nfor GrabHitch Drivers (the “Code of Conduct”) which sets out the terms on\nwhich a GrabHitch Driver may offer carpool rides. The Code of Conduct\nprovides that:\n“Specific for carpooling, as mandated by the Law:\ni\n\nThe motor vehicle used must be registered and insured in\nthe name of the Driver and used by the Driver or any\nperson by the Driver’s authority expressly provided to the\nCompany, the insurer of the vehicle and the relevant\nauthorities\nii The motor vehicle must not be used for the carriage of\ngoods other than samples, any instructional purposes for\nreward, or the carriage of passengers for hire or reward\npurposes. These mean the Driver must:\n Not solicit for passengers on a road or parking place or\npublic stand\n Ensure the carriage of the passenger is incidental to the\nDriver’s use of his vehicle\n Inform the passenger before the start of the carriage, of\nthe Driver’s destination\n Agree with the passenger, before the start of the ride,\non the date, pick-up and drop-off points, and the\npayment (whether in cash or in kind) for, the carriage\n Ensure that the amount or the value of any benefit in\nkind that the Driver collects from the passenger as\npayment does not exceed the cost and expenses\nincurred for the carriage of the passenger\n Ensure that if there is more than one passenger, the\naggregate of the amount or the value of any benefit in\nkind that the person collects from each passenger as\npayment does not exceed the cost and expenses\nincurred for the carriage of all the passengers; and\n\n7\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nEnsure that there is nothing in or on the motor vehicle\nthat displays or refers to the fares for the hiring of the\nmotor vehicle\nNot exceed the local limit (if available) of car pool trips\nin each day on any motor vehicle”\n\nGrabHitch drivers agree to the Code of Conduct by virtue of their\n\nagreement with the Organisation as set out in the “Terms and Conditions for\nSingapore GrabHitch Drivers” (the “GrabHitch Terms”). In particular, in\nagreeing to the GrabHitch Terms, GrabHitch drivers agree that they “have read,\nunderstood, accepted and agreed with [the GrabHitch Terms], the conditions\nset out in the Driver’s Registration Form and the Driver’s Code of Conduct.”\n\n13\n\nIn respect of the limit on carpooling trips that may be offered by a\n\nGrabHitch driver, the Organisation indicates the following in the “Frequently\nAsked Questions” section of its website (“FAQ”):\n“How many trips can I offer a day as a Hitch driver?\nBased on current carpooling regulations, non-commercial\ndrivers can only complete 2 trips in a calendar day. While we\nappreciate your enthusiasm for carpooling, please note that 2\ntrips a day limit is set by LTA regardless of whichever platform\nyou use.\nWe hope that you won’t put yourself and your riders at risk as\nyour insurance may not cover if you do more than 2 trips a day\nin total, combined across all platforms.\nFor drivers who are worried their insurance does not cover\nGrabHitch rides, remember we are the ONLY carpooling service\nwho has purchased additional insurance for extra coverage\nprovided no regulations are breached.”\n\n8\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n14\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nBased on the foregoing, I find that GrabHitch drivers provide carpool\n\nrides in their personal capacity. This is especially so given that GrabHitch\ndrivers:\n\n(a)\n\nare not allowed to solicit for passengers on the road, parking\n\nplaces or public stands;\n\n(b)\n\nare to ensure that their carrying of a passenger is merely\n\nincidental to their use of the vehicle;\n\n(c)\n\ncan only collect payment for the trip on the basis of a recovery\n\nof costs and expenses for each trip; and\n\n(d)\n\n15\n\nare only allowed to offer two carpool trips in each calendar day.\n\nIn the circumstances, GrabHitch drivers who are providing carpool rides\n\nin accordance with the applicable terms and conditions (as detailed above) are\nnot subject to the PDPA. Accordingly, the Drivers cannot be in breach of section\n13 the PDPA. It goes without saying that had any of the Drivers exceeded the\ndaily limit of two carpooling trips, they would not be considered to have\nprovided the carpool rides in a personal capacity.\n\nSecond Issue - Did the Organisation contravene section 24 of the PDPA?\n\n16\n\nAlthough the Organisation itself had not disclosed the Complainant’s\n\npersonal data, the Organisation is also required to put in place reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data of passengers using the Grab\nApp. In this regard, personal data obtained through the Grab App would be in\n\n9\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nthe possession or under the control of the Organisation. This includes personal\ndata such as the name and mobile phone number of the Complainant and any\nother information which was associated with, and related to, the Complainant,\nsuch as the Complainant’s pick-up point and destination. However, personal\ndata from the second Complainant’s Facebook page would not be regarded as\nbeing in the possession or under the control of the Organisation.\n\n17\n\nIn relation to the protection of passengers’ personal data from\n\nunauthorised disclosure to third parties, the Organisation sets out the following\nin the Code of Conduct:\n“You are prohibited from posting passenger details in public\nforums including social media sites or sharing contact details.\nThis is a violation of the Personal Data Protection Act.”\n18\n\nThis is the sole measure which the Organisation had put in place to\n\nprevent unauthorised disclosure of passengers’ personal data on public forum\nsites which GrabHitch drivers may use. Investigations revealed that the two\nDrivers in question were unaware of the restriction in the Code of Conduct\nagainst posting passenger details on social media sites.\n\n19\n\nI find that merely including this restriction in the Code of Conduct is\n\ninsufficient as a reasonable security arrangement to protect passengers’ personal\ndata. The Organisation makes its platform available to facilitate the hitching of\nrides or carpooling as part of its suite of commercial services. It has foreseen\nthe risk that GrabHitch Drivers may post passenger details on social media sites\nas evidenced by its Code of Conduct. It could have done more to inform\nGrabHitch drivers of the range of acceptable and unacceptable conduct.\nHowever, apart from this entry in the Code of Conduct, there is nothing to\nindicate that this provision had been drawn to the attention of GrabHitch drivers\n\n10\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nor that they understood the importance of protecting passengers’ personal data.\nFurthermore, as GrabHitch drivers are not subject to the PDPA, they may not\nbe familiar with its provisions and the obligations imposed thereunder on\norganisations.\n\n20\n\nAs has been held in Re Habitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018]\n\nSGPDPC 9 and Re National University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5,\nreasonable security arrangements can include policies and practices as well as\ntraining. The Organisation ought to have put in place more detailed guidance\nfor GrabHitch drivers to educate them about the need to handle the personal\ndata of their riders, obtained through the Grab App, with care. As GrabHitch\ndrivers are occasional drivers who may not be aware of the Organisation’s\nobligations under the PDPA, the Organisation would have done well by\nintroducing some form of online training for them. At the very least, the\nabovementioned restriction in the Code of Conduct could have been proactively\nhighlighted to GrabHitch drivers. In its representations, the Organisation\nasserted that requiring it to train GrabHitch drivers would be onerous. This\nassertion was not substantiated and probably was premised on the assumption\nof a classroom style training. Training is a means of communication and\ninstruction that may take various forms and is one of the security arrangements\nthat may be implemented by the Organisation to meet its obligations under the\nPDPA. It is ultimately up to the Organisation to determine the appropriate\nsecurity arrangements it ought to implement to comply with its PDPA\nobligations. In the circumstances, I have acceded to the Organisation’s request\nto amend the initial Directions issued in the preliminary Grounds of Decision to\nremove the direction to train GrabHitch Drivers and instead leave it to the\nOrganisation to ensure that it implements reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent the misuse and unauthorised disclosure of passengers’ personal data.\n\n11\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nRepresentations made by the Organisation\n\n21\n\nThe Organisation has made representations dated 21 November 2018 in\n\nrespect of the Commission’s preliminary findings, asserting that they should not\nbe found in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. Their central argument is that a\nGrabHitch driver does not drive in a “personal or domestic” capacity and should\nbe considered an “organisation” that is required to comply with the PDPA in\ntheir own right. In support of this assertion the Organisation has highlighted the\nfollowing factors:\n\n(a)\n\nBy driving individuals who are not friends or family, the\n\nGrabHitch driver’s activities move out of the private sphere and into the\npublic. Accordingly, GrabHitch drivers are not driving in a “personal or\ndomestic” capacity.\n\n(b)\n\nGrabHitch\n\ndrivers\n\n“maintain\n\nindependence”\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation in deciding on the precise details involved in the provision\nof GrabHitch services (e.g. how often they drive, where to go, how much\npayment to collect). GrabHitch drivers therefore “determine the\npurposes and means of processing the personal data” of the passengers,\nwhich is a defining characteristic of an organisation.\n\n22\n\nAs a preliminary point, I would highlight that the Organisation’s\n\nobligation to protect personal data under section 24 in its possession or control\nremains whether or not GrabHitch Drivers drive in a personal or domestic\ncapacity or in a capacity as organisations as defined under the PDPA. As such,\nthe position adopted by GrabHitch that GrabHitch drivers are required to\ncomply with the PDPA in their own right, does not address the finding that the\n\n12\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nOrganisation is in breach of its obligation to protect personal data under section\n24 of the PDPA.\n\n23\n\nIt bears further repetition that in my view, the Organisation’s measure\n\nof merely stating in its Driver’s Code of Conduct that GrabHitch drivers are\nprohibited from posting passenger details as set out at [17] above is insufficient\nto fulfil the Organisation’s section 24 obligations, whether or not GrabHitch\ndrivers are to be treated as organisations in their own right.\n\n24\n\nTurning to the specific positions taken by the Organisation as set out at\n\n[21] above, the first factor raised by the Organisation does not accord with the\nbasic nature of the GrabHitch service, which is fundamentally a carpooling\nactivity facilitated by the Grab App. Carpooling is a ride-sharing practice that\nprivate drivers engage in on a purely voluntary basis, and is best characterised\nas a social activity aimed at defraying the costs involved in owning and\nmaintaining a private car and reducing road congestion. Human life is filled\nwith interactions with people who are not friends or family, and it does not\nfollow that the mere fact of interaction with strangers should elevate an act (in\nthis case, carpooling) from the private to the public sphere.\n\n25\n\nIn fact, the Organisation, in the FAQ material published on its own\n\nwebsite3, seems to recognise that GrabHitch drivers are engaged in an activity\nthat is fundamentally private in nature:\n\n3\n\nQuoted portions retrieved from https://www.grab.com/sg/hitch/, accessed 10 December 2018.\n\n13\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\n“Why should I sign up with GrabHitch? What’s in it for me?\nAs a Hitch Driver, you get to benefit in 3 big ways: Cover your\npetrol costs, make new friends and contribute to a car-lite\nSingapore! All these at your convenience!\nHow is being a GrabHitch driver different from being a\nGrabCar driver?\nThey’re not the same at all! GrabCar drivers are commercial,\nprofessional drivers who have to register a business, purchase\ncommercial insurance, convert their car to a commercial vehicle\nat the LTA and then sign up in person at the Grab office. Since\nHitch Drivers are everyday, non-commercial private car\nowners who are not driving as a profession, the sign up\nprocess is way easier. No need for commercial vehicle\nconversion nor insurance, simply launch the Grab app, take a\ncouple of photos and submit them for verification. And you’re\ndone!\nAm I still considered a Hitch Driver if I don’t drive regularly?\nOf course you are! As a social initiative, we wouldn’t want to\nstress you out by imposing any penalty for irregularity. So\nplease go ahead and enjoy driving GrabHitch at your\nconvenience!\nWhy can’t I get a GrabHitch driver as easily as GrabCar or\nGrabTaxi?\nGrabHitch is meant as an advance booking service as we are\npowered by non-commercial, everyday drivers who give\nHitch Riders a lift at their convenience. Hence, there may not\nalways be any available Hitch Drivers who are heading the same\nway as you do at your specified time.

Learn how to Hitch the right way here.\n2. Your Hitch Driver is not a commercial driver like our\nGrabCar partners so they appreciate if you could treat them\nthe same way you would treat a friend giving you a\n(discounted) lift to your destination!\n3. Book in advance to maximise the chances of you getting a\nmatch! We can’t emphasise this enough but really, it helps to be\na little kiasu. Book the night before for a morning commute or 2\nhours ahead of your evening ride home.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n26\n\nAs repeatedly stressed in the Organisation’s materials quoted above, as\n\ncompared to professional GrabCar drivers, the GrabHitch service is one that is\nnon-commercial, only provided at the drivers’ own convenience, and primarily\nmotivated by a desire to be social and to reduce the need for car usage. For all\nintents and purposes, a GrabHitch driver is no different from a driver offering a\nlift to a roadside hitchhiker out of goodwill. It is thus apparent from the\npublished material that a GrabHitch driver engages in the activity in a purely\npersonal capacity. It is also apparent, their present representations regarding this\nmatter notwithstanding, that the Organisation recognises this. In fact, the private\nand casual nature of being a GrabHitch driver appears to be a main selling point\nfor the Organisation.\n\n27\n\nIn their representations, the Organisation also seeks to assert that\n\nwhether LTA regulates GrabHitch drivers or not should be irrelevant to the\ndetermination of whether or not the drivers should be considered an\norganisation. The Organisation states that doing so will mean that only regulated\nor licensed individuals will be considered organisations. I think that this\nargument takes the logic too far. There is no intention to link the ambit of\n\n15\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\norganisations under the PDPA to regulated activities. The interpretation that I\nhave adopted is consistent with the scheme that exempts carpooling activities\nfrom the requirement of vocational licensing established under the Road Traffic\n(Car Pools) (Exemption) Order 2015 (the “Exemption Order”). This is also\nconsistent with how the Organisation has pitched GrabHitch through its FAQs\nand Code of Conduct for GrabHitch Drivers as discussed in [11], [13] and [25]\nabove.\n\n28\n\nIt is not because of a supposed lack of regulation that the GrabHitch\n\ndrivers are not considered organisations. Instead, it is precisely due to the\npersonal and domestic nature of the activity they are engaging in that they are\nnot subject to the same regulations as a commercial private hire car driver. If\nanything, the exemption of carpooling from the requirements of vocational\nlicensing reflect the inherently private nature of carpooling (and by extension,\nthe GrabHitch service). This is certainly reflected in the Exemption Order,\nwhich only applies to “private motor cars”. In addition, under section 3(1)(b) of\nthe Exemption Order “the carriage of the passenger is incidental to the person’s\nuse of the private motor car [emphasis added]” – unlike a taxi or private hire\ndriver, the raison d’etre of the GrabHitch driver is not the provision of transport;\nin other words, a GrabHitch driver is driving in a purely private capacity and\nthe ferrying of a passenger in the context of a GrabHitch service is incidental to\nthis private capacity.\n\n29\n\nThe second factor raised by the Organisation relates to the\n\n“independence” of the GrabHitch drivers from the Organisation. The\nOrganisation asserts that because a GrabHitch driver is able to decide when to\nprovide GrabHitch rides, where to go, how payment is made and how much\npayment to collect, the Organisation has little control over the purposes and\n\n16\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nmanner in which a GrabHitch Driver processes personal data. Following from\nthe above, the Organisation asserts that pursuant to the EU General Data\nProtection Regulation, the drivers are “data controllers” who are able to\n“determine the purposes and means of the processing of personal data”.\n\n30\n\nThe Organisation appears to have mistakenly equated the GrabHitch\n\ndriver’s choice over whether to carpool with the control of purposes for, or the\nmanner in, which personal data is collected, used or disclosed. In this regard, I\nnote that the Grab App will automatically transmit the personal data (such as\nname and mobile number) of the GrabHitch passenger to the GrabHitch Driver.\nThis is how the Organisation programmed the Grab App to work – the\nGrabHitch drivers have no input into this collection and use of the personal data.\nIn fact, it is the Organisation that discloses the passengers’ personal data to the\nGrabHitch Drivers in the Organisation’s chosen manner and for the purposes\nthe Organisation deems acceptable.\n\n31\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation is in control of the personal data\n\nthat it collects, uses and discloses when passengers wish to use the\nOrganisation’s GrabHitch service. The “independence” of the GrabHitch driver\nas asserted by the Organisation is not the sole determinant as to whether he is\nan “organisation” under the PDPA. As I have concluded that the GrabHitch\ndriver is not an “organisation” under the PDPA, it is unnecessary to delve into\nissues around joint controllership which may arise in respect of drivers for other\nservices that the Organisation provides on its platform.\n\n32\n\nOne final point bears highlighting. The activities of the GrabHitch\n\ndriver are only made possible because of the Grab App. In providing the\nplatform for private individuals (both drivers and passengers) to engage in the\n\n17\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nsharing economy, the Organisation bears responsibility for the personal data\nthat it collects from passengers and uses to provide its services, and discloses to\nGrabHitch drivers.\n\n33\n\nIn the circumstances, and after considering the representations made by\n\nthe Organisation, I find that the Organisation is in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\nDirections to the Organisation\n\n34\n\nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, I am empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation\nsuch directions as I deem fit to ensure its compliance with the PDPA.\n\n35\n\nTaking into consideration the relevant facts in this matter, I hereby direct\n\nthe Organisation to:\n\n(a)\n\nreview and amend the Organisation’s policies and practices to\n\nprovide detailed guidance for GrabHitch drivers on the handling of the\npersonal data of their riders and to communicate to GrabHitch drivers\nall relevant policies and practices (including the amended policies and\npractices) within 120 days of this decision to protect the personal data\nin the possession or control of the Organisation from unauthorised\ndisclosure by GrabHitch drivers;\n\n(b)\n\nimplement any other reasonable security arrangements as\n\nnecessary to comply with section 24 of the PDPA; and\n\n18\n\n\fGrabcar Pte. Ltd.\n\n(c)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 14\n\nto inform the Commission within seven days of the compliance\n\nwith the above directions.\n\n36\n\nGiven that only two individuals were directly affected by the\n\nunauthorised disclosure of personal data and in consideration of the type of\npersonal data disclosed, I find that a financial penalty is not warranted in this\nmatter.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n19\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Skinny’s Lounge for failing to ensure that consent was obtained from its patrons to re-play recorded CCTV footage on a screen in its public lounge.

The\n\ncentral issue in this case is whether the Organisation had valid consent from its patrons to\ndisclose their images recorded on closed-circuit camera footage (“CCTV Footage”). The\ndisclosure was on a screen in a publicly accessible area of its premises.\n2\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, I found the Organisation in breach of section\n\n13(a) read with section 18 and with section 20(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act\n(“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Organisation had one KTV Room on its premise. The KTV Room had a sign beside\n\nthe TV screen which read “Smile you are being recorded”. Patrons using the KTV Room were\nthen recorded on CCTV Footage streamed “live” onto a screen in the Organisation’s public\nlounge (“Public Screen”) for general viewing.\n4\n\nOn or before 19 June 2018, the Complainant and her friends used the KTV Room and\n\ntheir images were live-streamed onto the Public Screen. After the Complainant and her friends\nleft, the CCTV in the KTV Room malfunctioned. With the live streaming disrupted, the\nOrganisation played on the Public Screen randomly selected recorded CCTV Footage. This\nincluded CCTV Footage of the Complainant and her friends which was replayed on the Public\nScreen for “a day or two”. After the Complainant found out about the replaying of the CCTV\nFootage, she lodged a complaint with the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) on\n19 June 2018.\n\n2\n\n\fSkinny’s Lounge\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 13\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n5\n\nThe provisions relevant to this case are as follows:\n(a)\n\nSection 13(a) of the PDPA states that organisations are prohibited from\n\ncollecting, using or disclosing an individual’s personal data unless the individual gives,\nor is deemed to have given, his consent for the collection, use or disclosure of his\npersonal data (the “Consent Obligation”).\n(b)\n\nSection 18 of the PDPA states that an organisation may collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data about an individual only for purposes (a) that a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances; and (b) that the individual has been informed\nof under section 20, if applicable (the “Purpose Limitation Obligation”).\n(c)\n\nSection 20(1) of the PDPA states that an organisation is required to notify\n\nindividuals of the purpose(s) for which it intends to collect, use or disclose an\nindividual’s personal data on or before such collection, use or disclosure of the personal\ndata (the “Notification Obligation”).\nPersonal Data\n6\n\nThe images of the Complainant and her friends on the CCTV Footage were their\n\npersonal data as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA. This was regardless of whether the images\nwere streamed live or replayed. The personal data was in the Organisation’s possession and/ or\nunder its control.\nThe Organisation failed to obtain valid consent to re-play the CCTV Footage with the\npersonal data of the Complainant and her friends on the Public Screen\n7\n\nUpon review of the collected evidence, patrons were given notice that their images\n\nwould be recorded and streamed live onto the Public Screen. First, they would have walked\npast the Public Screen before entering the KTV Room. In this regard, they would have noticed\n\n3\n\n\fSkinny’s Lounge\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 13\n\nthat the Public Screen showing images of the KTV Room. Second, the sign beside the TV\nscreen mentioned also notified the customers that they were being recorded.\n8\n\nHowever, there was no notice to the Complainant and her friends that their images could\n\nbe randomly selected and re-played on the Public Screen when they were no longer in the\nOrganisation’s premises. The Organisation gave no notice to its patrons of the purpose(s) for\nwhich their recorded images would have been used. The only purpose evident from the\ncircumstances was the live streaming visible to the patrons on the Public Screen. There was\nno evidence that a re-play of CCTV Footage on the Public Screen was regular. Neither could\nit be said that re-playing images of patrons in the KTV Room was an obvious response to\nCCTV malfunction, such that a reasonable person would have considered it natural and\ntherefore appropriate. Music videos, for example, could have been screened.\n9\n\nGiven the foregoing, as the Organisation had not notified the Complainant of the\n\npurposes for which the CCTV Footage would be reused, it follows that it had not obtained\nconsent for the use and disclosure of the Complainant’s personal data under section 13 read\nwith sections 14(1) and 20(1) of the PDPA. On the facts, none of the other provisions in the\nPDPA would apply to allow the Organisation to re-play the CCTV Footage on the Public\nScreen. In addition, the failure to notify the Complainant meant that the Organisation was not\npermitted to use and disclose the CCTV Footage in the manner which it did under section 18\nof the PDPA. I therefore find that the Organisation had contravened sections 13 and 18 of the\nPDPA.\nRemedial Action\n10\n\nThe Organisation did take remedial action. It ceased screening of CCTV Footage on\n\nthe Public Screen. It improved its notification by informing patrons that CCTV recording is\nongoing in its premise for security purposes.\nConclusion\n11\n\nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach as above, I am empowered under section\n\n29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation such directions as deemed fit to ensure compliance\nwith the PDPA.\n4\n\n\fSkinny’s Lounge\n12\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 13\n\nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on the Organisation, I have\n\ntaken into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThere was no evidence of any unauthorised use of the CCTV Footage of the\n\nComplainant and her friends other than the re-play mentioned.\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation did not receive any other complaints on this incident other\n\nthan from the Complainant.\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative in the course of investigation.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial action after being notified by the\n\nComplainant and PDPC.\n13\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I have decided to issue a warning\n\nto the Organisation for breaching its obligations under section 13(a) read with section 18 and\nwith section 20(1) of the PDPA, as neither further directions nor a financial penalty is warranted\nin this case.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Telcos were not found in breach of the PDPA for charging subscribers for the provision of Caller Number Non-Display value added services.","tags":["Consent","Not in Breach","Information and Communications","Singtel","Starhub","M1"],"date":"2019-06-06","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---3-Telcos---06062019.pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"No Breach of the Withdrawal of Consent Obligation by Telcos","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/no-breach-of-the-withdrawal-of-consent-obligation-by-telcos","timestamp":"2019-06-06","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\nCase No DP-1609-B0229\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\n1.

Ltd.\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1609-B0229\n\n6 June 2019.\nBackground\n1\n\nThe present matter arose from a complaint made by an individual mobile\n\nsubscriber (“Complainant”), in relation to the current industry practice of\nmobile network operators charging for the provision of Caller Number NonDisplay (“CNND”) services. The CNND service is offered on a per-line basis\naffecting all out-going calls made using a particular telephone number. When\nactivated by a subscriber, the CNND service essentially prevents the\nsubscriber’s telephone number from being displayed on call recipients’ devices.\n2\n\nThe Organisations are the three mobile network operators in Singapore.\n\nThey offer a range of telecommunication services to subscribers, in particular,\nmobile telephony services. They also offer CNND as an optional value-added\nservice to their subscribers. All the Organisations share a common practice of\ncharging subscribers for the provision of CNND services, although the precise\ncharges differ from Organisation to Organisation.\n3\n\nThe key question which has to be determined in this case is whether\n\nsection 16 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) prohibits\norganisations from imposing charges for the provision of CNND services. The\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nfindings and grounds of decision based on the Commission’s investigation are\nset out below.\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nThe Complainant is an individual subscriber of StarHub Mobile Pte Ltd\n\n(“StarHub”)’s mobile services. He had written to StarHub to request the\nwithdrawal of his consent to the disclosure of his telephone number to parties\nreceiving his calls.\n5\n\nIn response, the Complainant was informed by StarHub that, if he\n\nwished to prevent his telephone number from being displayed to call recipients,\nhe would need to activate StarHub’s CNND value-added service. He was also\ninformed that a one-time activation charge and monthly recurring charges were\napplicable.\n6\n\nThe Complainant was not agreeable to pay the charges for activating the\n\nCNND value-added service. He expressed the view that, as he was exercising\nhis right under the PDPA to withdraw consent to the disclosure of his personal\ndata, he should not be required to pay any charges for the CNND value-added\nservice in order to prevent his telephone number from being displayed to call\nrecipients.\n7\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Complainant raised this matter to the\n\nCommission. As the practice of charging for CNND services is common to all\nthe Organisations, the Commission commenced an investigation into the\npractices pertaining to the CNND services of all three Organisations.\nConveyance/withholding of calling party’s telephone number from recipient\n\n2\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n8\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nIn the course of its investigation, the Commission obtained a range of\n\ninformation from the Organisations pertaining to the manner in which a calling\nparty’s telephone number is conveyed to a call recipient during a telephone call,\nas well as details pertaining to the implementation of the CNND value-added\nservice. Investigations disclosed the following:\n(a)\nAll mobile and fixed line operators in Singapore are\ninterconnected using international telephony signaling protocols, e.g.,\nsignaling system no. 7 and session initiation protocol. Under the\narrangements for interconnection adopted by the Organisations, a\ncaller’s telephone number will be passed on by the caller’s network\noperator to the receiving network operator as part of the conveyance of\na telephone call.\n(b)\nThe transmission of the calling party’s telephone number by the\ncalling party’s operator to the recipient’s operator takes place regardless\nof whether the calling party has activated CNND services. The calling\nparty’s network does not remove the calling party’s telephone number\nfrom being transmitted. The difference in handling the caller’s number\nlies in indicators as to whether the phone number should be displayed or\nhidden from the recipient.\n(c)\nIf the call recipient has activated caller ID (also known as caller\nline identity or “CLI”) services, the recipient operator’s network will\nforward the calling party’s telephone number to the recipient’s device.\nOtherwise, the calling party’s telephone number will not be forwarded\nto the recipient’s device, and the recipient’s device would not display\nthe incoming caller’s telephone number. Currently, the vast majority of\nSingapore mobile subscribers have enabled CLI services.\n(d)\nThe flow of the caller’s telephone number from the caller to the\ncaller ID display at the call recipient’s device when the call recipient has\nactivated the CLI services for his telephone line takes place in the\nfollowing manner:\n\n3\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\n(i)\n\nWhen the caller dials the call recipient’s telephone number\nusing his phone, the call will be routed from the caller’s\noriginating local exchange to the recipient’s local\nexchange, which could be in the same or different\ntelecommunication company’s network, based on the preplanned call routing arrangement. The originating local\nexchange will be able to determine which telephone\ncommunications company the call recipient has subscribed\nto and will try to establish a call with the designated\nrecipient’s local exchange through the adopted signalling\nprotocols.\n\n(ii)\n\nIf the call recipient’s telephone is connected to the call\nrecipient’s telephone network, after the call is routed\nsuccessfully, an acknowledgement awaits the call recipient\nto pick up the call, which is typically translated to the\nringing of the telephone. At this stage, the caller’s\ntelephone number is reflected on the call recipient’s\ntelephone as caller ID display. The call is considered\nestablished after the call recipient picks up/accepts the call.\n\n(iii) Where the caller has activated CNND for his telephone line\nor where the call recipient has not activated CLI for his\ntelephone line, the caller’s ID will not be shared with the\ncall recipient.\n(e)\nThe CNND services offered by the Organisations allow callers’\ntelephone numbers to be hidden from call recipients even if these call\nrecipients have subscribed to caller ID services. The Organisations’\nCNND services are based on recommendations promulgated by the\nTelecommunication Standardisation Sector of the International\nTelecommunication Union (“ITU-T”). In addition to per-line CNND, it\nis also possible to offer CNND on a per-call basis although the\nOrganisations have not made CNND available on a per-call basis. Each\nof the Organisations imposes its own set of charges on its subscribers\nfor the CNND service. Typically, the charges consist of a combination\nof a one-time activation charge and monthly recurring charges.\n(f)\nIf a calling party has subscribed for CNND services, when a\ntelephone call is initiated, the calling party’s network operator would\n\n4\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\ntransmit a CNND indicator, together with the calling party’s telephone\nnumber, through the originating telephone network to the recipient’s\nnetwork operator. The function of the CNND indicator is to mark the\ncaller’s telephone number as “Presentation Restricted”, which would\nnotify the recipient’s network operator not to forward the calling party’s\ntelephone number to the recipient’s device.\n(g)\nIn order for the calling party’s telephone number to be withheld\nfrom the recipient, the recipient network operator’s cooperation is\nneeded to honour the CNND indicator, by recognising the indicator and\nwithholding the calling party’s telephone number from the recipient’s\ndevice.\n(h)\nAs such, the successful withholding of the calling party’s\ntelephone number from the call recipient is ultimately dependent on\ncooperation between the caller’s network operator and the recipient\nnetwork operator. In this regard, the Commission understands that the\nOrganisations have adopted common standards for CNND services, and\nas between themselves will typically honour one another’s CNND\nindicators.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nThe key issue to be determined in this case is whether the Organisations\n\nhave contravened section 16 of the PDPA by requiring individual subscribers to\npay charges for the CNND value-added service, in order to withhold their\ntelephone number from being disclosed to call recipients.\n\n10\n\nIn addressing the aforementioned key issue, it is pertinent to briefly\n\naddress a couple of preliminary issues that were raised in the course of the\nCommission’s investigation into this matter, namely:\n(a)\n\nwhether telephone numbers constitute personal data; and\n\n5\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nwhether express consent is required for the disclosure of\n\ntelephone numbers to call recipients.\nWhether telephone numbers constitute personal data\n11\n\nIn some of their representations to the Commission, the Organisations\n\nsuggested that mobile telephone numbers do not constitute personal data for the\npurposes of the PDPA. In this regard, the Organisations asserted that a call\nrecipient would not be able to identify a calling party simply by looking at the\ntelephone number displayed.\n12\n\nI do not think that that such an assertion accords with the definition of\n\n“personal data” under the PDPA. Section 2 of the PDPA defines “personal\ndata” to mean:\n“data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be\nidentified –\n(a)\n\nfrom that data; or\n\n(b)\n\nfrom that data and other information to which the\norganisation has or is likely to have access”.\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n13\n\nIn relation to whether telephone numbers constitute personal data, the\n\nCommission has stated in the Advisory Guidelines for the Telecommunication\nSector that:\n“Telephone numbers and International Mobile Equipment\nIdentity (“IMEI”) numbers\n\n6\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\n2.3 Where an individual is identifiable from the data, such as a\ncombination of the individual’s name, address and telephone\nnumber, then such data is personal data. In cases where the\nindividual cannot be identified from that data alone (such as a\ndevice identifier in itself), such data may still be personal data if\nthe organisation has or is likely to have access to other\ninformation that will allow the individual to be identified when\ntaken together with that data…\n2.4 In the telecommunication context, an individual’s mobile\ntelephone number is likely to be personal data as it may uniquely\nidentify, or be uniquely associated with, that individual…”1\n[Emphasis added.]\n14\n\nAdditionally, the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts\n\nin the Personal Data Protection Act also identifies personal mobile telephone\nnumbers as a unique identifier, and hence personal data on its own:\n“Certain types of data can on its own, identify an individual, for\ninstance biometric identifiers which are inherently distinctive to an\nindividual, such as the face geometry or fingerprint of an individual.\nSimilarly, data that has been assigned to an individual for the purposes\nof identifying the individual (e.g. NRIC or passport number of an\nindividual) would be able to identify the individual from that data\nalone.\nSuch data which, on its own, constitutes personal data, is referred to as\n“unique identifier” in these guidelines. Data that the Commission\ngenerally considers unique identifiers include:\n…\nPersonal mobile telephone number\n\n1\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines for the Telecommunication Sector at [2.3] – [2.4].\n\n7\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\n…”\n15\n\nMobile use in Singapore has grown in leaps and bounds. Just in terms of\n\nfigures alone, there were altogether 8,381,900 mobile subscriptions in\nSingapore as of March 2018, and a mobile population penetration rate of\n149.3%.2 It was also reported that 7 in 10 Singaporeans use social media on\nmobile, which, according to the survey, is double of the global average.3 Given\nthe multitudinous uses of mobile in today, mobile numbers have increasingly\nbeen used as a form of identification or verification of individuals, including for\nonline transactions, mobile payments, and social networking. This works on the\ngeneral premise that an issued mobile number is unique, and no two same\nmobile numbers should be in operation at the same time. Hence, a mobile\nnumber acts as a unique address for which individuals may be contacted or\nreceive messages or information on their mobile phones. In this regard, mobile\nnumbers double up as a unique identifier of the individual.\n\n16\n\nThis role of a personal mobile telephone number as a unique identifier\n\nis further strengthened by the mobile telephone number portability policy such\nthat an individual is able to retain and keep his mobile telephone number when\nhe switches to another service provider. This is one of the reasons that caller ID\nis popular with mobile phone subscribers – a subscriber is able to identify the\n\n2\n\nhttps://www.imda.gov.sg/industry-development-facts-andfigures/telecommunications/statistics-on-telecom-services/statistic-on-telecomservice-for-2018-jan\n\n3\n\nhttp://www.businesstimes.com.sg/consumer/7-in-10-singaporeans-use-social-media-onmobile-double-global-average-survey\n\n8\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\ncaller through the caller’s telephone number if the subscriber had programmed\nthe caller’s telephone number in his telephone directory.\n17\n\nAlso, when one of the Organisations uses a subscriber’s personal mobile\n\ntelephone number, for example to establish a telephone call or for logging call\ndata for billing purposes, that Organisation is using that personal mobile\ntelephone number as a unique identifier of the individual subscriber.\n18\n\nThere is, however, a distinction between land lines and mobile telephone\n\nnumbers. The foregoing discussion is concerned with mobile telephone\nnumbers. A land line terminates at premises that are, more likely than not,\nshared: e.g. residence of a family or place of business of an organisation. It is\nthe recognition of this key distinction that the aforementioned advisory\nguidelines limit its policy guidance to treating mobile telephone numbers\npersonal data without adopting a similar approach for land lines. Consumers and\norganisations also do not treat land lines as personal.\n19\n\nFrom the perspective of the call originating network, the Organisation\n\ntransmitting its subscriber’s mobile telephone number will be transmitting\npersonal data since it has full subscriber details. From the perspective of the\nrecipient of the call, the reality today is that a significant number of calls will\nbe matched with an address book entry in the recipient’s mobile phone and will\nthus identify the caller, or the recipient may recognise the number. Hence, I am\nsatisfied that the guidance set out in the Advisory Guidelines referred to above\nwould be applicable in the context of the present case, and that it would be\nentirely relevant and reasonable to proceed with the analysis in this case on the\nbasis that subscribers’ mobile telephone numbers constitutes personal data.\n\n9\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nDeemed consent for disclosure of subscriber identity to telephone call\nrecipients\n20\n\nThe Advisory Guidelines for the Telecommunication Sector sets out the\n\nfollowing guidance in relation to consent and the withdrawal of consent for the\ndisclosure of a subscriber’s telephone number to receiving parties:4\n“Provision of subscriber identity for calls or text messages\n3.8 Currently, when a subscriber who is an individual makes a\ntelephone call or sends a text message, his telephone number\n(which may be personal data relating to him) would typically be\ndisclosed to the receiving party and both the subscriber and\nreceiving party’s telecommunication operators, unless the\nsubscriber had chosen to have his telephone number ‘blocked’/\n‘unlisted’. Telecommunication operators may wish to obtain the\nconsent of the individuals for the purpose of such disclosures to\nrecipients of his calls and messages.\n3.9 Even if the telecommunication operators do not obtain such\nactual consent, given established practice, the Commission is of\nthe view that a subscriber who opts to have an ‘unblocked’/ a\n‘listed’ telephone number would typically be aware that the\ntelephone number would be collected, used or disclosed for the\npurpose of identifying that subscriber to other parties. Where the\ntelephone number is personal data relating to a subscriber, a\nsubscriber with an ‘unblocked’/ a ‘listed’ telephone number\ninitiating a call or sending a message may be deemed to have\nconsented to the collection, use or disclosure of the number for\nthe purpose of identifying himself to the receiving party, since\nthe subscriber would have voluntarily provided the data, and it\nwould be reasonable for the subscriber to have done so.\n\n4\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines for the Telecommunication Sector at [3.8] – [3.11].\n\n10\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\n3.10 Conversely, a subscriber who has opted for a ‘blocked’/ an\n‘unlisted’ number at the outset would not be considered to have\nconsented to the collection, use or disclosure of the number for\nthat purpose. A subscriber with an ‘unblocked’/ a ‘listed’\ntelephone number who subsequently applies to ‘block’/ ‘unlist’\nthat telephone number would be considered to have withdrawn\nconsent for the collection, use or disclosure of that telephone\nnumber for the purpose of identifying himself to other parties\nwhen making a call or sending a message.\n3.11 Where an individual subscriber is deemed to have given\nconsent for disclosure of his telephone number by one\ntelecommunication operator to another telecommunication\noperator for the purpose of identifying himself to the recipient of\nhis call or message, consent may be deemed to have been given\nto the collection, use or disclosure of the telephone number by\nthat other telecommunication operator for the same purpose.\nAlternatively, consent may not be required if the purpose for\ncollection, use or disclosure of the personal data falls within an\nexception, such as when it is required or authorised under\nwritten law.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n21\n\nI understand that currently the Organisations obtain express consent\n\nfrom subscribers for the collection, use and disclosure of their telephone\nnumbers for the purpose of identifying them to receiving parties. This is a good\npractice although, as the Advisory Guidelines for the Telecommunication\nSector establish, not strictly necessary. A subscriber who has opted for an\n‘unblocked’ or ‘listed’ telephone number may be deemed to have consented to\nthe collection, use or disclosure of his telephone number for the purpose of\n\n11\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nidentifying himself to recipients of his calls.5 It naturally follows that, the\nOrganisations would be able to rely on deemed consent to collect, use or\ndisclose the subscriber’s telephone number for the purpose of identifying the\nsubscriber to call recipients.\nWhether the Organisations have contravened section 16 of the PDPA\n22\n\nTurning to the key issue raised in this case, section 16 of the PDPA\n\nprovides that individuals may at any time withdraw any consent given or\ndeemed to be given under the PDPA in respect of the collection, use or\ndisclosure of their personal data for any purpose.\n23\n\nSection 16(3) of the PDPA is particularly relevant, and states that an\n\norganisation:\n“shall not prohibit an individual from withdrawing his consent\nto the collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the\nindividual, but this section shall not affect any legal\nconsequences arising from such withdrawal”.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n24\n\nSection 16(3) of the PDPA may be seen as comprising two limbs,\n\nnamely that:\n(a)\n\nan organisation shall not prohibit individuals from withdrawing\n\nconsent; and\n\n5\n\nSection 15(1) of the PDPA; and PDPC, Advisory Guidelines for the\nTelecommunication Sector at [3.9].\n\n12\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n(b)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nany legal consequences arising from such withdrawal shall not\n\nbe affected.\n25\n\nIt is necessary to construe both limbs of section 16(3) of the PDPA\n\nholistically. While section 16(3) of the PDPA is clearly intended to ensure that\nindividuals are not prohibited from exercising their right to withdraw consent,\nit also expressly preserves any legal consequences arising from such\nwithdrawal.\n26\n\nIt is also pertinent to refer to section 11(1) of the PDPA, which imposes\n\na general standard of reasonableness on organisations in meeting their\nresponsibilities under the PDPA. Section 11(1) of the PDPA states:\n“In meeting its responsibilities under this Act, an organisation\nshall consider what a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate in the circumstances.”\n27\n\nAt this juncture, it should be highlighted that the provision of CLI\n\nservices serves important societal purposes, including helping to reduce calls\nmade to harass or scam individuals and to speed up law enforcement\ninvestigations where a caller’s telephone number is required for the purposes of\ncriminal investigations. Additionally, given that most mobile telephone\nsubscribers have CLI and that Over-The-Top telephone services such as calls\nmade through smartphone applications do not provide the ability to the caller to\nmask his telephone number, the provision of CLI services has become a baseline\nexpectation of all users of modern mobile telephone networks: call recipients\nexpect to know the identity of the caller. Consumers’ expectations to be able to\nidentify an incoming caller as a basic functionality is also clearly embedded into\nthe design and manufacture of mobile phones as mobile phone manufacturers\nuniversally incorporate the ability to display caller ID as a basic and essential\n\n13\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nfeature of modern mobile phones. This functionality is integrated with the\ncontact list functionality such that display caller ID is matched with contact\ndetails whenever a call is received, and the caller’s name is displayed by the\nmobile phone when the call is connected. This modern convenience enables the\nsubscriber to decide whether to answer the call from an identified contact; and\nsome subscribers prefer not to take calls when the display caller ID does not\nmatch a known contact.\n28\n\nUnder the signaling standards adopted by fixed and mobile network\n\noperators in Singapore, a caller’s telephone number will be transmitted by the\ncalling party’s network to the receiving party’s network by default as part of the\nconveyance of a telephone call.\n29\n\nIn order for calling parties to withhold their telephone numbers from\n\nbeing displayed to call recipients (the vast majority of whom currently have\ncaller ID enabled), action has to be taken on the part of the Organisations, in\nterms of transmitting and giving effect to the relevant “Presentation Restricted”\nindicator.\n30\n\nAgainst this backdrop, I understand from the Organisations’\n\nrepresentations that, for CNND services to be implemented and offered as an\noption to subscribers, the Organisations have had to invest in relatively complex\nIT systems which are, amongst other things, able to automatically and in real\ntime instruct the mobile network to either implement or deactivate the CNND\ndepending on whether the caller is a CNND subscriber and which would be able\nto manage the customer sign-up for CNND and the database of CNND\ncustomers. Regular and continuous tests and updates to the IT systems are also\nrequired to ensure that CNND continues to work accurately when there is an\nupdate to interconnected systems, whenever new handsets are introduced into\n\n14\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nthe Singapore market by the Organisations, when new roaming partners are onboarded by the Organisations and when new technologies and platforms (such\nas VoLTE and VoWiFi) are deployed.\n31\n\nPerhaps in a nod to the infrastructure investment and operational costs\n\nrequired in order to provide consumer choice in both CLI and CNND services,\nthe International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”) provides charging\nprinciples for supplementary services such as for the charging of both CLI and\nCNND services, but has left it to individual member country to formulate its\nown policy decision with respect to charging for such services. The ITU is an\nagency of the United Nations specializing in information and communication\ntechnologies and, amongst other things, allocates global radio spectrum and\nsatellite orbits. In its ITU-T Rec D.232, ITU provides for charging principles\nfor supplementary service as follows:\n“2.1 Number Identification\nThis subclause provides charging principles for the supplementary\nservices, Calling Line Identification Presentation (CLIP), Calling line\nIdentification Restriction (CLIR), Connected Line Identification\nPresentation (COLP), Connected Line Identification Restriction\n(COLR) and Malicious Call Identification (MCID). Detailed description\nof the services are provided in Recommendations 1.251.3 (CLIP),\n1.251.4 (CLIR), 1.251.5 (COLP), 1.251.6 (COLR and 1.251.7 (MCID).\n2.1.1 Charging principles\nInnovation of the display or restriction service may be charged for by:\na) Inclusion in the rental charges raised against customers; or\nb) The setting of a separate subscription charge;\nc) A per event charge; or\nd) Combinations of a) to c).”\n\n15\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n32\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nGiven established practice as discussed above and the inherent nature of\n\na telephone call, whereby a calling party’s telephone number is by default\ntransmitted to the recipient network operator and typically forwarded to the call\nrecipient’s device, it would not be unreasonable for the network operator to\ncharge a reasonable fee for the costs it incurs to provide the CNND and restrict\nthe number from being disclosed to the call recipient. Also, given the\ncompetitive marketplace in the provision of telecommunications services in\nSingapore, market forces can be expected to determine the range of service\ncharges that any of the Organisations will be able to impose for the CNND\nservice. The relevant charges for the Organisations’ CNND services are publicly\naccessible and can be obtained by subscribers relatively easily, and that any\ncharges payable by individual subscribers to the Organisations for CNND\nservices would have a legal basis stemming from the contract between\nsubscribers and the Organisations.\n33\n\nIn summary, users of modern mobile telecommunications services\n\nexpect to be able to identify a caller and mobile telephone handset\nmanufacturers have incorporated CLI as a basic and essential feature. CLI now\nplays a societal role, enabling consumers to order their private lives and exercise\nchoice in how they wish to be contacted or to decline taking calls. In order to\nprovide consumers with this choice, significant ongoing investment have to be\nmade by the Organisations to maintain CNND services for its subscribers. The\nITU also recognises that there may be a need to charge for both CLI and CNND\nservices. In our domestic market, the price of these services are contained by\ncompetitive market forces. With the provision of CNND services as a value\nadded service, consumers have access to a paid service to restrict the sharing of\ntheir personal mobile phone numbers.\n\n16\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n34\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\nGiven the consumer expectations and reliance on CLI and how CLI is\n\nfundamentally embedded into the design and operation of mobile telephone\nsystems and handsets, and the additional infrastructure investments and\noperational costs required to provide consumer choice for CLI and CNND, it is\nnot unreasonable that the Organisations impose a reasonable charge for these\nservices. I have no doubt that a reasonable person would consider it appropriate\nfor the Organisations to charge a caller to prevent his telephone number from\nbeing displayed to the call recipient, failing which the Organisation may inform\nthe subscriber that the Organisations are unable to provide the caller with\ntelecommunications services if he wishes to withdraw such consent. An\nexample which illustrates the application of this can be found in the Advisory\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA, which states:6\n“An individual wishes to obtain certain services from a telecom\nservice provider, Operator X and is required by the telecom\nservice provider to agree to its terms and conditions for\nprovision of the services. Operator X can stipulate as a condition\nof providing the services that the individual agrees to the\ncollection, use and disclosure of specified types of personal data\nby the organisation for the purpose of supplying the subscribed\nservices. Such types of personal data may include the name and\naddress of the individual as well as personal data collected in\nthe course of providing the services such as the individual’s\nlocation data. The individual provides consent for those\nspecified types of personal data but subsequently withdraws that\nconsent.\nThe withdrawal of consent results in Operator X being unable to\nprovide services to the individual. This would in turn entail an\nearly termination of the service contract. Operator X should\n\n6\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA at [12.45].\n\n17\n\n\fStarhub Mobile Pte Ltd and others\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 12\n\ninform the individual of the consequences of the early\ntermination, e.g. that the individual would incur early\ntermination charges.”\n35\n\nI am therefore of the view that the provision of CNND is less a means\n\nto withdraw consent for the disclosure of the caller’s personal mobile telephone\nnumber to the call recipient but rather a separate service to allow a caller to\nmaintain anonymity. Accordingly, where an individual subscriber requests his\ntelecommunications service provider to mask his telephone number when he\ncalls another phone number, the Organisations are in compliance with section\n16 if they inform the subscriber that he may do so by subscribing and paying\nfor CNND services failing which the Organisation is unable to provide the\ntelecommunications service to the subscriber. By doing so, the Organisations\nwould have informed the subscriber of the legal consequences arising from such\nwithdrawal pursuant to section 16(2) of the PDPA.\n36\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant circumstances of the present\n\ncase, and for the reasons set out above, I find that the Organisations have not\nbreached section 16 of the PDPA in respect of the charges imposed on\nsubscribers for providing CNND value-added services, and that take no further\naction is required in this matter.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n18\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $30,000 was imposed on Ncode Consultant for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access and modification to an IT system provided to a school.

The\nstudents were able to obtain the login credentials of teachers by exploiting a\nSQL vulnerability found in NTRIX (the “Incident”). Ncode Consultant Pte Ltd\n(“Ncode”) supplied NTRIX to various schools, including Victoria School.\nVictoria School is a school organised and conducted directly by the Ministry of\nEducation (“MOE”).\n2\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the Government Technology Agency of\n\nSingapore on behalf of MOE reported to the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) that the NTRIX system for Victoria School\nsuffered a total of 84 unauthorised logins (the “Unauthorised Logins”)\nbetween 3 August to 17 October 2017.\n3\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found\n\nNcode in breach of section 24 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nNcode is a school administrative system developer, and has been\n\nworking with schools since 1994. NTRIX is a web application/portal managed\nby Ncode. There were 3 levels of users (i) student/parent; (ii) teaching/nonteaching employees; and (iii) administrator. By logging in with their respective\npasswords, teachers could enter examination scores and comments. Students\nand parents could also login to view results.\n5\n\nAt the time of the Incident and Unauthorised Logins, there were 2792\n\nrecords of students’ personal data stored as part of Victoria School’s instance of\nNTRIX. In each record, the students’ personal data may include all or some of\nthe following information: student name, admission number, residential\naddress, mobile number, parents’ names and contact details, subject proficiency\nrating at primary 6, current examination scores at Victoria School and\nexamination summary ratings (collectively, “Personal Data”).\n6\n\nThe Incident and the Unauthorised Logins exposed the Personal Data to\n\nrisk of unauthorised access, use and modification. In addition, the unauthorised\nusers could view confidential data of the students (e.g. examination results\nbefore it is published). There were also 11 instances of modification of\nexamination results for 10 students. The investigations revealed no evidence of\nmass data exfiltration. The unauthorised modifications to the examination\nresults were rectified by Victoria School, and there was no impact on the\nstudents’ grades.\n7\n\nNcode took the following remedial actions after discovery of the\n\nunauthorised access on 11 October 2017:\n\n2\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\n12 to 13 October 2017: Two factor authorisation (2FA) was\n\nintroduced for Victoria School’s employee logins to NTRIX;\n(b)\n\n14 to 17 October 2017: Ncode identified and fixed the SQL\n\ninjection1 vulnerability that led to the Unauthorised Logins;\n(c)\n\n21 October 2017: Ncode fixed all high risk items found using\n\nOWASP ZAP2 active scan;\n(d)\n\nFebruary 2018: Ncode informed all of its developers of the\n\nproper use of the security scanning tools VCG3 and OWASP ZAP.\nNcode also installed automatic security scans and committed to conduct\npenetration testing as scheduled.

There is no question or dispute that Ncode falls within\nPDPA’s definition of “organisation”. In the course of investigations, it was\n\n1\n\nSQL injection is a code injection technique, used to attack data-driven applications, in\nwhich nefarious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to\ndump the database contents to the attacker).\n\n2\n\nOWASP ZAP (short for Zed Attack Proxy) is an open-source web application security\nscanner.\n\n3\n\nVCG (short for Visual Code Grepper) is an automated security review tool that handles\nC/C++, C#, Java, VB and PL/SQL.\n\n3\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\ndetermined that Ncode was at all material times an independent third party\nservice provider to, and therefore was not acting on behalf of, MOE. Neither did\nNcode raise the applicability of section 4(1)(c) at any time. In the circumstances,\nsection 4(1)(c)4 of the PDPA does not apply.\nWhether Ncode complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n9\n\nNcode was appointed to supply NTRIX to Victoria School as well as to\n\nset up, host and maintain NTRIX for Victoria School for the period 1 January\n2017 to 31 December 2017 pursuant to an Invitation to Quote (“ITQ”) and the\nannexed Quotation Conditions of Contract read together with Ncode’s ITQ\nSubmission dated 14 December 2016 (collectively referred to as the\n“Contract”). Pursuant to the Contract, Ncode assisted Victoria School to\nupload the relevant databases containing the Personal Data for use with NTRIX\nand was obliged to comply with MOE IT Security Specifications for Schoolmanaged Systems (“MOE IT Security Specs”).\n10\n\nIt is not disputed that Ncode’s scope of work in the Contract included\n\nprocessing Personal Data in NTRIX nor that it was in possession or control of\nthe Personal Data. The Commissioner therefore finds that Ncode was acting as\na data intermediary of Victoria School.\n\n4\n\nSection 4(1)(c) of the PDPA provides that “any public agency or an organisation in the\ncourse of acting on behalf of a public agency in relation to the collection, use or\ndisclosure of personal data is not subject to the obligations under Parts III to VI of the\nPDPA”\n\n4\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n11\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\nIn the circumstances, Ncode had an obligation to put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Personal Data which was in its possession\nand/or under its control.5\n12\n\nBased on the investigations, there were 2 causes of the Incident and the\n\nUnauthorised Logins:\n(a)\n\nThe exploitation, by one of the students, of the NITRIX’ SQL\n\ninjection vulnerability using a publicly available SQLMap tool to\ndiscover usernames and encoded passwords stored as part of NTRIX for\nemployee and administrator logins. The passwords were then decoded\nand shared with other unauthorised users. This allowed the unauthorised\nusers to gain access to the Personal Data and make changes.\n(b)\n\nThe passwords found in the NITRIX system were not encrypted\n\nor hashed but were merely encoded in Base 64. The passwords were\neasily decoded with a publicly available online decoder. Once this was\ndone, they were linked to the usernames of the account holders. The\ndecoded passwords could then be used to access the web application\nwith a legitimate existing user account.\n13\n\nSQL injection vulnerability was, at the material time, and still is, a\n\ncommon and well known information technology security threat used by\nhackers to access computer systems without authorisation. The SQLMap\ninjection program used in the Incident did not require sophisticated knowledge\nin order to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability found in NTRIX. Detecting\nand fixing such a basic form of SQL injection vulnerability did not require\n\n5\n\nSee Section 4(2) read together with section 24 of the PDPA\n\n5\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\nspecialist IT security skills but is within the expertise of the average software\ndeveloper.\n14\n\nFurther, paragraph 16.4(g) of the MOE IT Security Specs specifically\n\nhighlighted SQL injection vulnerability flaws and required such flaws to be\nrectified in the application system by Ncode before deployment. Regular\nsecurity vulnerability scanning was also required under paragraph 21.13 of the\nMOE IT Security Specs. Security scanners would have detected the SQL\ninjection vulnerability found in NTRIX if used with the correct settings and\nfeatures. However, Ncode failed to use the features available in security\nscanning tools like VCG and OWASP ZAP to actively detect common software\nvulnerabilities like the SQL injection vulnerability in this case.\n15\n\nAlso, encoding passwords using Base64 is not a reasonable security\n\narrangement to protect the Personal Data, as these may be easily reversed with\npublicly available online decoder as was done in this case. In the case of\nComGateway (S) Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 19, the Commissioner found that\nencoding a Shipment ID using Base64 is not an actual means of encryption.\nBase64 is a common and simple encoding scheme, easily decoded through\npublicly available decoding tools. ComGateway was found in breach of Section\n24 of the PDPA because the URL of the Shipping Webpage unique to each\ncustomer (by virtue of the Shipment ID encoded in Base 64) could be easily\nmanipulated and ComGateway did not put in place security measures to address\nthis vulnerability.\n16\n\nInvestigations showed that the 2 causes of the Incident as well as the\n\nUnauthorised Logins were due to the inexperience of Ncode’s engineers in IT\nsecurity. An engineer with reasonable IT security knowledge would have (i)\n\n6\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\ndetected and fixed the basic form SQL injection vulnerability; and (ii) applied\nadequate password protection measures for all passwords.\n17\n\nIn responses to Notices to Produce, Ncode admitted that its engineers\n\nwere unfamiliar with IT security and lacked basic understanding of the correct\nsettings/features of security scanners needed to detect SQL injection\nvulnerability. These engineers also did not understand the basic features of\nencoding, hashing and encrypting to protect passwords properly. In fact,\nparagraph 8.4 of the MOE IT Security Specs required Ncode to ensure its\ntechnical and security personnel are trained in IT security and are aware of the\nsecurity implications of the work performed. There is no excuse for Ncode’s\nfailure to train the relevant employees in IT security.\n18\n\nThe investigations also revealed that the NTRIX system had other\n\nvulnerabilities which were undetected. These included Broken Session\nManagement6 and Cross-site scripting7. While these vulnerabilities were not\nexploited in the Incident or in respect of the Unauthorised Logins, they exposed\nthe Personal Data stored in NTRIX to unauthorised access.\n19\n\nIn addition, the Incident not only resulted in unauthorised access, but\n\nalso unauthorised modification of students’ examination results. While there\nwas no harm suffered by the students as Victoria School managed to rectify the\nunauthorised modifications, this will not always be the case. The Commissioner\nwould like to emphasize that the failure to put in place reasonable security\n\n6\n\nA weakness that allows a hacker to either capture or bypass authentication methods\ndue to improper management of sessions\n\n7\n\nEnables a hacker to inject client side scripts allowing the hacker to bypass access\ncontrols\n\n7\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\narrangements to prevent unauthorised modification is a serious breach of an\norganisation’s obligation to protect personal data. Changes to examination\nresults could have had an impact on the academic performance of the students\naffected.8 In this regard, an attacker may stealthily make unauthorised\nmodifications which may be difficult to detect, and consequentially cause\nsignificant harm. Possible security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\nmodification include automatic notification when changes are made to static\nhistorical personal data or the need for a higher level of access rights to make\nany changes to such personal data, given the significance of examination results\nto students’ academic performance.\n20\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds Ncode in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n21\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that Ncode is in breach of section\n\n24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\nto issue Ncode such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA. This may include directing Ncode to pay a financial penalty of such\namount not exceeding S$1 million.\n22\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on Ncode in this case, the Commissioner took into account the\nfollowing aggravating factors:\n\n8\n\nSee “ASEAN Scholar at SMU jailed 16 weeks for hacking into professor’s computer\nand changing grades” (The Straits Times, 8 November 2017), where changes were\nmade by the accused person to give himself better grades.\n\n8\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\nNcode’s business includes processing of minors’ personal data.\n\nIt is therefore imperative that reasonable security arrangements ought to\nhave been in place to protect the personal data of minors; and\n(b)\n\nNcode should have easily detected and rectified the well-known\n\nSQL injection vulnerability that existed in its basic form.\n23\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nNcode cooperated fully with the investigations; and\n\n(b)\n\nThere was no evidence of mass exfiltration of personal data as a\n\nresult of the Incident or the Unauthorised Logins.\n24\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs Ncode to pay a financial penalty of S$30,000.00 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court9 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\nRepresentations made by the Organisation\n25\n\nThe Organisation in its letter to the Commission dated 19 December\n\n2018 stated that while they concurred with the facts and findings set out in this\nDecision, they had requested for a reduction of the financial penalty quantum.\n\n9\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n9\n\n\fNcode Consultant Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 11\n\nThey made this request on the basis that they had cooperated fully with\ninvestigations as well as took prompt action to remediate the breach.\n26\n\nThe Commissioner had already taken into consideration the above\n\npoints in coming to its decision on the financial penalty.\n27\n\nThe Organisation had also referred to the financial penalties imposed on\n\nother organisations. However, the facts in the decisions referred to by the\nOrganisation were not identical to the facts in this case.\n28\n\nIn particular, the Organisation cited 3 cases in which the organisations\n\nthat were in breach of their obligations under the PDPA were imposed a\nfinancial penalty that was less than that imposed on the Organisation. The cases\ncited by the Organisation was Re ComGateway (S) Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 19,\nRe WTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 26 and Re Propnex\nRealty Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 1. However, the major difference between these\n3 cited cases and the current matter is that this matter, unlike the cases cited by\nthe Organisation, included the personal data of minors. Organisations ought to\nprotect the personal data of minors to a higher standard and the unauthorised\naccess or disclosure of personal data of minors is an aggravating factor when\nthe quantum of financial penalty to be imposed is determined.\n29\n\nThe Commissioner is, therefore, of the view that the financial penalty\n\nimposed in this case is justified, in particular given the aggravating factors set\nout above at paragraph 22.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $4,000 was imposed on Option Gift for failure to conduct sufficient testing before deployment of a programme script which resulted in an unauthorised disclosure of up to 426 individuals’ personal data.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Others","Online Portal"],"date":"2019-06-06","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Option-Gift-Pte-Ltd---060619.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Option Gift","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-option-gift","timestamp":"2019-06-06","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\nCase No DP-1806-B2242, DP-1806-B2243 and DP-1806-B2244\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nOption Gift Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1806-B2242, DP-1806-B2243 and DP-1806B2244\n\n6 June 2019\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nOn 12 June 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) was\n\nnotified by the Organisation of the unintended disclosure of up to 426 individuals’ personal\ndata due to a coding error in its system. The Commission subsequently received complaints\nfrom 2 of the affected individuals on 12 and 13 June 2018 respectively.\n2\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found the Organisation\n\nin breach of section 24 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) and sets out below his\nfindings and grounds of decision based on the investigations carried out in this matter.\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nThe Portal\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation maintains Uniqrewards (the “Portal”), an online portal through\n\nwhich national servicemen (“NSmen”) may redeem credits and gifts given by the Ministry of\nDefence (“MINDEF”) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (“MHA”) in recognition of their\ngood performance during in-camp training or courses, or to celebrate certain events, such as\nthe birth of a child. An NSman may log into the Portal and submit his redemption request,\nfollowing which he would instantly receive a confirmation email that his order(s) are being\nprocessed (“Confirmation Emails”). Besides the NSman concerned, the customer service\nteam of the Organisation would also receive a copy of the Confirmation Email by way of blind\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\n\ncarbon copy.\n\n4\n\nThese Confirmation Emails are generally sent via a service account linked to the Portal.\n\nThe service account is hosted by an external vendor which has a password expiry policy of 180\ndays. While the employee concerned had previously reset the service account password before\nits expiry, he had failed to do so punctually in the latest round due to an oversight and a lack\nof reminders or warnings on password expiry. This led to 427 NSmen not receiving any\nConfirmation Emails for their redemption requests submitted between 22 May 2018 and 24\nMay 2018. This issue was detected by the Organisation on 23 May 2018.\n\nThe Incident\n\n5\n\nTo rectify the issue, the Organisation wrote a separate programme script to regenerate\n\nand send out the Confirmation Emails which the Portal had previously failed to send out due\nto the service account’s password expiration. The programme script was intended to achieve\nthe following objectives:\n\n(a)\n\naccurately reflect the redemption request submitted by the NSman concerned\nand some of his basic details (i.e., his login identification, email address,\ndelivery address and mobile number) on each regenerated Confirmation Email;\nand\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\nsend the Confirmation Email only to its intended recipient.\n\nThe format of these Confirmation Emails were identical. To achieve objective (a), the\n\nprogramme script was meant to generate each of the 427 Confirmation Emails by extracting\nthe relevant details of the intended recipient from the Organisation’s backend database and\nincluding these details as part of the content of the email. To achieve objective (b), the\nprogramme script was meant to address the Confirmation Email only to the intended recipient’s\nemail address. This process performed by the programme script was iterative, and all 427\nConfirmation Emails were to be generated in the same manner.\n\n7\n\nThe programme script, however, did not behave as envisioned. While the content of\n3\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\n\neach of these Confirmation Emails was correctly generated by the programme script, the\nprogramme script left the email address(es) of the recipient(s) of the preceding Confirmation\nEmails in the “To:” field of the email each time a new Confirmation Email was generated (the\n“Error”). It merely added on the intended recipient’s email address, instead of replacing the\nprevious recipient’s email address with the intended recipient’s.\n8\n\nIn practice, this resulted in the first recipient of the Confirmation Email receiving the\n\nConfirmation Email that was intended for him as well as the Confirmation Emails of all the\nother 426 recipients. The second recipient received the Confirmation Email which was intended\nfor him as well as the Confirmation Emails of the subsequent 425 recipients; the second\nrecipient would not have received the Confirmation Email of the first recipient as the second\nrecipient’s email address would not have been included in the Confirmation Email generated\nfor the first recipient. Likewise, the third recipient received the Confirmation Email generated\nfor him as well as the Confirmation Emails generated for the subsequent 424 recipients; the\nthird recipient would not have received the Confirmation Emails generated for the first and\nsecond recipients as the third recipient’s email address would not have been included in the\nConfirmation Emails generated for the first and second recipients. This pattern of addressing\nthe Confirmation Emails continued until the last recipient, who received only the Confirmation\nEmail intended for him.\n9\n\nThis Error resulted in the personal data of up to 426 NSmen being accidentally\n\ndisclosed (the “Incident”). These personal data comprised the relevant NSman’s:\n\n10\n\n(a)\n\nlogin identification for the Portal;\n\n(b)\n\nemail address;\n\n(c)\n\ndelivery address; and\n\n(d)\n\nmobile number.\n\nAfter discovering the Incident, the Organisation took the following steps to mitigate the\n\ndamage caused:\n\n4\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\n\nOn 12 June 2018, the Organisation:\n\n(i)\n\nemailed all the affected NSmen an apology and requested for them to\ndelete\n\nall\n\nemails\n\nnot\n\nintended\n\nfor\n\nthem\n\nfrom\n\nredemption@uniqrewards.com; and\n\n(ii)\n\n(b)\n\nnotified the Commission of the Incident.\n\nOn 13 June 2018, all the affected NSmen received a text message from\nMINDEF and MHA respectively apologising for the Incident and requesting the\ndeletion of the same emails.\n\n(c)\n\nIn July 2018, the Organisation gave all the affected NSmen a gift voucher worth\nS$80 as a gesture of apology.\n\n11\n\nIn addition to the above, the Organisation introduced the following further steps to\n\nprevent the recurrence of the Incident:\n\n(a)\n\nAll future changes to the Portal would be subjected to a secondary check during\nthe development testing stage. Specifically, the person conducting integration\ntesting would be required to print out the expected output in the development\nenvironment and have it validated by a checker before starting the user\nacceptance test.\n\n(b)\n\nAll coding scenarios would have a separate person reviewing the source code\nwritten by the developer.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation began work to enhance the Portal’s backend system to allow\nConfirmation Emails to be resent directly.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation introduced a standard operating procedure to document the\nprocess of resending Confirmation Emails. Under this procedure, only\nauthorised users, with the approval of the Organisation’s data protection officer,\n\n5\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\n\nmay resend Confirmation Emails. An audit trail would also be created during\nthis process.\n\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation would deploy an application, Sonarcloud, to analyse the\nquality of source codes. Sonarcloud would be used to detect bugs,\nvulnerabilities and code smells1 during the development process.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n12\n\nAs a preliminary point, section 4(1)(c) of the PDPA excludes an organisation which\n\nacts on behalf of a public agency in relation to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data\nfrom Parts III to VI of the PDPA (i.e., the data protection provisions). Nevertheless, the\nCommission’s investigations revealed that the Organisation was a subcontractor of MINDEF\nand MHA and was not engaged by both public agencies to act on their behalf as a data\nintermediary. As such, section 4(1)(c) does not apply to the Organisation and the Organisation\nis required to comply with the data protection provisions of the PDPA.\n\n13\n\nThe main issue for determination is whether the Organisation breached section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA. Section 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n\n14\n\nAs the administrator of the Portal, the Organisation had full possession and control over\n\nthe personal data that the Portal collects, uses, discloses and processes at all material times.\nAccordingly, the Organisation had full responsibility for the security of the Portal, any changes\nto it, as well as the personal data processed by it. In this regard, the Commissioner found that\nthe Organisation had failed to conduct sufficient testing before rolling out the programme\nscript.\n15\n\nIn this case, software testing (i.e., development testing and user acceptance testing) was\n\ncarried out on the programme script prior to its actual implementation. Investigations revealed\n1\n\nA code smell refers to anything in the code of a programme that may signal a deeper issue in the code.\n\n6\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\n\na fundamental flaw in designing the test scenarios. The test scenario consisted of generating all\n427 test emails but instead of picking up the recipient emails from a list of email addresses,\neach email was hardcoded to be sent to the same internal email address. Unsurprisingly, the\nError, which would only have manifested itself if there was more than one recipient, was not\ndetected. A more thoroughly designed test scenario that more closely approximated the\nanticipated real world deployment environment could have included:\n(a)\n\nthe use of several test email addresses;\n\n(b)\n\nthe programme script retrieving these test email addresses from a database (e.g.\nthe main database of email addresses or a database of email addresses created\nfor the job) instead of using a single hardcoded email address; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe programme script being used to send the Confirmation Emails to the\nretrieved test email addresses.\n\n16\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds the Organisation in breach of section 24\n\nof the PDPA.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n\n17\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue the\nOrganisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may\ninclude directing the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nmillion.\n\n18\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be imposed on the\n\nOrganisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation voluntarily notified the Commission of the breach;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation fully cooperated with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n7\n\n\fOption Gift Pte Ltd\n(c)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 10\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the effects of the breach by\ninforming the affected individuals via email on the same day (12 June 2018)\nand offering them a voucher worth $80 in July 2018; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt corrective action to resolve the vulnerability and\nfurther remedial measures to enhance its backend system to prevent the\nrecurrence of similar incidents.\n\n19\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the present case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $4,000 within 30\ndays from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of\nsuch financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n20\n\nThe Commissioner has not set out any further directions for the Organisation given the\n\nremediation measures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to H3 Leasing for disclosing personal data online without the consent of the individual concerned.","tags":["Consent","Warning","Transport and Storage","Vehicle rental"],"date":"2019-06-06","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---H3-Leasing---06062019.pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"Breach of the Consent Obligation by H3 Leasing","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/breach-of-the-consent-obligation-by-h3-leasing","timestamp":"2019-06-06","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 9\nCase No DP-1803-B1859\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012\n\nAnd\n\nH3 Leasing\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fH3 Leasing\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 9\n\nH3 Leasing\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 9\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1803-B1859\n6 June 2019\nBackground\n1.\n\nThe complaint concerns the disclosure of personal data without consent by H3\n\nLeasing (the “Organisation”). The Organisation is in the business of rental of motor\nvehicles in Singapore.\n\n2.\n\nThe Complainant was a member of the public who had come across a post on\n\nsocial media by the Organisation disclosing scanned images of the NRIC of another\nindividual (“Affected Individual”). The personal data disclosed by virtue of this\ncomprised the full name, residential address, date of birth, NRIC number, NRIC photo\nand the thumbprint image of the Affected Individual (the “Personal Data Set”).

The Organisation was unable to locate him or the motor\nvehicle and made a police report concerning the apparent disappearance of the\nAffected Individual and the motor vehicle. The Organisation subsequently disclosed\nimages of the Affected Individual’s NRIC, which contained the Personal Data Set,\nthrough a public Facebook post to warn others about the Affected Individual and to\nsolicit information from the general public on the whereabouts of the motor vehicle.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n7.\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA provides that an Organisation shall not collect, use or\n\ndisclose personal data about an individual unless:\n\n(a)\n\nthe organisation obtains the consent of the individual for the collection,\nuse or disclosure of his personal data (in accordance with section 14 of\nthe PDPA);\n\n(b)\n\nthe individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure\nof his personal data (in accordance with section 15 of the PDPA); or\n\n(c)\n\ncollection, use or disclosure of his personal data is permitted or required\nunder the PDPA or any other written law.\n\n8.\n\nIn this case, the rental agreement entered into by the Organisation and the\n\nAffected Individual did not specify any purposes for which the Organisation could\ndisclose his personal data. There was no other document setting out such purposes\n3\n\n\fH3 Leasing\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 9\n\nand the Organisation admitted that it had not obtained the consent of the individual to\ndisclose his personal data. As such, I find that the Organisation did not have consent\nfor the disclosure of the Personal Data Set in the manner, and for the purposes, that\nit did.\n\n9.\n\nIt is also clear to me that none of the exceptions to consent in the Fourth\n\nSchedule to the PDPA permit such disclosure. The purposes of the Organisation in\nmaking the public Facebook post were to warn others about the Affected Individual\nand to solicit information from the public on the whereabouts of the missing vehicle.\nThese matters do not fall within any of the exceptions in the Fourth Schedule.\n10.\n\nOne question which may arise is whether the Organisation could have relied on\n\nthe exception to consent in paragraph 1(i) of the Fourth Schedule. That exception\npermits an organisation to disclose of an individual’s personal data without consent\nwhere it is necessary to do so in order for the organisation to recover a debt owed by\nindividual to the organisation. In my view, disclosure of the Personal Data Set via a\npublic Facebook post would be too broad a disclosure and would not be necessary for\nthe purpose of recovering a debt. Furthermore, disclosure of the scanned image of an\nNRIC (with all the data therein) in such a manner would neither be necessary nor\nappropriate.\n11.\n\nAs regards deemed consent, although the rental agreement between the\n\nOrganisation and the Affected Individual did not expressly specify the purposes for\nwhich the Organisation could collect, use or disclose the Affected Individual’s personal\ndata, the Affected Individual had provided his personal data to the Organisation for\npurposes relating to the rental of the motor vehicle and deemed consent under section\n15 of the PDPA would apply in respect of such purposes. The scope of deemed\nconsent permits the Organisation to use and disclose the Affected Individual’s\npersonal data to other allied service providers as necessary to provide the primary\nservice of motor vehicle rental. However, in my view, these purposes would not extend\nto permitting the Organisation to disclose his full NRIC details on social media for the\npurpose of warning others about the Affected Individual or soliciting information from\n4\n\n\fH3 Leasing\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 9\n\nthe public on the whereabouts of the missing vehicle. Accordingly, deemed consent\nunder section 15 of the PDPA does not apply to the disclosure in this case.\n\n12.\n\nIn light of the above, I find that the Organisation had disclosed the personal\n\ndata of the Affected Individual without consent and is therefore in breach of section 13\nof the PDPA.\nConclusion\n13.\n\nIn assessing the appropriate enforcement action in this case, I took into account\n\nthe following:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s prompt action to remove the Personal Data Set from\nthe public Facebook page;\n\n14.\n\n(b)\n\nThe number of individuals affected; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe impact of the breach.\n\nTaking into account the factors listed above, I have decided to issue a warning\n\nto the Organisation for the breach of its obligation under section 13 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"German European School Singapore was found not to be in breach of the PDPA in relation to allegations that there was no consent given for the collection of its student’s hair sample for the purpose of drug testing.","tags":["Consent","Not in Breach","Education","Student"],"date":"2019-06-03","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---German-European-School-Singapore---030619.pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"No Breach of the Consent Obligation by German European School Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/06/no-breach-of-the-consent-obligation-by-german-european-school-singapore","timestamp":"2019-06-03","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\nCase No DP-1712-B1471\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nGerman European School Singapore\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1712-B1471\n\n3 June 2019.\nBackground\n1\n\nThis case concerns a complaint made by the father (the “Complainant”)\n\nof a student1 (“AB”) at the German European School Singapore (“GESS”). The\ncentral issue raised in the complaint, in so far as it relates to the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), was that GESS had collected and used personal\ndata of AB without valid consent in the course of conducting a random drug\ntest. GESS has not denied that it had collected the personal data of AB but has\nasserted that it did so with valid consent. The brief facts of the case are as\nfollows.\n2\n\nOn 6 December 2017, AB was selected by staff of GESS for random\n\ndrug testing and asked to provide a hair sample by cutting for the drug test. This\nwas done in accordance with GESS’ internal procedures and pursuant to its\nschool bye-laws which provided that it may conduct drug testing at random or\nin cases of “proven suspicion”. When the Complainant found out about this\nlater that day, he immediately contacted the Principal of GESS via email to\n\n1\n\nAs this individual is a minor, his name and the names of his parents are omitted from this\nDecision.\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nobject to the test being done on his son. The complainant also requested that the\nresults of the test be given to him in its unopened envelope, as received by the\nschool.\n3\n\nIn a turn of events, the drug test could not be conducted on AB’s hair\n\nsample as it apparently had not been stored correctly after it had been cut when\nit was sent to the overseas testing laboratory engaged by GESS to conduct the\ndrug test2. Following the email correspondence between the Complainant and\nthe Principal, the Complainant and his wife (“AC”) met with the Principal and\nother GESS staff on 12 December 2017 to discuss the matter. At the meeting,\nthe Principal informed AB’s parents that AB was required to provide a second\nhair sample when he returned to school in January 2018.\n4\n\nThe outcome of this discussion was that the Complainant and AC were\n\ninformed by GESS during the meeting, and again by way of a letter dated 13\nDecember 2017, that AB would be subject to immediate expulsion from the\nschool if he did not provide a hair sample for the drug test on his first day back\nin school, or if the results of the test were positive.\n5\n\nThe Complainant eventually sent another email to the Principal on 7\n\nJanuary 2018 which stated that he permitted AB to give the second hair sample,\nalbeit under his “profound protest”. In reply to this email, the Principal\nreiterated GESS’ position that AB was required to give a hair sample for drug\ntesting, failing which he would have to leave school. Thereafter, the\n\n2\n\nThe drug test results on AB’s hair sample indicated “unable to complete” in respect of\neach of the drugs to be tested (listed in the results as cocaine, opiates, PCP,\namphetamines and marijuana) and the reason stated was “INVALID SAMPLE – Flap\nA/B not sealed or improperly sealed.”\n\n2\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nComplainant sent a final email emphasising that he had permitted AB to give\nthe second hair sample.\n6\n\nOn 8 January 2018, AB, accompanied by AC, presented himself at the\n\nPrincipal’s office at GESS. AC agreed to AB providing his hair sample for the\npurpose of drug testing and the school’s first aid officer proceeded to take a hair\nsample from AB.\n7\n\nOn 11 January 2018, the Complainant submitted his complaint to the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) that GESS had collected and\nused personal data of AB without consent. The Complainant asserted that this\nwas in contravention of sections 13 and 14 of the PDPA and that deemed\nconsent (under section 15 of the PDPA) did not apply. The Complainant also\nasserted that GESS “expect[s] parents to consent to have their children\nrandomly selected to take hair samples” and also that GESS “cannot argue that\nit is reasonable to do drugs testing in order to give a good education to its\nstudents”.\n8\n\nIn its response to PDPC’s investigation into the matter, GESS sought to\n\nrely on agreements entered into between GESS and AC in 2006 and 2011. GESS\nalso sought to rely on the Complainant’s correspondence with the Principal and\nAC’s verbal statements on 8 January 2018 to assert that the Complainant and\nAC had provided their consent for the collection of AB’s personal data. GESS\nalso made various representations concerning the reasons for its drug testing\npolicy.\n\n3\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Findings\nWhat is the personal data that is the subject of the complaint?\n9\n\nIn his complaint, the Complainant raised the possibility of AB’s hair\n\nsample being part of his personal data, apparently on the basis that a hair sample\ncontains DNA.3 In this case, GESS had not collected the hair sample for DNA\ntesting and would not have obtained any information concerning AB’s DNA.\n10\n\nNevertheless, the intention was to obtain through chemical analysis\n\ninformation about whether the individual had consumed controlled drugs by\nidentifying traces found in the hair sample. It is this personal data that is the\nsubject matter of the complaint. Further, it is clear that the hair sample was\ncollected for drug testing and there would be a report produced by the testing\nlaboratory which indicated the outcome of the test. The hair sample was sent to\nthe testing laboratory on a “no-names” basis, that is, without identifying the\nindividual to whom the sample belonged. As such only GESS was able to match\nthe drug test results with the student who had given the hair sample.\nWhat are the requirements for obtaining consent for the collection and use of\npersonal data under the PDPA?\n11\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA allows an organisation to collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data with the individual’s consent unless an exception applied. Consent\nmay be given by the individual or any person validly acting on behalf of the\nindividual: section 14(4). However, section 14(2) read with section 14(3)\n\n3\n\nThe Complainant stated in the third paragraph of the details of the complaint, “… I\nrealised that a hair sample contains DNA, and therefore qualifies as data in the list of\nexamples you listed – which included DNA sample and Iris scans”.\n\n4\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\ninvalidates any consent which requires an individual to give consent as a\ncondition of providing a product or service, beyond what is reasonably\nnecessary in order to provide the product or service. Section 15 of the PDPA\ncontemplates the possibility that an individual may be deemed to have given\nconsent through his voluntarily act of providing personal data to the\norganisation for specific purposes. While section 16(1) of the PDPA provides\nan individual may, at any time on giving reasonable notice to the organisation,\nwithdraw any consent given, or deemed to have been given. Finally,\norganisations are held to a reasonable standard in meeting their responsibilities\nby virtue of section 11(1) of the PDPA.\n12\n\nAs there are no written laws which require or authorise the collection of\n\npersonal data without consent as in the circumstance of this case, GESS must\ntherefore have either obtained consent under the PDPA for the collection and\nuse of AB’s personal data or AB must be deemed to have consented to such\ncollection and use. For the purposes of this case, I would like to highlight the\nfollowing principles which would apply under the PDPA:\n(a)\n\nThe term “consent” under sections 13 and 14 – in contrast with\n“deemed consent” under section 15 – is not defined in the PDPA.\nIn general, consent refers to any agreement to, or acceptance of,\nthe matter which is being consented to.\n\n(b)\n\nThe PDPA does not specify any particular manner in which\nconsent is to be given under sections 13 and 14 of the PDPA. It\nis trite law that consent may either be express or implied:\n(i)\n\nExpress consent refers to consent which is expressly\nstated in written or verbal form.\n\n5\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n(ii)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nImplied consent refers to consent which may be inferred\nor implied from the circumstances or the conduct of the\nindividual in question. Thus Black’s Law Dictionary\n(10th edition) defines “implied consent” as:\n“1. Consent inferred from one’s conduct\nrather than from one’s direct expression.\n– Also termed implied permission.\n2. Consent imputed as a result of\ncircumstances that arise, as when a\nsurgeon removing a gall bladder\ndiscovers and removes colon cancer.”\n\nLikewise, in the High Court case of Samsonite IP\nHoldings Sarl v An Sheng Trading Pte Ltd [2017] 4 SLR\n99 which involved, amongst others, the question of\nwhether certain backpacks were “put on the market with\nthe [trade mark] proprietor’s express or implied consent\n(conditional or otherwise)” within the meaning of\nsection 29 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 322), George\nWei J observed at [113] that:\n“The notion of “implied consent” is a\nmore difficult concept to grapple with [as\ncompared to express consent], especially\nin terms of its application. In general, it\ncan be characterised as consent which is\nnot expressly granted by the proprietor,\nbut rather inferred from his actions\nand/or the facts and circumstances of a\nparticular situation.”\n\nIn contrast to consent deemed by operation of law under\nsection 15, this is a form of actual consent where the\nindividual does, in fact, consent to the collection, use and\ndisclosure of his personal data (as the case may be)\nalthough he has not expressly stated his consent in\nwritten or verbal form. It is a concept that is more\n6\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nexpansive and malleable than deemed consent as its\nambit is defined by the circumstances and conduct of the\nindividual; but is necessarily more restricted in scope\nthan express consent which is an expression of agreement\nof the range of purposes contemplated by the\norganisation to which the individual agrees or accepts.\n(Parenthetically, the expansive scope of express consent\nis circumscribed by the requirement of reasonable\nappropriateness under section 18.)\n(c)\n\nFor both of the above modes of giving consent to be effective\nunder the PDPA, the requirements of section 14(1) of the PDPA\nmust be met. For example, the individual must have been\nnotified of the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure (as\nthe case may be) of his personal data.4 In comparison, deemed\nconsent under section 15 does not require that the individual\nmust have been notified of such purposes: section 20(3)(a) of the\nPDPA. It suffices that the individual provided personal data for\na purpose which may, or ought to, be known to the individual, or\ninferred from the surrounding circumstances.\n\n(d)\n\nWhere an individual has given express or implied consent in the\ncircumstances specified in section 14(2) of the PDPA (see\n\n4\n\nAn example of this is where an individual presents a credit card or charge card for the purpose\nof making payment for an online purchase. The individual expressly consents to the issuer bank\ncollecting, using and/or disclosing his payment details to process his purchases. Deemed\nconsent covers the disclosure of his payment details by the merchant to its acquiring bank.\nImplied consent enables the multiple layers of disclosure and use of his payment details by the\nfinancial institutions participating in the card scheme during the course of processing the\npayment. The concepts of deemed and implied consent operate in a mutually exclusive manner\nbut may be daisy-chained.\n\n7\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nabove), such consent would be invalid. As stated in the Advisory\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017)\n(at [12.15] to [12.16]):\n“12.15 Section 14(2) of the PDPA sets out\nadditional obligations that organisations must\ncomply with when obtaining consent. This\nsubsection provides that an organisation\nproviding a product or service to an individual\nmust not, as a condition of providing the\nproduct or service, require the individual to\nconsent to the collection, use or disclosure of his\npersonal data beyond what is reasonable to\nprovide the product or service. The subsection\nalso prohibits organisations from obtaining or\nattempting to obtain consent by providing false\nor misleading information or using deceptive or\nmisleading practices.\n12.16 Section 14(3) provides that any consent\nobtained in such circumstances is not valid.\nHence an organisation may not rely on such\nconsent, and if it collects, uses or discloses\npersonal data in such circumstances, it would\nhave failed to comply with the Consent\nObligation.”\n\n(e)\n\nWhere an individual has given express or implied consent under\nthe PDPA, deemed consent would not arise under section 15 of\nthe PDPA. This is in view of the words in section 15(1)(a) which\nstate that deemed consent may arise where the individual\n“without actually giving consent referred to in section 14,\nvoluntarily provides the personal data to the organisation …”.\n\nConsent obtained by GESS – Implied Consent\n13\n\nAfter a review of all the evidence obtained by PDPC during its\n\ninvestigation and for the reasons set out below, I am of the view that GESS had\n\n8\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nobtained the necessary consent for the collection and use of AB’s personal data\nin connection with the drug test conducted on his hair sample.\nNotification of purpose\n14\n\nAs with other schools, GESS has in place various school rules and\n\npolicies which it has established. Specifically, in relation to drug testing,\nparagraph 5.8 of the Respondent’s School Bye-Law (“Bye-Law 5.8”) states as\nfollows:\n“5.8\n\nDrug Testing\n\nThe School shall conduct drug tests on students of Form 7 and\nabove in cases of proven suspicion, as well as, at random. The\nPrincipal shall decide on the procedures of the test. If and when\nthe first test shall be positive, and this is confirmed by a second\ntest taken within a reasonable time-span, the respective\nstudent shall be expelled from the school immediately.”\n\n15\n\nThese bye-laws are made available to parents when they enrol their\n\nchildren in the school and are also available on GESS’ website through a\nparents’ portal set up by the school.\n16\n\nWhen considering Bye-Law 5.8, I note that it expressly states the\n\noutcome of a positive test, which is that the student in question will be expelled\nfrom the school. I am of the view that Bye-law 5.8 sufficiently specifies the\npurposes for which the drug test results would be used. Accordingly, I find that\nBye-Law 5.8 has met the requirements of the PDPA in terms of notifying the\nindividuals concerned of the purposes for the collection and use of their personal\ndata.\n17\n\nDuring investigations, GESS sought to rely on the following documents\n\nto substantiate its assertion that it had obtained written consent for the collection\nand use of AB’s personal data:\n\n9\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nAn agreement entered into by AC on 20 March 2006 to abide by\n\nthe terms of GESS bye-laws (including Bye-Law 5.8) (the “2006\nAgreement”).\n(b)\n\nAn information letter provided to parents of GESS’ students,\n\nincluding AC, on 31 October 2011 which included a reference and a link\nto GESS’ bye-laws and which was accepted by AC on 1 November 2011\n(the “2011 Information Letter”).\n18\n\nThe documents relied upon by GESS do not contain any express consent\n\nclause for the collection and use of personal data. This is unsurprising given that\nthose documents predate the enactment of the PDPA. It is notable in this case\nthat GESS had implemented a data protection policy following the enactment\nof the PDPA and it provided for express consent to be obtained for collection\nand use of various items of personal data for various purposes. However,\nGESS’s data protection policy does not cover personal data collected for the\npurpose of drug testing and accordingly they have not sought to rely on their\ndata protection policy in this case.\n19\n\nThe 2006 Agreement comprises a set of documents entitled “Part 4 –\n\nAdmission Forms” which were signed by the Complainant’s wife on 20 March\n2006. In particular:\n20\n\nPart 4.2 (entitled “Application Form”) included the following\n\nparagraph which was signed and agreed to by the Complainant’s wife:\n“I/We the undersigned request the enrolment of my/our\nchild/ward/employee in accordance with the terms, conditions\nand the school rules of the German European School\nSingapore. I certify that all particulars furnished in this\napplication are complete and accurate to the best of my/our\nknowledge, and that I/we will notify the School of any changes\nimmediately. I/We acknowledge that the School is considering\n\n10\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nthe application on the basis of the information I/we have\nprovided.”\n\n21\n\nPart 4.6 (entitled “Confirmation of Receipt of Documents”) included\n\nthe following, which was also signed and agreed to by the Complainant’s wife:\n“By signing this confirmation, I/we hereby confirm that I/we\nhave received the documents listed and that I/we agree to abide\nby their terms, and where appropriate make my/our child\naware of their content.”\n\nTitle of Document\nSchool rules\n\nConstitution\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nSchool\n\nAssociation\nSchool Fee Bye-Law\n\nTerms\n\nand\n\nConditions\n\nof\n\nPayments Fees\nBye-Law\n\nSchool Bye-Law\n\nGoverning\n\nthe\n\nEducation Principles\n(emphasis added)\n22\n\nThe 2011 Information Letter is a letter dated 31 October 2011 which had\n\nbeen sent by GESS to parents of its students. This letter informed parents of\ncertain changes to their Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions\nwas found in a document entitled “Statutory Information” which included the\nschool bye-laws. The following confirmation to the 2011 Letter was signed by\nAC on 1 December 2011:\n“I acknowledge receipt of the German European School\nSingapore Updated Terms and Conditions August 2011 and\nagree to accept the terms stated therein.”\n\n11\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nIn my view, both the 2006 Agreement and the 2011 Information Letter each\nserve as sufficient notification under the PDPA, since, as noted above, Bye-Law\n5.8 sufficiently identified the purposes for which students’ personal data\n(namely drug test results) were to be collected.\n23\n\nIn the circumstances, I am of the view that AB’s parents had access to\n\nGESS’ school bye-laws and hence had been notified of the purposes for the\ncollection and use of AB’s personal data in connection with the random drug\ntesting administered by GESS.\nActual and/or implied consent (by conduct) to the collection of personal data in\ndrug test results\n24\n\nGESS raised a number of specific instances where the Complainant\n\nand/or AC were alleged to have given their consent in written or verbal form,\nwhich I am satisfied to be the case on a review of the documents. Additionally,\nI am of the view that there is a more general principle that applies in this case.\nAs the school’s bye-laws were made available to parents, they must be taken to\nhave agreed to enrol their children in the school on that basis. This is certainly\nthe case in the present matter as AB has been enrolled in GESS for more than\n10 years.\n25\n\nI find that his parents’ decision to enrol him, and to continue having him\n\nenrolled in the school for a substantial period, amounts to an acceptance of the\nschool’s bye-laws, including Bye-law 5.8. This constitutes implied consent for\nthe purposes of the PDPA and, as it was validly given by AB’s parents, amounts\nto consent by AB pursuant to section 14(4) of the PDPA. A similar view was\ntaken by the court in GBN v GBO [2017] SGDC 143 with respect to a school’s\nconfiscation of its student’s mobile phone in accordance with its school rules.\nIn that case, the school in question had confiscated the student’s mobile phone\n\n12\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nas the student was found to have used the phone in contravention of the school’s\nrule on mobile phones. The said rule further provided that the school will only\nreturn mobile phones which had been confiscated after a period of three months.\nThe father of the student commenced court proceedings against the school\nalleging that the school’s confiscation of the phone amounted to the tort of\nconversion. The court in GBN, in dismissing the father’s proceedings, held:\n“I also disagree with the plaintiff’s assertion that he is not\nbound by the school rules. The plaintiff does not deny\nknowledge of the Phone Rule or the 3 January Letter. If the\nplaintiff took issue with the Phone Rule, the plaintiff could have\nenrolled his son in another school. Surely, as the defendant\ncounsel submitted, by continuing to let his son study at the\nSchool, the plaintiff would have either expressly or impliedly\nagreed that his son would abide by the School’s disciplinary\npolicies and rules.”\n\n26\n\nSimilarly, by continuing to keep AB enrolled at GESS, the Complainant\n\nand AC have either expressly or impliedly agreed that AB would abide by the\nSchool Bye-laws.\nActual consent when AB provided his hair sample for the purposes of drug\ntesting and collection of personal data\n27\n\nAt this juncture, I should deal with the Complainant’s email of 7 January\n\n2018 wherein he provided consent under protest for AB to undergo drug testing:\n“My principled objections to random drugs testing, as\nexplained in my previous email […] remain unchanged, but my\nson’s continued education at a school we otherwise like is more\nimportant, so [AB] will report to the front desk on Monday,\nunder profound protest form my side:\nIt is my view that parents are ultimately responsible for their\nchildren’s upbringing, and that we should be asked explicitly\nfor consent to a policy that:\n\n\ninvades our child’s privacy\n\n\n\nhas no relation to his performance, attitude, and\nbehaviour at school\n\n13\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nhas been ruled illegal in Europe.\n\nSpecifically, every parent should have the right to deny consent\nwithout any adverse impact on their child’s school experience.”\n(Emphasis added)\n\n28\n\nThe Complainant’s 7 January 2018 email makes it clear that he agreed\n\nto allow AB to provide GESS with his hair sample for the purpose of the drug\ntest in view of his continued desire for AB to remain and continue with his\neducation at the school. Presumably, the purpose of giving consent under protest\nis to record the Complainant’s objections to GESS’ policy on random drugs\ntesting on principle. His email is premised on his “principled objections to\nrandom drugs testing” and that parents ought to be able to deny consent without\nany adverse impact on the child’s school experience. The Complainant’s protest\ndoes not and cannot be taken to mean that he is giving notice that he intends to\nchallenge GESS’ collection of personal data on the basis that his agreement\nunder protest, without more, prevents such collection of personal data. This is\nmade clearer on a review of the correspondence between GESS and the\nComplainant following the Complainant’s said e-mail.\n29\n\nIn response to the Complainant’s email of 7 January 2018, GES replied\n\non the same day as follows:\n“Dear [redacted],\nThank you for your mail. Our position has not changed. [AB]\nwill not enter a classroom without giving a hair sample before\ndoing so. If he is unwilling to cooperate, he has to leave school\nat once. As you know. We (sic) are a private school and we have\nno obligations whatsoever to keep students who do not follow\nour policies.”\n\n30\n\nThe above email is presumably an attempt by GESS to make clear that\n\nAB would have to provide his hair sample without any condition or AB’s\nadmission at the school would be terminated. This correspondence likely\n\n14\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nresulted from the uncertainty of the Complainant’s intention agreeing to AB\ngiving his hair sample under protest.\n31\n\nThe Complainant then responded as follows:\n“Dear [redacted],\nIn your letter (attached), you asked [AB] to report to the front\ndesk, and in my email this morning, I write to you that [AB] will\ndo exactly that (albeit under my official protest, as stated).\nSo I am not sure why I receive this reply from you.”\n\n32\n\nThis makes it clear that the Complainant agreed to AB providing GESS\n\nwith the hair sample, although the Complainant was clearly displeased about\nhaving to do so. Accordingly, AB presented himself later that day and\nunderwent the collection of the hair sample for drug testing. In this regard, I\nnote that GESS had asserted that AC also gave verbal consent when she\naccompanied AB to school on 8 January 2018.\n33\n\nThe Complainant seeks to keep AB in GESS while cherry picking from\n\nits bye-laws those that he does not wish to abide with. Bye-laws play an\nimportant role in shaping conduct within an organisation. In an educational\ninstitution like a school, it is untenable that parents are able to cherry pick from\nits bye-laws in order to create a customised set of rules for their child. The\nOrganisation has the prerogative to justify that its bye-laws are reasonably\nnecessary for maintaining conduct and discipline in the school, and to provide\na safe educational environment. If the Complainant disagrees, it was always\nopen to the Complainant or AC to have enrolled AB in another school which\ndid not test its student for drugs. Accordingly, I find that GESS had obtained\nAB’s consent for the collection and use of his personal data as required under\nsection 13 of the PDPA. In coming to this conclusion, I bear firmly in mind the\nfact that AB’s parents had not formally objected to the collection and use of\n\n15\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nAB’s personal data until after he had been selected for random drug testing,\neven though he had been receiving his education in GESS for over a decade and\nAC had, as a staff member of GESS, known of the annual random drug tests\nthat GESS conducts pursuant to its bye-laws.\nReasonableness - GESS’ collection of personal data found in AB’s drug test\nresults is not beyond what is reasonable for GESS to provide education services\nto AB\n34\n\nThe Complainant also raised the issue that even if consent had been\n\nobtained by GESS, such consent would be invalid on the basis of section\n14(2)(a) read with section 14(3) of the PDPA.\n35\n\nBroadly speaking, GESS is providing education services to AB and it is\n\nclear that GESS did not permit AB to be exempt from the random drug testing\nwhen he was selected. To the contrary, GESS clearly informed AB’s parents\nthat he would be expelled from the school if he did not provide a hair sample\nand submit to the drug testing. Also, as set out above in paragraphs 13 to 23, the\nComplainant had access to the School Bye Laws and had been notified about\nthe school’s random drug testing policy since at least by 20 March 2006 when\nAC entered into the 2006 Agreement with the school. In the context of the\nPDPA, this also amounts to a requirement that AB consent to the collection and\nuse of his personal data (namely the drug test results, as stated earlier) by GESS\nfor the purposes provided in Bye-Law 5.8. The question therefore arises as to\nwhether GESS’ requirement for consent is beyond what is reasonable for the\nprovision of education services by GESS to AB.\n36\n\nOn this issue, I note that GESS asserted that the drug testing policy is\n\ninstituted for a purpose which was reasonable and appropriate in the\n\n16\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\ncircumstances. In this regard, GESS stated the following in its response to\nPDPC:\n“With regard to query 5(g)[5] of the Notice, the basis of GESS’\nbelief is as follows:\ni. GESS is registered as a society with its objectives and powers\nset out in its constitution;\nii. GESS has an open, long-standing, and firm policy on\nmaintaining itself as a drugs-free institution;\niii. In furtherance of this objective, GESS exercised its powers\nunder its constitution to institute policies and bye-laws,\nincluding its drug policy;\niv. As a school, GESS places paramount importance on the\nsafety and welfare of its students, including maintaining itself\nas a drugs-free institution;\nv. GESS’ drug policy is made known to and consented to by its\nstudents and/or their parents; and\nvi. GESS has in place clear guidelines and confidential\nprocedures in implementing drug testing…”\n\n37\n\nGESS also asserted that the German Embassy of Singapore supported\n\ndrug testing in schools and, in this regard, provided PDPC with a copy of a letter\nfrom the German Embassy of Singapore to the Respondent dated 1 March 2004\n(in German together with GESS’ translation). GESS’ translation of the German\nEmbassy’s letter states that:\n“The foreign federal office makes the following statement\nregarding the intention to conduct drug testing at the German\nSchool Singapore and regarding the changes of the school byelaws:\nThe Consideration of the German School Singapore, similar to\nother German schools abroad especially in the Asiatic region to\nintroduce drug testing, has been welcomed. The German\nschools abroad develop their school regulations on the basis of\n\n5\n\nQuery 5(g) refers to PDPC’s query on the basis of GESS’ assertion that their drug\ntesting policy was instituted for a purpose which was reasonable and appropriate in the\ncircumstances.\n\n17\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nthe guideline of the standing conference of the ministers of\neducation and cultural Affairs\" (KMK) dated 15.01.1982. Under\nthis directive, schools are taking action to promote and\nensure health care, including drug prevention. A\ncoordination with the funding German authorities is not\nintended. With the enrolment of their child, the\nparents/guardians acknowledge the school regulations, and\ntherefore also the provisions on health care and any\nregulations on drug prevention.\nThe prerequisite for the introduction of a drug test policy is ...\nthese procedures shall be embedded into an overall pedagogical\nconcept to drug prevention. If such a concept is not included\nelsewhere in the school regulations, schools are requested to do\nso without further delay. For this purpose, the exchange of\nexperience with other schools of the region in particular the\nGerman School Beijing is recommended, as they have included\na drug policy as annex to their school regulations to, inter alia,\n“save their students from addiction, keep the school free\nfrom addictive substances and to support students who are\nat risk of being addicted and their guardians to get away of\nthe addiction, if necessary.” The German School Tokyo have\nsimilar plans. The background to such an overall pedagogical\napproach to drug prevention is the understanding of drug\nprevention as an educational task and not only as\nmeasurement to identify drug users.”\n(Emphasis added)\n\n38\n\nAs a general principle, schools have various responsibilities in relation\n\nto their students and these may extend beyond a purely pedagogical role. For\nexample, they would also be responsible for ensuring the health and safety of\nstudents in the school environment. Hence, I am of the view that schools are\nbest placed to determine the appropriate school rules and bye-laws to establish\nin order to discharge their various responsibilities and create an environment\nthat is conducive to meet the educational needs of their students. This may\ninclude implementing a policy which requires drug tests for certain students or\nin certain circumstances to ensure a safe environment and to detect behaviour\nand habits that may affect a student’s scholastic performance. I am fortified by\nthe views of the court in GBN where the court found that a school had the\nauthority to implement and enforce school rules to maintain the discipline of its\n\n18\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nstudents as set out above at paragraph 25. Just as in GBN, it was open to the\nComplainant in this matter to take AB out of GESS and enrol AB in another\nschool.\n39\n\nIt should also be highlighted that it was open to the Complainant to\n\nwithdraw his consent on giving reasonable notice to GESS by virtue of section\n16 of the PDPA. Had the Complainant withdrawn this consent, GESS would\nhave had to inform the Complainant of the likely consequences of withdrawing\nthe consent: section 16(2). Section 16(3) of the PDPA safeguards the\nComplainant by ensuring that GESS cannot prohibit his withdrawal of consent;\nbut the Complainant will have to live with any legal consequences arising from\nsuch withdrawal, which in this case means that he has to take AB out of GESS\nand enroll him in another school. The application of these principles had been\nillustrated in the Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (at\n[12.45]):\n“An individual wishes to obtain certain services from a telecom\nservice provider, Operator X and is required by the telecom\nservice provider to agree to its terms and conditions for\nprovision of the services. Operator X can stipulate as a condition\nof providing the services that the individual agrees to the\ncollection, use and disclosure of specified types of personal data\nby the organisation for the purpose of supplying the subscribed\nservices. Such types of personal data may include the name and\naddress of the individual as well as personal data collected in\nthe course of providing the services such as the individual’s\nlocation data. The individual provides consent for those\nspecified types of personal data but subsequently withdraws that\nconsent.\nThe withdrawal of consent results in Operator X being unable to\nprovide services to the individual. This would in turn entail an\nearly termination of the service contract. Operator X should\ninform the individual of the consequences of the early\ntermination, e.g. that the individual would incur early\ntermination charges.”\n\n19\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n40\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nClearly, the above finding is limited to the facts in this case and should\n\nnot be taken as a general ruling that an organisation can in all cases justify a\nclaim that it cannot provide services to an individual if the individual does not\nconsent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data. Any such finding\nis fact and context specific and must meet the same reasonableness test as set\nout at section 14(2)(a) and which is discussed above at paragraphs 35 to 38.\nReasonableness – a reasonable person would consider it appropriate in the\ncircumstances for GESS to obtain a hair sample from AB by cutting his hair\n41\n\nApart from whether consent to random drug testing in order to receive\n\neducation from a school is reasonable, there is the related question whether the\ncollection of personal data through the provision of hair sample by cutting is a\nreasonably appropriate means of implementing the random drug test policy.\nSection 11(1) of the PDPA imposes a general standard of reasonableness on\norganisations in meeting their responsibilities under the PDPA:\n“In meeting its responsibilities under this Act, an organisation\nshall consider what a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate in the circumstances.”\n\n42\n\nTo my mind, obtaining a hair sample by cutting in order to perform drug\n\ntesting does not appear to me to be particularly invasive or unreasonable. Hair\ntests are contemplated in our anti-drug abuse laws as means of detecting\nsuspected drug consumption: see section 31A of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Also,\nobtaining a hair sample by cutting a few strands of hair is not invasive and does\nnot ordinarily cause pain. I acknowledge that the random drug testing policy by\nGESS and the mandatory regime under the Misuse of Drugs Act are very\ndifferent, and take care to emphasise that I refer to the Misuse of Drugs Act only\nto highlight that taking a hair sample to test for drug consumption is an\nacceptable method.\n\n20\n\n\fGerman European School Singapore\n\n43\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 8\n\nAccordingly, I find that the collection and use of AB’s personal data in\n\nthe circumstances of this case is not beyond what is reasonable for GESS to\nprovide education services to AB and the collection of personal data through\nhair samples is a reasonably appropriate means to do so. As GESS has not\ncontravened section 14(2) of the PDPA, section 14(3) does not apply and the\nconsent obtained by GESS remains valid.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n44\n\nIn the circumstances, I find that GESS is not in breach of sections 13\n\nand 14 of the PDPA as they had obtained consent for the collection and use of\nAB’s personal data and this consent was valid and subsisting at the relevant\ntime.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n21\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $8,000 was imposed and directions were issued to Matthew Chiong Partnership for breaches of the PDPA.

The\nCommissioner found the Organisation to be in breach of its Protection\nObligation and Openness Obligation under the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”). The Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decisions are set\nout below.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a Singapore-registered law firm which provides\n\nestate planning services and handles property transactions for its clients.\n3\n\nOn 28 August 2017, an administrative staff from the Organisation sent\n\nan email (“Email 1”) to two individuals informing them that the legal\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\ndocuments for their property refinancing had been prepared and were ready for\nsignature. One of the email addresses was incorrect as the administrative staff\nmade an error in the email address – as an example and only for illustration\npurposes, by typing AAA@yahoo.com instead of ZAAA@yahoo.com. The\nincorrect email address was a valid email address as the Complainant had sent\na test email to that email address after Email 1 was sent and did not receive a\nmail delivery failed message. This mistake was identified by the sister of the\nComplainant (\"Sister\"), one of the intended recipients, who informed the\nComplainant. Once the Complainant informed the administrative staff, the\nadministrative staff re-sent the email to the Complainant. Email 1 disclosed\ninformation including the email address of the Sister, the residential address of\nComplainant and Sister, and the name of the bank in relation to the Complainant\nand Sister's mortgage of their property.\n4\n\nThe second incident occurred on 15 September 2017 when the same\n\nadministrative staff sent an email (“Email 2”), enclosing a letter addressed to a\nbank from the Organisation and a redemption statement issued by the bank, to\nthe same incorrect email address. Email 2 disclosed information including the\nfull names, NRIC numbers, residential address, financial data such as the\nmortgage account information (consisting the name of bank, account holders’\nfull names, loan account number, file reference number, name of security, and\nredemption statement of account for the month of September 2017) of the\nComplainant and her Sister. Following the two incidents, the Managing Partner\napologised to the Complainant and Sister and offered: (i) a full refund of legal\ncosts; and (ii) to absorb all the disbursements incurred in handling the property\ntransaction.\n5\n\nSubsequently, on 29 September 2017, the Managing Partner sent an\n\nemail (“Email 3”) to the Complainant and Sister enclosing two attachments: (i)\n\n2\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\na Letter of Approval from the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) Board; and (ii)\na blank Authorisation Use of CPF for Purchase of Private Property form. The\nComplainant noticed that there were two different documents contained within\nthe Letter of Approval, and one of the pages reflected the full names of two\nother individuals (“Other Clients”), who were clients of the Organisation, and\nwho were unrelated to the Complainant’s property transaction and unknown to\nthe Complainant and Sister.\n6\n\nThe table below sets out the three emails sent (collectively, the\n\n“Emails”) and the enclosed attachments (collectively, the “Attachments”)\nalong with a description of the corresponding information that was disclosed\nwithout authorisation.\n\nEmail 1\n\nEmail 2\n\nType of Document\n\nInformation Disclosed\n\nCorrespondence\n\n\n\nThe Sister's email address;\n\n\n\nthe Complainant’s and\nresidential address; and\n\n\n\nthe name of the bank in relation to\nthe mortgage of the property.\n\n1.

A\nblank\nAuthorisation\nUse of CPF for\nPurchase\nof\nPrivate Property\nForm\n\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Assessments\nMain Issues for Determination\n7\n\nThe issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhether the information disclosed by the Emails and\n\nAttachments constituted personal data within the meaning of the PDPA;\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation had implemented reasonable security\n\narrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its\ncontrol, as required pursuant to section 24 of the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nwhether the Organisation had put in place policies and practices\n\nrelating to personal data, as required pursuant to section 12 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nIssue (a): Whether the information disclosed by the Emails and Attachments\nconstituted personal data\n(i) The information disclosed in the Emails and Attachments were personal data\n8\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines personal data as data, whether true or\n\nnot, about an individual who can be identified from either that data, or from that\ndata and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\naccess. Given that the full names, residential address, NRIC numbers, email\naddresses and financial data of the Complainant and Sister were disclosed, it\nwould have been possible to identify the Complainant and Sister from the\ninformation contained in the Emails and Attachments. Taking just the email\naddress of the Complainant as an example, given that it contained the partial\nname of the Complainant, it in itself would potentially allow a third party to\nidentify the Complainant. The disclosure of the full names of the Other Clients\nin Email 3 would also have allowed a third party to identify these individuals.\nAccordingly, the information contained in each of the Emails and Attachments\nor collectively, amounted to personal data within the meaning of section 2(1) of\nthe PDPA.\n(ii) The personal data contained in Emails and Attachments were sensitive in\nnature\n9\n\nThe earlier decisions of the Commissioner have identified that certain\n\ninformation by reason of the context of their disclosure or by their very nature\nwould be considered as personal data that is sensitive.1 These include but are\n\n1\n\nSee Re Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [11].\n\n5\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nnot limited to NRIC/Passport numbers2, financial data such as bank account\ndetails containing the name of the bank, the bank account number and the\naccount holder’s name3, and insurance policy data such as the premium amount\nand type of coverage4.\n10\n\nAs set out in the table at paragraph 6, the following personal data had\n\nbeen disclosed: the bank name, the NRIC numbers of the Complainant and\nSister, loan account number of the bank, repayment information and collateral\ninformation. The disclosure of such information could have led to harm to the\nComplainant and Sister as such financial information could have exposed the\nComplainant and Sister to the risk of fraud and identity theft. As such, the\npersonal data of the Complainant and Sister which had been disclosed, when\ntaken as a whole, constituted sensitive personal data.\n11\n\nSince the Organisation is in the business of providing legal services, and\n\nhandles large volumes of personal data on a day to day basis, the Organisation\nand its staff members should be vigilant in its handling of personal data. The\nfact that the same administrative staff managed to send the emails to the\nincorrect email address on two separate occasions within a period under one\nmonth – ie between 28 August and 15 September 2017 – despite being told of\nthe mistake demonstrated that a culture of care and responsibility towards the\nhandling of the personal data had not been sufficiently ingrained within the\nOrganisation.\n\n2\n\nRe JP Pepperdine Group Pte.

This point was\nagain emphasised in the recent decision of Re Aviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 4\nwhere sensitive personal data was disclosed due to a lack of safeguards put in\nplace to protect against the unauthorised disclosure of personal data in the\norganisation’s enveloping process. The PDPC’s Advisory Guidelines on Key\nConcepts in the Personal Data Protection Act urge organisations to “implement\nrobust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of security for\npersonal data of varying levels of sensitivity”.7\n\n5\n\nRe Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [25] and [26].\n\n6\n\nRe Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [17] and [18].\n\n7\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act\n(revised on 27 July 2017) at [17.3].\n\n7\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n14\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nFurther, the Commissioner in Re Credit Counselling Singapore advised\n\nthat suitable checks and controls be implemented before emails containing\nsensitive personal data are sent.8 These may range from process-based\nsupervision to technological controls like using the “mail-merge” function in\nOutlook. Credit Counselling Singapore had, after the data breach, automated the\nprocess of sending emails using mail-merge software. The Organisation in this\ncase should similarly consider putting in place a similar technological solution\nsince it has to churn out standard form emails regularly.\n15\n\nHowever, the Commissioner “is not suggesting that organisations\n\nwould need, for example, to have the added layer of supervision in all cases\nwhere emails containing personal data are being sent out … organisations are\nto put in place security arrangements that are commensurate with the sensitivity\nof the data in question – a balance of considerations.”9 The PDPC’s guide to\npreventing accidental disclosure when processing and sending personal data\nencourages organisations to have a process to double check and verify: (i) the\nrecipients’ email addresses; (ii) whether the right attachments containing the\ncorrect personal data are attached; and (iii) whether the attachments are for the\nintended recipients before sending the emails out.10 Therefore, implementing\nadditional checks and controls when handling sensitive personal data is not a\nmandatory requirement but one that should be adopted where appropriate.\nUltimately, the facts of the case and the type of personal data being handled will\ninfluence whether or not the current checks and controls implemented in the\nparticular organisation are sufficient.\n\n8\n\nRe Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [29].\n\n9\n\nRe Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [30].\n\n10\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data (20 January 2017) at [2.1]\n\n8\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\n(ii) The Organisation failed to implement adequate security arrangements\nwhich led to the unauthorised disclosure of personal data\n16\n\nThe Organisation explained that the unauthorised disclosure in the\n\nEmails were caused by human error and failure to conduct thorough checks of\nthe recipients’ email addresses and the content of the attachments before\nsending out the email to the recipients. For Email 1 and Email 2, the\nadministrative staff had entered an incorrect email address which the\nOrganisation claims has never occurred when she had sent out electronic\ncommunications on previous occasions. For Email 3, the Letter of Approval was\nprinted on recycled paper and scanned by an employee of the Organisation.\nHowever, the employee had scanned the Letter of Approval using the doublesided scanning mode which was the previous setting left on the scanner. As a\nresult, a page containing the names of the Other Clients who were also clients\nof the Organisation was scanned together with the Letter of Approval.\n17\n\nThe excuse that this was a one-off mistake by the employees and the\n\nManaging Partner of the Organisation, and not due to any lack of or failure to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements pursuant to section 24 PDPA was\nduly considered by the Commissioner. This was an alternative position\npreviously considered by the Commissioner in Re Furnituremart.sg [2017]\nSGPDPC\n\n7\n\n(“Re\n\nFurnituremart.sg”).11\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner\n\nin\n\nRe\n\nFurnituremart.sg ultimately concluded that the organisation lacked the\nnecessary policies and practices to protect personal data.12 Similarly, the\nCommissioner also takes the view in this case that the Organisation failed to\n\n11\n\nRe Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [11].\n\n12\n\nRe Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [17].\n\n9\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nimplement reasonable security arrangements, and the incident could not be\nconsidered as a one-off inadvertent disclosure.\n18\n\nAs a starting position, under section 53(1) of the PDPA, is that the\n\nOrganisation is liable for the acts and conduct of its employees in relation to the\nunauthorised disclosure of the personal data. In response to the Commissioner’s\nrequest of the details of the Organisation’s security arrangements, the\nOrganisation stated that: (i) all employees were briefed on the need to keep\nprivate and confidential personal data of their clients on a regular basis; and (ii)\nall employees were advised to cut and paste email addresses of clients from a\nlegitimate source of information or click the “Reply” function to the email sent\nfrom a client rather than typing in the email addresses. However, the\nOrganisation was unable to provide any evidence of such briefings to its\nemployees.\n19\n\nIn Re Aviva Ltd [2017], the Commissioner found that “it is insufficient\n\nfor the Organisation to solely depend on its employees to carry out their duties\ndiligently as a type of safeguard against an unauthorised disclosure of personal\ndata”.13 This case is no different. Therefore, the Commissioner finds that the\nOrganisation's briefing to and/or giving advice to employees was by itself\ninsufficient to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data, particularly\ngiven the sensitive nature of the personal data.\n20\n\nFurther, the nature of the Organisation’s services is a relevant factor to\n\nbe taken into consideration. In Re Credit Counselling Singapore, the\nCommissioner observed that “… it is foreseeable that there will be risks of\n\n13\n\nRe Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [28].\n\n10\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\ninadvertent disclosure of sensitive personal data” where the organisation\n“routinely handles large volumes of sensitive financial personal data of\nindividuals”.14 In the present case, the Organisation is a law firm and the staff\nhandling conveyancing matters handle sensitive personal data on a day-to-day\nbasis and it was therefore foreseeable that there were risks of inadvertent\ndisclosure of sensitive personal data. Given the nature of the Organisation’s\nwork, the Organisation ought to be subject to a higher level of care and\nresponsibility for its clients’ personal data.\n21\n\nThe Commission released a Guide to Data Protection Impact\n\nAssessment which is intended to assist organisations interested in conducting\ndata protection risk assessments. The Commissioner encourages the\nOrganisation to carry out a data protection risk assessment on its conveyancing\ndepartment, which should help to identify and address the specific risks that\nexists in its operational processes. This will assist the Organisation to put in\nplace effective risk mitigation measures.\n22\n\nGiven the Commissioner's findings above that the Organisation did not\n\nput in place adequate security arrangements to protect the personal data of its\nclients, it is hereby concluded that the Organisation was in breach of the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n14\n\nRe Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at [32].\n\n11\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nIssue (c): Whether the Organisation has complied with its Openness Obligation\nunder Section 12 of the PDPA\n(i) The Organisation did not implement any policies or practices to protect\npersonal data\n23\n\nThe investigations revealed that the Organisation did not put any\n\npolicies or practices in place to protect personal data. In Re Furnituremart.sg,\nthe Commissioner decided that “the lack of a written policy is a big drawback\nto the protection of personal data … Having a written policy is conducive to the\nconduct of internal training, which is a necessary component of an internal data\nprotection programme”.15 The Organisation’s claim that internal briefings were\nconducted to raise staff awareness were unsubstantiated by any supporting\nevidence. Nevertheless, even if verbal briefings were indeed given, this in itself\nwould not be sufficient for the Organisation to discharge its obligations under\nsection 12 of the PDPA. In general, an organisation should have some form of\nwritten policy or practice in place in relation to protecting personal data\nespecially if the process is complex or if the organisation frequently deals with\nsensitive personal data on a daily basis. A well-drafted written policy has the\nadvantage over verbal instruction of being a resource that can generally be\nsubsequently relied upon to provide clarity about the appropriate procedures and\ncontrols to employees and help minimize the chance for any misunderstanding\nor miscommunication. This may take the form of written standard operating\nprocedures in dealing with personal data which would set out the operational\nprocess of how employees should deal with personal data to prevent data\nprotection breaches. For example, a process which implements the suggestion\nset out at paragraph 15 above may be set out in the form of a standard operating\nprocedure.\n\n15\n\nRe Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [14].\n\n12\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n24\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nBased on the above, given that the Organisation had not developed and\n\nimplemented policies and practices that are necessary to protect personal data,\nit is the conclusion of the Commissioner that the Organisation is in breach of\nthe Openness Obligation under section 12 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations\n25\n\nThe Organisation, by way of email dated 3 January 2019, requested that\n\nthe imposition of financial penalty amount be removed or that the amount be\nreduced. In this regard, the Organisation made the following representations:\n(a)\n\nthe disclosure was not a deliberate act on the part of the\n\nOrganisation or any of its staff;\n(b)\n\nthe incidents related to one single conveyancing case involving\n\n2 individuals;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation waived all legal costs and expenses incurred in\n\nthe matter in which it advised the Complainant;\n(d)\n\nthe information disclosed is generally regarded as sensitive but\n\nthat it had absolutely no interest to the recipient; and\n(e)\n\nthe unauthorised disclosure was not due to lack of supervision\n\nand it was not possible to check all email addresses every time there is\nan email to be sent out. The staff member who committed the error was\n50 years old and probably has long-sightedness. The staff was not in the\nemail thread and so she could not have copied the email address from\nthe header of prior emails to the client. The said staff has since left the\nOrganisation’s employment.\n\n13\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n26\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nThe Commissioner in deciding to impose a financial penalty and on the\n\nappropriate quantum of the financial penalty had already taken into\nconsideration the issues raised by the Organisation and as set out at paragraph\n25(a) to (c) above.\n27\n\nWith regard to the issue raised by the Organisation and set out at\n\nparagraph 25(d), the Commissioner notes that the Organisation agrees that the\ninformation disclosed in these incidents is sensitive.\n28\n\nWith regard to the issue raised by the Organisation and set out at\n\nparagraph 25(e) above, the basis for the finding of a breach of the Organisation’s\nobligation under section 24 of the PDPA was that the Organisation failed to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements. In this regard, the Commissioner\ndoes not expect organisations to check the email addresses every time there is\nan email to be sent out. However, as explained above at paragraph 15, the\nOrganisation ought to have implemented a considered process to verify that\nemails are correctly addressed to the intended recipient – the Organisation did\nnot adduce any evidence of such a considered process. Nevertheless, the\nCommissioner has decided on compassionate grounds to reduce the quantum of\nthe financial penalty set out in the preliminary decision issued to the\nOrganisation, given that the staff who committed the error was advanced in age\nand long-sighted.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n29\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue\n\ndirections as it thinks fit in the circumstances. This may include directing the\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$ 1\nmillion as the Commissioner thinks fit.\n\n14\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n30\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nthe Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account the\nOrganisation’s dilatory conduct during investigations. It had been neither\ncooperative nor forthcoming in its responses to the Notice to Require Production\nof Documents and Information (“NTP”) issued by the Commissioner as part of\nits investigations. The Organisation took a month to respond to the first NTP\nand second NTP despite being sent reminders by the Commissioner on several\noccasions:\n(a)\n\nThe first NTP was sent on 12 December 2017 with a deadline to\n\nrespond by 22 December 2017. The Organisation failed to meet the\ndeadline and only on 2 January 2018, more than a week after the expiry\nof the deadline, did the Organisation write requesting for an extension\nof time to respond. The extension sought was up to 4 January 2018. The\nOrganisation was granted an extension of time to respond by 10 January\n2018. The organisation finally responded on 11 January 2018.\n(b)\n\nThe 2nd NTP was sent on 22 January 2018 requiring the\n\nOrganisation to respond by 1 February 2018. The Organisation again\nfailed to meet the deadline and did not even request for an extension of\ntime to respond. The investigating officer had to call the Organisation\non 6 February 2018 to ask the Organisation why it had failed to respond\nto the 2nd NTP within the deadline. During this conversation, the\nOrganisation requested for an extension of time of the deadline. The\ninvestigating officer informed the Organisation that she would issue a\nreminder with a deadline to respond by 15 February 2018. The reminder\nwas issued on 7 February 2018. The Organisation failed to comply with\nthis new deadline. In fact, no correspondence from the Organisation was\nreceived even by 20 February 2018. On 20 February, the investigating\n\n15\n\n\fMatthew Chiong Partnership\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 7\n\nofficer called the Organisation as a further reminder. Only after this did\nthe Organisation respond to the 2nd NTP on 23 February 2018.\n31\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$8,000 within 30\ndays from the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest, at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n32\n\nIn addition, the Commissioner hereby issues the following directions to\n\nthe Organisation:\n(a)\n\nto implement a data protection policy and internal guidelines or\n\nstandard operating procedures to comply with the obligations under the\nPDPA;\n(b)\n\nfor all employees of the Organisation handling personal data to\n\nattend a training course on the obligations under the PDPA and the\nOrganisation’s data protection policies; and\n(c)\n\nto complete the above directions within 60 days from the date of\n\nthis decision and inform the office of the Commissioner of the\ncompletion thereof within one week of implementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n16\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to PAP Community Foundation for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Education","Pre-school kindergarten","senior care"],"date":"2019-04-23","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---PAP-Community-Foundation---230419.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by PAP Community Foundation","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/04/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-pap-community-foundation","timestamp":"2019-04-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\nCase No DP-1807-B2434\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nPAP Community Foundation\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fPAP Community Foundation\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1807-B2434\n\n23 April 2019\nBackground\n1\n\nThe Organisation provides a range of services, including pre-school\n\nkindergarten services and senior care services. The central issue to this case, in\nso far as it is related to the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), is\nwhether the Organisation had made reasonable security arrangements to protect\nthe personal data of the students and students’ parents that it had in its\npossession and control at the material time.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nOne of the many preschools under the Organisation’s management is the\n\nSparkletots @ Kampong Chai Chee centre (the “preschool”). In the course of\nthe year, the preschool would organise various school trips, sometimes with the\nparticipation of the parents. In preparation for these trips, the preschool would\ncollect the parents’ personal data (including NRIC numbers) to allow for\nverification of the parents’ identity on the day of the trip.\n3\n\nThe present investigations arise from one such school trip. A few days\n\nbefore the trip was scheduled to take place, a teacher at the preschool sent a\nphotograph of a consolidated attendance list to a “WhatsApp” chat group,\n\n\fPAP Community Foundation\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\n\nreminding parents of the upcoming school trip. The attendance list contained\npersonal data relating to the 15 students in that particular class and their parents,\nand included the contact numbers and NRIC numbers of five of the parents (the\n“Personal Data”). The “WhatsApp” chat group comprised of the parents of\nstudents from that class.\n4\n\nThe teacher who sent the photograph of the attendance list quickly\n\ndeleted it after being alerted to the disclosure of personal data by one of the\nparents within the group chat. That same parent later lodged a complaint with\nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”). The PDPC thereafter\ncommenced investigations into the incident.\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nThe Relevant PDPA Provisions\n5\n\nIn respect of this matter, the relevant provision is section 24 of the\n\nPDPA. Section 24 requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\nPreliminary Issues\n6\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data is “personal data” as defined in\n\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA. There is no question or dispute that the Organisation\nfalls within PDPA’s definition of an “organisation”. There is also no dispute\nthat the Personal Data was, at all material times, in the Organisation’s\npossession and under their control and that the Organisation was responsible for\nthe Personal Data.\n2\n\n\fPAP Community Foundation\n\n7\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\n\nThe key issue is therefore whether the Organisation had protected the\n\nPersonal Data in its possession and under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access and similar risks.\nThe Organisation failed to make reasonable security arrangements\n8\n\nAfter a review of all the evidence obtained by PDPC during its\n\ninvestigation and for the reasons set out below, I am of the view that the\nOrganisation had failed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in its possession and control, and has thereby breached the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. This breach is attributable\nprimarily to the Organisation’s lack of specific policies or procedures in place\nto guide its employees on the use, handling and disclosure of personal data,\nespecially in the context of communicating with parents.\n9\n\nIt bears noting that “security arrangements”, as envisaged in section 24\n\nof the PDPA, encompass physical, technical and administrative measures to\nprotect personal data. Such measures include data protection policies and\nprocedures that employees must comply with in the course of their work.\n“Reasonable” in section 24 implies that the security arrangements in place are\ncommensurate with the nature and volume of the personal data that the\norganisation possesses and/or controls.\n10\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation has about 360 Sparkletots Centres with\n\nabout 43,000 children enrolled. By the very nature of its kindergarten/ preschool\nbusiness, the Organisation collects, possesses, and handles a significant amount\nof personal data of minors and parents alike. The everyday frequency of\ninteraction between its staff and the parents of the children under the\nOrganisation’s care indicates also that specific policies or training would\n\n3\n\n\fPAP Community Foundation\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\n\nreasonably be expected to be put in place in order to guide staff on the PDPA\nobligations that will undoubtedly be engaged during their day to day activities.\nIn the course of their work, the Organisation’s staff are more likely than not to\nbe placed in situations where the use and disclosure of personal data is crucial\nto the discharge of their duties, as it was with the case of obtaining consent for\nand organising the school trip in question.\n11\n\nThe Organisation has admitted that it did not have such specific policies\n\nor procedures in place to guide its employees on the use and disclosure of\npersonal data in their communications with the parents of students enrolled at\nthe organisations preschools. While it had a Data Protection Notice, this was a\ndocument that was intended to provide general information about how the\nOrganisation handles personal data. It was meant for an external audience. It\nwas not intended to provide detailed guidance to its teaching and other staff on\nhow they should handle personal data in the course of their work. Since the\nOrganisation handles personal data of its students and their parents, the\nomission to provide detailed guidance to its teaching and other staff is an\nobvious gap in its security arrangements. To my mind, the Organisation needs\nto provide guidance to its employees in the area of communications and\ntransmission of documents containing personal data, such as via messaging\napplications. The absence of such policies and procedures meant that the\nOrganisation had little assurance that its employees were consistently\nperforming their duties in a PDPA-compliant manner. This falls short of the\nstandard of “reasonable security arrangements”.\n12\n\nThat said, the Organisation had provided PDPA training to its employees\n\nat the preschool, including the teacher who had disclosed the attendance list.\nWhile PDPA training raises employees’ awareness of their obligations, this\nserves as a useful illustration that mere training alone cannot be a substitute for\n\n4\n\n\fPAP Community Foundation\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\n\ndata protection policies and procedures in specific areas. Reasonable assurance\nagainst such incidents requires instituting and enforcing proper policies and\nprocedures within an organisation, with training sessions acting as the medium\nto communicate such policies.\n13\n\nBased on the foregoing, I find that the Organisation has breached the\n\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\nConclusion\n14\n\nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, I am empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation\nsuch directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n15\n\nIn determining the appropriate directions to be imposed on The\n\nOrganisation, I have taken into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThe teacher in question acted swiftly in removing the Personal\n\nData from the “WhatsApp” group; and\n(b)\n\nThe number of individuals impacted by the disclosure (15\n\nstudents and 30 parents) was relatively small and the disclosure was\nconstrained to the group of parents to whom the Personal Data pertained\nto.\n16\n\nTo its credit, the Organisation also acted swiftly to address their\n\ninadequate policies – a response which, in my assessment, carries mitigating\nvalue. The following remedial actions taken by the Organisation have therefore\nbeen taken into account:\n\n5\n\n\fPAP Community Foundation\n\n(a)\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 6\n\nImmediate suspension of all “WhatsApp” chat groups following\n\nthe disclosure;\n(b)\n\nExpedited the implementation of a set of “Social Media Policy /\n\nWhatsapp chat group rules” that was already under development when\nthe breach occurred;\n(c)\n\nRolled out a suite of other policies across the Organisation\n\nincluding a “Document Retention Policy” and an “Information Security\nPolicy”; and\n(d)\n\nUndertook the development of a practical employee handbook\n\nand conducted refresher training for its employees.\n17\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of the case, I am of the view\n\nthat these remedial actions have sufficiently addressed the current gap in\npolicies and practices relating to the handling of personal data by the\nOrganisation’s employees. I have therefore decided to issue a warning to the\nOrganisation for breaching its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA,\nwithout further directions or imposing a financial penalty.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Tutor City for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised access of individuals’ personal data stored in web directories.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Education","Tuition"],"date":"2019-04-23","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Tutor-City-230419.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Tutor City","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-tutor-city","timestamp":"2019-04-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\nCase No DP-1806-B2228\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTutor City\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fTutor City\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1806-B2228\n\n23 April 2019\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nAs more organisations conduct business over the Internet, the volume and sensitivity\n\nof personal data collected online likewise increases. This case shows that when collecting\ndocuments containing personal data via a website, organisations should have in place\nreasonable security arrangements in the form of access controls to prevent unauthorised access\nto these documents to third parties. In particular, organisations should ensure that these\ndocuments are not unwittingly saved in folders that are accessible by the public.\n\n2\n\nOn 8 June 2018, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint from an individual (the “Complainant”) in relation to the publication of\npersonal data belonging to 50 individuals on the Organisation’s website, www.tutorcity.com.sg\n(the “Website”). Specifically, images of the educational certificates of tutors using the Website\nwere found to be publicly accessible by Internet users (the “Incident”).\n\n3\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, I found the Organisation in breach of section\n\n24 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). I set out below my findings and grounds\nof decision based on the investigations carried out in this matter.\n\nMaterial Facts\n\nThe Website\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation is registered and managed by its sole proprietor (the “Sole\n\nProprietor”). Through the Website, the Organisation provides matching services between\n\n\fTutor City\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\nfreelance tutors and its prospective clients (e.g. parents of students).\n\n5\n\nThe Website lists freelance tutors and provides access to information about their\n\neducational qualifications, past experience and contact details. Freelance tutors agree to make\nsuch of their information publicly available and searchable on the Website when they sign on\nfor the service. The Website also provides an interested student or her parent to request for\nadditional educational details from a tutor that they have identified. In order to provide this\nfeature, tutors could upload their educational certificates onto the Website. The intention was\nfor the tutor to approve each request to view their educational certificates, and by dint of this\nworkflow, there was no intention to make the educational certificates publicly available or\nsearchable outside the Website. The optional nature of this feature explains the low number of\ntutors who were affected, viz 50 tutors out of a total of 13,283 tutors registered on the Website.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation had instructed a freelance web developer to design and develop the\n\nWebsite. Upon its completion in 2011, the Website was handed over to the Organisation and\nuploaded to a hosting server. It is admitted by the Sole Proprietor that:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation has been the sole party in charge of the Website after the\nhandover;\n\n(b)\n\nthe developer did not process any personal data on the Organisation’s behalf for\nthe development of the Website; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe developer did not have any further involvement in the Website after it was\nhanded over to the Organisation.\n\nThe Incident\n\n7\n\nAs part of the Website’s features, tutors interested in using the Organisation’s matching\n\nservice are given the option of voluntarily uploading up to three different educational\ncertificates onto the Website. These certificates assisted the Organisation in matching the needs\nof the student in question to suitable tutors. These certificates were not intended to be made\npublicly accessible.\n\n8\n\nNotwithstanding this, all uploaded certificates were stored in the /Public_html/directory\n\n3\n\n\fTutor City\n(the\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\n“Public\n\nDirectory”)\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nWebsite’s\n\nserver\n\nwithin\n\na\n\nsub-folder,\n\nPublic_html\\tutor\\tutor_image (the “Image Directory”). Both directories were not secured\nwith any form of access controls and were accessible by the public so long as the path to the\nrelevant directory was known.\n\n9\n\nInvestigations also revealed that the certificates were indexed by search engines like\n\nGoogle due to the lack of any measures taken to prevent automatic indexing of the Image\nDirectory by web crawlers. This resulted in them showing up as search results on Google.\n\n10\n\nThe Incident resulted in the disclosure of the following types of personal data of 50\n\nindividual tutors:\n\n11\n\n(a)\n\nname of the individual;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\neducational institution the individual attended; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe grades the individual attained for each subject.\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took the following steps to prevent\n\nits reoccurrence:\n\n(a)\n\nit added a .htaccess file to the Image Directory that would restrict access to only\nthe administrator; and\n\n(b)\n\nit deleted all the images stored in the Image Directory as of 8 June 2018.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n12\n\nThe issue for determination is whether the Organisation breached section 24 of the\n\nPDPA. Section 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n\n4\n\n\fTutor City\n13\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\nAs a preliminary point, I note that the Organisation, being the sole administrator of the\n\nWebsite, retained full possession and control over the personal data that the Website collected\nat all material times. Although a developer was previously engaged for website development,\nthe Sole Proprietor admitted that the developer did not process any personal data on behalf of\nthe Organisation. Accordingly, the developer was not a data intermediary and the Organisation\nretained full responsibility for the IT security of the Website as well as the personal data\ncontained therein.\n\n14\n\nNotwithstanding that the Organisation retained full responsibility over the Website’s\n\nsecurity, other than instructing the developer to “make it safe”, the Organisation had paid little\nto no attention to the security of the Website. In this regard, the Sole Proprietor had provided\nthe following statement:\nFrom year 2011 to current, I did not implement any additional security measures\nto the website or its web directories as I am not tech-savvy and the current\nwebsite had fulfilled my business needs. Therefore, even though the Personal\nData Protection Act took effect in year 2014, I did not review my website to see\nif its security settings and measures are sufficient to protect the personal data of\nthe tutors that had registered in my website. I did not think there was a need to\nreview my website as I thought that Tutor City is a small business and no one\nwould hack my website.\nAs for the security measures for the web directory, I do not have the knowledge\nof the exact settings or measures taken as I had pointed out earlier that I am not\ntech-savvy. When I commission the web developer to design the website, I gave\nhim the business requirements and just told him to make it safe. I did not\nquestion on what sort of technical measures were to be used for the website.\nBefore the website was uploaded to the hosting server, I did some testing on\nwhether the features of the website were working correctly as intended but the\ntesting was from a functionality angle and not to examine the security of the\nwebsite. I wish to state that I am not aware of how the folders in the web\ndirectory are protected.\n15\n\nWhile the Website was developed and handed over to the Organisation before the\n\nPDPA came into force on 2 July 2014 (the “Appointed Day”), the Organisation continued to\nuse the Website to collect personal data after the Appointed Day. As such, it was incumbent\non the Organisation to take proactive steps to comply with its obligations under the PDPA. The\nfollowing passage in Re Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 (at [11]) is instructive:\n\nThis means that, for example, if there were no security arrangements previously\nto protect the existing personal data the organisation was holding, the\n5\n\n\fTutor City\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\norganisation has a positive duty to put in place security arrangements after the\nAppointed Day. It was not enough for the organisation to leave things status\nquo, if this would not enable the organisation to meet the requirements and\nstandards of the Protection Obligation. As provided in Section 24 of the PDPA,\nthe security arrangements must be “reasonable”.\n\n16\n\nIn this regard, as can be seen from paragraph 14 above, no steps were taken after the\n\nAppointed Day by the Organisation or the Sole Proprietor to review the standard of security of\nthe Website. The facts demonstrate that, prior to the Incident, the Organisation did not attempt\nto equip itself with knowledge of its data protection obligations under the PDPA. As mentioned\nabove, the Organisation showed a lack of knowledge of the security arrangements over its\nWebsite. It did not:\n\n(a)\n\ncommunicate any specific security requirements to its developer to protect the\npersonal data stored on the Website’s server, including instructing the developer\nto ensure that the uploaded certificates would not be accessible to the public;\n\n(b)\n\nmake reasonable effort to find out and understand the security measures\nimplemented by its developer for the Website;\n\n(c)\n\nattempt to verify that security measures to “make [the Website] safe” were\nindeed implemented by its developer; and\n\n(d)\n\nconduct any reasonable security testing (e.g. penetration tests).\n\nThese demonstrate a fundamental lack of care by the Organisation over the personal data in its\npossession and/or under its control.\n\n17\n\nRelated to the above, I note that the Sole Proprietor’s vague comment to its developer\n\nto make the Website safe does not constitute a security measure. The Organisation could not\nhave reasonably expected its developer to implement security measures that were adequate for\nthe Organisation’s purposes merely based on the Sole Proprietor’s vague comment. The\ndeveloper would not have known that the Organisation intended to protect the tutors’\ncertificates from public access without the Organisation specifying this requirement.\n\n18\n\nWhile this palpable lack of detail may have been the norm before the Appointed Date,\n\nthis is surely not the standard after the Appointed Date. The standard that is expected from\norganisations contracting professional services to build their corporate websites or other online\n6\n\n\fTutor City\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\nportal is articulated in the Guide to Building Websites for SMEs. The Organisation ought to\nhave reviewed the standard of security that had been implemented on the Website after the\nAppointed Date. In doing so, it should have delved into some degree of detail by providing its\ndeveloper the intended use cases and identifying risks and abuse that it can foresee. These do\nnot require deep technical knowledge but do require that the Organisation has an understanding\nof how the Website will be used by itself and its customers. Had it reviewed the security\nstandard implemented on the Website, it would have realised that all the certificates provided\nby the tutors were accessible publicly, when this was not the intention. The Sole Proprietor’s\nclaim that he lacked IT knowledge or tech-savviness is also not a defence against the\nOrganisation’s failure to take any steps to comply with the Protection Obligation.\n\n19\n\nAs observed in the Guide to Building Websites for SMEs at [5.5] to [5.6]:\n\n5.5\n\nSecurity Configuration Management\n\n5.5.1 Organisations should ensure, or require their vendor(s) to ensure, that\nthe software and hardware components of the organisation’s website are\nproperly configured to prevent unauthorised access. This includes reviewing\noperating systems, checking if appropriate antivirus/anti-malware software are\nin place and setting firewall rules to only allow authorised traffic. The\nconfiguration of each component should also be fully documented, kept up to\ndate, and reviewed regularly.\n5.5.2 There should also be a plan for testing and applying patches and updates\nfor the website’s software and hardware components. This includes having a\nprocess and person responsible to monitor new patches and updates that become\navailable.\n5.6 Security Testing\n5.6.1 Testing the website for security vulnerabilities is an important aspect of\nensuring the security of the website. Penetration testing or vulnerability\nassessments should be conducted prior to making the website accessible to the\npublic, as well as on a periodical basis (e.g. annually). Any discovered\nvulnerabilities should be reviewed and promptly fixed to prevent data breaches.\n5.6.2 Where organisations have outsourced the development of its website, they\nshould require the IT vendor(s) to conduct the above security testing. As a\nbaseline, organisations may wish to consider using the Open Web Application\nSecurity Project (OWASP) Testing Guide and the OWASP Application\nSecurity Verification Standard (ASVS) to verify that security requirements for\nthe website have been met.\n[Emphasis added.]\n7\n\n\fTutor City\n\n20\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\nThe same guide goes on to add, amongst others, at [6.2.1], that:\nAccess control is a critical part of the website’s security arrangements. An\neffective access control scheme should be designed such that:\n\n\n\n21\n\nOnly authorised users (usually staff of the organisation) are allowed to\naccess the website’s administrative functions and personal data handled\nby the website…\nAll users should only be able to see the website functions and data that\nthey are allowed to access…\n\nIn the present case, I am advised that where documents containing personal data have\n\nto reside on web servers, folder or directory permissions and access controls are a common and\ndirect way of preventing their unauthorised access by public users and web crawlers.\nDepending on its circumstances, the Organisation could therefore have implemented any of the\nfollowing reasonable technical security measures to prevent its Image Directory from being\nindexed by web crawlers:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the Organisation could have placed these documents in a folder of a nonpublic folder/directory. Access to such documents will then be controlled by the\nserver’s administrator. While this may not be ideal in complex servers with\nmultiple web applications — given that it may not be practicable for the server\nadministrator to control access to all these files — this is not the case for the\npresent Website.\n\n(b)\n\nSecond, the Organisation could have placed these documents in a folder of a\nnon-public folder or directory, with access to these documents being through\nweb applications on the server. This could be done through PHP scripts. To\naccess the data in the documents, users would have to first log into the web\napplication.\n\n(c)\n\nThird, the Organisation could have placed these documents in a sub-folder\nwithin the Public Directory but control access to files by creating a .htaccess file\nwithin that sub-folder. This .htaccess file may specify the access restrictions\n(e.g. implement a password requirement or an IP address restriction). An\n\n8\n\n\fTutor City\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\nindex.html file could also be created within that sub-folder to show a HTML\npage with no content or a denial of access message. Any unauthorised user\nwould then need the specific URL to access a document in the sub-folder.\nHowever, given that the Public Directory is the web root directory containing\nall the content to be displayed on the Website, it should not have overly\nrestrictive access rights. This may pose some challenges for organisations\nseeking to balance access restrictions to specific documents against retaining\naccessibility to website content that is intended to be public.\n\n22\n\nIt is up to each organisation to determine which security arrangements are the most\n\nsuitable for its purposes, taking into account factors such as sensitivity of the personal data,\nsize of the database and operational realities. The above are merely three potential technical\nsecurity measures that organisations may implement to protect personal data.\n\n23\n\nOn an even more basic level, the Organisation could, and should, have done proper\n\nhousekeeping to ensure that all its Website’s publicly accessible folders did not contain files\nthat are not meant to be publicly disclosed. Investigations disclosed that from the handover up\ntill the occurrence of the Incident, the Organisation did not carry out any further updates or\ndevelop new security features for the Website. Although this did not contribute, in this case, to\nthe Incident, it is nevertheless a separate breach of the Protection Obligation. I cannot\nemphasise enough the importance of putting in place maintenance processes to ensure regular\nsecurity patching as a security measure; regular archival of old data will also reduce the size of\nany breach that may arise and is therefore also an important aspect of the Protection Obligation.\nData protection threats are constantly evolving and patching is one of the common tasks that\nall IT system owners are required to perform in order to keep their security measures current\nagainst external threats.1\n24\n\nBesides the above, I note that the Organisation had taken the view that the security of\n\nthe Website did not need to be reviewed because the Sole Proprietor did not think that it would\nbe hacked. I would like to make it clear that the low likelihood of being hacked is not an\nacceptable reason for the failure to comply with the Protection Obligation. An organisation is\nrequired to put in place security arrangements to protect personal data in its possession or\n1\n\nSee also Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte. Ltd. [2017] SGPDPC 12 and Re Cellar Door Pte Ltd [2016]\nSGPDPC 22.\n\n9\n\n\fTutor City\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 5\n\ncontrol whether or not they believe that there is a likelihood of being hacked on the basis that\nthey are small organisations.\n25\n\nIt is erroneous to think that the cyber security risk exposure of a business is\n\ncommensurate with its business size. According to the Singapore Cyber Landscape 2017 issued\nby the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, almost 40% of the cyberattacks reported to\nSingCERT in 2017 targeted small medium enterprises (“SMEs”).2 A more recent study\nreleased in January 2019 by Chubb and YouGov has revealed that many SMEs in Singapore\nunderestimate their exposure to cyber risks, and the existence of “a significant gap between the\nhard reality of cyber risk and how well small companies are prepared to deal with it”.3.\nCrucially, the same study observes that:\n\n... it is becoming increasingly likely that if an SME has a security\nweakness, it will be targeted sooner rather than later. This is why, for\ncyber criminals, these businesses are the proverbial “low-hanging fruit”.\nNot only are they easy targets, they also offer a substantial cumulative\npayoff. In fact, SMEs, with their low or no investment in cyber security\nmeasures, are actually the ideal, and subsequently the most common\ntarget for online crimes.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n26\n\nIn the same vein, and as illustrated by the Incident as well as our previous decisions,\n\ndata protection threats may not always come in the form of hacking incidents – the lack of\naccess controls4, which is something inherently within the Organisation’s powers to\nimplement, system design errors5 and human error6 can similarly lead to a personal data breach\nincident. Organisations should therefore not take the security of their website for granted\nsimply because of the smaller scale of their businesses.\n\n2\n\nhttps://www.csa.gov.sg/~/media/csa/documents/publications/singaporecyberlandscape2017.pdf\nOut of the 300 SMEs in Singapore polled, 63% believed themselves to be less vulnerable than larger\ncompanies, yet 56% had experienced a cyber error or attack in the past 12 months; https://www.chubb.com/sgen/_assets/documents/chubb-sg-sme-cyber-preparedness-report.pdf\n4\nSee, for example, Re Dimsum Property Pte.

The Organisation is therefore in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. I took\ninto account the number of affected individuals, the type of personal data at risk of unauthorised\naccess and the remedial action by the Organisation to prevent recurrence. I have decided to\nissue a warning to the Organisation for the breach of its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA as neither further directions nor a financial penalty is warranted in this case.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $15,000 was imposed on COURTS for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its customers from unauthorised disclosure on its online portal.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade","Furniture","Electronics"],"date":"2019-01-22","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---COURTS---220119.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by COURTS","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/01/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-courts","timestamp":"2019-01-22","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 4\nCase No DP-1707-B0917\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\nCOURTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n[2019] SGPDPC 4\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1707-B0917\n22 January 2019\nBackground\n1\n\nOn 9 July 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a complaint from a customer (“Complainant”) of\nCOURTS\n\n(Singapore)\n\nPte\n\nLtd\n\n(“COURTS”)\n\nstating\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nhttp://www.courts.com.sg website (“Website”) was “unsafe for customers”.\nThe Complainant discovered that by entering his name and e-mail address on\nCOURTS’ Guest Login (“Guest Login Page”) for the purpose of making a\npurchase, the Website would automatically open another webpage (“Guest\nCheckout Page”) disclosing the Complainant’s contact number and address\n(the “Incident”).\n2\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found\n\nCOURTS in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Website is owned and managed by COURTS, a leading consumer\n\nelectronics and furniture retailer in Singapore with a network of 80 stores\nnationwide. Ebee Global Solutions Pvt Ltd (“Ebee”) was an IT vendor engaged\nby COURTS to develop and maintain the Guest Login Page and Guest Checkout\nPage (“Guest Checkout System”) that was part of the Website. At the material\n\n2\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\ntime, the process flow when a customer wished to make a purchase through the\nGuest Login Page was as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe customer accesses the Website and selects an item to “Add\n\nto cart” before selecting “Proceed to checkout”;\n(b)\n\nThe customer may choose to log into his COURTS’ HomeClub\n\naccount or he may choose to “Checkout as guest user”;\n(c)\n\nIf the customer chooses to check out as a guest user, he enters\n\nhis name and email address and selects “Login as guest”; and\n(d)\n\nAssuming that the customer has previously made a purchase\n\nthrough the Website using the same email address, the customer’s\ncontact number and residential address (collectively, the “Personal\nData Set”) will be displayed on the Guest Checkout Page.\n4\n\nInvestigations revealed that in relation to (c) above, the Personal Data\n\nSet would be displayed upon an exact match with the Email Address the\ncustomer had used previously even if the name entered does not match the name\nthe customer used initially. In the circumstances, the customer’s email address\nwas the sole login credential as the “Name” field did not serve any security\npurpose; access to the Guest Checkout System was not conditional on linking\nthe input entered into the “Name” field with the customer’s email address.\n5\n\nThe Guest Checkout System was launched on 21 April 2014. Data\n\ncollected from the Guest Checkout System was stored in COURTS’ database\nhosted on the Amazon Web Services server (“AWS Server”). The database\ncontained customers’ email addresses, contact numbers and residential\naddresses.\n\n3\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n6\n\nAs at 9 July 2017, COURTS confirmed that a total of 14,104 Personal\n\nData Sets were stored in COURTS’ database hosted on the AWS Server. The\nPersonal Data Sets belonged to either COURTS’ HomeClub customers or to\ncustomers who had made a purchase using the Guest Checkout System since 21\nApril 2014.\n7\n\nCOURTS took the following remedial actions after it was notified of the\n\nIncident:\n(a)\n\nOn 30 August 2017, COURTS launched a new Website with a\n\nnew Guest Checkout System in place. No data is stored for future use\nduring the new guest checkout process. Customers using the new Guest\nCheckout System are required to key in their personal data each time a\npurchase is made. The Guest Checkout Page would not populate the\nPersonal Data Set even if the same customer had previously made a\npurchase.\n(b)\n\nOn 30 September 2017, COURTS’ database containing the\n\nPersonal Data Sets hosted on the AWS Server was decommissioned;\n(c)\n\nCOURTS engaged a PDPA consultant to conduct PDPA\n\ntrainings for its support centre and operation groups, and scheduled a\nfull audit on COURTS’ processes; and\n(d)\n\nCOURTS put in place additional security measures, such as\n\nadopting a policy for penetration tests to be performed at least once\nevery 6 months on the new Website.\n\n4\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data Set is “personal data” as defined\n\nin section 2(1) of the PDPA. There is also no dispute that the PDPA applies to\nCOURTS as it falls within PDPA’s definition of “organisation”. The issue to be\ndetermined by the Commissioner in this case is whether COURTS had complied\nwith its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether COURTS complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n9\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. It is not disputed\nthat COURTS had possession and/or control of the Personal Data Sets stored in\nCOURTS’ database, and hosted on the AWS Server. In this regard, COURTS\nconfirmed that Ebee did not have the login credentials to COURTS’ database.\nIts arrangement with Ebee was in the nature of a software development\nrelationship. While the scope of the contract with Ebee covered the maintenance\nof the Guest Checkout System, in reality, maintenance was not carried out.\nCOURTS did not engage Ebee to operate the database or perform any form of\nprocessing activities on the Personal Data Sets and as such, Ebee was not a data\nintermediary.\n10\n\nThe investigations found that COURTS failed to put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Personal Data Sets for the following\nreasons:\n(a)\n\nEmail addresses are readily shared by individuals and searchable\n\non various public platforms. The use of an email address as the sole login\n\n5\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\ncredential on the Guest Login Page resulting in disclosure of the\nPersonal Data Set on the Guest Checkout Page fell short of the standard\nof protection required to prevent unauthorised access. As has been held\nin Re ABR Holdings Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 16, it is not acceptable to use\ncommonly used identifiers to retrieve personal data. The intention to\nmake the user experience smooth for returning guest shoppers without a\nHomeClub account was laudable but quite unacceptable as it poses a risk\nto customers. The entry of an email address was sufficient to retrieve the\nassociated contact number and address that had been stored in the\ndatabase. This amounted to a failure to protect personal data of returning\ncustomers that falls below the standard expected under the PDPA.\n(b)\n\nThere was a glaring failure by COURTS to adequately consider\n\ndata protection with respect to the Guest Checkout System of the\nWebsite. Although the Website and Guest Checkout Page were launched\nbefore the PDPA came into force, COURTS failed to review their\nsystem design or process flow, or implement any internal security\npolicies in relation to data protection for the Website after the PDPA\ncame into force for the purpose of ensuring compliance. Additionally,\n(i)\n\nNo penetration tests were conducted since the launch of\n\nthe Website and the Guest Checkout Page on 21 April 2014;\n(ii)\n\nNo security scans were performed on the Website for a\n\nperiod of 12 months prior to the Incident; and\n(iii)\n\nNo maintenance of the Guest Checkout System had been\n\ncarried out since its launch on 21 April 2014.\n\n6\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n11\n\nCOURTS represented that it had scheduled training programmes in\n\nplace for all employees with respect to data protection obligations under the\nPDPA.\n(a)\n\nNew employees are required to go through tailored PDPA\n\ntraining specific to their job scopes during on-boarding; and\n(b)\n\nPDPA refresher training is conducted for all employees, with the\n\nmost recent one being in February 2017.\n12\n\nWhile data protection training has an impact on the proper\n\nimplementation of an organisation’s data protection policies and practices, these\ntraining measures are ineffective to deal with the system design and process\nflow deficiencies in the Website and cannot therefore amount to sufficient\nsecurity arrangement to protect against the unauthorised disclosure of the\nPersonal Data Sets. Admittedly, COURTS conceded that the disclosure of the\nPersonal Data Set on the Guest Checkout Page once an email address matched\nan existing customers’ record in COURTS’ database was “…an oversight on a\ndesign flaw that we were serving data unauthenticated”. It is inexcusable for an\nestablished organisation like COURTS to neglect its obligations to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data Sets. This\nresulted in the Personal Data Sets being exposed to risk of unauthorised\ndisclosure for more than 3 years1.\n13\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds COURTS in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\n1\n\n21 April 2014 to 30 August 2017.\n\n7\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n14\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that COURTS is in breach of section\n\n24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\nto issue COURTS such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA. This may include directing COURTS to pay a financial penalty of such\namount not exceeding S$1 million.\n15\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on COURTS in this case, the Commissioner took into account the\nfollowing aggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nGiven that email addresses are widely shared, use of an email\n\naddress as the sole login credential to protect against unauthorised\ndisclosure of the Personal Data Set was clearly not a reasonable security\narrangement;\n(b)\n\nCOURTS subjected the Personal Data Sets to risk of\n\nunauthorised disclosure for a substantial period of about 3 years; and\n(c)\n\nCOURTS displayed a lack of urgency and absence of initiative\n\nto obtain information in relation to the Incident.\n16\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nThere was limited risk of unauthorised disclosure because the\n\nPersonal Data Set would only be disclosed upon entry of a matching\nemail address used by COURTS’ HomeClub customers or previous\ncustomers who had made a purchase through the Guest Check Out\nSystem;\n8\n\n\fCOURTS (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n(b)\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest any actual loss or damage\n\nresulting from the Incident; and\n(c)\n\nCOURTS effected remedial actions upon being informed to\n\nimplement measures to prevent recurrences of the Incident and to\nincrease employee’s awareness of the PDPA.\n17\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs COURTS to pay a financial penalty of S$15,000.00 within 30\ndays from the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court2 in respect of judgment debts, shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n2\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n9\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $250,000 and $750,000 was imposed on SingHealth and IHiS respectively for the failure to make reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data of individuals.","tags":["Protection","Protection","Financial Penalty","Financial Penalty","Healthcare","Healthcare","Patient","Prescription"],"date":"2019-01-15","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---SingHealth-IHiS---150119.pdf","nature":"Protection, Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by SingHealth and IHiS","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/01/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-singhealth-and-ihis","timestamp":"2019-01-15","pdf-content":"COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n[2019] SGPDPC 3\nCase No DP-1807-B2435\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\n(1) Singapore Health Services Pte.\nLtd.

Ltd. & Ors.\n[2019] SGPDPC 3\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1807-B2435\n14 January 2019\n1\n\nThis case concerns the worst breach of personal data in Singapore’s history. In an\n\nunprecedented cyber attack on the Singapore Health Services Pte Ltd’s (“SingHealth”) patient\ndatabase system, the personal data of some 1.5 million patients and the outpatient prescription\nrecords of nearly 160,000 patients were exfiltrated in a cyber attack (the “Data Breach”).\n2\n\nFollowing the announcement on 20 July 2018 by the Ministry of Communications and\n\nInformation and the Ministry of Health (“MOH”), a four-member Committee of Inquiry\n(“COI”) was convened by the Minister for Communications and Information to look into the\ncyber attack, find out what went wrong and recommend ways to better safeguard critical\nsystems. The COI concluded its hearings and submitted its report on 31 December 2018 to the\nMinister-in-charge of Cyber Security. The public report of the COI’s findings was released on\n10 January 2019 (“Public COI Report”).\n3\n\nSoon after the announcement of the Data Breach, the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (the “Commission”) received several complaints from members of the public\nregarding the Data Breach. The Commission commenced its investigations thereafter\n(“Investigation”). The organisations involved were SingHealth and Integrated Health\nInformation Systems Pte Ltd (“IHiS”).\n4\n\nSingHealth and IHiS (collectively, the “Organisations”) agreed to cooperate with the\n\nCommission to expedite the Investigation and determination of liability and for the\nCommission to issue such directions that it deems fit on the basis of the Organisations’\nrepresentations. In this regard, the Organisations voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the\nfacts as set out in this Decision and accepted the Commissioner’s findings in this Decision.\n5\n\nThe Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision, which are based on the\n\nOrganisations’ representations, are set out below. Additionally, the Organisations have agreed\nto incorporate references to relevant sections of the Public COI Report relating to their\n1\n\n\frepresentations and the factual issues addressed therein. Accordingly, the Commissioner has\nreferred to some parts of the Public COI Report in the grounds of decision.\nMaterial Facts\n6\n\nThe following chronology and summary of admitted facts were provided by IHiS and\n\nSingHealth in its submissions. SingHealth is one of three healthcare clusters in the Singapore\npublic healthcare sector. In Singapore, public healthcare institutions (“PHIs”) are grouped into\nclusters (“Clusters”). IHiS and SingHealth are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MOH Holdings\nPte Ltd (“MOHH”), the holding company through which the Singapore government owns the\ncorporatised institutions in the public healthcare sector. MOH determines the policies and\nstructures within the healthcare sector.\n7\n\nThe SingHealth Cluster comprises Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), Changi\n\nGeneral Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, National\nCancer Centre, National Dental Centre Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore, National\nNeuroscience Institute, Singapore National Eye Centre, SingHealth Community Hospitals and\nSingHealth Polyclinics.1 SingHealth’s primary function is the provision of healthcare services.\n8\n\nIHiS is the central national IT agency for the public healthcare sector in Singapore. IHiS\n\nis also the MOH-designated Sector Lead for the healthcare sector for liaising with the Cyber\nSecurity Agency of Singapore (“CSA”). Prior to 2008, PHIs were responsible for their own IT\nfunctions and strategy. In July 2008, IHiS was established by MOH to centralise all of the IT\nfunctions and capabilities of the PHIs (including IT staff) in a single entity, which would\nsupport all the PHIs. IHiS also assumed responsibility for the development and maintenance\nof the Clusters’ IT systems (including SingHealth). The objectives of centralisation were to,\ninter alia: (i) enable better alignment of IT strategies and integration of patient care across\nPHIs, and (ii) reduce the cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in a varied and fragmented IT\nlandscape.\n9\n\nIT resources in the public healthcare sector were further consolidated in November\n\n2016, when MOHH’s Information Systems Division (“ISD”) was merged into IHiS. With this\nmerger, national healthcare systems which were originally managed by ISD came under IHiS’\n\n1 Polyclinics in Bedok, Bukit Merah, Marine Parade, Outram, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Sengkang and Tampines, as well as Bright\n\nVision Hospital. Two other polyclinics in Queenstown and Geylang used to be under SingHealth.\n\n2\n\n\fmanagement as well. Each Cluster, SingHealth not excepted, has a Group Chief Information\nOfficer (“GCIO”) and a Cluster Information Security Officer (“CISO”). Pursuant to the public\nhealthcare sector policy, Healthcare IT Security Policy and Standards (Version 3.0) (“IT-SPS”),\nthe GCIO provides leadership and direction for the Cluster’s IT security program, including\nthe establishment and maintenance of the program objectives, strategy, and near- and mediumterm activities such as aligning strategic IT initiatives with the Cluster’s business objectives.\nThe GCIO is assisted by the CISO, who is charged with security oversight for the Cluster. The\nCISO reports to the GCIO directly on security matters.\n10\n\nUpon the formation of IHiS in 2008, the employment of the majority of IT staff across\n\nthe Clusters at the time, including SingHealth, were transferred to IHiS. Since then, IHiS has\nbeen responsible for hiring and managing IT personnel at both the management and operational\nlevel for functions such as general management, maintenance and security management.\nHowever, IHiS designates some IT personnel to be redeployed to the Clusters to be responsible\nfor providing leadership and direction for the IT security program as well as executive\nmanagement oversight of the local Cluster IT systems. In the present case, the SingHealth\nGCIO and SingHealth CISO are employed by IHiS but deployed to SingHealth to serve the IT\nneeds of SingHealth. The staff of the SingHealth GCIO Office2 that supports the SingHealth\nGCIO and carries out, among other duties, operational and security oversight of SingHealth’s\nIT systems are also deployed by IHiS to SingHealth.3\n11\n\nGCIOs are accountable to their Clusters for the Chief Information Officer (“CIO”)\n\nservices they provide, such as IT capability development, systems resiliency and security. In\nSingHealth, the GCIO reports to SingHealth management via the SingHealth Deputy Group\nChief Executive Officer (Organisational Transformation and Informatics) (“DGCEO\n(OT&I)”). The SingHealth GCIO is also concurrently accountable to the Chief Executive\nOfficer (“CEO”) of IHiS for the quality of the CIO services provided to the Cluster.4\n12\n\nIHiS has a centralised Delivery Group which manages the day-to-day operations and\n\ntechnical support, maintenance and monitoring of the entire SingHealth IT system, including\n\n2\n\nThe SingHealth GCIO Office has a staff strength of 50 members who are IHiS employees.\nThe SingHealth GCIO Office is made up of staff deployed from IHiS who are mostly IT Directors from\nSingHealth’s institutions that carry out management oversight roles of the institutions’ IT operations.\n4\nThe CEO of IHiS sets the key performance indicators of the SingHealth GCIO and GCIO Office, namely\ncapability development, resiliency and cost effectiveness.\n3\n\n3\n\n\fthe Sunrise Clinical Manager system (“SCM”), as well as the other Clusters’ IT systems. The\nIHiS Delivery Group also covers the security aspects of the Clusters’ IT systems and plays a\nsupportive role in rolling out security measures. Within the IHiS Delivery Group, the Security\nManagement Department (“SMD”) covers a broad portfolio of IT security in the Clusters. The\nSingHealth GCIO Office relies on the IHiS Delivery Group for their technical expertise on\nsecurity and operational matters.\nSingHealth’s Electronic Medical Record system\n13\n\nSingHealth uses SCM, an Electronic Medical Record (“EMR”) software solution from\n\nAllscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc (“Allscripts”). Through SCM, there is a single enterprisewide EMR containing real-time patient data. SCM is vital to SingHealth’s operations and is\nactively used by SingHealth staff in patient care and management.\n14\n\nSCM was implemented by SingHealth in 1999. The IHiS Delivery Group took over the\n\nmanagement of SCM in 2008, when the IT team at SingHealth responsible for managing SCM\nwas transferred to IHiS. The SCM database contains patient medical records, including the\nfollowing types of personal data concerning SingHealth’s patients:\n(a)\n\npatient particulars (e.g. name, National Registration Identification Card\n\nnumbers (“NRIC”), address, gender, race and date of birth);\n(b)\n\nclinical episode information (e.g. A&E, inpatient, outpatient);\n\n(c)\n\norders (e.g. laboratory, radiology, cardiology, medication, nursing);\n\n(d)\n\nresults (e.g. of diagnostic tests and orders);\n\n(e)\n\nclinical documentation (e.g. from doctors, nurses, rehabilitation);\n\n(f)\n\nvital signs (e.g. blood pressure, pulse);\n\n(g)\n\nmedical alerts and allergies;\n\n(h)\n\ndiagnosis and health issues;\n\n(i)\n\nvaccination details;\n\n(j)\n\ndischarge summaries;\n4\n\n\f15\n\n(k)\n\nmedical certificates; and\n\n(l)\n\noutpatient medication dispensed (with associated patient demographics).\n\nAs of July 2018, the SCM database contained patient data of over 5.01 million unique\n\nindividuals.\n16\n\nThe SCM IT network is spread across two sectors:\n(a)\n\nthe SingHealth network, which includes infrastructure in the SingHealth\n\ncampus; and\n(b)\n\nthe Healthcare-Cloud (“H-Cloud”) at the Healthcare Data Centre (“HDC”). H-\n\nCloud was set up in 2014 by IHiS as part of a data centre consolidation exercise across\nthe PHIs as well as for IHiS to leverage cloud technologies in serving the PHIs.\n17\n\nBefore June 2017, the SCM system (which includes the Citrix servers hosting the SCM\n\nclient application and the SCM database servers) was located at SingHealth’s SGH campus.\nThe Citrix servers serve as middleware (i.e. the bridging between an operating system or\ndatabase and applications on a network) supporting many applications used in SingHealth’s\ndaily operations, including the SCM client application. Citrix servers allow for virtualisation\nof the SCM client application without the need for a local installation on the user’s workstation.\nThere is no transactional data that flows directly between the user’s workstation and the SCM\ndatabase. Users can only view screen images of the SCM client application.\n18\n\nThe SCM system at SGH (i.e. both the SCM database servers and Citrix servers) was\n\nmigrated to be hosted in H-Cloud in June 2017. Since June 2017, a typical SingHealth user\nwould access the SCM system in the following manner:\n(a)\n\nfrom the user’s workstation, the user launches a virtual SCM client application\n\nhosted on the H-Cloud Citrix servers. The application will require the user to enter his\nunique user credentials to log in to the SCM client application. The user credentials are\nsent through the Citrix server to the SCM security server for authentication; and\n(b)\n\nupon successful authentication, the user will be able to access information on\n\nthe SCM database corresponding to the user’s designated role and responsibilities.\n\n5\n\n\fData Breach\n19\n\nBetween 27 June to 4 July 2018, the personal data of 1,495,364 unique individuals were\n\nillegally accessed and copied from the SCM database. The illegal access and copying was\nlimited to a portion of the SCM database, and only in respect of the following personal data:\n(a)\n\nthe names, NRIC numbers, addresses, gender, race, and dates of birth (“Patient\n\nParticulars”) of 1,495,364 SingHealth patients; and\n(b)\n\nthe outpatient dispensed medication records (“Dispensed Medication\n\nRecords”) of 159,000 patients (which is a subset of the full set of illegally accessed\npersonal data).\nSequence of events\n20\n\nBased on forensic investigations by IHiS and CSA, the attacker gained initial access to\n\nthe SCM network in August 2017 by infecting a user’s workstation. This was likely through\nan email phishing attack, which led to malware and hacking tools subsequently being installed\nand executed on the user’s workstation.\n21\n\nOnce the attacker established an initial foothold through the affected workstation, the\n\nattacker used customised malware to infect and subsequently gain remote access to and control\nof other workstations between December 2017 and May 2018. From these compromised\nworkstations, the attacker was able to gain access to and control of two user accounts: (i) a\nlocal administrator account, and (ii) another service account (a special user account that\napplications or services use to interact with the operating system) (“Compromised Accounts”):\n(a)\n\nthe local administrator account was a dormant account not ordinarily used for\n\nday-to-day operations, and was originally created as a back-up account for use by\nadministrators. This account was secured with an easily deduced password\n(“P@ssw0rd”); and\n(b)\n\nthe service account was also a dormant account with full administrative\n\nprivileges. This account was secured with a password which was self-generated during\nthe installation of the services.\n\n6\n\n\f22\n\nThrough these Compromised Accounts, the attacker was able to gain access to and\n\ncontrol of the Citrix servers located at SGH (“SGH Citrix Servers”). IHiS had planned to\ndecommission these SGH Citrix servers following the migration of the SCM database and the\nCitrix servers to H-Cloud in June 2017 but the SGH Citrix Servers remained operational and\npart of the SCM network while the decommissioning process was ongoing because the SGH\nCitrix Servers were still hosting other applications which were either planned for migration to\nH-Cloud or decommissioning by FY 2018.\n23\n\nWhile the attacker had managed to log in to the SGH Citrix Servers, which gave it a\n\ndirect route to the SCM database, the attacker still did not have the credentials that would have\nenabled it to log in to the SCM database. As such, between end-May to mid-June 2018, the\nattacker made multiple failed attempts to access the SCM database using invalid credentials,\nor accounts that had insufficient privileges to gain access to the SCM database.\n24\n\nOn 11 June 2018, an IHiS database administrator from the IHiS Delivery Group\n\ndiscovered the multiple failed attempts to log in to the SCM database. She noticed that some\nuser IDs were used on separate occasions to log in to the SCM database, but they could not log\nin because they were non-existent user IDs or were not granted access. One of the user IDs\nbelonged to a domain administrator from the IHiS Systems Management Department but she\nverified that he had not made any attempts to log into the database.\n25\n\nMore attempts to log in to the database were made on 12 and 13 June 2018. One of the\n\nuser IDs used was the same as those used on 11 June 2018. It became clear to her on 13 June\n2018 that the failed attempts to log in were evidence of someone attempting to gain\nunauthorised access to the database. On 13 June 2018, a few members of the staff from the\nIHiS Delivery Group met with the SMD over these login attempts. A chat group was created;\nmembers included the SIRM, the SingHealth CISO and members of the SMD.\n26\n\nOn 26 June 2018, the attacker managed to obtain login credentials for the SCM database\n\nfrom the H-Cloud Citrix server. CSA assessed that there was an inherent coding vulnerability\nin the SCM client application which allowed the attacker to retrieve the SCM database login\ncredentials from the H-Cloud Citrix server. These credentials were then used to access the SCM\ndatabase using one of the compromised SGH Citrix Servers.\n\n7\n\n\f27\n\nBetween 27 June and 4 July 2018, the attacker used the stolen SCM database login\n\ncredentials to access and run numerous bulk queries from one of the compromised SGH Citrix\nServers on the SCM database. Data that was illegally accessed and copied through such queries\nwas then exfiltrated by the attacker through the initial compromised workstations to the\nattacker’s overseas Command and Control (“C2”) servers.\n28\n\nSuspicious circumstances were observed by staff of the IHiS Delivery Group who were\n\nnot members of the SMD. They brought their suspicion to the attention of individual personnel\nfrom IHiS’ Security Incident Response Team (“SIRT”), which is part of the SMD. One of the\npersonnel thus notified was the Security Incident Response Manager (“SIRM”). The staff in\nthe IHiS Delivery Group had reported the suspicious circumstances as they suspected that there\nwas something amiss. While the matter was referred to the SMD, the SIRT was not formally\nactivated at any point. This was not in accordance with IHiS’ Healthcare IT Security Incident\nResponse Framework, version 2.1 (“SIRF”) and IHiS’ Cluster IT Security Incident Response\nSOP, version 1.0 (“IR-SOP”).\n29\n\nOn 4 July 2018, an IHiS Assistant Lead Analyst from the IHiS Delivery Group\n\nsupporting SCM observed alerts generated by a performance monitor which was programmed\nto monitor database queries. He commenced investigations into the unusual queries on the\nSCM database. When the Assistant Lead Analyst was unable to trace the user launching the\nqueries or make sense of the queries on his own, he alerted his colleagues from the IHiS\nApplication, Citrix and Database teams to assist in the investigations. An automated script was\nthen developed and implemented on the SCM database by the Assistant Lead Analyst together\nwith an IHiS Database Administrator from the IHiS Delivery Group to terminate the queries,\nlog the queries and send alerts to them when such queries are identified. The Citrix Team Lead\nalso took steps to block access to the SCM database from any SGH Citrix Server, and submitted\nrequests to create firewall rules to block all connections to the SCM database originating from\nany SGH Citrix Server. Collectively, these efforts stopped the further exfiltration of data from\nthe SCM database.\n30\n\nThe SIRM and the SingHealth CISO were both aware of the suspicion of attack since\n\n13 June 2018 and the remediation efforts of 4 July 2018. They were both copied on emails and\nwere members of a chatgroup created to investigate these incidents. The SingHealth CISO was\napprised of the investigations but did not make further enquiries. Instead, he waited passively\n8\n\n\ffor updates. The SIRM was overseas until 18 June 2018 without nominating a covering officer.\nDuring this time, neither the SIRM nor the SingHealth CISO escalated the matter despite their\nknowledge of these circumstances through meetings and messages. Also, neither the SIRM nor\nthe SingHealth CISO took any steps to activate the SIRT in accordance with the IR-SOP.\n31\n\nIHiS senior management and the SingHealth GCIO were only alerted to the attack on\n\nthe evening of 9 July 2018. Even though the SingHealth GCIO did not receive details of the\nunauthorised access (and in particular the exfiltration of data), he promptly escalated the matter\nand informed the CEO of IHiS that there was suspected unauthorised access into the SCM\ndatabase. Concurrently, the SingHealth GCIO informed the SingHealth DGCEO (OT&I) of the\nsuspected unauthorised access. After being informed, the CEO of IHiS consulted with IHiS’\ndirector for Cyber Security Governance (“CSG”) and organised an urgent conference call\nbetween IHiS senior management and the relevant employees at 1:00 p.m. the next day, where\nhe was to be briefed on the matter.\n32\n\nDetails of the attack and the exfiltration of data were first shared with the CEO of IHiS\n\nand the SingHealth GCIO, at the conference call on 10 July 2018. The CEO of IHiS\nimmediately recalled all relevant employees and IHiS senior management for an urgent\nmeeting at IHiS’ office on the matter and to undertake an examination of IHiS’ logs of the\nattacker’s queries on the SCM database to ascertain the extent of data exfiltration (if any). More\ndetails of the incident were ascertained and the CEO of IHiS and IHiS senior management were\ninformed of the same at the meeting that afternoon. Arrangements were made to immediately\nnotify CSA. Notifications were also issued by IHiS to MOH and SingHealth. A “war room”\nwith five working cells for containment, investigation, patient impact, communications and\nreviewing of security measures for other systems was also set up.\nRemedial actions\n33\n\nFrom 10 July 2018, IHiS and CSA worked jointly to put in place containment measures\n\nto isolate the immediate threat, eliminate the attacker’s foothold and prevent the attack from\nrecurring:\n(a)\n\nIHiS reset the system accounts twice in succession to invalidate any existing\n\nfull-access authentication tokens that the attacker might have;\n\n9\n\n\f(b)\n\nIHiS Security Operations Centre was placed on high alert to look out for\n\nsuspicious activity and signs of compromise and failed login attempts, which allowed\nCSA and IHiS to detect and respond to fresh callback attempts by the attacker on 19\nJuly 2018 to the C2 servers;\n(c)\n\nthe IHiS Network team tightened firewall rules;\n\n(d)\n\nIHiS reloaded all Citrix servers with clean images to ensure no compromised\n\nCitrix servers were left running;\n\n34\n\n(e)\n\nIHiS mandated passwords changes for all users (including administrators); and\n\n(f)\n\nIHiS put in place extensive monitoring of all administrator accounts.\n\nIHiS also supported CSA in its investigations by providing forensic images of\n\ncomputers suspected to be compromised, memory dumps, and proxy and network logs for\nforensic analysis by CSA. IHiS also simulated the attacker’s queries to ascertain the extent of\ndata exfiltration.\n35\n\nOn 19 July 2018, attempts by the attacker to access the SCM network were again\n\ndetected and CSA recommended the adoption of Internet Surfing Separation (“ISS”) to contain\nthe attack. ISS was instituted immediately thereafter on 20 July 2018 for SingHealth, and by\n22 July 2018 for the other two Clusters.\n36\n\nShortly after SingHealth was informed of the cyber attack, SingHealth made plans for\n\npatient communications using multiple channels of communication. Within days after the\npublic announcement of the cyber attack on 20 July 2018, SingHealth sent out SMSes or letters\nto notify patients whether their data was illegally accessed and how they can seek help.\nTelephone hotlines were also set up for members of the public to obtain further information.\nMembers of the public could also check whether their data had been accessed on the\n“HealthBuddy” mobile application and the SingHealth website.\n37\n\nOn 1 November 2018, IHiS announced that it will be adopting a slew of measures to\n\nstrengthen cybersecurity across the public healthcare sector following the cyber attack. IHiS\nidentified and initiated 18 security measures which will be implemented progressively. Such\nmeasures include:\n10\n\n\f(a)\n\naddressing Advanced Persistent Threat (“APT”) by sophisticated actors: IHiS\n\nhas initiated several measures to improve its ability to detect indicators-of-compromise,\nrecord and monitor endpoints’ system-level behaviours and events, detect advanced\nmalwares and remove the threats (if any). IHiS will also be implementing two-factor\nauthentication for endpoint local administrators who manage end-user devices and\ninstallation of software;\n(b)\n\naddressing vulnerabilities to prevent unauthorised access to Clusters’ IT\n\nnetworks: To further prevent the use of weak passwords, IHiS will be enhancing the\naccess management capability to manage complex passwords centrally and\nautomatically update and protect administrator accounts. Access management will be\nboosted with threat analytics to provide earlier detection of suspicious account activities\nby applying a combination of statistical modelling, machine learning, as well as\nbehaviour analytics to identify unusual activities, and respond faster to threats; and\n(c)\n\nenhancing security of the Allscripts SCM: IHiS has put in place database\n\nactivity monitoring for SCM and it is being enhanced with more comprehensive blocks\nand alerts on execution of bulk queries.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n38\n\nThe issues for determination are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhether IHiS was acting as a data intermediary for SingHealth in relation to the\n\nSingHealth patients’ personal data on the SCM database; and\n(b)\n\nwhether each of the Organisations complied with its obligation under section 24\n\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in respect of the Data Breach.\n39\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Commissioner finds that the Patient Particulars and\n\nDispensed Medication Records are personal data as defined under section 2(1) of the PDPA\nbecause they contain data about patients who could be identified from that data.\n40\n\nGiven the facts and circumstances surrounding the Data Breach, the Patient Particulars\n\nand Dispensed Medication Records were disclosed without authorisation in the Data Breach.\n\n11\n\n\f(a)\n\nWhether IHiS was acting as a data intermediary for SingHealth\n\n41\n\nA data intermediary is defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA as an organisation that\n\nprocesses personal data on behalf of another organisation but does not include an employee of\nthat organisation. SingHealth engaged IHiS (MOH’s designated IT arm of the public healthcare\nsector), as required by MOH, to manage its IT systems and provide day-to-day operations and\ntechnical support, maintenance, and monitoring of the entire SingHealth IT system (including\nthe SCM database which held the personal data of SingHealth’s patients). These activities\ninclude “processing” of personal data on behalf of SingHealth, as defined in section 2(1) of the\nPDPA.\n42\n\nThe scope of the IHiS Delivery Group’s duties and responsibilities to SingHealth are\n\nset out in the following policy documents:\n(a)\n\nthe IT-SPS, which is a policy document jointly prepared by MOHH and IHiS;\n\n(b)\n\nthe annual IT workplans for each of the SingHealth institutions, which establish\n\nan agreement between each of the SingHealth institutions and IHiS;5 and\n(c)\n\nthe IHiS Data Protection Policy (“DPP”) (read in conjunction with the MOHH\n\nInformation Sharing Policy), which expressly states that IHiS is a data intermediary for\nSingHealth and all other healthcare institutions in the Clusters.6\n43\n\nNotably, the DPP makes it clear that IHiS will only collect, use, disclose and/or process\n\nSingHealth’s data to the extent necessary to fulfil its duties and obligations to SingHealth. This\nincludes, among other things, collecting, using, disclosing and/or processing SingHealth’s data\nfor the purposes of investigating and resolution of issues and errors reported in IT programs\nand systems and IT support.7\n\nThe IT workplans expressly include the provision of SCM maintenance support as an item under the list of “IT\nSystem Support and Maintenance Services” to be provided.\n6\nClause 1.1.3 of the DPP states:\n5\n\n“As IT professionals who support healthcare organisations, IHIS acts as a “data intermediary” in\nrelation to Client Data, will exercise reasonable care in protecting Client Data from unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (our “Protection\nObligation”), and we undertake steps to ensure that we do not retain personal data longer than is\nrequired for business or legal purposes (our “Retention Obligation”).\n[Emphasis added.]\n7\n\nClause 6.1.1 of the DPP.\n\n12\n\n\f44\n\nPursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA, a data intermediary that processes personal data\n\non behalf of and for the purposes of another organisation pursuant to a contract which is\nevidenced or made in writing has a duty to comply with sections 24 and 25 of the PDPA. Under\nsection 4(3) of the PDPA, an organisation that engages a data intermediary to process personal\ndata on its behalf and for its purposes has the same obligation in respect of such personal data\nas if it had processed the personal data itself. Accordingly, SingHealth and IHiS each have an\nobligation to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of\nSingHealth’s patients that are in their possession or under their control.\nThe GCIO Office\n45\n\nAt this juncture, it is pertinent to deal with the issue of where the roles of the GCIO\n\n(and the GCIO Office) as well as the CISO fit within the Organisations. Because of the way in\nwhich all IT functions and capabilities (including IT staff) for the public healthcare sector are\ncentralised in IHiS, it is not readily apparent whether SingHealth or IHiS is responsible for the\nactions of the GCIO and CISO.\n46\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 9 above, every Cluster has a GCIO and CISO. It is not\n\ndisputed that the SingHealth GCIO and SingHealth GCIO Office are operationally part of\nSingHealth and its organisational structure. The SingHealth GCIO is positioned at the top of\nand is in charge of the SingHealth GCIO Office, through which he carries out services and\nowes responsibilities to SingHealth in terms of overseeing SingHealth’s IT systems. In\nSingHealth, the SingHealth GCIO and his office have a number of duties. These include:\n(a)\n\nthe SingHealth GCIO is responsible for updating the SingHealth Board of\n\nDirectors on important IT security matters and attends the SingHealth Board IT\nCommittee (“ITC”) meetings. For example, the SingHealth GCIO provides\nSingHealth’s Risk Oversight Committee (“ROC”) with information relating to\nproposed or implemented measures to improve SingHealth’s IT security, such as\nencryption of data in SingHealth’s servers, monitoring of unusual access to the EMR\nand outgoing network traffic, and phishing exercises conducted on SingHealth staff.\nThe SingHealth GCIO also informs the ROC about major IT security incidents in\nSingHealth’s network, remediation of cybersecurity weaknesses observed in\nSingHealth’s servers, and the status of SingHealth’s compliance with IT security\nstandards, such as the IT-SPS;\n13\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe SingHealth GCIO sits on several SingHealth management level committees\n\nthat have oversight over IT matters in SingHealth, specifically the Cluster IT Council\n(“CITC”), Electronic Medical Record Steering Committee (“EMRSC”) and Enterprise\nResource Planning Steering Committee (“ERPSC”).8 The SingHealth GCIO Office is\nalso the secretariat of the CITC, the overall governing body for IT matters across the\nSingHealth Cluster;\n(c)\n\nthe SingHealth GCIO Office oversees SingHealth’s IT operations and security\n\nand exercises oversight over the IHiS Delivery Group’s administration and\nimplementation of policies;\n(d)\n\nthe SingHealth GCIO Office prepares and presents for approval, papers on IT\n\nsecurity proposals and budgets, including various annual IT work plans and budgets to\nSingHealth’s management, management committees and board committees, such as the\nCITC and ITC. The SingHealth GCIO works with the respective SingHealth PHIs to\nprepare the IT workplan9 for each SingHealth PHI;\n(e)\n\nthe SingHealth GCIO Office tracks the implementation of audit remediation\n\nmeasures recommended by MOHH’s Group Internal Audit division (“GIA”) 10\naccording to the timeline agreed between IHiS and GIA;11 and\n(f)\n\nthe SingHealth GCIO and GCIO Office also play a key role in SingHealth’s\n\nstaff IT security education and awareness initiatives by developing various security\npolicies pertaining to cybersecurity in accordance with the IT-SPS, such as the\nSingHealth IT Acceptable Use Policy, the SingHealth Response Plan for Cyber Attacks\n(Version 3.0) (“SingHealth RP CA”), the standard operating procedure (“SOP”) for\nIncident Communication and Escalation and the SingHealth Data Access Policy. The\nSingHealth GCIO also sends out memos to all SingHealth staff in relation to IT security\nrisks and staff training initiatives, e.g. phishing exercises.\n\n8\n\nSee paragraph 66 below for more details on the CITC and other board committees in SingHealth with oversight\nover IT matters.\n9\nAn IT workplan would typically include IHiS’ direction for implementation of IT initiatives, including IT\nsecurity initiatives (such as Advanced Threat Protection and hard disk encryption) for the financial year.\n10\nThe scope of the GIA’s audits are discussed at paragraphs 71 to 73 below.\n11\nThe SingHealth GCIO Office does not verify whether the audit remediation measures have been implemented.\nThe GIA would validate if the remediation measures had in fact been performed and update SingHealth\nmanagement accordingly.\n\n14\n\n\f47\n\nSimilarly, as mentioned at paragraph 9 above, it is not disputed that the SingHealth\n\nCISO is charged with security oversight for SingHealth and reports to the SingHealth GCIO\ndirectly on security matters. The SingHealth CISO does not have any staff reporting under him\nand relies on the IHiS Delivery Group (specifically the SMD) for their technical expertise on\nsecurity and operational matters. The SingHealth CISO has a key role in the organisational\nstructure of SingHealth with regard to IT security. Under the IT security incident reporting\nprocesses developed and/or adopted by SingHealth, the SingHealth CISO has substantial\nresponsibilities including the assessing, monitoring, and coordinating of responses to such\nincidents. He is accountable for the actions of incident response functions and is responsible\nfor making regular, direct reports to the SingHealth GCIO, SingHealth management and other\nrelevant parties such as the CSG.\n48\n\nOn balance, while IHiS employees deployed to fill the SingHealth GCIO or CISO role\n\nmay owe concurrent duties and responsibilities to IHiS, to the extent that they are carrying out\nthe functions of the SingHealth GCIO or CISO, it is not disputed that they act on behalf of\nSingHealth. Insofar as they perform the work and operate on behalf of SingHealth, the\nCommissioner finds that the actions of the SingHealth GCIO and CISO as well as the\nSingHealth GCIO Office should be attributed to SingHealth.\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisations complied with their obligations under section 24 of the\n\nPDPA\n49\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect the personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks\n(the “Protection Obligation”).\n50\n\nPursuant to section 11(1) of the PDPA, the reasonableness of the security arrangements\n\nmade is to be objectively determined, having regard to what a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances. The following factors as set out in the Advisory\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) (at [17.2]) are taken into\nconsideration in assessing the reasonableness of security arrangements:\n(a)\n\nthe nature of the personal data;\n\n15\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe form in which the personal data has been collected (e.g. physical or\n\nelectronic); and\n(c)\n\nthe possible impact to the individual concerned if an unauthorised person\n\nobtained, modified or disposed of the personal data.\n51\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of the security arrangements adopted by the\n\nOrganisations, the Commissioner took into consideration the fact that medical data is personal\ndata of a sensitive nature which should be accorded a higher standard of protection. 12 The\nhealth sector handles some of the most sensitive personal data and patients have the right to\nexpect that the data will be looked after.13\n52\n\nAs observed in Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive Works Pte Ltd [2016]\n\nSGPDPC 22, “reasonable security arrangements” for IT systems must be sufficiently robust\nand comprehensive to guard against a possible intrusion or attack:14\n“Another important aspect of a “reasonable security arrangement” for IT\nsystems is that it must be sufficiently robust and comprehensive to guard\nagainst a possible intrusion or attack. For example, it is not enough for an IT\nsystem to have strong firewalls if there is a weak administrative password which\nan intruder can “guess” to enter the system. The nature of such systems require\nthere to be sufficient coverage and an adequate level of protection of the\nsecurity measures that are put in place, since a single point of entry is all an\nintruder needs to gain access to the personal data held on a system. In other\nwords, an organisation needs to have an “all-round” security of its system.\nThis is not to say that the security measures or the coverage need to be\n“perfect”, but only requires that such arrangements be “reasonable” in the\ncircumstances.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n53\n\nThe public healthcare sector is heavily reliant on IT and a wide variety of IT systems\n\nthat hold personal data are employed as part of a healthcare institution’s operations. 15 In\nparticular, the SCM system is hosted in H-Cloud and the SCM database contains the full\nmedical records of all SingHealth’s patients, which is very sensitive personal information. It is\n\n12\n\nRe Aviva Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 4 at [17].\nUK, ICO, Health Sector Resources <https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/resources-and-support/health-sectorresources/>.\n14\nRe The Cellar Door Pte Ltd at [29].\n15\nThese include clinical systems that provide direct patient care to administrative and infrastructure systems that\nautomate processes and workflow and facilitate sharing of information and communications across teams within\nand outside of the institution.\n13\n\n16\n\n\ftherefore critical to protect the security and confidentiality of such medical records. As\nhighlighted in the Advisory Guidelines for the Healthcare Sector (updated 28 March 2017) (at\n[4.2]):\n“In relation to the Protection Obligation, the PDPA requires an organisation to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control. There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for\norganisations to comply with the Protection Obligation. Generally, where the\npersonal data stored is regarded as more confidential and where the\nadverse impact to individuals is significantly greater if such personal data\nwere inadvertently accessed (e.g. relating to sensitive medical conditions),\ntighter security arrangements should be employed. Healthcare institutions\nshould consider the nature of the personal data in their possession or under\ntheir control (as the case may be) to determine the security arrangements\nthat are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nWhether SingHealth complied with its Protection Obligation\n54\n\nAs an organisation subject to the data protection provisions under the PDPA,\n\nSingHealth has the primary responsibility of ensuring that there are reasonable security\narrangements in place to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control, 16\nregardless of whether SingHealth has appointed a data intermediary to process patient personal\ndata on its behalf.\n55\n\nWhile SingHealth may outsource the activities necessary to protect the personal data in\n\nthe SCM database by engaging IHiS to maintain and secure its IT network and the SCM\ndatabase, SingHealth has a duty to ensure that any data intermediary that processes personal\ndata on its behalf complies with the PDPA.17 This means that SingHealth can still be liable for\na data breach for failing to meet its responsibility, even though IHiS was found to have its own\nresponsibility, and vice versa.18\n56\n\nThe Commissioner takes this opportunity to reiterate that while organisations may\n\noutsource work to vendors, the responsibility for complying with statutory obligations under\nthe PDPA may not be delegated:19\n\n16\n\nClause 5.1.1 of the DPP expressly states that Clients (i.e. SingHealth) will at all times remain in control over\nClient Data (i.e. the personal data of SingHealth’s patients).\n17\nSee Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and others [2016] SGPDPC 19 at [46].\n18\nRe Social Metric Pte Ltd at [16], citing Re Smiling Orchid.

In\nRe Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17, the Commissioner explained that where the data\nprocessing activities are carried out by the organisation’s external vendor, the organisation has\na supervisory or general role for the protection of the personal data, while the data\nintermediary has a more direct and specific role in the protection of personal data arising from\nits direct possession of or control over the personal data.20\n58\n\nIn this case, on the basis of the Organisations’ representations and evidence in these\n\nproceedings, the Commissioner is satisfied that SingHealth had some security arrangements in\nplace to meet its supervisory role for the protection of the personal data, such as by maintaining\noversight and control over IHiS’ processing of the SCM database. However, the SingHealth\nCISO’s failure to comply with the IT security incident reporting processes and failure to\nexercise independent judgement call into question whether SingHealth had taken reasonable\nand appropriate measures to protect the personal data in the SCM database from unauthorised\naccess and copying. More importantly, it points to a larger systemic issue within the\norganisation.\n59\n\nTo begin with, parties should put in place a contract that sets out the obligations and\n\nresponsibilities of a data intermediary to protect the organisation’s personal data and the\nparties’ respective roles, obligations and responsibilities to protect the personal data. 21 The\nforeign data protection authorities have taken the position that a data controller that outsources\nthe processing of its personal data to data processors must take all reasonable steps to protect\nthat information from unauthorised use and disclosure while it is in the hands of the third-party\nprocessor.\n\n20\n21\n\nRe Social Metric Pte Ltd at [16], citing Re Smiling Orchid.\nRe Singapore Telecommunications Limited at [14].\n\n18\n\n\f60\n\nAccording to the Information Leaflet on the Outsourcing the Processing of Personal\n\nData to Data Processors published by the Hong Kong Office of the Privacy Commissioner for\nPersonal Data’s (“PCPD”),22 the primary means by which a data user may protect personal\ndata entrusted to its data processor is through a contract.23 The PCPD recommends that the\nfollowing obligations should be imposed on data processors:\n“How to comply with the requirements\nThrough contractual means\nThe primary means by which a data user may protect personal data\nentrusted to its data processor is through a contract. In practice, data users\noften enter into contracts with their data processors for the purpose of defining\nthe respective rights and obligations of the parties to the service contract. To\nfulfil the new obligations under DPP2(3) and DPP4(2), data users may\nincorporate additional contractual clauses in the service contract or enter into a\nseparate contract with the data processors.\nThe types of obligations to be imposed on data processors by contract may\ninclude the following:(a)\n\nsecurity measures required to be taken by the data processor to\nprotect the personal data entrusted to it and obligating the data\nprocessor to protect the personal data by complying with the data\nprotection principles (The security measures that are appropriate and\nnecessary for a data user will depend on the circumstances. Basically,\nthe data processor should be required to take the same security measures\nthe data user would have to take if the data user was processing the data\nhimself);\n\n(b)\n\ntimely return, destruction or deletion of the personal data when it is no\nlonger required for the purpose for which it is entrusted by the data user\nto the data processor (it is for the parties to agree the appropriate number\nof days);\n\n(c)\n\nprohibition against any use or disclosure of the personal data by\nthe data processor for a purpose other than the purpose for which\nthe personal data is entrusted to it by the data user;\n\n(d)\n\nabsolute prohibition or qualified prohibition (e.g. unless with the\nconsent of the data users) on the data processor against sub-contracting\nthe service that it is engaged to provide;\n\n(e)\n\nwhere sub-contracting is allowed by the data user, the data processor’s\nagreement with the sub-contractor should impose the same obligations\n\n22\n\nHong Kong, PCPD, Outsourcing the Processing of Personal Data to Data Processors (September 2012)\n<https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/publications/files/dataprocessors_e.pdf>. Under Hong Kong law, a data user is\nto take all reasonably practicable steps to safeguard the security of personal data held by it. Where personal data\nis entrusted to a data processor, a data user is responsible for any act done by the data processor.\n23\nHowever, the PCPD also recognised that other means of compliance, such as being satisfied that data processors\nhave robust policies and procedures in place and having the right to audit and inspect, may be used.\n\n19\n\n\fin relation to processing on the sub-contractor as are imposed on the\ndata processor by the data user; where the sub-contractor fails to fulfil\nits obligations, the data processor shall remain fully liable to the data\nuser for the fulfilment of its obligations;\n(f)\n\nimmediate reporting of any sign of abnormalities (e.g. audit trail\nshows unusual frequent access of the personal data entrusted to the data\nprocessor by a staff member at odd hours) or security breaches by the\ndata processor;\n\n(g)\n\nmeasures required to be taken by the data processor (such as\nhaving data protection policies and procedures in place and\nproviding adequate training to its relevant staff) to ensure that its\nrelevant staff will carry out the security measures and comply with\nthe obligations under the contract regarding the handling of\npersonal data;\n\n(h)\n\ndata user’s right to audit and inspect how the data processor\nhandles and stores personal data; and\n\n(i)\n\nconsequences for violation of the contract.\n\nThe above list is not exhaustive and data users may need to make adjustments\nor to include additional obligations on data processors under the contract having\nregard to factors such as the amount of personal data involved, the sensitivity\nof the personal data, the nature of the data processing service and the harm that\nmay result from a security breach.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n61\n\nIn a similar vein, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s (“OPC”)\n\nguidance note, Privacy and Outsourcing for Businesses, 24 states that organisations that\noutsource the processing of personal information must be satisfied that the third party has\npolicies and processes in place, including training for its staff and effective security measures,\nto ensure that the information in its care is properly safeguarded at all times:\n“The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents\nAct (PIPEDA) — Canada’s federal private-sector privacy law – requires\norganizations to take privacy consideration into account when considering\noutsourcing to another organization.\nThere is nothing in PIPEDA that prevents organizations from outsourcing the\nprocessing of data.\nHowever, regardless of where information is being processed—whether in\nCanada or in a foreign country—organizations subject to PIPEDA must take all\nreasonable steps to protect that information from unauthorized uses and\ndisclosures while it is in the hands of the third-party processor.\n\nCanada OPC, Privacy Topics – Privacy and Outsourcing for Businesses (January 2014)\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/outsourcing/02_05_d_57_os_01/>.\n24\n\n20\n\n\fOrganizations must also be satisfied that the third party has policies and\nprocesses in place, including training for its staff and effective security\nmeasures, to ensure that the information in its care is properly safeguarded\nat all times.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n62\n\nThe position taken by the foreign data protection authorities is consistent with the\n\nCommissioner’s views in Re Smiling Orchid. There should be a clear meeting of minds as to\nthe services the service provider has agreed to undertake and organisations must follow through\nwith procedures to check that the outsourced provider is delivering the services:25\n“Data controllers that engaged outsourced service providers have to be clear\nabout the nature and extent of services that the service provider is to provide.\nThere must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service\nprovider has agreed to undertake, and this should be properly\ndocumented. Data controllers should follow through with the procedures\nto check that the outsourced provider is indeed delivering the services. In\nthe absence of such clarity of intent and procedures, it is risky to hold that the\noutsourced service provider is a data intermediary.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n63\n\nHaving reviewed the policy documents at paragraph 42 above, the Commissioner finds\n\nthat IHiS’ duties and obligations as a data intermediary are clearly set out and properly\ndocumented in the policy documents. In particular:\n(a)\n\nthe IT-SPS sets out IHiS’ roles and responsibilities, including to design\n\nprocedures and processes needed to implement the IT security policies and standards\nas described in the IT-SPS;26 and\n(b)\n\nthe DPP provides guarantees of security of the personal data processed on behalf\n\nof SingHealth as it expressly states that IHiS shall exercise reasonable care in protecting\nSingHealth’s personal data and shall ensure that it implements and maintains\nappropriate security measures when processing personal data on behalf of SingHealth.27\n\n25\n\nRe Smiling Orchid at [51]. See also Re Singapore Cricket Association & Ors. [2018] SGPDPC 19, where the\nCommission reiterated that organisations that engage service providers to process personal data on their behalf\nshould clarify and properly document the nature and extent of service provided.\n26\nClause 6.1.1 of the IT-SPS.\n27\nClause 1.1.3 of the DPP:\n“As IT professionals who support healthcare organisations, IHIS acts as a “data intermediary” in relation\nto Client Data, will exercise reasonable care in protecting Client Data from unauthorised access,\n\n21\n\n\f64\n\nThe above policy documents evidence the parties’ intentions to be contractually bound\n\nby, and define the scope of the duties and obligations set out therein.\n65\n\nAdditionally, SingHealth has developed and implemented a number of data protection\n\npolicies and practices, which were communicated to its staff. These include:\n(a)\n\na Data Protection Policy, which explains how SingHealth institutions handle\n\npersonal data and is available to the public on SingHealth’s website and at its premises;\n(b)\n\na PDPA Employee Standards Manual, which is a resource and guide for\n\nSingHealth employees regarding SingHealth’s obligations under the PDPA;\n(c)\n\na dedicated intranet page for PDPA training materials, which is accessible to all\n\nstaff;\n(d)\n\na Master Data Share Agreement that SingHealth entered into with its subsidiary\n\ninstitutions to regulate the sharing of information among the SingHealth institutions;\n(e)\n\na Data Access Approval Policy, which sets out the policy and procedure for\n\nhandling data access requests from data subjects at the SingHealth level; and\n\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (our “Protection\nObligation”), and we undertake steps to ensure that we do not retain personal data longer than is required\nfor business or legal purposes (our “Retention Obligation”).”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nClause 11.1.1 of the DPP:\n“The principles under which we discharge our Protection Obligations as data intermediary under the PDPA\nfor Client Data are as follows:\n11.1.1 When Handling Client Data on behalf of Clients in connection with such services as IHiS may\nprovide to Clients from time to time at Clients’ request, IHiS shall ensure that it implements and\nmaintains appropriate security measures to ensure the security of the Client Data.\n11.1.2 In doing so, IHiS may be required to appoint vendors to advise on and execute the appropriate\ndata protection measures, and Clients authorise IHiS to appoint such vendors as may be necessary to\nperform tasks in connection with meeting its obligations under Section 25 [sic.] PDPA under its\nengagement with the Clients.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n22\n\n\f(f)\n\na Data Breach Management Policy, which sets out the policy and procedure for\n\nthe implementation of SingHealth’s personal data breach management programme to\nmanage personal data breaches effectively.28\nSingHealth management and board oversight of IT operations and security\n66\n\nApart from the policy documents, there is evidence that SingHealth maintained\n\noversight of IT operations and security through various oversight and auditing mechanisms,\nsuch as through the following board and management committees:\n(a)\n\nSingHealth’s senior management and Board members are apprised of IT\n\nmatters, such as IT audits and assessments, and the budgeting of IT projects, by the\nSingHealth GCIO Office;\n(b)\n\nother than the SingHealth Board of Directors, there are three Board committees\n\nthat have oversight of IT security matters and meet regularly throughout the year:\n(i)\n\nthe ITC: a Board committee comprising Board members and co-opted\nmembers from external institutions who have IT expertise. Senior\nmanagement representatives from SingHealth such as the Group CEO\n(“GCEO”) and Deputy Group CEO, as well as the SingHealth GCIO\nattends the ITC meetings. ITC approves the various annual IT workplans\nfor the SingHealth Cluster, which are prepared by the SingHealth GCIO\nand the IHiS Delivery Group; and\n\n(ii)\n\nthe Audit Committee (“AC”) and the ROC: where audits and key risks\nrelating to cyber security matters, such as SingHealth’s compliance with\nand key cyber security initiatives undertaken as part of the IT-SPS, and\nefforts to raise IT user security awareness, are deliberated upon. The\nROC receives updates from the SingHealth GCIO on proposed or\nimplemented measures to improve SingHealth’s IT security;29\n\n28\n\nIn the present case, as the suspicious circumstances were first observed by IHiS staff from the IHiS Systems\nManagement Department, the cyber security incident reporting framework which was followed was IHiS’ IRSOP.\n29\nThese include updates on the encryption of data in SingHealth’s servers, monitoring of unusual access to the\nEMR and outgoing network traffic, and phishing exercises conducted on SingHealth staff.\n\n23\n\n\f(c)\n\nat the management level, the CITC is the overall governing body for IT matters\nacross the SingHealth Cluster. The CITC reports to the ITC.30 The CITC meets\nmonthly to review and endorse SingHealth’s Cluster-wide IT projects and\ninitiatives and to oversee and review the IT security program. Its role is to ensure\nthat IT strategy and investments are aligned with the business strategy and IT\narchitecture of the Cluster, resulting in the effective and efficient use of IT in\nenabling SingHealth to achieve its goals. The SingHealth GCIO sits on the CITC.\nThere are two further sub-committees under the CITC:\n(i)\n\nthe ERPSC; and\n\n(ii)\n\nthe EMRSC, which is the central governance body to oversee EMR\naccess audit and continuous access monitoring requirements. The\nEMRSC members comprise of the SingHealth GCIO as well as the\nDirectors of Medical Informatics of the various PHIs in SingHealth.\n\nOperational measures\n67\n\nIn addition to the board and management level oversight, the Commissioner finds that\n\nthrough the SingHealth GCIO and GCIO Office, SingHealth also followed through with\noperational procedures and checks to ensure that IHiS carried out its functions to protect their\npersonal data.\n68\n\nThe SingHealth GCIO Office exercises oversight of the IHiS Delivery Group’s\n\nadministration of policies. It monitors and verifies that policies are carried out and issues of\nsecurity are addressed primarily through various operational meetings between the SingHealth\nGCIO Office and the IHiS Delivery Group, such as:\n(a)\n\nthe monthly SingHealth IT Management, Communication and Coordination\n\nMeeting chaired by the SingHealth GCIO, where issues of cyber security are discussed,\nallowing the SingHealth GCIO to track and ensure follow up of any outstanding\nremediation measures to be done;\n\nSingHealth’s GCEO chairs the CITC, and DGCEO (OT&I) is the Deputy Chair. The CITC members include\nthe other SingHealth DGCEOs and the heads of the various PHIs in SingHealth. The SingHealth GCIO Office is\nthe secretariat of the CITC.\n30\n\n24\n\n\f(b)\n\nregular meetings between the SingHealth GCIO Office Application Directors\n\nand the individual IHiS Delivery Group teams (e.g. the SMD), which further allows for\ncyber security issues and policy compliance to be tracked; and\n(c)\n\nad hoc meetings between the SingHealth GCIO Office and the relevant IHiS\n\nDelivery Group teams to track and ensure that detected vulnerabilities in the SingHealth\nnetwork are addressed.\n69\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 72 below, the SingHealth CISO also keeps track of the\n\ntimelines agreed between IHiS and the GIA on the audit remediation measures. In the\ncircumstances, the Commissioner finds that there are governance and audit mechanisms in\nplace for SingHealth to maintain oversight and control over IHiS’ processing of the SCM\ndatabase.\nAudits and risk management\n70\n\nThe security measures put in place by IHiS are also subject to regular audits. The\n\nSingHealth CISO conducts yearly Critical Information Infrastructure (“CII”) risk assessments\non SingHealth’s mission-critical IT systems (i.e. SingHealth’s SCM system) on behalf of\nSingHealth. This exercise is overseen by the SingHealth GCIO and the SingHealth CISO relies\non technical input from members of the IHiS Delivery Group in assessing the risks or threats\nto the CII, the controls in place and the steps that should be taken to improve on the existing\ncontrols. The SingHealth CISO’s assessment is presented to the SingHealth ITC.\n71\n\nSeparately, MOHH’s GIA conducts a CSA CII Compliance Review on the SCM system\n\nannually to ascertain if SingHealth, being a CII operator, has complied with CSA’s\nrequirements for the CII.\n72\n\nThe GIA also conducts an annual audit of SingHealth’s IT systems. 31 The GIA\n\nidentifies and prioritises the key risk areas (including for cyber security) and comes up with\nthe annual audit plan together with input from SingHealth management for the SingHealth\n\n31\n\nThe GIA is an independent centralised internal audit division housed within MOHH which audits the Clusters\nand IHiS. Audit findings from the GIA are presented directly to the AC and the ROC. Their findings are also\naddressed by the IHiS Board Audit and Risk Committee. The GIA reports to the MOHH Board Audit and Risk\nCommittee, which comprises all the Audit Committee Chairmen from all the MOHH subsidiaries (including\nSingHealth and IHiS).\n\n25\n\n\fAC’s review and approval. The SingHealth CISO coordinates GIA audits by being the parties’\npoint of contact and keeps track of the timeline agreed between IHiS and the GIA on the audit\nremediation measures.\n73\n\nBy way of example, in FY 2016, the GIA planned an audit on IHiS’ H-Cloud data\n\ncentre and engaged external providers to perform an IT security penetration test from three PHI\nsystems, one of which was from SGH to H-Cloud (the “H-Cloud Pen-Test”). The plan for the\nH-Cloud Pen-Test was presented to and approved by the SingHealth AC on 16 May 2016 and\nthe H-Cloud Pen-Test was conducted in early January 2017.\n74\n\nAs the H-Cloud Pen-Test was an audit of IHiS’ H-Cloud, the finalised audit report (the\n\n“GIA Audit Report”) was addressed to the CEO of IHiS. However, the audit findings\n(including the security risks) and the follow up actions and measures to be taken by IHiS were\nbrought to the attention of SingHealth’s senior management and were discussed at various\nboard committees and management committees within SingHealth.\n75\n\nBetween May 2017 and October 2017, the GIA (which was tasked with eventually\n\nvalidating that remediation measures had been carried out) presented the results and\nobservations from the H-Cloud Pen-Test to the SingHealth Board AC, ROC and ITC and\nprovided updates on the remediation measures and implementation timelines being undertaken\nby IHiS to rectify the weakness identified in the GIA Audit Report. This shows that\nSingHealth’s various board committees were kept abreast of the follow up for the remediation\nmeasures by the GIA.\n76\n\nOne area that had previously been identified as a potential issue in the operational\n\nmonitoring of the remediation of the audit findings was in respect of the implementation by\nIHiS of firewall rules on the SGH Citrix Servers to block remote desktop protocol traffic from\nend-user workstations. In its further representations, SingHealth provided evidence that the\nSingHealth GCIO Office, through the SingHealth CISO, had been tracking the status of the\nremediation of these outstanding issues. The IHiS Delivery Group had informed the SingHealth\nCISO on more than one occasion that the implementation of the software firewall rules as a\nremediation measure had been completed by 7 August 2017. As the implementation of the\nsoftware firewall rules are a matter of configuration of the existing SGH Citrix Servers without\nthe need for procurement of additional equipment, it is not unreasonable for the SingHealth\n\n26\n\n\fCISO to have relied on IHiS Delivery Group to provide him with an update after\nimplementation. In retrospect, the SingHealth CISO could have asked for evidence (e.g.\nscreenshots) demonstrating that the software firewall had been turned on and was effective in\nblocking remote desktop protocol traffic from end-user workstations. But this would have been\na level of operational verification that the SingHealth CISO can reasonably expect the IHiS\nDelivery Group to have done before they reported up to him that this audit finding had been\nremediated. Having considered SingHealth’s further representations, and the evidence\nprovided, the Commissioner accepts that SingHealth had exercised reasonable oversight in\nrespect of the implementation of the software firewall rules.\n77\n\nA similar position was taken by the OPC in the Canadian Personal Information\n\nProtection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) Case Summary #2007-365,32 which\nrelates to the disclosures by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication\n(“SWIFT”) of personal information to US authorities. The OPC reviewed the contract in place\nbetween SWIFT and the banks, as well as the other means available to the banks to ensure that\nSWIFT is providing a comparable level of protection. It found that the banks had fulfilled their\nobligations under Principle 4.1.3 of the PIPEDA, citing the various oversight and auditing\nmechanism, such as the development and implementation of a highly sophisticated and\nelaborate set of security measures, the cooperative oversight and technical oversight group:\n“SWIFT and its members have collaboratively developed and implemented\na highly sophisticated and elaborate set of security measures to ensure the\nintegrity, confidentiality, security and reliability of the financial messages\nthat SWIFT delivers.\nSWIFT reports back to its committees and boards through its Annual\nReport and through the security audit report (it should be noted that these\nreports encompass far more than personal information handling practices).\nAlthough some of the contractual language appears to place SWIFT in control\nof how its system is used and, by extension, how personal information in its\npossession is handled, it is nevertheless also obliged to maintain confidentiality\nof information.\nFurthermore, the Assistant Commissioner noted that there are other means by\nwhich the banks, as members and users of the SWIFT system, can ensure that\na comparable level of protection is in place, particularly with respect to the\ncooperative oversight and technical oversight groups. Through these\nvarious oversight and auditing mechanisms, and through the contractual\nOPC, PIPEDA Case Summary #2007-365, Responsibility of Canadian financial institutions in SWIFT’s\ndisclosure of personal information to US authorities considered (2 April 2007) <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opcactions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2007/pipeda-2007-365/>.\n32\n\n27\n\n\flanguage and various security measures in place, she was satisfied that the\nbanks are meeting their obligations under Principle 4.1.3.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nSingHealth CISO’s failure to escalate incident\n78\n\nNotwithstanding, as described at paragraph 30 above, the Commissioner observes that\n\nthe SingHealth CISO failed to comply with the various incident response policies and SOPs.\nThe SingHealth CISO’s role in relation to cyber incidents are detailed in the following IT\nsecurity incident reporting policy documents:\n(a)\n\nunder the SingHealth RP CA, the SingHealth CISO’s role is to:\n(i)\n\ndevelop and align IT security incident handling and response policies\nand processes;\n\n(ii)\n\nunder the Security Incident Response Plans for various scenarios, e.g.\nMalware Infection and Data Loss/Leakage, upon being alerted, the\nSingHealth CISO is responsible for crucial steps, including:\n(A)\n\nto review and classify the incident and notify the relevant\n\npersonnel, such as the SingHealth GCIO, SingHealth’s Corporate\nCommunication Department, the CSG, and the management of affected\nSingHealth institutions (“Relevant Personnel”) within 30 minutes of\nreceiving the alert;\n(B)\n\nto prepare the incident report and provide periodic containment\n\nand incident closure updates to the Relevant Personnel; and\n(C)\n\nfor the post mortem, to finalise and submit the incident report to\n\nthe Relevant Personnel, and update the SOP for such incidents.\n(b)\n\nunder the IR-SOP, the SingHealth CISO likewise has a direct line of reporting\n\nto the SingHealth GCIO and the following responsibilities in a security incident:\n(i)\n\naccountable for the actions of the incident response team and incident\nresponse functions;\n\n28\n\n\f(ii)\n\nresponsible for making regular, direct reports to the SingHealth GCIO,\nthe CSG and the management of SingHealth institutions;\n\n79\n\n(iii)\n\nperform post-incident review of the incident to improve processes;\n\n(iv)\n\ncoordinate with SingHealth’s Corporate Communication Department;\n\n(v)\n\nwhere applicable, report to law enforcement authorities; and\n\n(vi)\n\nendorse IT security incident handling and response processes.\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 47 above, the SingHealth CISO has a key role in the\n\norganisational structure of SingHealth with regards to IT security, alongside the SingHealth\nGCIO. Under the IT security incident reporting processes developed and/or adopted by\nSingHealth, the SingHealth CISO has substantial responsibilities including assessing,\nmonitoring, and coordinating responses to such incidents. He is accountable for the actions of\nthe incident response functions and is responsible for making regular, direct reports to the\nSingHealth GCIO, SingHealth management and other relevant parties such as the CSG.\n80\n\nCyber security incidents are investigated by the IHiS SIRT, which is led by the SIRM.\n\nAs the SingHealth CISO does not have any staff reporting under him, the SingHealth CISO\nrelies on the IHiS Delivery Group for their technical expertise on security and operational\nmatters. Under the IR-SOP, the SIRM is responsible for leading the effort of the SIRT and\ncoordinating input from the SIRT members. The SIRM reports to the SingHealth CISO. In\nturn, the SingHealth CISO is accountable for the actions of the SIRT and is responsible for\nescalating any issues to the SingHealth GCIO Office.\n81\n\nIn this case, even though the SingHealth CISO was informed of suspicious activities\n\nshowing multiple failed attempts to log in to the SCM database using invalid credentials, or\naccounts that had insufficient privileges in mid-June 2018, and the attack and remediation\nefforts on 4 July 2018, the SingHealth CISO did not escalate these security events. Rather, he\nwholly deferred to the SIRM’s assessment as to whether an incident was reportable (who\noperated erroneously under the misapprehension that a cyber security incident should only be\nescalated when it is “confirmed”) when he should have exercised independent judgement to\nescalate the incident to the SingHealth GCIO. To his mind, at the time that he was informed of\nthese suspicious activities, they were only potential breaches and were not confirmed security\nincidents as investigations were still underway. This does not comply with the IR-SOP. Besides\n29\n\n\ffailing to exercise his independent judgement, it would appear that the SingHealth CISO also\nfailed to understand the significance of the information provided to him or to grasp the gravity\nof the events that were happening.\n82\n\nIn this respect, the findings of the COI are relevant. Having thoroughly examined the\n\nincident response up to 10 July 2018, including the sequence of events and the state of mind of\nthe persons involved, the COI found that with regard to the incidents on 4 July 2018, the\nSingHealth CISO’s response was “clearly lacking, and displayed an alarming lack of\nconcern”. 33 It was clear at that point that a CII system had potentially been breached. The\nSingHealth CISO should have recognised it as a Category 1 reportable security incident and\ntaken steps to escalate the matter immediately but he did not do so. Instead, he “effectively\nabdicated to [the SIRM] the responsibility of deciding whether to escalate the incident”.34\n83\n\nFurthermore, although the SingHealth CISO was accountable for the actions of the\n\nSIRT under the IR-SOP, the COI found that the SingHealth CISO did not provide any\nsignificant degree of leadership in sharing information, coordinating investigations and\nremediation efforts across the various IHiS teams. Instead, the SingHealth CISO “did nothing,\nand simply left [the SIRM] and the rest of the SIRT to their own devices in the investigation\nof the matter and remediation efforts”.35\n84\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner finds that the SingHealth CISO failed to\n\ndischarge his duties. For the reasons set out at paragraphs 47 to 48 above, the SingHealth\nCISO’s failure to comply with the incident reporting SOPs is a lapse that is attributable to\nSingHealth. While the attacker had already gained access to the SCM network and SCM\ndatabase by that time, given the substantial volume of sensitive medical personal data held in\nthe SCM database, it is reasonable to expect that someone in the SingHealth CISO’s position,\nwith the experience and stipulated responsibilities under the IT security incident reporting\nprocesses, should have been more familiar with the incident reporting standards, showed\ngreater initiative and exercised independent judgement to escalate the incident to the\nSingHealth GCIO. However, the SingHealth CISO’s conduct in this case fell far short of what\na reasonable person would expect from someone in his position.\n\n33\n\nPublic COI Report at [514].\nPublic COI Report at [514].\n35\nPublic COI Report at [514].\n34\n\n30\n\n\f85\n\nIn its representations, SingHealth referred to evidence of communications between the\n\nSingHealth CISO and SIRT personnel between 13 June 2018 and 9 July 2018, which showed\nthat the SingHealth CISO raised queries and sought updates while the SIRT was conducting\ninvestigations into the cyber security incident. Having reviewed the evidence submitted by\nSingHealth, the Commissioner finds that the SingHealth CISO had not acted reasonably and\nfailed to discharge his responsibilities. Apart from raising a few questions with regard to the\nsuspicious activities when they first surfaced on 13 June 2018, the SingHealth CISO failed to\nprovide any input or guidance to the team or query whether the matter should be escalated.\nRather, the evidence showed that security incidents were handled without sufficient regard for\nthe importance of protecting personal data and discharging its responsibilities properly.\n86\n\nSingHealth’s representations also drew attention to an important point about the role of\n\nthe SingHealth CISO from an organisational structure perspective. Because all IT functions\nand capabilities for the public healthcare sector, including the domain expertise and technical\ncapabilities required to investigate and respond to IT security incidents, are centralised in IHiS,\nin effect, the SingHealth CISO and GCIO Office have little choice but to rely on the IHiS SMD\nfor their oversight on cybersecurity incidents.\n87\n\nThe SingHealth GCIO is supported by the GCIO Office, which has a staff strength of\n\nabout 50 IHiS employees. Together, they are collectively responsible for 11 institutions, with\nan estimated 30,000 employees, 400-odd IT systems and 350 to 500 IT projects. The\nSingHealth CISO’s responsibilities in the GCIO Office are also relatively broad and include:\n(a)\n\nworking on IT risk assessments;36\n\n(b)\n\nliaising with the GIA and IHiS Delivery Group for audit confirmation,\n\ncoordinating progress updates and following-up on any audit findings or observations;\n(c)\n\nbeing part of the security incident response and reporting process;37 and\n\n36\n\nThe SingHealth CISO covers at least 4 risk assessments (enterprise risks, CII risks etc) each year from the IT\nperspective. Each assessment would stretch over a few months depending on the complexity of the matter. The\nSingHealth CISO would also follow up with the IHiS Delivery Group to check on the remediation /\nimplementation status.\n37\nThe SingHealth CISO would liaise with the IHiS SMD for security event escalation about 3 to 4 times a month.\nIn such instances, other IHiS Delivery Group colleagues would inform the SingHealth CISO about potential\nsecurity issues. The SingHealth CISO would liaise with the SMD for follow up and remediation, and to also obtain\nconfirmation of remediation.\n\n31\n\n\f(d)\n\nassisting the SingHealth GCIO in raising end-user awareness of IT security in\n\nSingHealth.\n88\n\nGiven the size and scale of SingHealth’s IT systems and network and the large\n\ndatabases of sensitive medical personal data that SingHealth is responsible for, it is reasonable\nto expect that considerable resources would have been devoted to the SingHealth CISO to carry\nout operational and security oversight of SingHealth’s IT systems. However, the SingHealth\nCISO (who is the only staff who has a portfolio specific to security) worked alone and had no\nstaff reporting under him. As a result of this arrangement, when the SingHealth CISO was on\nmedical leave between 20 June 2018 and 3 July 2018, there was no one other than the IHiS\nSIRM to cover the SingHealth CISO’s duties and provide guidance on the investigation.\n89\n\nThe SingHealth CISO’s failure to discharge his duties is also not a one-off incident that\n\nwould have been difficult to foresee.38 Rather, it revealed a systemic problem in the way the\nSingHealth GCIO Office, specifically the SingHealth CISO function, is staffed. The\nSingHealth CISO did not have the resources or the technical and IT security expertise for him\nto properly fulfil his functions. For example, he should have had a team within SingHealth to\nsupport him and provide adequate cover when he is away. It was evident from the SingHealth\nCISO’s response to the Data Breach that the existing arrangements are inadequate. As this\norganisational arrangement failed to meet the reasonable standards expected of an organisation\nof SingHealth’s size, the Commissioner finds that SingHealth had failed to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its\ncontrol from unauthorised access and copying.\n90\n\nIn this regard, SingHealth made representations submitting that it relies on and requires\n\nIHiS to ensure that the staff they deploy to carry out functions provided by IHiS, such as the\nSingHealth GCIO and CISO, are appropriately qualified and trained to discharge their duties\nand do so responsibly. SingHealth has no control over the organisational structure, how the\nCISO and SIRT is set up, or how the SingHealth CISO has to rely on the investigation findings\nand updates of the SIRT and other teams before making a report upwards or over manpower\nallocation. It also emphasised that SingHealth shares an atypical relationship with IHiS which\ngoes beyond the typical relationship a vendor shares with a customer – IHiS is not an IT vendor\nbut the MOH-designated IT arm of the public healthcare sector.\n38\n\nSee Re BHG (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 16 at [25] – [28].\n\n32\n\n\f91\n\nThe Commissioner understands that this is the way the public healthcare sector is\n\nstructured and is sympathetic to the fact that SingHealth may have had limited ability to\ninfluence the organisational structure. Nevertheless, insofar as SingHealth is an organisation\nas defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA and does not fall within any of the category of\norganisations that are excluded from data protection obligations under section 4(1) of the\nPDPA, SingHealth is required to demonstrate that it has complied with the obligations under\nthe PDPA in the event of an investigation.39\n92\n\nIn this regard, as emphasised in earlier decisions and at paragraph 54 above, it bears\n\nrepeating that SingHealth has the primary role and responsibility of ensuring the overall\nprotection of the personal data in its possession or under its control, even if it has engaged a\ndata intermediary that has a duty to protect the personal data. 40 The fact that SingHealth is\nrequired to engage and rely on IHiS for all its IT services in accordance with MOH’s policy\ndoes not absolve SingHealth from its responsibilities and obligations under the PDPA. Hence,\nthese representations cannot absolve SingHealth from liability but the Commissioner\nrecognises the exceptional set of circumstances in this case, and have taken them into\nconsideration as mitigating factors in the directions that the Commissioner has made.\n93\n\nSingHealth also submitted that the errors of individuals within organisations should not\n\nin and of itself equate to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA unless the individual’s errors\npoints to a larger systemic issue within the organisation or an inadequacy of security\narrangements which led to or caused the mistakes, lapses or poor judgement.\n94\n\nThe Commissioner agrees that as a matter of principle, an error or flaw in the\n\norganisation’s systems and processes does not automatically mean that the organisation failed\nto take reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data. As highlighted in AIG Asia\nPacific Insurance Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 8 (at [27] and [28]), the Commissioner will consider\nwhether the organisation had implemented any security arrangements and if so, whether those\narrangements are reasonable:\n“The fact that personal data had been disclosed to an unauthorised party\nby an error or flaw in an organisation’s systems and processes does not\nautomatically mean that the organisation is liable under section 24 of the\n39\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA at [6.3].\nSee Re The Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3696 and Eagle Eye Security Management Services\nPte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 11 at [16]; Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd at [33] and [34].\n40\n\n33\n\n\fPDPA for failing to take reasonable security arrangements to protect personal\ndata.\nFor the purposes of section 24, the Commissioner has to consider what\nsecurity arrangements (if any) an organisation had implemented to\nprevent such unauthorised disclosure, and whether those arrangements\nare reasonable.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n95\n\nIn the present case, as the Commissioner has found at paragraphs 87 to 89 above that\n\nthe SingHealth CISO’s failure to comply with the SOPs was emblematic of the inadequacy of\nthe security arrangements, the Commissioner has already taken this into consideration before\nSingHealth submitted its representation.\n96\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant facts and representations made by\n\nSingHealth, the Commissioner finds that while SingHealth had maintained oversight over\nIHiS’ provision of IT operations and security through various levels of board, management and\noperational oversight and audit mechanisms, SingHealth had not taken sufficient security\nmeasures to protect the personal data in the SCM database from the unauthorised access and\nillegal copying. Accordingly, SingHealth has failed to meet its Protection Obligation and is in\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether IHiS complied with its Protection Obligation\n97\n\nAt the outset, as the personal data in the SCM database was in IHiS’ possession, if not\n\nunder its control, IHiS was obliged to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect\nthe personal data in the SCM database.\n98\n\nIt is accepted that the Data Breach was perpetrated by a skilled and sophisticated threat\n\nactor. The level of discipline and planning demonstrated during the Data Breach are\ncharacteristic of an APT actor, who used advanced methods that overcame enterprise security\nmeasures:\n(a)\n\nthe attacker took steps to conduct lateral movement and reconnaissance in order\nto avoid breaching the existing detection mechanisms IHiS had put in place, and\ncould not have easily been noticed;\n\n34\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe attacker used highly customised malware that evaded SingHealth’s antivirus software and security defences and could not have been detected by\nstandard anti-malware solutions; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe attacker employed numerous customised and modified open-source scripts\nand tools that were manipulated to evade signature-based anti-virus detection.\n\n99\n\nFurthermore, the attacker deliberately and specifically targeted the SCM database and\n\ntook active steps to ensure that it would remain undetected until it had reached the SCM\ndatabase.\n100\n\nHence, the key issue for determination is whether, despite the attacker’s sophisticated\n\nand novel tactics, techniques and procedures, IHiS had done enough under section 24 of the\nPDPA to prevent the unauthorised disclosure.\nIHiS’ security arrangements at the material time\n101\n\nIHiS bases its security arrangements on the IT-SPS, 41 which is a policy based on\n\ninternational information security standards. The IT-SPS covers all the essential IT security\ndomains, and prescribes the IT security policies, technical security standards and processes to\nbe implemented by all public healthcare institutions, including policies on user access control\nand password management.\n102\n\nAccording to IHiS, it maintained a comprehensive IT security incident and response\n\nframework, which consists of three measures – prevention, detection and response, for all\nsystems under its purview (including the SCM network during the time of the Data Breach). A\nbrief summary of the measures taken for the SCM network is as follows:\n(a)\n\ntechnical measures to prevent cyber security risks for:\n(i)\n\nend-point security relating to SingHealth and IHiS issued end-point\ndevices (e.g. workstations), such as the prohibition from use of personal\ndevices on the SCM network, the use of anti-virus and anti-malware\nsoftware;\n\n41\n\nThe current version of the IT-SPS was issued in 2014.\n\n35\n\n\f(ii)\n\nnetwork security, such as creating network firewalls to segregate each\nnetwork segment so as to ensure that only authorised network traffic is\npermitted to cross segments or zones;\n\n(iii)\n\nH-Cloud security by implementing measures such as web application\nfirewalls, physical separation of Virtual Data Centres, and Privileged\nAccess Management;\n\n(iv)\n\ndatabase security, such as by running automated scripts which closely\nmonitor the SCM database to detect and raise alerts for performance\nabnormalities, and keeping detailed access and audit logs which include\ninformation such as failed login attempts; and\n\n(v)\n\nemail security, such as anti-virus, anti-spam and attachment blocking\ntechnology;\n\n(b)\n\npolicies and processes to manage or otherwise deal with cyber security risks,\n\nwhich include:\n(i)\n\nbuilding awareness and educating staff on cyber security risks and IHiS’\nIT policies, such as by conducting IT security training, sending regular\nsecurity alerts and conducting regular phishing exercises to create\nawareness and promote vigilance;\n\n(ii)\n\ndeveloping policies for users, such as the IT-SPS, the SingHealth\nAcceptable Use Policy, and the SingHealth End User Computing,\nEquipment and Network Policy and monitoring the compliance of users\nto these policies; and\n\n(iii)\n\nconducting periodic reviews of the risks, controls and other measures of\nthe security systems flagged by the GIA;\n\n(c)\n\ndetection measures to identify and pinpoint cyber security risks, such as\n\ncontinuous real-time monitoring and periodic testing; and\n(d)\n\nrisk assessment exercises carried out at various levels. For example, enterprise\n\nrisk assessment and CII risk assessment exercises were conducted annually by the\nSingHealth CISO and overseen by the SingHealth GCIO.\n\n36\n\n\f103\n\nAt the material time, IHiS also had the following incident reporting processes and\n\nframeworks in place to ensure that cyber security incidents are appropriately escalated and\naddressed:\n(a)\n\nthe SIRF, which translates the requirements of the National Cyber Incident\n\nResponse Framework42 into the context of the PHIs; and\n(b)\n\nthe IR-SOP, which is IHiS’ Cluster-level standard operating procedure for\n\nresponding to security incidents.\n104\n\nInternally, IHiS also maintains a security incident classification framework identical to\n\nthat used by CSA, and has developed internal reporting timelines for security incidents to be\nescalated to the CSG within IHiS.\n105\n\nCyber security incidents are investigated by the IHiS SIRT. This team is led by the\n\nSIRM, and comprises of IHiS’ Computer Emergency Response Team (“CERT”) and lead\npersonnel from IHiS Infrastructure Services and Application Services teams. It is the SIRM’s\nresponsibility to coordinate input from the SIRT members and to report to the SingHealth\nCISO. The SingHealth CISO’s responsibility is to escalate any issues to the SingHealth GCIO.\n106\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 127 below, IHiS represented that all IHiS staff have been\n\nbriefed to alert the SIRT or the SMD when a non-security IHiS staff encounters a suspicious\nincident. This was communicated to all IHiS staff through regular emails, circulars, wallpapers\nand intranet banners. IHiS also represented that insofar as the non-security IHiS staff are\nconcerned, the general expectation was for them to report suspicious incidents to the SIRT or\nSMD. Such staff are not expected to be familiar with the details of the IT-SPS and SIRF, though\nthese policies were made available via IHiS’ intranet.\n107\n\nGiven that IHiS regularly handles large volumes of sensitive personal data on behalf of\n\nthe PHIs, the Commissioner finds that it is insufficient for IHiS to have merely informed its\nnon-security staff to alert the relevant personnel through emails, circulars, wallpapers and\nintranet banners. These are effective in creating awareness amongst staff, but ineffective as\npolicies for a number of reasons. Emails and circulars are disseminated and therefore\n\n42\n\nThe National Cyber Incident Response Framework is the framework for the reporting and management of cyber\nincidents affecting CIIs.\n\n37\n\n\fineffective as a resource for future reference; while wallpapers and intranet banners are\ntemporary and replaced eventually. The necessity of a set of written policies that are centrally\nstored (eg on the intranet) and which can be consulted cannot be replaced by these other means\nof creating awareness. IHiS had admitted that while the SIRF and IT-SPS were made available\nvia IHiS’ intranet, it had not developed any written policy on IT security incident reporting for\nits non-security staff. Furthermore, regular training sessions and staff exercises should have\nbeen conducted to ensure that all IHiS staff are familiar with the IT security incident reporting\nand their role in recognising and reporting suspected IT security incidents. These trio of\nawareness, training and written resource have to be deployed collectively for an effective staff\ntraining programme.\n108\n\nAs the Commissioner observed in Re SLF Green Maid Agency [2018] SGPDPC 27 (at\n\n[13]), it is insufficient for organisations that handle large volumes of sensitive personal data to\nmerely disseminate guidelines and instructions. It is necessary for the organisation to have a\nsystem of staff training and awareness:\n“For a company like the Organisation that handles personal data of foreign\ndomestic workers and clients on a daily basis (eg passport and income\ninformation), it is necessary for it to put in place a better system of staff\ntraining and awareness given the sensitive nature of personal data that it\nhandles, as well as the volume. Merely disseminating guidelines and verbal\ninstructions is insufficient. As noted in Re Aviva Ltd, whilst there is no specific\ndistinction in the PDPA based on the sensitivity of the data, organisations are\nto ensure that there are appropriate levels of security for data of varying levels\nof sensitivity: [2018] PDP Digest 245 at [17]-[18]. NRIC and passport numbers\nand financial information would generally be considered more sensitive: Re\nAviva Ltd at [17]. Structured and periodic training could have been\nimplemented to protect personal data.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n109\n\nFurthermore, the Commissioner finds that by IHiS’ own admission, there were a\n\nnumber of vulnerabilities and gaps in SingHealth’s network and in IHiS’ systems and processes\nwhich were exploited by the attacker.\n110\n\nFirst, there were gaps in how IHiS’ policies and practices were implemented and\n\nenforced, particularly in the management of the SGH Citrix Servers. IHiS asserts that its\nmanagement gave clear directions and instructions to its Citrix Team Lead in July 2017 to turn\non software firewall on the SGH Citrix Servers to block remote desktop protocol traffic from\nend-user workstations. However, firewall rules were not implemented on the SGH Citrix\n38\n\n\fServers that were used by the attacker in the course of the attack. IHiS’ staff failed to discharge\ntheir assigned responsibilities. IHiS had relied on its staff to follow through on instructions and\nthe Citrix Team Lead to ensure that the instructions were complied with. In this case, however,\nboth the team responsible for placing the firewalls and their supervisor, the Citrix Team Lead,\nfailed to discharge their assigned responsibilities. To compound matters, IHiS updated the\nSingHealth CISO that the software firewall rules had been implemented without having\nverified this.\n111\n\nSecond, there were insufficient steps taken to ensure that technical measures to protect\n\npersonal data were carried out as intended and according to IHiS’ own policies and practices.\nSuch insufficiencies were exploited by the attacker.\n112\n\nWeak local administrator passwords: under the IT-SPS, administrator accounts were\n\nrequired to have a 15-character password. Notwithstanding, the local administrator account\nthat the attacker relied on in the course of the attack had an easily deduced password\n(“P@ssw0rd”) with only eight characters. The account also had the same password since 2012\ndespite the requirement for it to be changed every three to six months. Although IHiS had\npushed its password policy and requirements through a Group Policy Object (“GPO”), which\nshould apply to all servers by default, it did not apply to servers which had activated a setting\nto prevent the GPO from applying, such as the SGH Citrix Servers.43\n113\n\nIn Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 12, the Commissioner\n\nhighlighted (at [35]) the importance of managing admin account credentials, and took the view\nthat the implementation of an effective password expiry mechanism would have reduced the\npotential adverse impact of an unauthorised use of the admin account password:\n“On the facts, the Organisation failed to put in place any formal policy or\npractice for the management of the admin account passwords to the EDM\nserver. Additionally, in terms of the Organisation’s handling of the admin\naccount credentials, the Commission identified two main areas of concern as\nfollows:\n…\n(b)\nsecond, the password of the admin account to access the EDM\nApplication had not been changed since the roll out of the EDM\n43\n\nGPOs automate the implementation and enforcement of policies. They should apply to all servers by default,\nexcept for groups of servers which have the ‘block policy inheritance’ setting applied. Applying ‘block policy\ninheritance’ prevents group policies from being inherited from these servers. The SGH Citrix Servers were part\nof a group of servers which had group policy inheritance applied. As such, the GPOs implementing the complex\npassword policy and policy for the deactivating of dormant accounts were not applied.\n\n39\n\n\fApplication, i.e. from November 2014 until the time of the data breach\nincident in December 2015. The implementation of an effective\npassword expiry mechanism would have reduced the potential\nadverse impact of an unauthorised use of the admin account\npassword.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n114\n\nPasswords in cleartext was found in scripts: the password of one of the local\n\nadministrator accounts relied by the attacker in the course of the attack was found in cleartext\nin scripts on a SGH Citrix Server. This script was created by a Citrix Administrator despite\nspecific instructions in March 2017 and June 2017 from his supervisors to clean up the scripts\nand avoid storing any passwords in the scripts in cleartext. Under the IT-SPS, passwords must\nnot be stored as cleartext on storage systems, audit logs or when transmitted over the network\nbut should configured to be encrypted, prompted or hashed.\n115\n\nIn Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd, the fact that login credentials were being transferred in\n\nclear and unencrypted text, which exposed the hosting environment to potential compromise\nshould the credentials be intercepted, was found to be indicative of a poor level of security in\nthe system design and implementation:44\n“In this case, the Respondents have failed to put such an all-round security in\nplace. The Commission has found several significant gaps in the security\nmeasures implemented as follow:\n…\n(c) Login credentials were transferred in clear and unencrypted text. With\nregard to the Site’s functionality, the Commission found that login\ncredentials (ie user logins and passwords) were being transferred in clear\nand unencrypted text, indicative of a poor level of security in the system\ndesign and implementation. This security vulnerability exposed the\nhosting environment to potential compromise should the credentials be\nintercepted. Cellar Door, as the organisation having the overall responsibility\nand control over the design and functionalities of the Site, has the obligation\nto ensure that, as part of the design and functionalities of the Site, provisions\nwere made for the security of the transmission of the login credentials. In its\noriginal design, the Site did not have such a security feature to protect the\ntransmission of the login credentials – but this was prior to Section 24 of the\nPDPA coming into force on 2 July 2014. However, subsequently when the\nPDPA came into full effect on 2 July 2014, Cellar Door had the obligation to\nreview the design and functionalities of the Site, and put in place the necessary\nsecurity arrangements to comply with Section 24 of the PDPA. Yet, Cellar\nDoor had failed to do so, and the Site still lacked in the necessary measures to\nsecure the transmission of the login credentials.”\n\n44\n\nRe The Cellar Door Pte Ltd at [30].\n\n40\n\n\f[Emphasis added.]\n\n116\n\nDormant accounts were not disabled: although IHiS’ policies required a periodic\n\nreview of unused or dormant accounts, the dormant local administrator account and service\naccount relied on by the attacker in the course of the attack were not detected and disabled by\nIHiS because the automated process to detect and disable unused or dormant accounts only\nextended to “domain” accounts instead of local accounts.45\n117\n\nIn Re K Box Entertainment Group Pte Ltd and another [2016] SGPDPC 1, the\n\nCommissioner found (at [26]) that the organisation had weak control over unused accounts.\nThe organisation failed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data\nin its possession or under its control as it could have easily removed the unused accounts but it\nhad failed to do so. As a result, the unused administrative account with a weak password\n(“admin”) remained in the system and put the personal data of the organisation’s members at\nrisk:\n“In particular, the Commission has identified the following vulnerabilities in K\nBox’s security arrangements which show how K Box failed to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the members’ personal data:\n(b) K Box had weak control over unused accounts, specifically, unused\naccounts were not removed:\n(i)\n\nAs stated at paragraph 14 above, as many as 36 accounts were removed\nfrom the CMS system on 17 September 2014, which suggests that K\nBox may not have had the practice of deleting the accounts of staff that\nhad left the company until it conducted the review on 17 September\n2014. This is despite the fact that K Box was able to remove the unused\naccounts within a day after the List had been disclosed online which\nshows that K Box could have easily removed the unused CMS\naccounts earlier but it had failed to do so;\n\n(ii)\n\nAs a result of K Box and/or Finantech’s failure to promptly remove\nunused accounts from the CMS system, the unused administrative\nCMS account with the user name ‘admin’ and a weak password of\n‘admin’ remained in the CMS for about one year after Mrs G had\nleft Finantech. This had put the personal data of K Box’s members\nat risk because as noted at paragraph 20 above, Finantech itself had\nhypothesised that someone could have hacked into K Box’s CMS using\nthis ‘admin’ user account and planted a malware control and command\ncentre to retrieve and export the members’ data;”\n\n45\n\nDomain accounts exist in the Microsoft Active Directory and are used to centrally manage servers and\nworkstations within an enterprise when these computing resources join to a domain. In contrast, local accounts\nexist within each server or workstation and are not managed centrally.\n\n41\n\n\f[Emphasis added.]\n\n118\n\nLack of controls to detect bulk querying behaviour in the SCM database or queries\n\nbeing run from illegitimate client applications: even though the SCM database contained\nsensitive personal data of millions of patients, there were no controls to detect bulk querying\nbehaviour. However, IHiS represented that the use of such database access monitoring software\nor tools are not common in the healthcare sector and are generally only used in the security and\nbanking/finance sector. The Public COI Report corroborates this.46 As such, the Commissioner\naccepts that it was not unreasonable that IHiS did not have such controls in place at the material\ntime.\n119\n\nThat said, according to the Guide to Securing Personal Information issued by the Office\n\nof the Australian Information Commissioner (“OAIC”),47 the use of proactive monitoring to\nidentify possible unauthorised access or disclosure may be a reasonable step to take particularly\nif the organisation uses many systems or databases which hold large amounts of personal\ninformation:\n“Audit logs, audit trails and monitoring access\nUnauthorised access of personal information can be detected by reviewing a\nrecord of system activities, such as an audit log. Maintaining a chronological\nrecord of system activities (by both internal and external users) is often the best\nway for reviewing activity on a computer system to detect and investigate\nprivacy incidents. Audit logs should also be named using a clear naming\nconvention.\nAudit trails are used to reconstruct and examine a sequence of activities on a\nsystem that lead to a specific event, such as a privacy incident.\nAccess monitoring software that provides real time (or close to real time)\ndynamic review of access activity can also be useful for detecting\nunauthorised access to personal information. Use of proactive monitoring\nto identify possible unauthorised access or disclosure, including any breach\nthat might amount to an eligible data breach for the purposes of the NDB\nscheme, may be a reasonable step for you to take particularly if you use\nmany systems or databases which hold large amounts of personal\ninformation.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n46\n\nPublic COI Report at [221].\nAustralia, OAIC, Guide to securing personal information: ‘Reasonable steps’ to protect personal information,\nJune\n2018\n<https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-and-organisations/guides/guide-to-securing-personalinformation>.\n47\n\n42\n\n\f120\n\nIn future, organisations that hold large amounts of personal data should consider\n\nimplementation of database access monitoring as one of the security measures for early\ndetection of unauthorised access or disclosure.\n121\n\nLack of controls to prevent or monitor communications between the SGH Citrix Servers\n\nand the SCM database at HDC: such controls were only implemented after the unauthorised\naccess from the SGH Citrix Servers to the SCM database was discovered. Even if it was\nnecessary to keep a connection between the SGH Citrix Servers and the SCM database at HDC,\nsuch a connection should have been a protected connection and the servers using the connection\nshould have been placed behind a firewall (which they were not). 48\n122\n\nAs highlighted in Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd, a firewall is a fundamental measure that\n\nshould be in place for servers to protect against an array of external cyber threats: 49\n“In this case, the Respondents have failed to put such an all-round security in\nplace. The Commission has found several significant gaps in the security\nmeasures implemented as follow:\n(a)\nNo server firewall installed. While there was an alleged “software\nfirewall configuration”, there was no firewall installed to protect GIW’s server\nitself at the material time. A firewall is fundamental to the security of the\nserver to protect against an array of external cyber threats, and GIW has\nthe responsibility of ensuring that such a fundamental measure is in place\nfor its server. In this case, a dedicated firewall (beyond the alleged software\nfirewall configuration) protecting the server itself was only installed after\nthe data breach incident had taken place.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n123\n\nUnpatched Microsoft Outlook email client maintained in the SingHealth IT\n\nenvironment: the attacker was able to gain access to an unpatched end-user workstation running\na version of Outlook by using a publicly available hacking tool. On this issue, IHiS submitted\nthat it did not assess if an urgent roll-out to deploy the patch outside its usual patching cycle\nwas required given that the patches released by Microsoft were not categorised as “Critical”.\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner accepts that it was not unreasonable for IHiS to not\nhave applied the patch at the material time. IHiS cannot be faulted for relying on the software\n\n48\n49\n\nAs found at paragraph 1100 above.\nRe The Cellar Door Pte Ltd at [30].\n\n43\n\n\fprovider’s assessment of the criticality and urgency for applying the steady stream of updates\nand patches that are made available on a regular basis.\n124\n\nNotwithstanding, the Commissioner takes this opportunity to reiterate the importance\n\nof putting in place maintenance processes to ensure regular security patching as a security\nmeasure. Patching is one of the common tasks that all system owners are required to perform\nin order to keep their security measures current against external threats:50\n“First, the Organisation failed to ensure regular patching of the EDM\nApplication since its roll out in November 2014. The KPMG Reports\nhighlighted that the EDM Application was exposed to 24 known vulnerabilities\nbecause it did not follow a regular patching cycle. The KPMG also noted that\nthe EDM server appeared to have been patched in an ad-hoc manner once\nevery two to four months. Patching is one of the common tasks that all\nsystem owners have to perform in order to keep its security measures\ncurrent against external threats. The failure to patch the EDM Application\nregularly was a failure to protect the EDM Application against known\nsystem vulnerabilities.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n125\n\nFor completeness, even though the SingHealth GCIO had oversight over the IHiS\n\nDelivery Group’s administration and implementation of policies, seeing as the above\nvulnerabilities are basic operational tasks that fall within the type of day-to-day operations and\ntechnical support, maintenance and monitoring, which is managed by the IHiS Delivery Group,\nit was reasonable for SingHealth to have expected the IHiS Delivery Group to ensure that\nreasonable security arrangements which were within the scope of IHiS’ responsibility were\ncarried out.\n126\n\nThird, vulnerabilities that had previously been flagged out to IHiS were either not\n\nremediated or not addressed in time:\n(a)\n\nIHiS was aware of some vulnerabilities in the Citrix Servers and had required\n\nits Citrix Team to fix the Citrix Servers to prevent exploitation. Although the Citrix\nServers in H-Cloud were fixed, the same fixes were not applied to the SGH Citrix\nServers, some of which were still in operation even though they were planned to be\ndecommissioned;\n\n50\n\nRe Orchard Turn Developments Pte Ltd at [38]. See also Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd at [26].\n\n44\n\n\f(b)\n\nthe GIA Audit Report had flagged out most of the vulnerabilities highlighted in\n\nparagraphs 110 to 123 above. Although IHiS had instructed its staff to address the\nvulnerabilities stated in the report, IHiS staff responsible for the remediation did not\nadequately track and ensure that all vulnerabilities were fully and properly remediated.\nRemediation was stated to be done when it was not actually done or not done\nthoroughly. No verification was conducted by IHiS line management. In particular,\nthere was evidence that both IHiS and the GIA thought the implementation of firewall\nrules on the SGH Citrix Servers to block remote desktop protocol traffic from end-user\nworkstations as a remediation measure had been completed by 7 August 201751 even\nthough the team responsible for placing the firewall failed to discharge their assigned\nresponsibilities (as observed at paragraph 110 above); and\n(c)\n\na coding vulnerability in the SCM application was flagged by a former IHiS\n\nemployee in 2014 in an email sent to a competitor of Allscripts. Although the fact that\nthere was a potential vulnerability in the SCM application was known to the\nmanagement at IHiS at the time, no action was taken to investigate or remedy the\nvulnerability that he found. IHiS submitted that no action was taken at the time because\nit took the view that the vulnerability was not an issue, especially in light of its existing\nsecurity measures and doubts over the credibility of their former employee. Allscripts\nhad also been alerted to the possibility of a vulnerability. Pertinently, the SCM\napplication is Allscripts’ product. Allscripts did not inform IHiS of this apparent coding\nvulnerability and if this vulnerability will be remediated. It was not unreasonable for\nIHiS to assume that Allscripts would have issued a patch as part of its regular software\nsupport had they verified this apparent coding vulnerability. In view of this and the fact\nthat the attacker could have used a different method to exploit the coding vulnerability\nin the SCM client application (that was likely also unknown to Allscripts at the time),\nwhich allowed the attacker to retrieve the SCM database login credentials from the HCloud Citrix Server, the Commissioner accepts that it was not unreasonable for IHiS to\nnot have remedied the apparent coding vulnerability in the SCM application highlighted\nin 2014.\n\n51\n\nAt the SingHealth AC meeting held on 13 October 2017, GIA, which was in charge of ensuring that remediation\nmeasures were implemented and checked upon, stated that the implementation status of past audit issues was\nlargely on track. According to the IHiS Delivery Group, the specific remediation measure of network segregation\nenhancement had already been completed.\n\n45\n\n\f127\n\nFourth, even though IHiS represented that it had communicated to all IHiS non-security\n\nstaff through regular emails, circulars, wallpapers and intranet banners that the SIRT or SMD\nshould be alerted whenever they encounter a suspicious incident, the fact that IHiS employees\nwho first encountered the suspicious activity failed to escalate it to the SIRT, as opposed to\nnotifying an individual who happened to be part of the SIRT, suggests that the approach\nadopted by IHiS (where there was no written IT security incident policy in place and no\ntraining) was inadequate and IHiS non-security staff did not have a good understanding of the\nimportance and requirements for reporting IT security incidents. The SIRM also failed to\ncomply with the SIRF and IR-SOP.52\n128\n\nIn January 2018, when the SIRM was alerted to call-backs to a suspicious foreign IP\n\naddress from the workstations compromised by the attacker, he did not take steps to block that\nIP address for the entire SCM network, or initiate any investigations, which could have\nidentified and contained the compromised workstations before they were eventually used in\nthe attack, including a compromised workstation which was eventually used as a means of\nexfiltration (“January 2018 incident”). The SIRM failed to escalate the January 2018 incident\nas he took the position (which IHiS did not endorse) that this was not a reportable incident as\nit pertained to a malware infection that had been detected and cleaned without network\npropagation. In fact, the SIRM did not make any effort to determine whether there had been\nany such network propagation.\n129\n\nFrom mid-June 2018, when IHiS staff had identified multiple failed login attempts to\n\nthe SCM database originating from the compromised SGH Citrix Servers, using invalid\ncredentials, or accounts that had insufficient privileges, the SIRM failed to escalate or take any\nadditional steps to manage the vulnerabilities, as he was labouring under the misapprehension\nthat a cybersecurity incident should only be escalated when it is “confirmed”. The SIRM failed\nto appreciate that timely incident reporting, in accordance with the relevant IHiS policies and\nstandards on incident reporting, could enable more resources to be deployed to better\ninvestigate and contain a cybersecurity incident.53\n\n52\n\nIn this regard, the Public COI Report also highlighted (at [926] and [927]) that even within the IHiS SMD, the\nprocesses for reporting observations were inconsistent and unclear. There was no established procedure for how\nIHiS staff should escalate a matter internally or how to report a security incident to the SingHealth CISO or the\nSingHealth GCIO. This resulted in confusion and consequent delays in response.\n53\nThe COI also found at ([433] and [593]) that he had delayed reporting because he felt that additional pressure\nwould be put on him and his team once the situation became known to management. The evidence also suggested\n\n46\n\n\f130\n\nAs highlighted in Re National University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5, data\n\nprotection policies and practices are only effective when staff understand and are familiar with\nthe policy and put its security procedures in practice:54\n“In another case, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (“OPC”)\nexplained that whilst security policies and procedures are essential, they are\nnot in themselves sufficient to protect personal information; the effectiveness\nof security safeguards depends on the organisation’s:\n“[d]iligent and consistent execution of security policies and\nprocedures [which] depends to a large extent on ongoing privacy\ntraining of staff and management, so as to foster and maintain a\nhigh organizational awareness of informational security concerns”.\nIn a separate investigation, the OPC further clarified its position and stated\nthat security policies and practices are only effective when “properly and\nconsistently implemented and followed by employees”.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n131\n\nHowever, it was apparent from the response of a number of IHiS staff and in particular,\n\nthe SIRM’s response, that the communications and training provided to them was inadequate\nfor them to fully comprehend and internalise the existing framework and SOPs.\n132\n\nTo be clear, the PDPA does not require organisations to provide an absolute guarantee\n\nfor the protection of the personal data in its possession or under its control. As the\nCommissioner clarified in Re Tiger Airways & Ors. [2017] SGPDPC 6 (at [17]): 55\n“In the context of section 24, this means that an organisation is not required\nto provide an absolute guarantee for the protection of personal data in its\npossession, but that it must make such security arrangements as a\nreasonable person would consider appropriate, given the nature of the\npersonal data involved and the particular circumstances of that\norganisation.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n133\n\nEven so, in consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Data Breach,\n\nthe Commissioner finds that IHiS had not done what a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate to prevent the unauthorised exfiltration of the personal data in the SCM database.\nthat the reluctance to escalate potential security incidents may have come from a belief that it would not reflect\nwell in the eyes of the organisation if the matter turned out to be a false alarm.\n54\nRe National University of Singapore at [24] and [25].\n55\nSee also Re BHG at [25].\n\n47\n\n\fIn view of the very large volume of sensitive medical personal data managed and processed by\nIHiS on behalf of SingHealth, it is reasonable to expect IHiS to accord SingHealth’s IT systems\nand, in particular, the SCM database a higher standard of protection. However, by IHiS’ own\nadmission, the weaknesses, lapses and failures on the part of some IHiS personnel to comply\nwith IHiS’ security framework showed that the administrative or organisational security\nmeasures that IHiS had in place at the time of the Data Breach were inadequate.\n134\n\nAccordingly, even though IHiS had in place a number of security arrangements to\n\nprotect the personal data in its possession or under its control, the Commissioner finds that\nIHiS had not taken sufficient security steps or arrangements to protect the personal data in the\nSCM database from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure and copying.\nDirections\n135\n\nHaving considered the evidence obtained by the Commission during its investigation\n\nand the representations of the parties, the Commissioner is satisfied that both SingHealth and\nIHiS have breached section 24 of the PDPA. The Commissioner is empowered under section\n29 of the PDPA to give such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n136\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs SingHealth to pay a financial penalty of $250,000\n\nwithin 30 days of the issuance of this direction, failing which interest at the rate specified in\nthe Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n137\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs IHiS to pay a financial penalty of $750,000 within\n\n30 days of the issuance of this direction, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules\nof Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount\nof such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n138\n\nThe financial penalties imposed against the two Organisations are individually the\n\nhighest and second highest financial penalty amounts imposed by the Commission to date. This\nis appropriate given the circumstances.\n139\n\nFirst, this is the largest data breach suffered by any organisation in Singapore with the\n\nnumber of affected individuals amounting to almost 1.5 million unique individuals. Second,\n48\n\n\fwhile the attacker managed to exfiltrate the personal data of almost 1.5 million unique\nindividuals, the SCM database which was attacked contained patient data belonging to over\n5.01 million unique individuals whose personal data was put at risk. This increases the\nseriousness of IHiS and SingHealth’s data security inadequacies. The patient data held in the\nSCM database contained highly sensitive and confidential personal data including clinical\nepisode information, clinical documentation, patient diagnosis and health issues and Dispensed\nMedication Records. It is not difficult to imagine the potential embarrassment that a patient\nmay suffer if such sensitive information about the patient and the patient’s health concerns\nwere made known to all and sundry. As such, it is critical for the Organisations to protect the\nsecurity and confidentiality of such medical records. Third, the attacker exfiltrated the\nDispensed Medication Records of 159,000 unique individuals together with the Patient\nParticulars. From the Dispensed Medication Records, one may be able to deduce the condition\nfor which a patient was being treated. This may include serious or socially embarrassing\nillnesses.\nSingHealth’s Representations\n140\n\nSingHealth made representations for a reduction in the quantum of the financial penalty\n\nas set out in the preliminary Decision on the basis that the Commission should factor in the\nprinciple of proportionality in deciding the appropriate financial quantum and the extent to\nwhich SingHealth had failed to discharge its obligations. In this regard, SingHealth represented\nthat they did have in place various security measures which were reasonable to have oversight\nof its data intermediary except in relation to the lapses of an individual.\n141\n\nThe fact that an organisation has adequately implemented other protection policies will\n\nnot operate to absolve or mitigate liability for breaches. In Re Funding Societies Pte Ltd [2018]\nSGPDPC 29, the organisation pleaded in mitigation that it had in place “a framework of\nsecurity arrangements, such as a risk management framework, an information security policy\nand training and audits of its policies and procedures.” In response, the Commissioner stated:56\n“Neither should the fact that the Organisation continuously assessed its\ncompliance with the obligations set out in the PDPA and that it had the\nnecessary frameworks in place mitigatory as these were the standard of\nconduct expected for compliance. These are not activities or measures which\n\n56\n\nRe Funding Societies Pte Ltd at [32] and [33].\n\n49\n\n\fgo beyond the standard of protection required by the PDPA and as such is not\na mitigating factor.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n142\n\nEven in cases where both the organisation and data intermediary have been found to be\n\nin breach of the PDPA, the Commissioner will assess each party’s breach on its own merits\nand circumstances. In calculating the quantum of the financial penalty to be imposed, the\nCommissioner takes an objective approach in assessing the facts and circumstances of the\ncontravention and how a reasonable organisation or data intermediary should have behaved in\nthe circumstances. In this regard, as explained in the Advisory Guidelines on Enforcement of\nthe Data Protection Provisions (issued 21 April 2016) (at [25.2]), one of the factors that the\nCommission may consider to be an aggravating factor includes:\n“the organisation is in the business of handling large volume of sensitive\npersonal data, the disclosure of which may cause exceptional damage,\ninjury or hardship to a person (such as medical or financial data), but\nfailed to put in place adequate safeguards proportional to the harm that\nmight be caused by disclosure of that personal data.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n143\n\nNevertheless, in assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nSingHealth, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nSingHealth voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts, accepted the\n\nCommission’s findings set out in this Decision and had agreed to cooperate with the\nCommission to expedite the Investigation and the determination of liability for each of\nthe parties and issue any directions that the Commission deems fit;\n(b)\n\nSingHealth was constrained, in that, as a matter of policy, all IT functions and\n\ncapabilities for the public healthcare sector (including the proposed structure and\nresourcing for the SingHealth GCIO Office) are centralised in IHiS;\n(c)\n\nSingHealth was cooperative during the Investigation;\n\n(d)\n\nSingHealth took immediate effective remedial action following the Data\n\nBreach; and\n\n50\n\n\f(e)\n\nSingHealth was as much a victim of the malicious actions of a skilled and\n\nsophisticated threat actor who used advanced methods that overcame enterprise security\nmeasures as the individuals whose personal data was illegally accessed and copied.\n144\n\nSimilarly, in assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on IHiS,\n\nthe Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nIHiS voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to liability and had agreed to\n\ncooperate with the Commission to expedite the Investigation and the determination of\nliability for each of the parties and issue any directions that the Commission deems fit;\n(b)\n\nIHiS was cooperative during the Investigation;\n\n(c)\n\nIHiS took immediate effective remedial action following the Data Breach; and\n\n(d)\n\nIHiS was as much a victim of the malicious actions of a skilled and sophisticated\n\nthreat actor who used advanced methods that overcame enterprise security measures as\nthe individuals whose personal data was illegally accessed and copied.\n145\n\nWithout the above mitigating factors, the Commissioner would have imposed the\n\nmaximum financial penalty allowed under the PDPA against IHiS and a financial penalty at a\nsignificantly higher quantum against SingHealth.\n146\n\nThe Commissioner has not set out any further directions for IHiS and SingHealth given\n\nthe remediation measures already put in place.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n51\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $5,000 was imposed on Toppan Forms for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data from unauthorised disclosure.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance","Admin and Support Services","printing"],"date":"2019-01-03","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---AIG-Asia-Pacific-Insurance-and-Toppan-Forms-030119.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Toppan Forms","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2019/01/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-toppan-forms","timestamp":"2019-01-03","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 2\nCase No DP-1702-B0537\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd &\nToppan Forms (S) Pte Ltd\n… Organisations\n\nDECISION\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd & Toppan Forms (S) Pte\nLtd\n[2019] SGPDPC 2\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1702-B0537\n\n3 January 2019.\nBackground\n1\n\nToday’s leading companies are approaching outsourcing in innovative\n\nways to activate, create, integrate and amplify business value. Outsourcing is\nexpected to see growth across all functions, particularly in IT, finance and\nhuman resource1. This will correspondingly result in an increase in the volume\nof data processing activities that is outsourced by organisations to data\nintermediaries.\n2\n\nIt is, therefore, crucial that data intermediaries and the organisations that\n\nengage them understand their respective obligations and those of the other party\nin this data processing relationship. This matter aims to shed some light in this\nregard and addresses the following issues:\n(a)\n\nwhether a data intermediary may have control of the personal\n\ndata that it processes on another organisation’s behalf; and\n\n1\n\nSee Deloitte’s 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey at\nhttps://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/process-andoperations/us-cons-sdt-gos-exec-summary-2016.pdf\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nif yes, in what circumstances would the data intermediary have\n\nsuch control and whether as a result of this; and\n(c)\n\nwhat, if any, are the obligations that the engaging organisation\n\ncontinues to have where the data intermediary is in control of the\npersonal data.\n3\n\nOn 21 February 2017, AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd (“AIG”)\n\ninformed the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nregarding an incident with its printing vendor, Toppan Forms (S) Pte Ltd\n(“Toppan”). Toppan mailed out 87 policy renewal letters (“Policy Renewal\nLetters”) addressed to the respective individual AIG policyholders (“Affected\nCustomers”) enclosing incorrect business reply envelopes (the “Incident”).\nThe incorrectly enclosed business reply envelope was addressed to Tan Chong\nCredit Pte Ltd (“Tan Chong Credit”) instead of AIG.2\n4\n\nThe Commissioner makes the following findings:\n(a)\n\nAIG did not breach section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\n\nAct 2012 (“PDPA”); and\n(b)\n\nToppan breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nMaterial Facts\n5\n\nAIG is one of the leading general insurance companies in Singapore,.\n\n6\n\nThe Incident occurred on or around 10 October 2016, and was\n\ndiscovered by AIG on 2 November 2016 when it contacted an Affected\n\n2\n\nTan Chong Credit is one of AIG's scheme partners.\n\n2\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nCustomer to invite him to renew his motor insurance policy. The Affected\nCustomer informed AIG of the incorrectly inserted business reply envelope.\n7\n\nThe Policy Renewal Letters sent to the Affected Customers enclosed 2\n\nMotor Insurance Renewal Notices. The first notice was to be completed if the\nCustomer wished to also extend the insurance to cover home protection besides\nthe motor insurance. If the Affected Customer only wished to renew the motor\ninsurance, the Customer would only complete the second notice. The Affected\nCustomer was to then return either one of the completed notices to AIG. This\ncould presumably be done either by inserting the completed notice in the\nenclosed business reply envelope or by way of fax as the Organisation’s fax\nnumber was provided.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nThe personal data in each renewal form comprised:\n(a)\n\nThe personal data printed on the first page of both Motor\n\nInsurance Renewal Notices which comprised of an Affected Customer’s\nname, address, make of vehicle together with registration number, hire\npurchase company (if any), motor policy number, premium payable,\nexcess as well as renewal and expiry dates (the “Printed Personal\nData”).\n(b)\n\nIn addition, customers were also required to fill in the second\n\npage of the relevant Motor Insurance Renewal Notice to update AIG of\nthe customers’ marital status, identification number or passport number,\naddress, contact number etc. and input payment details such as credit\ncard number, card holder’s name, and card expiry date (collectively the\n“In-filled Personal Data”).\n\n3\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nPrinted Personal Data and In-filled Personal Data are collectively referred\nto as “Personal Data” in this Decision.\n9\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data in the renewal forms constitutes\n\n“personal data” as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA.\n10\n\nThere is also no dispute that the PDPA applies to AIG and Toppan as\n\nthey both fall within PDPA’s definition of “organisation”.\n11\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commissioner in this case are as\n\nfollows:\n(a)\n\nWhether Toppan was a data intermediary for AIG;\n\n(b)\n\nWhether AIG had complied with its obligations under section 24\n\nof the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nWhether Toppan had complied with its obligations under section\n\n24 of the PDPA.\nToppan was a data intermediary\n12\n\nToppan, pursuant to an agreement dated 1 March 2006 and\n\nsupplemented by Addendum No. 1 dated 24 June 2014 (collectively the\n“Agreement”), agreed to provide printing, collation and delivery services for\nAIG. This would have included printing the Policy Renewal Letters and the\nMotor Insurance Renewal Notices which included the Printed Personal Data.\nTo perform this work, Toppan would have had to record, hold and retrieve the\nPrinted Personal Data, thereby processing personal data on behalf of AIG.\nToppan would also have caused the Affected Customers to transmit the Personal\n4\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nData through the customers use of the business reply envelopes Toppan had\nenclosed with the Policy Renewal Letters to return the notices.\n13\n\nIn the circumstances, the Commissioner finds that Toppan was engaged\n\nto carry out activities of “processing” personal data on behalf of AIG as defined\nin section 2(1) of the PDPA. Toppan was therefore acting as a data intermediary\nof AIG.\nElements of Section 24 under the PDPA\n14\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n15\n\nThe obligation to make reasonable security arrangements does not attach\n\nunless the organisation is in possession or control of personal data.\nAIG and Toppan had possession of the Printed Personal Data\n16\n\nAIG was in possession of the Printed Personal Data. First, AIG had the\n\nPrinted Personal Data of each of the Affected Customers on record as each of\nthem had an existing relationship with AIG. Second, it was AIG who provided\nToppan with the Printed Personal Data.\n17\n\nToppan was in possession of the Printed Personal Data from the moment\n\nit received the data from AIG.\n\n5\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nThe meaning of “control” in the PDPA\n18\n\nWhile there is no definition of “control” in the PDPA, the meaning of\n\ncontrol in the context of data protection is generally understood to cover the\nability, right or authority to determine (i) the purposes for; and/or (ii) the manner\nin which, personal data is processed, collected, use or disclosed.3\n19\n\nThe organisation which engages a data intermediary to process personal\n\ndata on its behalf (in this case AIG) will always have overall control of the\npurposes for which, and manner in which, personal data is processed, collected,\nused or disclosed.\n20\n\nA data intermediary is unlikely to have control over the purposes for\n\nwhich personal data is processed, collected, used or disclosed. If a data\nintermediary has control over the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure\nof the personal data, it is likely to be processing personal data on its own behalf\nrather than on behalf of another organisation.\n21\n\nA data intermediary, however, may be in control over the manner in\n\nwhich personal data is processed, collected, used or disclosed from a practical\nperspective, especially where the data intermediary is in the best position to\ndetermine the specific manner in which the personal data is processed, collected\nused or disclosed and the organisation defers to the data intermediary on how\nbest to process, collect, use or disclose the personal data because of the data\nintermediary’s expertise in the processing of personal data.\n\n3\n\nSee AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 8 at [18].\n\n6\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n22\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nIn the current business environment, where the outsourcing of data\n\nprocessing is increasingly prevalent and has led to a well-developed business\nprocess outsourcing industry, the reality is that these data intermediaries have\nspecialised knowledge and skills and tools including in the area of data\nprocessing, that the organisations which engage them may not have. The fact is\nthat organisations no longer engage data intermediaries just to bring costs down\nbut increasingly because of their expertise and resources available in specific\nareas including in the handling personal data. In these circumstances, such data\nintermediaries are likely to be in the best position to advice or determine the\nmanner in which personal data is processed, collected, used or disclosed and the\nrelevant security measures to be implemented to protect personal data it is\nprocessing.\n23\n\nIn addition, section 4(2) read together with section 24 of the PDPA\n\nsupports the view that a data intermediary may be in control of personal data.\nPursuant to section 4(2), data intermediaries are subject to section 24 of the\nPDPA, which obliges the data intermediary to “protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control…”. A data intermediary may, therefore, be in\npossession of, and/or in control of, personal data.\n24\n\nThis is consistent with the purpose of the PDPA in recognising both the\n\nprotection of personal data and the need for organisations to collect, use and\ndisclose personal data for legitimate purposes.4 A data intermediary that has the\nrelevant expertise, knowledge and/or tools in handling and protecting personal\nand has been trusted with determining the manner in which personal data is\nprocessed is in the best position to protect that personal data; even if the data\n\n4\n\nSection 3 of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nintermediary is not in possession of the personal data it ought to be responsible\nfor the protection of such personal data.\nAIG had control of the Personal Data as a whole\n25\n\nAIG was in control of the Personal Data as a whole, including the In-\n\nfilled Personal Data. Similar to AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte Ltd [2018]\nSGPDPC 8,5 in this case, AIG determined what personal data it required to\nprovide its services and the purposes for which the Personal Data was processed,\ncollected, used and disclosed. In particular, AIG was in a position to decide, and\ndid in fact do so, that in order to provide a better experience for customers when\nrenewing their policies, the Printed Personal Data was pre-filled in the opening\nsection of the renewal form. With respect to the In-filled Personal Data, AIG\nwas responsible for determining what personal data was required from its\ncustomers and the purposes for which the In-filled Personal Data was processed,\ncollected, used and disclosed. Therefore, in so far as the Affected Customers\nwere returning the completed notices with the Personal Data, such Personal\nData was within AIG’s control at the material time.\nToppan also had control of the Personal Data as a whole\n26\n\nToppan\n\nindicates\n\non\n\nits\n\nwebsite\n\nwww.toppanforms.com/eng/about_us.html that the Toppan Forms (Hong\nKong) Group (of which Toppan is part of) “has been providing one-stop total\ninformation management solutions to help our clients find better ways to handle\ninformation asset.”\n\n5\n\nSee [20] and [24]\n\n8\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n27\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nIn fact, Toppan touts its data management expertise in various places on\n\nits website stating that\n“Data Management Services at Toppan Forms is a high security\nbusiness process outsourcing service specialising in data handling.\nISO 9001:2008 Quality Management Certification and ISO 27001:2005\nInformation Security Management Systems Certification guarantee that\nour operations are up to certified international standards. We help you\nmaximize the value of data asset while minimizing handling cost and\ndata leakage risk.\nWe provide a wide range of data management services from data print\nand business mailing service to document digitization.”(emphasis\nadded)\n28\n\nIt is clear from the above that Toppan does not see itself merely as a\n\nvendor that prints forms and mails them out but rather a specialised business\nprocess outsource service with the value proposition that it not just prints forms\nbut ensure data security. This is consistent with clause 3.3 of Addendum No. 1\ndated 24 June 2014, which is part of the Agreement, where in Toppan:\n“represents and warrants to AIG that it has and will continue to have\nindustry best practice administrative, technical, and physical safeguards\nin place to ensure the security and confidentiality and protect against the\nunauthorised or accidental destruction, loss, alternation (sic), use or\ndisclosure of Client Data and other records and Information of AIG’s\ncustomers or employees, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards\nto the integrity of such information and records.” (emphasis added)\n\n9\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n29\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nClient Data is defined in the Addendum to mean “any “personal data”\n\nas defined under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act 26 of 2012), all\nsubsidiary legislation, guidelines, and notices as amended or issued thereunder\nfrom time to time”.\n30\n\nToppan is no ordinary form printing and mailing vendor and instead\n\nrecognises itself as having expertise in the area of data protection and data\nsecurity in relation to its form printing and mailing outsourcing services.\n31\n\nAs explained above, such organisations are likely to have control over\n\nthe means in which personal data is processed, collected, used or disclosed. In\nthis regard, the investigations revealed that Toppan had control over the\nsystems, processes and practices implemented to process the Personal Data in\nthe notices from the time of receipt of the notices from AIG, to the enveloping\nof the Policy Renewal Letters, to the mailing out of these letters, and up to the\nonward transmission of the notices by AIG’s customers by way of returning the\nnotices in the business reply envelopes.\n32\n\nToppan was solely responsible for its enveloping process during which\n\nbusiness reply envelopes were enclosed with the Policy Renewal Letters, and\nwas, therefore, in control of directing the manner and mode in which Affected\nCustomers returned the completed renewal forms (and the Personal Data\ncontained therein). These processes were not dictated by AIG and AIG did not\nhave input in how these processes were drawn up.\n33\n\nGiven the above, Toppan was, like AIG, also in control of the Personal\n\nData as a whole. This is given Toppan’s control over the manner in which the\nPersonal Data was handled and the processes it put in place to print, envelope\nand mail out the Policy Renewal Letters comprising the Personal Data.\n\n10\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nWhether AIG complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n34\n\nAIG had the same obligation in respect of personal data processed on its\n\nbehalf and for its purposes by Toppan as if the personal data were processed by\nAIG itself.6\n35\n\nBased on the investigations, the Commissioner finds that AIG had\n\ncomplied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n36\n\nIn order to take into account obligations under the PDPA, AIG\n\nsupplemented its agreement with Toppan dated 1 March 2006 with Addendum\nNo. 1 dated 24 June 2014. Under Clause 3.2 of the Addendum, the covenants\nmade by Toppan with respect to “Client Data”7 included the following:\n(a)\n\nto inform itself regarding, and comply with, AIG’s privacy\n\npolicies and all applicable privacy laws, including the “Privacy Laws”8;\n(b)\n\nto maintain adequate administrative, technical and physical\n\nsafeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of the “Client\nData”, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security\n\n6\n\nSee Section 4(3) of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\nDefined in the Addendum as “any “personal data” as defined under the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (Act 26 of 2012), all subsidiary legislation, guidelines, and notices\nas amended or issued thereunder from time to time and any information regarding\nAIG’s (and/or its Affiliates) clients or prospective clients received by (Toppan) in\nconnection with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement…”.\n\n8\n\nDefined in the Addendum as “any Singapore laws, rules or regulations relating to\npersonal information or collection, use, storage, disclosure or transfer of personal\ninformation, including the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (Act 26 of 2012), all\nsubsidiary legislation, guidelines, and notices issued thereunder from time to time, as\nmay be amended from time to time”.\n\n11\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nor integrity of the “Client Data”, and protect against unauthorised access\nto, use of or disclosure of “Client Data”.\n37\n\nThe Incident, as will be explained below, was a result of a gap in\n\nToppan’s enveloping process where the necessary checks were not carried out\nand AIG had no part to play in the actual breach.\n\nWhile this does not\n\nautomatically excuse AIG from a finding of a section 24 breach the\nCommissioner is of the view that it would not be reasonable to have required\nAIG to implement any further security arrangements given the circumstances in\nthis case.\n38\n\nToppan’s standard operating procedure, which was updated in January\n\n2017, set out the necessary checks that Toppan had put in place in respect of the\nprinting, enveloping and mailing of the Policy Renewal Letters. This document,\nif followed, would have prevented the Incident. Of course, AIG could have\naudited Toppan’s enveloping process in a “live” environment to confirm that\nthe relevant checks in respect of ensuring the correct Business Reply Envelope\nwas enclosed were being carried out. However, given Toppan’s credibility and\nexpertise in the area of Data Protection Management and data security and\nToppan’s contractual obligation to maintain industry best practices (as opposed\nto mere compliance with the PDPA) in implementing security arrangements,\nany requirement to audit such a seemingly minor part of Toppan’s complete\nprocess would appear to amount to a requirement for AIG to micromanage its\ndata intermediaries’ activities. There may be circumstances where such\nmicromanagement is required, but based on the facts here, this case is not one\nof those circumstances.\n39\n\nGiven the circumstances, the Commissioner does not find AIG to be in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n12\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nWhether Toppan complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n40\n\nAs AIG’s data intermediary, Toppan had an obligation to put in place\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Printed Personal Data and Infilled Personal Data which was in its possession and/or under its control.9\n41\n\nAt the material time, Toppan’s standard operating procedure for\n\nenveloping was as follows (“Toppan’s Enveloping Process”):\n(a)\n\nStep 1 – A supervisor checks for the use of correct stationery\n\nincluding the use of correct business reply envelopes, quantity of letters\nto be printed and the appearance of the print-out.\n(b)\n\nStep 2 - The enveloping employee manually envelopes the\n\nprinted letters according to a check list. The enveloping employee signs\noff as first checker after checking for correct page sequence and dirty or\nmisaligned prints.\n(c)\n\nStep 3 - The supervisor conducts a quality control check by\n\nensuring addressee’s name and address are visible in the envelope\nwindow and that the number of letters enveloped tallies with the\nchecklist. The envelope content is not checked. The supervisor signs off\nas second checker.\n(d)\n\nStep 4 - A manager does a sampling check on content. The\n\nmanager must check content of the first 5, the last 5 and another 5\nrandomly chosen envelopes. The manager then signs off.\n\n9\n\nSee Section 4(2) of the PDPA\n\n13\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n(e)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nStep 5 - The packing employee tallies the number of envelopes\n\nwith the checklist before sealing and sending the envelopes for mailing.\n42\n\nThe investigations found that Toppan’s enveloping employee inserted\n\nthe incorrect business reply envelope because it looked similar to the correct\nreply envelope and failed to submit the unsealed envelopes for the supervisor\nand manager to conduct their respective checks. Also, Toppan’s staff who\npacked the envelopes for mailing did not check for signatures of the supervisor\nand manager before sealing and mailing the enveloped Policy Renewal Letters.\n43\n\nToppan’s Enveloping Process fell far short of the standard protection\n\nrequired for the processing of the Personal Data, and amounted to weak internal\nwork process controls:\n(a)\n\nThe enveloping employee was able to by-pass the relevant\n\nchecks during the Enveloping Process undetected;\n(b)\n\nNo specific instruction was given to the enveloping employee to\n\ncheck that the correct business reply envelope is inserted; and\n(c)\n\nThe packing employee was not instructed to check for signatures\n\nof the supervisor and manager before sealing and mailing the enveloped\nPolicy Renewal Letters.\n44\n\nToppan was processing a significant volume of personal data on behalf\n\nof one of the leading general insurance companies in Singapore. It was therefore\nincumbent on Toppan to put in place reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect this personal data. In this regard, Toppan was fully aware of its\nobligations, and had in fact made specific warranties to implement industry best\n\n14\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\npractice security arrangements with respect to its processing of Personal Data\nas discussed at [28] above.\n45\n\nThe data breach could have been avoided if simple additional steps had\n\nbeen included in Toppan’s Enveloping Process, for example:\n(a)\n\nToppan could have required notification to the assigned\n\nsupervisor and manager before the start of each enveloping job. This\nwould have made it less likely for their respective sampling checks to\nhave been by-passed, as happened in the Incident;\n(b)\n\nToppan could have required its packers to have sight of the\n\nsignatures of the supervisor and manager before sealing and mailing the\nenveloped Policy Renewal Letters; and\n(c)\n\nAs part of the job instructions for each enveloping job, Toppan\n\ncould have required its employee to check that the correct business reply\nenvelope is inserted.\n46\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds Toppan in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\nRemedial Action taken by Toppan\n47\n\nToppan took the following remedial actions after it was notified of the\n\nIncident:\n(a)\n\nThe random sampling size for content checks was increased to\n\n30%;\n\n15\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nThe packers are required to inform the manager or supervisor if\n\nsignatures of the relevant supervisor and manager are not on the\naccompanying checklist;\n(c)\n\nThe relevant supervisor and manager are required to track the\n\nnumber of enveloping jobs. They are also required to ensure all\nenveloping jobs are checked and signed off by them before the batch is\nsent to the packers;\n(d)\n\nEmployees are to be reminded during daily meetings and\n\nmonthly Work Improvement Meetings to strictly follow the standard\noperating procedure for enveloping works; and\n(e)\n\nA stern warning given to the employee responsible for the\n\nIncident.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n48\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that Toppan is in breach of section\n\n24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\nto issue Toppan such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA. This may include directing Toppan to pay a financial penalty of such\namount not exceeding S$1 million.\n49\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on Toppan in this case, the Commissioner also took into account the\nfollowing mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nToppan cooperated fully with the investigations;\n\n16\n\n\fAIG & Toppan\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC\n\nToppan took prompt remedial action to prevent future breaches\n\nof a similar nature from recurring; and\n(c)\n\nThe impact of the data breach was limited. Only 1 Affected\n\nCustomer used the incorrectly inserted business reply envelope.\n50\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs Toppan to pay a financial penalty of S$5000.00 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court10 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue and\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n17\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $11,000 was imposed on Bud Cosmetics for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its customers from unauthorised disclosure.

Since 2007, the Organisation has been collecting\ncustomer information for membership registration. At the time of the Incident, all customers\nwho wished to purchase items from the Organisation’s Website were required to set up a\nmembership account.\n4\n\nAs a matter of practice, the Organisation maintained two separate membership\n\ndatabases. The first database was for customers who registered to become members on its\nWebsite, which was kept in the SQL database and stored on the host server (the “Online\nDatabase”), while the second database was for customers who registered in person at the\nOrganisation’s retail outlets (the “Offline Database”).1 The Offline Database was provided by\nthe Organisation’s vendor as part of its point-of-sale system. At all material times, the Online\nand Offline Databases were not consolidated but were kept and updated separately. Personal\ndata extracted from the Offline Databases was not stored in any folders linked to the Website.\nThe Online Database contained approximately 1,132 members in 2012. At the time of the\n1\n\nAt the time of the investigation, the Organisation represented that there were approximately 5,000 registered\nmembers on the Offline Database.\n\n\finvestigation, the Organisation represented that there were approximately 2,457 registered\nmembers on the Online Database.\n5\n\nAs part of its marketing strategy, the Organisation prepared and sent its customers e-\n\nnewsletters with information about its products and the latest promotional offers. A customer\nmailing list for each e-newsletter was generated by selecting members’ email addresses from\nboth the Online and Offline Databases based on certain criteria. When generating this list, the\nOrganisation would only extract email addresses from both the Online and Offline Databases.\nThey would not extract the other types of personal data and combine the records into a\nmasterlist; the Organisation confirmed that apart from the email addresses for the purposes of\nsending out marketing newsletters, it did not combine the datasets from the Online and Offline\ndatabases. To reduce the file size of each e-newsletter, the Organisation intentionally kept the\nimages embedded in the e-newsletters in publicly accessible image folders. Once an enewsletter was sent out, the customer mailing list for that particular e-newsletter would be kept\nin an archive folder. The image folders and customer mailing lists were managed and generated\nby the owner of the Organisation.\n6\n\nOn or around 6 April 2017, the Complainant, who was a member of the Organisation,\n\ndiscovered a URL link to the Member List in the search results when she conducted a search\nusing her name on the Internet. The Member List contained the following personal data of\napproximately 2,300 members:\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nname;\n\n(b)\n\ndate of birth;\n\n(c)\n\ncontact number;\n\n(d)\n\nemail address; and\n\n(e)\n\nresidential address.\n\nThe Member List was located in the image folder for an e-newsletter that was sent out\n\nin 2012 (“2012 Image Folder”). At the time, the 2012 Image Folder was hosted on SmartyHost\nPty Ltd’s (“SmartyHost”) servers based in Australia. However, following a cyberattack\nincident on SmartyHost’s “osCommerce” system in April 2012 (“2012 Cyberattack\n\n\fIncident”) and unplanned server outages which resulted in website downtime, the Organisation\nswitched web hosting companies in 2013 and engaged Just Host Inc (“Just Host”), a United\nStates (“US”) based company with servers located in Provo, Utah.\n8\n\nAfter it was notified of the Incident, the Organisation deleted the Member List from the\n\n2012 Image Folder as well as the e-newsletter image folders created from 2006 to 2016. The\nOrganisation also sought to improve the security of its Website by activating “Sitelock”, an\nadd-on feature offered by Just Host which conducts daily scans of its Website for\nvulnerabilities and malware.\nCause of the Incident\n9\n\nInvestigations found that search engines were able to access and index the URL link to\n\nthe Member List contained in the 2012 Image Folder because the 2012 Image Folder was\nunsecured. The Organisation represented that, prior to the notification from the Commission,\nit was unaware of the existence of the Member List, or how it ended up in the 2012 Image\nFolder. However, it hypothesised that the Member List may have been inserted into the 2012\nImage Folder as a result of the 2012 Cyberattack Incident as that was the only known occasion\nin 2012 where the Organisation had encountered problems with its Website. In the 2012\nCyberattack Incident, hackers exploited a vulnerability in SmartyHost’s osCommerce system\nto send spam emails via the “tell-a-friend” function on the system.\n10\n\nHaving considered the evidence and findings of the investigation, the Commissioner is\n\nnot convinced by the Organisation’s hypothesis. The vulnerability of the “tell-a-friend” feature\ndoes not appear to be in any way connected to the unauthorised extraction of data from the\nOnline Database. More pertinently, the claim that the Incident had occurred in 2012 seems\nimprobable given that the number of members contained in the Member List exceeded the\nnumber of online-registered members in 2012 (when they had only approximately 1,132\nmembers). While the Member List could possibly be a combination of 2012-registered\nmembers of both the Online and Offline Databases, it is unlikely to be the case as the\nOrganisation had not combined both Databases (save for the combination of email addresses\nfor the mailing list) or linked the Offline Database to the Website such that an exploitation of\nthe “tell-a-friend” feature could have led to the access of the Offline Database.\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n11\n\nThe main issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under section 12(a) of\nthe PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA; and\n\n(c)\n\nwhether the Organisation complied with its transfer limitation obligation under\nsection 26 of the PDPA.\n\n12\n\nThere was no question or dispute that the data disclosed in the Member List was\n\n“personal data” as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA as it was clearly possible to identify an\nindividual from that data.\n13\n\nIn this regard, although the Member List contained personal data that was collected\n\nbefore the PDPA came into full force on 2 July 2014 (“Appointed Day”), as the Organisation\ncontinued to use the personal data after the Appointed Day, it was incumbent on the\nOrganisation to take proactive steps to comply with its obligations under the PDPA in respect\nof not only new personal data that may come into its possession or control but any existing\npersonal data held in its possession or control.2\n14\n\nAs the Commissioner highlighted in Re Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 (at\n\n[11]):\nThis means that, for example, if there were no security arrangements previously\nto protect the existing personal data the organisation was holding, the\norganisation has a positive duty to put in place security arrangements after the\nAppointed Day. It was not enough for the organisation to leave things status quo,\nif this would not enable the organisation to meet the requirements and standards\nof the Protection Obligation. As provided in Section 24 of the PDPA, the security\narrangements must be “reasonable”.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n2\n\nSee Re Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at [10].\n\n\f15\n\nAccordingly, the Organisation was under an obligation to comply with the data\n\nprotection provisions under the PDPA in respect of both personal data that was collected before\nand after the Appointed Day.\nWhether the Organisation breached section 12(a) of the PDPA\n16\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA imposes an obligation on organisations to develop and\n\nimplement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA. Organisations are also required to communicate to its staff information about\nsuch policies and practices.\n17\n\nThe Organisation represented that it had a privacy policy on its Website (“Privacy\n\nPolicy”) at the time of the Incident. However, the Privacy Policy (which was last updated in\nDecember 2006) only notified customers as to how the Organisation will use and process their\npersonal data and did not set out any procedures or practices as to how the Organisation and its\nemployees should handle and protect the personal data in their possession or under their\ncontrol.\n18\n\nIn any case, by the Organisation’s own admission, prior to being notified by the\n\nCommission, the Organisation was under the impression that the PDPA only prohibited\norganisations from sending marketing messages to Singapore telephone numbers that were\nregistered with the Do Not Call (“DNC”) Registry. The Organisation confirmed3 that it did not\nimplement any data protection policies or practices in respect of the personal data in its\npossession or under its control as it was not aware of its Data Protection Obligations under the\nPDPA.4 In response, to questions on the Organisation’s data protection policies and practices,\nthe Organisation responded that the questions were “(n)ot applicable as we do not currently\nhave a policy/ procedure document. However, we would appreciate any assistance in drafting\nsuch a policy document for our staff”.\n19\n\nFor completeness, the investigations found that the Organisation had begun drafting a\n\nnew Data Protection Policy prior to the Incident in February 2017, when it claimed to be\nunaware of its Data Protection Obligations. However, on balance, the Commissioner accepts\nthe Organisation‘s representation that it had only drafted the Data Protection Policy because\n3\n4\n\nSee the Organisation’s response to the Commission’s Notice to Produce dated 10 May 2017 at [2.8].\nUnder Parts III to VI of the PDPA.\n\n\f“during our research of other major local beauty retailer websites we noticed the section on\nData Protection Policy section [sic.] on their websites. Hence we thought we should include a\nsimilar detailed policy on ours”. The new Data Protection Policy was only implemented after\nthe Incident in June 2017, when the Organisation launched its new Website.\n20\n\nIn this regard, it is a trite principle of law that ignorance of the law is no excuse. The\n\nOrganisation’s lack of awareness of its obligations under the PDPA cannot excuse its breach\nof the PDPA and is not a legitimate defence to a breach.5 It bears repeating that the development\nand implementation of data protection policies is a fundamental and crucial starting point for\norganisations to comply with their obligations under the PDPA. As the Commissioner\nhighlighted in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 (at [32]):\nData protection policies and practices developed and implemented by an\norganisation in accordance with its obligations under section 12 of the PDPA are\ngenerally meant to increase awareness and ensure accountability of the\norganisation’s obligations under the PDPA.\n21\n\nData protection training is also an effective and necessary mode of communicating the\n\nOrganisation’s policies and practices and is a key aspect of the Openness Obligation under\nsection 12 of the PDPA.6 Employees will only be able to protect personal data if they are first\nable to recognise when a matter requires data protection considerations. In this regard, the\nCommissioner agrees with the following observations in the Joint Guidance Note issued by the\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the Office of the Information and Privacy\nCommissioner of Alberta and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for\nBritish Columbia:7\nTraining and general education on privacy are very important. Our Offices have\nseen instances where issues were not identified as privacy issues when they\nshould have been. As a result, appropriate steps were not taken to prevent or\naddress privacy breaches. In other cases, we have seen a lack of awareness or\nappreciation for privacy risks on the part of employees result in the development\nof products or services that were not compliant with applicable privacy law. In\nAlberta, human error is the most common cause of reported breaches resulting\nin a real risk of significant harm to an individual. Examples include: misdirected\nS\n\nM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 (at [16]).\nSee Re Habitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 9 (at [14]).\n7\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta\nand the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia, Getting Accountability Right\nwith a Privacy Management Program <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/thepersonal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda-compliance-help/pipedacompliance-and-training-tools/gl_acc_201204/> at p 13.\n6\n\n\ffaxes and mail, e-mail addresses viewable in mass e-mails, inappropriate\ndisposal of documents, and disclosure of passwords.\nEmployees will be able to better protect privacy when they are able to recognize\na matter as one that involves personal information protection.\n[Emphasis added.]\n22\n\nHowever, apart from instructing its employees on the requirements under the DNC\n\nprovisions of the PDPA, 8 the Organisation did not provide any formalised data protection\ntraining for its employees. Accordingly, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation had\nbreached section 12(a) of the PDPA given that at the time of the Incident the Organisation did\nnot develop and implement a data protection policy as necessary for it to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA\n23\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. The Member List containing the personal data of the Organisation’s online-registered\nmembers was located in an image folder that belonged to and was at all material times\ncontrolled by the Organisation. Accordingly, the Commissioner finds that the Member List was\nin the Organisation’s possession. The Organisation was also in control of the personal data as\nit had the ability, right and/or authority to determine what personal data was required to provide\nits services and the purposes for, and the manner in which it was collected, used and disclosed.9\nSuch control was demonstrated when it generated the respective e-newsletter customer mailing\nlists and when it deleted the Member List upon being notified of the Incident.\n24\n\nWhile the cause of the Incident cannot be determined with certainty after investigations,\n\nthe fact remains that the Member List was generated and inserted into the 2012 Image Folder.\nThe common law maxim res ipsa loquitur applies even though the Organisation showed a clear\n\n8\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation represented that it had instructed the members of its sales team to ensure that\nthey require customers to indicate if they want to be contacted by the Organisation when they sign up to be a\nmember and to inform the customer that their data will not be sold or offered to any third party. The Organisation\nalso represented that it only sent text messages via SMS to customers whose numbers were not on the DNC\nRegistry.\n9\nThe meaning of control as set out in AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 8 at [18].\n\n\flack of knowledge of how and when this happened. As the Website administrator, the\nOrganisation was responsible for ensuring the security of the Website such as by conducting\nperiodic penetration testing or vulnerability assessments and ensuring that any vulnerabilities\nare reviewed and promptly fixed to prevent data breaches. However, by the Organisation’s own\nadmission, prior to being informed of the Incident, the Organisation never considered the\nadequacy of the security of its Website or information technology system (“IT system”) and\ndid not put in place any security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or\nunder its control. At the time of the Incident, the Organisation had never conducted any\nvulnerability scans or penetration tests to ensure that its Website was sufficiently protected.\n25\n\nAs mentioned above, the Organisation was unaware of its Data Protection Obligations\n\nunder the PDPA at the time of the Incident and therefore did not have any policies or procedures\nin place to guide its employees regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data in\nits possession or under its control. Consequently, the Organisation did not implement any\nchecks and controls to prevent or minimise the risk of unauthorised disclosure of personal data.\nBy way of example, the Organisation failed to implement procedures for the generation of\nMember List, use of Member List for sending e-newsletters and deletion of Member List after\ne-newsletters have been sent. Given the Organisation’s practice of retaining the publicly\naccessible e-newsletter image folders for extended periods, proper housekeeping should have\nbeen conducted to ensure that all publicly accessible folders did not contain extraneous files,\nincluding stray copies of Member List.\n26\n\nAs mentioned in the Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium, managing\n\ninfo-communication technology systems security and risks related to data breaches requires\ngood governance. It is a good practice for organisations to:\n“Conduct periodic checks for personal data stored in ICT systems. For personal\ndata that is not required in any form anymore, securely dispose the data (refer to\nsection 8). If there is a need to retain the data but not in identifiable form, e.g.\nfor performing data analytics, consider anonymising the data.” 10\n27\n\nIn light of the absence of any security arrangements to protect the personal data from\n\nunauthorised disclosure, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation has contravened section\n24 of the PDPA.\n\n10\n\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium at [4.1].\n\n\fWhether the Organisation breached section 26 of the PDPA\n28\n\nUnder section 26 of the PDPA, unless otherwise exempted,11 an organisation shall not\n\ntransfer any personal data to a country or territory outside Singapore except in accordance with\nrequirements prescribed under the PDPA to ensure that organisations provide a standard of\nprotection to personal data so transferred that is comparable to the protection under the PDPA.\nThe regulations issued under the PDPA specify the conditions under which an organisation\nmay transfer personal data outside Singapore.\n29\n\nIn particular, regulation 9(1) of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014 provides\n\nthat an organisation must take appropriate steps to:\n(a)\n\nensure that the transferring organisation will comply with the Data Protection\nObligations under the PDPA, in respect of the transferred personal data while it\nremains in the possession or under the control of the transferring organisation;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nascertain whether, and to ensure that, the recipient of the personal data in that\ncountry or territory outside Singapore (if any) is bound by legally enforceable\nobligations12 to provide the transferred personal data a standard of protection\nthat is at least comparable to the protection under the PDPA.\n\n30\n\nIn this regard, it was not disputed that the Organisation had engaged SmartyHost and\n\nJust Host to host its Website and the Online Database. As mentioned above, SmartyHost was\nbased in Australia and Just Host is based in the US. Both companies had servers located outside\nSingapore.\n31\n\nWhile personal data collected and transferred overseas before the Appointed Day are\n\nnot subject to the obligations under the PDPA, a substantial portion of the personal data in the\nOnline Database was collected and transferred to Just Host’s servers located in the US after the\n\n11\n\nA transferring organisation is taken to have satisfied the requirements to ascertain and ensure that the recipient\nof the personal data outside Singapore is bound by legally enforceable obligations to provide a comparable\nstandard of protection in the situations set out in regulation 9(3) of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014.\n12\nAs defined under regulation 10 of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2014.\n\n\fAppointed Day, and are therefore subject to the Transfer Limitation Obligation under the\nPDPA. Specifically, the number of members in the Online Database had increased from 1,635\nmembers on 29 December 2014 to 2,457 members on 10 April 2017.\n32\n\nBy engaging the services of Just Host to host its Website and Online Database on its\n\nserver in the US, the Organisation had effectively transferred personal data outside Singapore.\nHowever, as the Organisation was not aware of the transfer limitation requirement under the\nPDPA, the Organisation admitted that it did not ask or even consider the location of the web\nhosting company’s servers to be a relevant factor when it engaged Just Host to provide web\nhosting services. The Organisation therefore failed to undertake the most fundamental step of\nconsidering whether US federal and state laws provided protection comparable to the PDPA.\nIt is not necessary for the Commissioner to venture any opinion whatsoever on the issue of\nwhether US law provided comparable protection in order to find that the Organisation, having\nbeen ignorant of its obligation to do so, had in fact failed to undertake the most fundamental\nstep of considering this issue. This omission is sufficient, ipso facto, to put the Organisation in\nbreach of section 26 of the PDPA.\n33\n\nHad the Organisation undertaken the fundamental step of considering whether US law\n\nprovided comparable protection, it could have arrived at two possible conclusions. First, it may\ndecide that there is no further requirement for it to impose any additional safeguards by contract\nas it concluded that US law provided comparable protection. Second, it may decide that there\nare areas that US law does not provide comparable protection and it may then impose\ncontractual obligations on Just Host to ensure that it provided a standard of protection\ncomparable to the PDPA in respect of the personal data transferred. Needless to say, the\nOrganisation never reached this set of considerations since it omitted to even undertake the\nmost fundamental step.\n34\n\nIn this regard, organisations that choose to engage IT vendors that are either located\n\noverseas or have servers located outside Singapore are reminded of their obligations under\nsection 26 of the PDPA. If the personal data of individuals have to be transferred from\nSingapore to the overseas destination, organisations will need to ascertain whether and ensure\nthat the recipient of the personal data outside Singapore is bound by legally enforceable\nobligations to provide the transferred personal data a standard of protection that is at least\ncomparable to the protection under the PDPA.\n\n\f35\n\nTherefore, by the Organisation’s own admission, the Commissioner finds that the\n\nOrganisation failed to discharge its duties under section 26 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations\n36\n\nThe Organisation made representations for a reduction in the quantum of the financial\n\npenalty as set out below at paragraph 38(a) on the basis that the retail industry is facing a\nfinancial downturn. The financial information adduced by the Organisation to justify its request\ndid not show any significant drop in income. Having duly considered the matters raised in the\nrepresentations, the Commissioner has decided to maintain his decision on the quantum of the\nfinancial penalty.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n37\n\nHaving found that the SCA is in breach of sections 12(a), 24 and 26 of the PDPA, the\n\nCommissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n38\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nto pay a financial penalty of S$11,000 within 30 days from the date of this\n\ndirection, failing which, interest at a rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts, shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until the financial penalty is paid in full;\n(b)\n\nto engage duly qualified personnel to conduct a security audit of its Website and\n\nIT system and furnish a schedule stating the scope of risks to be assessed and the time\nwithin which a full report of the audit can be provided to the office of the Commissioner\nwithin 30 days from the date of this direction;\n(c)\n\nto develop an IT security policy to guide its employees on the security of\n\npersonal data on its Website and IT system within 60 days from the date of completion\nof the above security audit; and\n\n\f(d)\n\nto implement a training policy for employees of the Organisation handling\n\npersonal data to be trained to be aware of, and to comply with the requirements of the\nPDPA when handling personal data; and to require all employees to attend such training\nwithin 90 days from the date of this direction.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $30,000 was imposed on Funding Societies for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of its members.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance","financing platform"],"date":"2018-12-13","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Funding-Societies-Pte-Ltd---131218.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Funding Societies","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/12/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-funding-societies","timestamp":"2018-12-13","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\nCase No DP-1708-B1035\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1708-B1035\n\n13 December 2018\n\nBACKGROUND\n1\n\nOn 14 August 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received an email notification from the Organisation. The\nOrganisation is the operator of an online financing platform that connects\nborrowers and investors (the “Website”). Individuals who used the Website\nwould have to register for an account, either as an “Investor” or a “Borrower”\n(collectively, “Members”). Each Member was given a unique identifier, which\nwas generated sequentially (the “MemberID”).\n2\n\nIn its email notification, the Organisation informed the Commission that\n\none of its Members, [Redacted] (Replaced with “Mr J”), had emailed them on\n25 July 2017 to inform that he had found a vulnerability with the Website. To\nillustrate this, Mr J showed the Organisation the personal details of two other\nMembers that he had extracted from the Website (the “data breach”). The\nOrganisation took immediate action to rectify the vulnerability and was able to\ndo so by 26 July 2017.\n3\n\nAfter receipt of the email notification from the Organisation, the\n\nCommission proceeded to investigate into an alleged breach of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nMATERIAL FACTS\nThe Website’s vulnerability\n4\n\nOn 19 June 2017, the Organisation rolled out new system components\n\nfor the Website. This update gave rise to a vulnerability in the Website’s\nsecurity system, the details of which are summarised below.\n5\n\nWhen a Member successfully logged into the Website using his\n\nusername and password, his browser received an authentication token from the\nWebsite’s server.1 This token contained the user’s MemberID and granted the\nuser access to the Website. Simultaneously, his browser also received an\nauthorisation token, containing the same MemberID. The authorisation token\ncontrolled the functions and type of data that the particular user could access.\nOperating together, the two valid tokens (ie authentication and authorisation\ntokens, which shared the same MemberID) granted the logged-in user access to\nthe Website’s functions and data from his own Member account.\n6\n\nHowever, the Organisation’s in-house Website developers did not\n\nprogramme the Website to require both tokens to contain the same MemberID.\nWhen a logged-in user carried out a browsing activity on the Website, the\nsecurity system only verified that the user’s authentication token was valid, and\nthereafter granted data access based on the MemberID in the authorisation\ntoken, without ensuring that the MemberIDs in both tokens were identical.\n\n1\n\nA token is part of the request command from the browser to the Website. Token based\nauthentication works by ensuring that each request to a server is accompanied by a\nsigned token which the server verifies for authenticity and only then responds to the\nrequest.\n\n2\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n7\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nAs a result, a Member who had successfully logged into the Website\n\n(under an authentication token which carried his MemberID) could browse\nanother Member’s data by changing the MemberID in the authorisation token.\nThe Organisation suspects that this is how Mr J had gained unauthorised access.\n8\n\nThe investigations revealed that the Organisation became aware of this\n\nvulnerability on 7 July 2017, 18 days before the data breach occurred. The\nvulnerability was detected by a member of the Organisation’s engineering team.\nUpon discovery, the Organisation initially planned to roll out a quick-fix within\na week, and thereafter to have a complete fix within a month.\n9\n\nAccording to the Organisation, a quick-fix was rolled out on 11 July\n\n2017, but had to be retracted on the same day as it caused the Website’s mobile\napplications to crash. The Organisation then worked on finding a fix that would\nclose out the vulnerability without causing the Website’s mobile applications to\ncrash.\n10\n\nOn 20 July 2017, the Organisation rolled out a partial-fix for about 25%\n\nof their “endpoints”.2 They did not roll out the entire fix as they wanted to\n“minimise the chances of inducing a negative effect” on their system. Although\nthere was no evidence that this partial-fix had solved the vulnerability, the\nOrganisation claimed that if Mr J had attempted access through one of the fixed\nendpoints, he would have been denied access to the data.\n11\n\nBefore the Organisation could roll out a complete fix for the\n\nvulnerability, Mr J informed them of the data breach on 25 July 2017. The\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation explained that the “endpoint” referred to a function defined on the\ngateway which had a HTTP URL. The Commission understands the “endpoint” in this\ncase to refer to the server which controlled access to their data.\n\n3\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nOrganisation escalated the matter as top priority and rolled out the complete fix\nwithin 24 hours of Mr J’s report.\n12\n\nIn total, the vulnerability lasted for about 37 days.\n\nThe affected Personal Data\n13\n\nMr J had accessed and extracted the personal data of two Members. In\n\nparticular, the personal data that had been extracted included the Members’\nCustomer ID, name, NRIC number, and residential address.\n14\n\nWhile there was no further evidence of unauthorised access, the\n\ninvestigations revealed that the personal data of all the Organisation’s existing\nMembers were also at risk of disclosure. At the time of the data breach, the\npersonal data collected and held by the Organisation numbered in the thousands.\nThe personal data that was at risk of disclosure included a Member’s Customer\nID, NRIC number, account username, first and last name, telephone number,\nmarital status, spouse’s name, residential address, bank account details (for\ninvestors), subscription agreement (for investors), crowdfunding settings (for\ninvestors), suitability assessment settings (for investors), wallet account balance\n(for investors), and company details (for borrowers).\n15\n\nNotably, an unauthorised user would have been able to pretend to be\n\nanother user by using the other user’s MemberID as the authorisation token to\nperform certain functions in respect of the other user’s account. In particular,\nthis included:\n(a)\n\nUsing the Investor’s account to contact prospective Borrowers;\n\n(b)\n\nUpdating a Member’s personal details (subject to actual\n\nverification of the details);\n4\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n(c)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nProviding feedback to the Organisation on behalf of the\n\nMember;\n(d)\n\nChanging the Member’s email address which was used to\n\nsubscribe to the Organisation’s newsletter; and\n(e)\n16\n\nAltering the auto-investment settings of an Investor’s account.\n\nWith regard to paragraph 15(e), it was revealed that an unauthorised user\n\nwould have been able to delete the Member’s auto-investment settings, or to\nalter the parameters for the Member’s auto-investment settings. Such an\nalteration of the auto-investment parameters may have caused the Member to\nmake an investment which he had not initially intended or to fail to make an\ninvestment which he may have wanted.\n17\n\nThere was no evidence that Mr J, or any other person, had performed\n\nany of the unauthorised functions in paragraph 15.\nThe Organisation’s Remedial Measures\n18\n\nFollowing the incident, the Organisation immediately requested Mr J to\n\ndelete the data which he had accessed as a results of the vulnerability. Although\nthe Organisation had requested written confirmation for this, they were only\nable to obtain verbal confirmation from Mr J that the data had been deleted.\n19\n\nThe Organisation also took the following remedial actions to resolve the\n\nWebsite’s vulnerability:\n(a)\n\nIntroduce a more robust logging system to log all unauthorised\n\naccess to user account data;\n\n5\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\n(b)\n\nForming an internal quality assurance team (“QA team”);\n\n(c)\n\nImplementing documentation requirements which required the\n\nQA team to create and maintain details of test cases and test results;\n(d)\n\nApplying secure connection technologies or protocols, such as\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, to all websites and web\napplications handling personal data;\n(e)\n\nStoring documents containing personal data on Amazon Web\n\nService’s Simple Storage Service (S3), which allows the storage of data\nin private buckets that require credential keys which are provided only\nwhen requests are authenticated; and\n(f)\n\nDeveloping and implementing policies and procedures to\n\nmanage future rollouts of new system components.\nFINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n20\n\nThe key issue to be determined is whether the Organisation had\n\ncomplied with its data protection obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n21\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect the personal\n\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n22\n\nAs to the standard of reasonable security arrangements, the\n\nCommissioner has clarified in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 that\norganisations must protect personal information by implementing security\n\n6\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nsafeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information and that “more\nsensitive information should be safeguarded by a higher level of protection”.3\n23\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation possessed a wide range of personal\n\ndata of their Members, including financial information such as bank account\ndetails and wallet account balance. The Commissioner considers the financial\ninformation of an individual to be “sensitive personal data”.4 It is also\nnoteworthy that such sensitive personal data was readily accessible on the\nWebsite via a logged-in account.\n24\n\nHaving considered the material facts, the Commissioner found that the\n\nOrganisation did not have reasonable security arrangements in place to prevent\nthe unauthorised access, use and disclosure of personal data in its possession.\n25\n\nFirst, the Organisation did not have adequate security arrangements on\n\ntheir Website to ensure that Members could only access their own information\nand perform functions on their own accounts. The decoupling of authentication\nand authorisation into two separate tokens was a deliberate design decision on\nthe Organisation’s part so as to “enable stateless API development”. However,\nthe Website should have been equipped with a security measure to ensure that\nthe two tokens carried the same MemberID before granting access to data.\n26\n\nIn the Commissioner’s view, implementing such a security measure was\n\na necessary step that the Organisation should have taken after decoupling the\ntokens. The lack of such security measures was a fundamental mistake on the\nOrganisation’s part, and left a glaring vulnerability in the Website. Indeed, this\n\n3\n\nAviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at paragraph [19].\n\n4\n\nCredit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 18 at paragraph [15].\n\n7\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nvulnerability was so obvious that the Organisation’s own engineer had\ndiscovered it in the course of his routine work.\n27\n\nSecond, the Organisation did not adequately test the security of their\n\nWebsite. The Organisation claimed that they had conducted testing prior to the\nrollout of the new Website components, but were unable to provide\ndocumentation of such testing. In any case, the Organisation explained that the\ntests focused on functionality and load testing of the Website, but not on the\nsecurity and protection mechanisms. In this regard, it was clear to the\nCommissioner that the Organisation had failed to conduct the necessary security\ntests on its Website. Consequently, the Organisation failed to identify the\nvulnerability during its testing stage.\n28\n\nThird, the vulnerability in the Website could be exploited with relative\n\nease. A Member who had some understanding of web technology would have\nbeen able to change the MemberID on the authorisation token, thereby granting\nhim access to another Member’s profile. While making such a change was not\nas simple as manipulating the URL, the Commissioner noted that the tools\nnecessary to make such changes were not sophisticated and were readily\navailable online. Crucially, the fact that MemberIDs were generated in a\nsequential order made it even easier for Members to guess other Members’\nMemberIDs.\n29\n\nFourth, the Organisation failed to appreciate the degree of risk that the\n\nvulnerability posed to the personal data in their possession. This was evident in\ntheir treatment of the vulnerability after their engineer discovered the breach.\nThey had resolved to fix the vulnerability on 7 July 2018 but did not actually\nprioritise this until the breach occurred on 25 July 2018. The Organisation’s\nexplanation that it had only rolled out 25% of the partial-fixes to minimise the\n\n8\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nimpact on their system revealed that they were uncertain about the effectiveness\nand compatibility of their partial-fix. It also reflected that they had not taken the\nvulnerability seriously, and that they were in no rush to fix the vulnerability so\nlong as their business remained operational.\n30\n\nAs such, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation had failed to\n\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its\npossession and within its control. The Organisation is, therefore, in breach of\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n31\n\nThe Organisation made representations following the issuance of a\n\npreliminary Decision to the Organisation. The representations did not\nsubstantively address the Commissioner’s decision to find the Organisation in\nbreach of its obligations under the PDPA but were in the nature of a request to\nconsider mitigating circumstances. The Commissioner has considered the\nrepresentations and has decided to maintain the directions in the preliminary\nDecision.\n32\n\nThe representations made by the Organisation are summarised below:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation is a relatively young enterprise that has been\n\nin operation for less than 4 years and while, it takes “all reasonable\nefforts to ensure that any security issues and deficiencies are identified,\nhandled and remedied on a proactive basis”, there are some issues or\ndeficiencies that it reactively dealt with. In the present case, once the\nincident was known, the Organisation notified PDPC of its breach\nvoluntarily; and\n\n9\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 29\n\nexpanded reasonable efforts to remediate the incident promptly;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation continued to assess the data breach incident\n\nafter its remediation efforts to develop long term procedures to prevent\nsimilar occurrences in the future;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation had in place a framework of security\n\narrangements, such as a risk management framework, an information\nsecurity policy and training and audits of its policies and procedures;\n(d)\n\nOnly the data of two individuals were actually disclosed in the\n\nincident and no actual loss or damage was suffered; the actual\ncompromised data did not include any financial information.\nFurthermore, the Organisation received verbal confirmation from the\nindividual who discovered the flaw in the system that he had deleted the\npersonal data of the two individuals that he extracted.\n33\n\nThe Commissioner did not consider being a young organisation to be a\n\nmitigating factor. Neither should the fact that the Organisation continuously\nassessed its compliance with the obligations set out in the PDPA and that it had\nthe necessary frameworks in place mitigatory as these were the standard of\nconduct expected for compliance. These are not activities or measures which go\nbeyond the standard of protection required by the PDPA and as such is not a\nmitigating factor.\n34\n\nWith respect to point (d) above, this had already been taken into\n\nconsideration when the Commissioner decided on the financial penalty.\n\n10\n\n\fFunding Societies Pte.

Today, we live\n\nin a world of tweets and texts, email and instant messaging. This case shows\nthat when sending documents containing a significant volume of personal data\nby email, it is important for organisations to have in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect these documents from unauthorised access by\nunintended recipients.\n2\n\nOn 27 November 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received notification from the Institute of Singapore Chartered\nAccountants (“ISCA”) that one of its employees inadvertently sent an email\nattaching a Microsoft Excel document containing personal data of 1,906\nindividuals (the “Excel File”) to an unintended recipient (the “Incident”).\n3\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found\n\nISCA in breach of section 24 of Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nEstablished in 1963, ISCA is the national professional body for\n\naccountants in Singapore with about 32,000 members. ISCA is the\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nAdministrator of the Singapore Chartered Accountant Qualification and the\ndesignated body to confer the “Chartered Accountant of Singapore”\ndesignation.\n5\n\nOn or about 23 November 2017, as part of business operations, 2 ISCA\n\nemployees (the “First Employee” and the “Second Employee”, collectively\nthe “Employees”) were unable to open the Excel File (stored on ISCA’s internal\nshared drive) as it appeared to be corrupted. The Employees sought the\nassistance of ISCA’s IT department. Arising from this, ISCA’s IT Support\nSpecialist sent an email to the System/Network Engineer from the ICT\ndepartment to recover the Excel File from the backup server, and to send the\nrecovered Excel File to the Employees.\n6\n\nOn 24 November 2017, the System/Network Engineer created an email\n\nto send the recovered Excel File as an attachment to the Employees (the\n“Subject Email”). As the earlier email from the IT Support Specialist did not\ninclude the Employees in the addressee list, the System/Network Engineer had\nto specifically insert the Employees in the recipient section of the Subject Email.\nDue to the auto-complete feature in Microsoft Outlook’s email software, the\nSystem/Network Engineer inadvertently selected an accounts manager (the\n“Unintended Recipient”)1 in a listed telecommunications service provider\n(“Telco”) instead of the First Employee as they both had the same first name.\nThe Subject Email containing the Excel File was therefore sent to the IT Support\nSpecialist, the Second Employee and the Unintended Recipient. The Excel File\nwas not encrypted with a password.\n\n1\n\nThe Unintended Recipient was the designated accounts manager to communicate with ISCA\non services provided by the Telco to ISCA.\n\n2\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n7\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nThe Excel File listed 1,906 candidates in the ISCA Professional\n\nExamination programme. The personal data2 of the candidates which were\ndisclosed include the following:\n(a)\n\nNRIC numbers;\n\n(b)\n\nPassport numbers;\n\n(c)\n\nName;\n\n(d)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(e)\n\nPostal Address;\n\n(f)\n\nEmail Address;\n\n(g)\n\nMobile Phone Numbers;\n\n(h)\n\nEmployment history records;\n\n(i)\n\nQualification records;\n\n(j)\n\nExam results; and\n\n(k)\n\nAppeal status of their candidature.\n\n(collectively, the “Subject Data”)\n8\n\nThe Second Employee discovered the mistake within 10 minutes of the\n\nSubject Email being sent, and reported it to the Manager, Info-communications\nand Technology Management, who was also one of ISCA’s data protection\nofficers (the “Manager ICT”).\n9\n\n2\n\nISCA took the following remedial action:\n\nEach of the 1,906 candidates did not have the same types of data disclosed in the Excel File.\nSome candidates had more data in the Excel File than others.\n\n3\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n(a)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nOn 24 November 2017 at around 3.24pm, the System/Network\n\nEngineer emailed the Unintended Recipient to inform her to disregard\nthe Subject Email. At around 3.44pm, the Unintended Recipient replied\nthe System Network Engineer to inform ISCA that she had deleted the\nSubject Email without opening the Excel File.\n(b)\n\nOn 25 November 2017, the Manager ICT sent a further email to\n\nthe Unintended Recipient to require that all copies of the Subject Email\nand Excel File are permanently deleted. Through emails dated 27 and 28\nNovember 2017, the Unintended Recipient confirmed that the Subject\nEmail and Excel File have been permanently deleted.\n(c)\n\nThe Unintended Recipient signed a Declaration confirming that:\n(i)\n\nThe Subject Email and Excel file was promptly deleted\n\nupon the Unintended Recipient being notified by ISCA of the\nSubject Email being sent by mistake;\n(ii)\n\nThe Excel File was not opened by the Unintended\n\nRecipient nor anyone else; and\n(iii)\n\nThe Unintended Recipient’s employer does not possess\n\nthe Subject Email and Excel File and no copies remain in its mail\nservers, backups or systems.\n(d)\n\nOn 29 November 2017, ISCA notified all 1,906 candidates of the\n\nIncident by email and/or SMS.\n\n4\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n10\n\nIt is not disputed that the Subject Data is “personal data” as defined in\n\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA. There is also no dispute that the PDPA applies to\nISCA as it falls within PDPA’s definition of “organisation”.\n11\n\nThe issue to be determined by the Commissioner in this case is whether\n\nISCA had complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether ISCA complied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA\n12\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n13\n\nIt is not disputed that ISCA had possession and/or control of the Subject\n\nData in the Excel file stored on ISCA’s internal shared drive and backup server.\nISCA’s security arrangements to protect electronic documents containing\npersonal data\n14\n\nAs part of ISCA’s business operations, its employees are required to\n\naccess a significant number of its members’ personal data contained in\nelectronic files (e.g. the Excel File contained 1,906 individuals’ Subject Data).\nThe Subject Data in ISCA’s possession and/or control included personal data\nwhich has a higher expectation of confidentiality (e.g employment history\nrecords, qualification records, exam results and appeal status) and could be\npotentially embarrassing if disclosed to unauthorised recipients.\n\n5\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n15\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nIn this regard, ISCA has a general policy that applies to the whole\n\norganisation with respect to the protection of personal data of its members. This\n“Information Sensitivity Policy” is intended to guide employees on protecting\ninformation at varying sensitivity levels, including during electronic\ndistribution. According to ISCA, the Subject Data in the Excel File would fall\nunder the “More Sensitive” category. For electronic distribution of documents\nin this category, there are “no restrictions to approved recipients within ISCA,\nbut should be encrypted or sent via a private link to approved recipients outside\nof ISCA premises”.\n16\n\nISCA also has targeted policies and standard operation procedures\n\n(“SOPs”) for specific departments and/or operational activities that deal with\npersonal data. The policies/SOPs that require electronic documents containing\npersonal data to be protected are:\n(a)\n\n“Data Management for CPE Programmes Policies and\n\nProcedures” applies to employees dealing with continuing professional\neducation. It requires encryption for excel reports generated that\ncontains personal data.\n(b)\n\n“Data Management” applies to the Member Services and\n\nMarketing department of ISCA. It requires internal reports generated by\nthe department that contain personal data to be “encrypted with\npassword”.\n(c)\n\nThe SOP entitled “Student Data Management” attached 2 emails\n\nin relation to the protecting files that contain personal data which stated:\n\n6\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n(i)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\n“Please ensure that your files are password-protected\n\nespecially if they contain personal data such as name, NRIC\nnumber, address, phone number and email address”; and\n(ii)\n\n“For electronic transmission (i.e. email, thumbdrives\n\netc) of personal data, please ensure the files are encrypted”.\n17\n\nHowever, none of ISCA’s security arrangements at [15] and [16]\n\nrequired password based encryption for the Excel File in the circumstances\nleading up to the Incident.\n(a)\n\nISCA’s Information Sensitivity Policy did not apply because the\n\nSystem/Network Engineer intended to send the Excel File by email to\nauthorised recipients within ISCA only.\n(b)\n\nISCA conceded that none of the policies/SOPs at [16] applied to\n\nthe System/Network Engineer who was in ISCA’s ICT department.\n18\n\nThe Commissioner found that ISCA failed to put in place reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Subject Data in the Excel File during email\ntransmission for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe volume (1,906 members) and type (data with a higher\n\nexpectation of confidentiality) of Subject Data in the Excel File\nwarranted direct protection. In this regard, ISCA should have had a\npolicy/SOP that applied to all employees requiring password based\nencryption for the Excel File in respect of both external and internal\nemails. This would be a reasonable security arrangement to protect the\nSubject Data against unauthorised access in the event the Subject Email\nwas sent to any unintended recipient.\n\n7\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n(i)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nISCA’s Information Sensitivity Policy at [15] was not a\n\nsufficient security arrangement as it only required password\nbased encryption for external emails.\n(ii)\n\nISCA’s “Student Data Management” SOP at [16(c)]\n\nrecognised that the Subject Data in the Excel File required direct\nprotection. Under this SOP, the Employees who had requested\nthe Excel File would have had to ensure that the Excel File is\nencrypted with a password for electronic transmission. However,\nas discussed at [17(b)], this SOP did not apply to the\nSystem/Network Engineer. At the material time, ISCA did not\nhave a specific policy/SOP for the ICT department in respect of\nits operational activities that deal with personal data.\n(iii)\n\nAccording to ISCA, the System/Network Engineer did\n\nnot open the Excel File when recovering it from ISCA’s backup\nserver. He was therefore not aware that the Excel File did not\nhave password based encryption. This excuse is not credible for\nthe reason that when the Employees requested for the restoration\nof an Excel file from the backup server, one would have expected\nthat the least that would have been done was for the\nSystem/Network Engineer to open the file to be sure that it had\nbeen properly restored and thus usable by the Employees. It is\nmore likely that the System/Network Engineer had opened the\nfile but it had not occurred to him that it was a spreadsheet\ncontaining voluminous personal data. In any event, the lack of\npolicy/SOP for the ICT department and the gap in the extant\nInformation Sensitivity Policy meant that the System/Network\nEngineer would not have been required to password protect the\nrestored Excel file.\n8\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nISCA conducted PDPA training for its employees. In this regard,\n\ndata protection training only has an impact on the proper implementation\nof an organisation’s data protection policies and practices. It does not\nreplace the requirement for an organisation to have the necessary data\nprotection policies in respect of its operational/business activities that\ndeal with personal data. In the present case, ISCA did not have any\npolicy/SOP that if properly implemented, would have been a reasonable\nsecurity arrangement to protect the Excel File during internal email\ntransmission.\n19\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds ISCA in breach of\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\nRepresentations by ISCA\n20\n\nISCA made representations following the issuance of a preliminary\n\nDecision to ISCA. The representations did not go to the merits of the matter but\nwere mainly related to the timelines for ISCA to comply with the\nCommissioner’s\n\ndirections.\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner\n\nhas\n\nconsidered\n\nthe\n\nrepresentations made and has made adjustments to the timelines in the final set\nof directions below.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n21\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that ISCA is in breach of section 24\n\nof the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\nto issue ISCA such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA. This may include directing ISCA to pay a financial penalty of such\namount not exceeding S$1 million.\n\n9\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n22\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions, if any, to be\n\nimposed on ISCA in this case, the Commissioner took into account the\nfollowing mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nISCA notified the Commission of the Incident and was fully\n\ncooperative in the investigations;\n(b)\n\nThe unauthorised disclosure was limited to a single Unintended\n\nRecipient for a short period of 10 minutes;\n(c)\n\nISCA took prompt action to mitigate the impact of the Incident\n\nby (i) requesting the Unintended Recipient to permanently delete the\nSubject Email containing the Excel File; and (ii) notifying all affected\nindividuals of the Incident; and\n(d)\n\nThere was no evidence to suggest any actual loss or damage\n\nresulting from the unauthorised disclosure.\n23\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner\n\nhereby directs ISCA to do the following:\n(a)\n\nWithin 90 days from the date of the Commissioner’s directions,\n\nreview its policies and security arrangements in respect of electronic\ntransmission of documents containing personal data; and\n(b)\n\nPay a financial penalty of S$6,000.00 within 30 days from the\n\ndate of the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court3 in respect of judgment debts, shall accrue\n\n3\n\nCap 322, R5, 2014 Rev Ed.\n\n10\n\n\fInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 28\n\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of the financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to SLF Green Maid Agency for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of individuals’ personal data.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Others","domestic helper"],"date":"2018-12-13","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Green-Maid-Agency---131218.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by SLF Green Maid Agency","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/12/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-slf-green-maid-agency","timestamp":"2018-12-13","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\nCase No DP-1806-B2265\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nSLF Green Maid Agency\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fSLF Green Maid Agency\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\n\nSLF Green Maid Agency\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1806-B2265\n13 December 2018\n1\n\nThis case arose out of the common practice of reusing scrap or discarded paper where\n\nthe reverse side of the paper can still be used. This is highly commendable and\nenvironmentally-friendly, but organisations must take care to ensure that there is no personal\ndata on the scrap or discarded paper set aside for such re-use. An employee of SLF Green Maid\nAgency (the “Organisation”) wrote information for the Complainant on a piece of paper which\ncontained personal data of other individuals on the reverse side and gave the paper to the\nComplainant. This happened on two separate occasions. The key issue is whether this\ndisclosure of personal data by the Organisation amounts to a breach of section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nOn 8 April 2018, the Complainant visited the Organisation’s office to enquire about\n\nengaging a foreign domestic worker. An employee of the Organisation assisted her and over\nthe course of these enquiries, the employee handed the Complainant some paper on which he\nwrote information related to her query. The Complainant discovered that the reverse side of\nthe paper contained personal data of other individuals. The Complainant informed the\nemployee that the paper that was used should not have been given to the Complainant.\n3\n\nOn 24 April 2018, the Complainant returned to the Organisation’s office and was served\n\nby the same employee. Again, over the course of the queries, she was provided information\nhand written on used paper. Similarly, the reverse side of the paper contained personal data of\nother individuals.\n4\n\nOver the two occasions, the following personal data was disclosed to the Complainant:\n(a)\n\nOn the first occasion, the used side of the paper contained a photocopy of the\n\nfront and back of an individual’s NRIC.\n2 of 6\n\n\fSLF Green Maid Agency\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\n\nOn the second occasion, the used side of the paper was a letter detailing a\n\nfamily’s personal circumstances, explaining why a foreign domestic worker was\nrequired by them. The letter also contained four individuals’ names and two of their\nFIN numbers. In an accompanying portion of a contract, the same four individuals’\npassport numbers and passport expiry dates were found; and\n(c)\n\nthe same portion of a contract contained five other individuals’ names and NRIC\n\nnumbers, with some accompanying signatures.\nDid the Organisation breach section 24 of the PDPA\n5\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA stipulates that an organisation shall protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. It is undisputed that the personal data listed in paragraph 4 was disclosed without\nauthorisation. The totality of the circumstances led me to conclude that the unauthorised\ndisclosure stemmed from the Organisation’s lack of reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent such disclosure. I set out the factors leading to this conclusion below.\n6\n\nOrganisations that re-use scrap paper should put in place reasonable security measures\n\nto prevent scrap paper containing personal data from being re-used or given to other clients.\nThe security arrangements will have to involve at least two aspects:\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nImplementing a system of processes backed up by policies, and\n\n(b)\n\nTraining of staff to be aware of the risks and to be alert to spot them.\n\nIn this case, investigations did not turn up any process or system within the organisation\n\nfor segregating scrap paper containing personal data from the pile(s) of scrap paper that can be\nre-used by staff.\n8\n\nNeither were there any policies. In fact, the Organisation admitted that they did not\n\nhave a detailed policy with respect to personal data protection nor did they provide staff with\nany formalised training on personal data. Instead, the Organisation relied on the management’s\nverbal directions to screen through all discarded paper and to destroy any paper that contained\n3 of 6\n\n\fSLF Green Maid Agency\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\n\npersonal data; and that only paper which did not contain personal data was to be re-used. The\nOrganisation intimated, in written responses during investigations, that the following\ninstructions were given to employees:\n“Physical Office Manning- Office should be manned continuously by staff during operating\nhour. In occasion that staff is alone in office and the need to leave the office, say go to the\ntoilet, office should be locked. Do not leave office open but unattended.\nManagement of Client’s data- Clients (Employer/customer and FDW) data should not be used\nor discussed loosely. Not even between staff and staff. Management insists that no loose talk\non sensitive data like how rich is an employer and personal income, where employer stays,\netc...Only on a need to know and authorized to know basis.\nClients/FDW’s document. Individual client/FDW’s document are filed and serialized. Files are\nsafe keep in cabinet within the office space which is locked after office hour.\nAccess to Personal Computer. Instruction to all staff is that “outsider” person who is not\nauthorized is not allowed to “touch” our personal computer. Ever happened before that a staff\nlet a customer use her personal computer to check certain thing from website was\nreprimanded.”\n\n9\n\nTo my mind, these instructions were insufficient and failed to establish the practices\n\naround the Organisation’s policy of using discarded paper that contained personal data.\n10\n\nThe Organisation intimated that they prominently pasted a set of guidelines on handling\n\npersonal data and provided a copy of a document entitled “Guidelines to Personal Data\nProtection” (“Organisation’s “Guidelines””). The relevant part of the Organisation’s\n“Guidelines” stated:\n“Proper Housekeeping Other than the document that Staff is working on at any point in time,\nno other unnecessary document, especially document with personal data should be lying\naround on the working table or other places.”\n…\n“Management of waste paper with personal information on it. Waste paper with personal\ndata on them are not to be disposed of in public rubbish bin direct, unless data is permanently\nmasked off by using permanent marker and is torn into small pieces.” (emphasis in original)\n\n11\n\nThere are a couple of issues with the Organisation’s Guidelines. First, they do not\n\naddress the re-use of discarded paper containing personal data directly. They deal with\nsafekeeping and disposal of waste paper containing personal data. Second, investigations did\n4 of 6\n\n\fSLF Green Maid Agency\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\n\nnot uncover any evidence to substantiate that the Organisation’s Guidelines were provided to\nits employees.\n12\n\nTurning now to the importance of staff training as a security arrangement. It has been\n\nsaid before in Re: National University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5 and it bears repeating\nthat training is important to inculcate the right employee culture and establish the right level of\nsensitivity to personal data amongst staff. The organisation admitted that no training had been\nprovided. The closest form of training in this matter was a verbal exhortation by management\nto screen scrap paper and to discard (and not to re-use) scrap paper that contained personal\ndata. Clearly, this was insufficient to establish the right level of employee sensitivity to client\npersonal data. These verbal instructions did not appear to have been effective on the employee\nwho served the Complainant as he made the same mistake to the same client twice: he handed\nover to the Complainant scrap paper containing personal data of other individuals on two\nseparate occasions and had failed to retrieve them even after the employee was informed by\nthe Complainant that he should not re-use paper with personal data.\n13\n\nFor a company like the Organisation that handles personal data of foreign domestic\n\nworkers and clients on a daily basis (eg passport and income information), it is necessary for it\nto put in place a better system of staff training and awareness given the sensitive nature of\npersonal data that it handles, as well as the volume. Merely disseminating guidelines and verbal\ninstructions is insufficient. As noted in Re Aviva Ltd, whilst there is no specific distinction in\nthe PDPA based on the sensitivity of the data, organisations are to ensure that there are\nappropriate levels of security for data of varying levels of sensitivity: [2018] PDP Digest 245\nat [17]-[18]. NRIC and passport numbers and financial information would generally be\nconsidered more sensitive: Re Aviva Ltd at [17]. Structured and periodic training could have\nbeen implemented to protect personal data.\n14\n\nI therefore find that the Organisation was in breach of its obligation to protect personal\n\ndata under section 24 of the PDPA as it did not implement reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect the personal data found in the discarded papers. Since the incident, the Organisation\nhas reminded its staff to comply with internal guidelines on personal data protection and the\nprocedures for destroying documents containing personal data. They have also highlighted to\nthe staff internal penalties for any failure to comply.\n5 of 6\n\n\fSLF Green Maid Agency\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 27\n\nDeputy Commissioner’s Directions\n15\n\nGiven my findings that the Organisation is in breach of section 24 of the PDPA, I am\n\nempowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as it deems\nfit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n16\n\nTaking into account the limited scope of the unauthorised disclosure, I do not think\n\nthat a financial penalty is warranted and instead make the following directions:\na. The Organisation is to conduct a review of its procedures to prevent the use of\ndiscarded or unwanted documents containing personal data within 30 days from the\ndate of this Decision;\nb.

Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner – Case No DP-1706-B0834\n\n13 December 2018\n\nBackground\n\n1\n\nThis matter involves WTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”), a\n\ncompany which provides vehicle repair and maintenance services at Kaki Bukit and Gul Circle\nin Singapore. On 9 June 2017, a complaint was lodged by a member of the public\n(“Complainant”) with the Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”), alleging\nthat a URL link to the Organisation’s customer database, which contained the personal data of\nthe Organisation’s customers, was publicly accessible over the Internet (the “Incident”). The\nCommissioner sets out below his findings and grounds of decision based on the investigations\ncarried out in this matter.\n\nMaterial Facts\n\n2\n\nThe Complainant had been searching for a company address via Google’s search\n\nengine, when he chanced upon the URL link to the Organisation’s Kaki Bukit customer\ndatabase, which contained the personal data of 2,472 of its Kaki Bukit customers. The personal\ndata that was disclosed included the names, NRIC and FIN numbers, residential addresses,\ncontact numbers, email addresses and car plate registration numbers of the Organisation’s Kaki\nBukit customers. The Complainant proceeded to lodge a complaint with the Commission on 9\nJune 2017. Upon receiving the complaint, the Commission commenced an investigation into\nthis matter.\n\n3\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, the Organisation represented that it had\n\nimplemented a Backend Electronic Job Card System (“Backend System”) which ran as a web\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\napplication over the Internet since December 2013. The Backend System was set up for internal\nuse only and was meant to allow the Organisation’s staff to, amongst other things, store and\naccess the personal data of the Organisation’s customers. The Backend System was developed\nand maintained by ZNO International (Pte.) Limited (“ZNO”) from October 2013.\nSubsequently, QGrids was responsible for the maintenance of the Backend System from March\n2016. The Organisation represented that the publicly accessible URL link to the Organisation’s\nKaki Bukit customer database was part of the Backend System.\n4\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, the Commission also found that there were two\n\nother databases that were part of the Backend System, which similarly contained personal data\nand were also publicly accessible, as follows:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation’s Gul Circle customer database, which contained the names,\n\nNRIC and FIN numbers, residential addresses, contact numbers, email addresses and\ncar plate registration numbers of 2,223 of the Organisation’s Gul Circle customers; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation’s master car database, which contained 3,764 records with the\n\nnames of car owners, and the details of their cars, such as a car’s make, model, plate\nnumber, colour, chassis number, registration number, transmission type and mileage.\n\n5\n\nAll three URL links to the Organisation’s three databases will collectively be referred\n\nto as the “Compromised URL Links”. The Compromised URL Links were all webpages\nwhich provided data export functions, i.e. they allowed data to be exported into Microsoft Excel\nspreadsheets. By clicking on any of the Compromised URL Links, the corresponding Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet would be generated and provided to a user. As the Microsoft Excel\nspreadsheets would subsequently be saved in the backend server, the Microsoft Excel\nspreadsheets could be discovered and indexed by search engines.\n\n6\n\nNotably, the Organisation admitted during the course of the investigation that the\n\nwebpages of the Backend System were all secured by authentication mechanisms, save for the\nCompromised URL Links. The Organisation represented that the authentication mechanisms\nfor the Compromised URL Links were “left out by ZNO unintentionally” during the\ndevelopment of the Backend System. With no authentication mechanisms to limit access to the\n\n2\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nCompromised URL Links, search engines were able to discover and index these Compromised\nURL Links, rendering the respective databases publicly accessible over the Internet.\n7\n\nAfter the Organisation was notified by the Commission of the unauthorised disclosure\n\nof its Kaki Bukit customers database on 15 June 2017, the Organisation represented that it had\ntaken the following steps to prevent the reoccurrence of the unauthorised disclosure of personal\ndata:\n\n(a)\n\nadded Robots.txt to discourage search engines from crawling webpages of the\n\nOrganisation’s Backend System;\n\n(b)\n\nsecured all webpages in the Organisation’s Backend System with login\n\nmechanisms;\n(c)\n\nremoved the Compromised URL Links from Google and Bing search engines;\n\nand\n(d)\n\nmigrated the Backend System to a local server and configured it to be only\n\naccessible within the Organisation’s Local Area Network instead of the Internet.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n8\n\nAt the outset, the information that was disclosed via the Compromised URL Links\n\n(names, NRIC and FIN numbers, residential addresses, contact numbers, email addresses, car\nplate registration numbers and details of cars, such as a car’s make, model, plate number,\ncolour, chassis number, registration number, transmission type and mileage) constitutes\npersonal data as defined in section 2(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of\n2012) (“PDPA”), as the Organisation’s customers and/or car owners could be identified from\nsuch information disclosed or is information that is about these identified customers and/or car\nowners.\n\n9\n\nThe issue for determination is whether each of the Organisation, ZNO and QGrids had\n\ncomplied with the obligation under section 24 of the PDPA to implement reasonable security\narrangements to protect personal data in its possession or under its control.\n\n3\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n10\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides:\n“An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.”\n\n[Emphases added.]\n\nAs a preliminary issue, the meaning of the terms “possession” and “control” under section 24\nof the PDPA is considered. Whilst the definition of “possession” is not defined in the PDPA,\nthe distinction between “possession” and “control” had been explained in Re Cellar Door Pte\nLtd [2016] SGPDPC 22 at [17] as:\n“it is possible for the same dataset of personal data to be in the possession of one organisation,\nand under the control of another. For example, in a situation where the organisation transfers\npersonal data to its data intermediary, the organisation could remain in control of the personal\ndata set while, simultaneously, the data intermediary may have possession of the same personal\ndata set.”\n\n11\n\nNotably, in Re Cellar Door Pte Ltd, it was found that even though the organisation was\n\nnot in direct possession of the personal data that was held in the data intermediary’s servers, it\nwas still obliged to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data as\nit had control over such data.\n\n12\n\nAs to the definition of “control”, AIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC\n\n8 at [18] states that:\n“[w]hile there is no definition of “control” in the PDPA, the meaning of control in the context\nof data protection is generally understood to cover the ability, right or authority to determine\n(i) the purposes for; and/or (ii) the manner in which, personal data is processed, used or\ndisclosed.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n4\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n13\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the issue for determination is whether each of the Organisation,\n\nZNO and QGrids had possession or control of the personal data contained in the Compromised\nURL Links, so as to trigger the obligation to implement reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent its unauthorised disclosure under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether ZNO had the obligation to protect personal data under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n14\n\nZNO was the IT vendor engaged by the Organisation to develop, host and maintain the\n\nBackend System. While the Organisation claims that it had asked ZNO to include\nauthentication mechanisms to limit access to the data found in the Compromised Links, the\nonly evidence that the Organisation relied upon was the statement of its General Manager. Even\nif we take the Organisation’s case at its highest and it is found that ZNO was indeed asked to\nimplement authentication mechanisms, ZNO would not be in breach of the PDPA given that it\nhad delivered the Backend System (save for one module which was not relevant to the Incident)\nin 2013. After the relevant PDPA provisions came into force on 2 July 2014, the onus is on the\nOrganisation to review its existing systems and to put in place enhancements to ensure that the\nstandards of protection under the PDPA are met. In this regard, the Commissioner finds that\nZNO did not have the obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether QGrids had the obligation to protect personal data under section 24 of the PDPA\n15\n\nAs of March 2016, QGrids had been engaged by the Organisation for the purposes of\n\napplication and data migration from ZNO’s web hosting services to Vodien Internet Solutions\nPte. Ltd. (“Vodien”), a third party Singapore-based web hosting company which provides,\namongst other services, domain registration and web hosting services, and subsequently, to\ntake over the maintenance of the Backend System from ZNO. QGrids had possession of the\npersonal data which is the subject of this decision in migrating the Backend Server to Vodien,\nand would have had to ensure that such personal data was protected. However, the data breach\nthat occurred in this case was not a result of the migration of the Backend Server or QGrids\nrole with respect to this. In this regard, the Commissioner finds that QGrids does not have the\nobligation under section 24 of the PDPA to implement reasonable security arrangements to\nprotect the personal data contained in the Compromised URL Links.\n\n5\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nWhether the Organisation had the obligation to protect personal data under section 24 of\nthe PDPA\n16\n\nWith regards to the development of the Backend System, the Organisation represented\n\nthat it had “[specified] to ZNO that the website and system should be protected with login\nmechanism and role-based authorisation feature; however, these requirements were given\nverbally during requirement analysis and were not recorded in any document”. Also, while the\nOrganisation represented that it had tested the Backend System before it was delivered to the\nOrganisation by ZNO, the user acceptance test was not documented by either the Organisation\nor ZNO.\n17\n\nThe Commissioner takes this opportunity to reiterate the importance of clarifying the\n\nobligations of an organisation and a service provider and thereafter documenting these in\nwriting and prior to the provision of services, as set out in Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and\nothers [2016] SGPDPC 19 at [51]:\n“[t]here must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service provider\nhas agreed to undertake, and this should be properly documented. Data controllers\nshould follow through with the procedures to check that the outsourced provider is\nindeed delivering the services.”\n18\n\nPresently, there is an absence of objective evidence showing that the Organisation had\n\ngiven specific requirements that login mechanism and role-based authorization was required.\nEqually, there is no evidence that this requirement was communicated, documented or –\ncrucially – included within the scope of User Acceptance Tests. Post 2 July 2014 when the\nPDPA came into full force, the Organisation should have reviewed its systems to ensure that\nthe standards of protection expected under the PDPA are met. The Commission also recognises\nthat “personal data of individuals may be exposed if the website or database in which it is stored\ncontains vulnerabilities. There needs to be a regular review to ensure that the website collecting\npersonal data and the electronic database storing the personal data has reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks”.1 The Commission considers that it is good practice for\nan organisation to “conduct regular ICT security audits, scans and tests to detect\n1\n\nPDPC, Guide to Data Protection Impact Assessments (published 1 November 2017), at [8.3].\n\n6\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nvulnerabilities”.2 Against the above backdrop, the Organisation retained full responsibility for\nimplementing reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data contained in the\nCompromised URL Links. The Commission found that the Organisation did not take any steps\ntowards protecting the personal data in its possession or under its control to prevent any\nunauthorised disclosure of the personal data contained in the Compromised URL Links.\nAdditionally, it should have conducted regular IT security checks to ensure that the Backend\nSystem did “not contain any web application vulnerabilities that could expose the personal data\nof individuals collected, stored or accessed via the website through the Internet”.3\n19\n\nAlthough access to the Backend System was only intended for staff of the Organisation,\n\nconsidering how the Backend System was accessible from the Internet, it would have been\nimportant for the Organisation to conduct IT security checks to detect vulnerabilities in the\nBackend System. The Commission takes the view that “[t]esting the website for security\nvulnerabilities is an important aspect of ensuring the security of the website. Penetration testing\nor vulnerability assessments should be conducted prior to making the website accessible to the\npublic, as well as on a periodical basis (e.g. annually).” 4 In this regard, the Organisation\nrepresented that “there [was no] penetration testing performed prior to [the Commission\nnotifying the Organisation about the unauthorised disclosure of personal data on 15 June\n2018]”.\n\n20\n\nGiven the absence of any security arrangements to protect personal data against\n\nunauthorised disclosure, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation has contravened section\n24 of the PDPA.\n\nRepresentations\n\n21\n\nThe Organisation made representations following the issuance of a preliminary\n\nGrounds of Decision. The Commissioner has considered the representations made and is of the\nview that the representations made do not justify any change in his decision or the directions\n\n2\n\nPDPC, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised 20 January 2017) at [6.1].\nPDPC, Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised on 20 January 2017), at [4.2.1].\n4\nPDPC, Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised on 20 January 2017), at [5.6.1].\n3\n\n7\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nmade. The Commissioner sets out below the points raised in the representations together and\nthe reasons for rejecting the representations.\n\n22\n\nThe Organisation in its representation states that they implemented a role based\n\nauthorisation feature and a login mechanism. These facts have already been taken into\nconsideration. The Organisation’s claims that it had instructed its vendor to protect the system\nwith a login mechanism and a role based authorisation feature are considered in paragraph 18\nabove. Even on the assumption that instructions for a role based authorisation feature and a\nlogin mechanism was properly given, the authentication mechanisms were not implemented\nwith respect to the Compromised URL Links and any alleged instructions were not\ndocumented. As stated in paragraph 17, such instructions should be documented in writing to\nclarify the obligations of an organisation and a service provider.\n23\n\nThe Organisation also states in its representations that they had expected its vendor\n\nZNO to conduct all the necessary audits as it was still developing the backend system even\nafter the relevant data protection provisions under the PDPA came into force on July 2014 and\nthat the disclosure resulted from a programming flaw. This has already been considered at\nparagraph 14 above. Further, organisations should take note that while they may delegate work\nto vendors to comply with the PDPA, the organisations’ responsibility for complying with\nstatutory obligations under the PDPA may not be delegated. In this case, the Organisation\nsimply did not put in place any security arrangements to ensure that it complies with its\nobligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n24\n\nThe final point made by the Organisation in its representations is that it had no technical\n\nexpertise to identify technical flaws and had no reason to suspect that the compromised URL\nlinks would be published on the Internet. In the present case, the gravamen lies in the lack of\nawareness and initiative on the part of the Organisation, as owner of the system, to take its\nobligations and responsibilities under the PDPA seriously. It is unrealistic to expect all\norganisations to have the requisite level of technical expertise to manage increasingly complex\nIT systems. But a responsible organisation would have made genuine attempts to engage\ncompetent service providers and give proper instructions. In this case, it is the paucity of\nevidence of such instructions, purportedly made by the Organisation, that stands out. Likewise,\nthere was no evidence that it had conducted adequate testing of the system. Pertinently, while\nthese lapses may have been more excusable before 1 July 2014, there is no excuse for the\n\n8\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nOrganisation not to have initiated (and properly documented) a review of the system for\ncompliance with the PDPA. The responsibilities of ownership do not require technical\nexpertise.\nDirections\n25\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of section 24 of the PDPA, the\n\nCommissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation such\ndirections as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n\n26\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on the\n\nOrganisation, the Commissioner took into account the following mitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was generally cooperative, forthcoming and prompt in\n\nproviding responses to the Commission during the investigation; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took immediate remedial actions to rectify and prevent the\n\nrecurrence of the data breach.\n\n27\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the aggravating factor that the Organisation\n\nshowed a lack of accountability with respect to the Backend System and its obligation to protect\nthe personal data that was stored on it. Not only did the Organisation fail to document the\ninstructions given to ZNO to implement login mechanism and role-based authorisation features\nfor the Backend System, the Organisation had also failed to document the user acceptance test.\nWhile the system was developed and delivered before the PDPA came into full force, the\nOrganisation knowing full well that its practices left a lot to be desired from a security\nstandpoint, ought to have audited its systems before 2 July 2014 to ensure that its practices are\nPDPA compliant. The failure to do so reflected the Organisation’s lack of accountability in\nensuring that it had made reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data on the\nBackend System, as well as to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or similar risks to such data.\n\n28\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the present case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$20,000 within\n30 days from the date of this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules\n\n9\n\n\fWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 26\n\nof Court in respect of judgment debts, shall be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Big Bubble Centre for disclosing personal data online without the consent of the individuals concerned.","tags":["Consent","Warning","Arts, Entertainment and Recreation","Scuba diving"],"date":"2018-11-28","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision---Big-Bubble-Centre---281118.pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"Breach of the Consent Obligation by Big Bubble Centre","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/11/breach-of-the-consent-obligation-by-big-bubble-centre","timestamp":"2018-11-28","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 25\nCase No DP-1802-B1770\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nBig Bubble Centre\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fBig Bubble Centre\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 25\n\nBig Bubble Centre\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1802-B1770\n28 November 2018\n1. The circumstances which led to the complaint over Big Bubble Centre’s (the\n“Organisation”) actions is a common one in today’s social media age. It usually starts with\na dispute between an individual and an organisation and quickly escalates from there. One\nparty expresses unhappiness with the other on social media and the other party then\nresponds on social media to defend themselves. During the exchange, personal data is\ndisclosed and is accessible to all and sundry. The approach of the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (“PDPC”) in such cases has been stated in Re My Digital Lock Pte Ltd [2018]\nSGPDPC 3 and Re M Star Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 and\nthat approach has been followed in this case.\n2. The Organisation is a sole-proprietorship in the scuba-diving services business. The\nComplainant is an ex-employee of the Organisation.\n3. The key issue is whether by using the personal data, the Organisation has:\na) breached its obligation under section 13 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) to obtain valid consent before disclosing personal data; or\nb) breached its obligation under section 18 of the PDPA to only use and disclose\npersonal data for purposes (i) that a reasonable person would consider appropriate\nin the circumstances; and (ii) that the data subject has been informed of.\nMaterial Facts\n4. The Complainant and the Organisation had a contractual dispute in which the Complainant\nclaimed that the Organisation had failed to pay his wages. The Complainant resigned and\ntook dive equipment which he claims to have paid for.\n5. The Organisation, however, refutes these claims and say that they withheld $600 from the\nComplainant as the Complainant owed the Organisation $850 for participating in and\nlogging dives organised by the Organisation with the aim of the Complainant obtaining the\nPADI Dive Master Certification. Also, the Organisation alleges that the Complainant did\nnot pay for the dive equipment that he took and instead stole the said equipment together\nwith the Organisation’s documents. Accordingly, the Organisation has filed a police report\nagainst the Complainant for the alleged theft.\n6. The above contractual dispute and allegations of theft are beyond the remit of the Personal\nData Protection Commission (“PDPC”) and I do not make any findings in respect of the\n2\n\n\fBig Bubble Centre\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 25\n\nabove. It is the actions of the Organisation and the Complainant subsequent to the\nsubmitting of the police report that concerns the PDPC. According to the Complainant, the\nOrganisation had sent text messages to some of its customers informing them of their\nallegations against the Complainant.\n7. In February 2018, the Complainant wrote a Facebook post detailing his unhappiness with\nthe Organisation and its sole proprietor. The crux of his post was that he felt cheated\nbecause the Organisation did not pay his salary and made a police report against him\nalthough he did his best as an employee. He also warned other divers from joining the\nOrganisation.\n8. The Organisation responded with two Facebook posts of its own, which were posted on the\nFacebook pages of the sole-proprietor (ie his personal Facebook page) and a public group\nfor scuba divers. The crux of these posts was that the Complainant owed the Organisation\nmoney for participating in dives organised by them, that they had given him a large discount\nto participate in the dives, that they had given the Complainant diving experience that no\none else would give him and that the Complainant stole diving equipment as well as a\ncustomer database and the Organisation’s delivery documents\n9. The Organisation also disclosed the following personal data in these posts: (a) the\nComplainant’s name, NRIC number, date of birth, passport number and expiry date, mobile\nphone number, email address and residential address; and (b) the name and residential\naddress of the Complainant’s female friend as well as the make of her car (collectively, the\n“Personal Data Sets”). It is undisputed that the Personal Data Sets were in the\nOrganisation’s possession and that the Organisation had obtained them from the\nComplainant when he was employed by the Organisation.\nDid the Organisation comply with sections 13 and 18 of the PDPA?\n10. Subject to certain exceptions,1 in accordance with section 13 read with section 14 of the\nPDPA, organisations may only collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual\nwith the consent of that individual (the “Consent Obligation”). It is undisputed that the\nOrganisation had not explicitly obtained the Complainant’s consent to disclose the Personal\nData Sets in the manner above or notified him, as required under section 20 of the PDPA,\nthat his personal data would be disclosed in such manner.\n11. In Re M Star Movers, the position I took was as follows:\n“18. The Deputy Commissioner advises caution in disclosing personal data\nwhen responding to public comments. An organisation should not be\nprevented or hampered from responding to comments about it using the\n\n1\n\nPursuant to section 17 of the PDPA read with the Second, Third and Fourth Schedule of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\n\fBig Bubble Centre\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 25\n\nsame mode of communications that its interlocutor has selected. In some\nsituations, it may be reasonable or even necessary to disclose personal data\nin order to advance an explanation. An individual who makes false or\nexaggerated allegations against an organisation in a public forum may not\nbe able to rely on the PDPA to prevent the organisation from using material\nand relevant personal data of the individual to explain the organisation’s\nposition on the allegations through the same public forum.\n19. The following observations may be made in this context about the\napproach that the Commission adopts. First, the Commission will not\nengage in weighing allegations and responses on golden scales in order to\nestablish proportionality. The better approach is to act against disclosures\nthat are clearly disproportionate on an objective standard before the\nCommission intervenes in what is essentially a private dispute…”\n12. In the present case, the Organisation’s disclosure of personal data is clearly\ndisproportionate on any objective standard. I can conceive of no legitimate reason for the\nOrganisation to disclose the Complainant’s NRIC and passport number in order to defend\nitself against the Complainant’s allegations. Neither can I see the relevance of disclosing\nthe name and residential address of the Complainant and the make of the car owned by the\nComplainant’s friend to the dispute over salary and dive equipment.\n13. While it is understandable how such excessive disclosure of personal data could have been\nmade when penning social media posts in the heat of the moment, such conduct is\nnevertheless inexcusable. Let this be a caution against wielding one’s pen in anger during\nthe heat of altercation.\n14. I thus find that the Organisation’s disclosure of the personal data of the Complainant and\nhis friend was done without consent and is in breach of section 13 of the PDPA.\nActions taken by the Commission\n15. As at 15 March 2018, the Facebook posts had been removed.

It is clearly well within the prerogative of an organisation to ban\nindividuals from entry into its premises as a consequence of flouting its rules,\nin particular where the actions of such individuals affects the organisation’s\nability to maintain order and prevent criminal and other undesirable activities\nfrom being carried out. The question with which the Commissioner is concerned\nis whether the flouting of rules by individuals provides an organisation with\ncarte blanche to treat the personal data of those individuals in any manner it sees\nfit. The Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision are set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates several gaming centres, or clubs, where\n\nmembers use computers connected by a Local Area Network (“LAN”) to play\nmulti-player games. The LAN gaming centre in question was the Organisation’s\nHougang branch (the “LAN shop”).\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n3\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nTo play at the LAN Shop, an individual must first sign up to become a\n\nmember. All members are subject to the Organisation’s rules and regulations.\nThese rules stipulate that members who engage in prohibited behaviour, e.g.\nonline gambling, viewing of pornography, theft and truancy, will be banned\nfrom entry. According to the Organisation, the rationale for banning members\nis to maintain order and to prevent criminal and other undesirable activities from\nbeing carried out on the Organisation’s premises.\n4\n\nOn 11 January 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission\n\n(“PDPC”), acting on a tip-off published in an online news report1, inspected the\nLAN Shop and found that the Organisation had posted notices (“Notices”),\ncomprising enlarged photocopies of the identity documents (e.g. student pass,\nemployment pass, Singapore Armed Forces identity card) of 11 individuals\nwhom the Organisation had banned from entry into its premises. Each Notice\ncontained personal data of a member who was banned.\n5\n\nThe Notices disclosed different types of personal data, including a\n\nmember’s name, photograph, NRIC number/FIN, student identification\nnumber, mobile phone number, and name of employer, occupation, and remarks\nabout a member (“remarks”). The Organisation provided these remarks to\nexplain why the members had been banned from the LAN Shop, which included\nthe following:\n\n1\n\nThe Mothership, “Gaming shop resorts to shaming misbehaving kids, but giving away\ntoo much personal info” (30 December 2016) <http://mothership.sg/2016/12/gamingshop-resorts-to-shaming-misbehaving-kids-but-giving-away-too-much-personalinfo/>.\n\n2\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n(a)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\n“Banned for skipping classes and being very rude to his\n\nparents”;\n(b)\n\n“Banned for surfing pornography”;\n\n(c)\n\n“Banned for using others’ Ezlink card”;\n\n(d)\n\n“Banned for stealing money and captured by CCTV”;\n\n(e)\n\n“Caught for stealing iPhone”; and\n\n(f)\n\n“Caught online gambling during routine checks by police and\n\narrested inside the centre”.\n6\n\nThe personal data in question, except for the remarks, had been collected\n\nat the time of application when the individuals filled up membership forms. The\nOrganisation’s stated intention for displaying the Notices is for the purpose of\nhelping its staff to identify members who had been banned from the LAN Shop.\nThe staff will deny entry to the LAN Shop to banned members.\n7\n\nThe sole proprietor of the Organisation alleged that he had instructed his\n\nstaff to remove the Notices prior to 2 July 2014 when the data protection\nprovisions of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) came into effect.\nHowever, the Notices continued to be displayed in the LAN Shop until they\nwere finally taken down sometime between 11 January 2017 to 26 January\n2017.\n8\n\nAt the material time, the Organisation did not have in place any personal\n\ndata protection policies or internal guidelines, although it claimed it had\nappointed a data protection officer.\n\n3\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nTwo Issues for Determination\n9\n\nThe relevant issues for determination in this case are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation obtained consent from its customers to\n\ndisclose the personal data found in the Notices pursuant to section 13 of\nthe PDPA;\n(b)\n\nwhether the disclosure of personal data was for a purpose that a\n\nreasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances\npursuant to section 18(a) of the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nwhether the Organisation developed and implemented the\n\nnecessary data protection policies and practices pursuant to section 12(a)\nof the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation obtained consent from its customers to disclose\nthe personal data found in the Notices\n10\n\nThe Commissioner finds that the Organisation failed to obtain consent\n\nfrom its customers who were the subject of the Notices. The Commissioner’s\nexplanation of this finding is set out in greater detail below at paragraphs 17 to\n21 in discussing the Organisation’s section 18(a) obligations.\nWhether the disclosure of personal data of its members was for a purpose\nthat a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances\npursuant to section 18(a) of the PDPA\n11\n\nPursuant to section 18(a) of the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use\n\nor disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable\nperson would consider appropriate in the circumstances. Where the purpose of\n\n4\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\ncollection, use or disclosure does not fall within one of the excepted general\npurposes set forth in Schedules Two, Three and Four, the purpose has to be both\nappropriate and also notified to the individual. Where the general purpose of\ncollection, use or disclosure falls within one of the aforementioned exceptions,\nthe specific purpose must still be reasonably appropriate, although there is no\nneed to notify the individual subject to section 20(4) of the PDPA.\n12\n\nAs a preliminary point, it was not disputed that the data contained in the\n\nNotices, which included details such as the banned member’s name,\nphotograph, NRIC number/FIN, student identification number, name of\nemployer and occupation, fell within the definition of “personal data” under\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA as it was possible to identity the 11 banned members\nfrom such details when taken as a whole. Also, given that the reason for the ban\nset out in each of the Notices was stated below the copy of the NRIC of each\nbanned member, these reasons would also constitute personal data of the\nmember. It was also not disputed that the personal data of the banned members\nwas in the Organisation’s possession and under its control at the material time.\n13\n\nBased on the investigations, the Commissioner finds that the purpose of\n\ndisclosure of the 11 banned members’ personal data was for an inappropriate\npurpose that breaches section 18(a) of the PDPA. The reasons for this finding\nare set out below.\nThe Purpose of the Notices was to assist staff in identifying banned members\nand to inform banned members that they were prohibited entry into the LAN\nShop\n\n5\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n14\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nThe sole-proprietor of the Organisation in his statement, made clear that\n\nthe purpose for the display of the Notices was to assist staff in identifying\nbanned members and to inform banned members that they were prohibited entry\ninto the LAN Shop and the reason(s) for the ban.\n15\n\nIn answer to the question “[p]lease state the purpose of the collection,\n\nuse and disclosure of the personal data of those individuals”, the sole-proprietor\nstated, inter alia, that:\n“The purpose of collection, use and disclosure was to facilitate\nthe application of membership and the provision of LAN gaming\nservices to members which includes maintaining the rules and\nregulations.\nThe rules and regulations such as banning members from entry\ndue to surfing porn, online gambling or skipping schools (sic) is\nnecessary to maintain order and prevent criminal activities\nfrom occurring in our premises. In fact, the aforesaid was\nencouraged by undercover police officers when they arrested\npeople for online gambling.\nAccordingly, we put the Notices to inform our staff and also\nthose members banned from our clubs that they are\nprohibited entry. Members never challenged or demanded us\nto bring down the Notices, but asked us for reasons. For\nexample, a student will be informed that he has been banned\nbecause he skipped school. In this regard, some parents who\ncomplain to us for allowing their children to play in the LAN\ngaming shop will give permission for us to put the personal data\nof their children up to shame them so they will not do it again,\nbut other parents will refuse.\nAs for adults, some will ask us why we put up the Notices, and\nwe will inform them that they have been caught by the police\nfor online gambling.\nThe students and adults need to show to us why we should\nremove the ban and Notices. For example, a student needs to\nshow us good results. Likewise, the adult needs to show us that\nhe did not commit the offence like surfing porn or online\ngambling, or only given a warning by the police.\nAt the end of the day, CTC did not disclose the personal data\nwith ill intent but rather to adhere to the laws and ensure our\nmembers comply with the laws as well. That said, I admitted\nthat we did post the Notices up and there were better ways\n\n6\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nto inform our employees and members of the ban. (emphasis\nadded)2\n\n16\n\nFrom the above, it appears that the Organisation encountered situations\n\nwhere members were potentially using their premises for criminal activities\nsuch as online gambling or were playing truant and were in the LAN Shop when\nthey were meant to be in school. To manage this, the Organisation decided to\nban members who were suspected of committing an offence or undertaking any\nundesirable activities in their premises or playing truant. The purpose of the\nNotices was to inform the Organisation’s staff which members were banned and\nto inform banned members of their ban and the reasons for the ban. Whilst the\nintentions are laudable, the modality of execution fell short.\n17\n\nAt this juncture, the Commissioner would like to deal with the\n\nOrganisation’s claim that “some parents … will give permission for us to put the\npersonal data of their children up…”. The first point to take note of here is that\nthe Organisation does not claim that consent was obtained from all its members\nwho were the subject of Notices which were displayed. In fact, this is an\nadmission that consent to display the Notices was not obtained from all of the\nmembers who were the subject of Notices. Even with respect to the claims made\nthat consent was obtained in some of the cases, the Organisation failed to adduce\nany evidence of having obtained any such consent to support this claim other\nthan the bare assertion made by the sole-proprietor of the Organisation.\n18\n\nThe other point that the Commissioner would like to deal with as a\n\npreliminary issue is the claim that “[m]embers never challenged or demanded\nus to bring down the Notices.”. It should be noted that the failure to challenge\n\n2\n\nWitness Statement dated 3 February 2017.\n\n7\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nor demand that the Notices be removed does not indicate that the member has\nunequivocally consented to the display of the Notices. The Organisation is\nrequired to either specifically obtain consent from the member to display the\nNotice or rely on deemed consent. The facts of this case, as uncovered during\nthe investigations, does not lend itself to a finding that members are deemed to\nhave consented to the display of the Notices.\n19\n\nIn this regard, given that the purpose of the Notices was limited to\n\nassisting staff in identifying banned members and to inform banned members\nthat they were prohibited entry into the LAN Shop and the reason(s) for the ban,\na reasonable person would not consider it appropriate to display the Notices to\neveryone that enters the LAN Shop. In fact, even the sole-proprietor of the\nOrganisation admits that other better ways existed to inform staff and banned\nmembers of the ban. Clearly, a simple way of doing so would have been to\nmaintain an internal black list that only the staff on duty would be able to\nconsult.\n20\n\nGiven the above, it is telling that the sole-proprietor instructed his staff\n\nto remove all the Notices before the PDPA came into effect. In this regard, the\nsole proprietor in his witness statement, in answer to the question “[p]lease state\nwhether CTC (ie the Organisation) had taken any measures as of 30 December\n2016 to prevent its employees to (sic) collect, use and disclose personal data\nwithout consent and notification. If so, please provide details of the measures\ntaken”, stated that:\n“I actually instructed my employees to take down those the (sic)\nNotices before the Personal Data Protection Act came into effect.\nBut I do not visit the clubs (including the LAN Gaming Shop)\nregularly so I was not able to monitor whether they did in fact\ntake down the Notices.\n\n8\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nHowever, they took down the Notices before I received your\nnotice to produce but I could (sic) not remember the date. They\ntook it down during the Chinese new Year.”\n\n21\n\nIn the final analysis, the Organisation’s intention to withhold its services\n\nfrom certain categories of users cannot be faulted nor should personal data\nprotection laws impede such intentions. However, the manner in which it had\ncarried out this purpose left much to be desired. The use of personal data to\nmaintain an internal black list of customers that are banned from the cybercafe\nis an appropriate purpose. Section 18 of the PDPA requires that such use be\nnotified, and this could easily have been achieved with clear notification that\nsome of the personal information provided by customers of the cybercafe during\nregistration may be used for the purpose of managing the ongoing customer\nrelationship, including the provision or suspension of services due to the\ncustomer’s breach of the Organisation’s rules. This would be an eminently\nappropriate purpose and, once notified, there would have been consent if the\ncustomer continues to make use of the cybercafe’s facilities and services. One\nfurther point to highlight is that not all personal data disclosed in the Notices is\nrequired to achieve this purpose; photocopies of NRIC and FIN cards in\nparticular need not have been used to achieve the stated purpose.\n22\n\nThe manner of disclosure also left much to be desired. As the owner of\n\nthe Organisation well knows, the black list need not be publicly displayed but\ncan be kept as an internal list. The placement of the Notices also detracts from\nthe stated purpose of assisting staff in the identification of persona non grata.\nThese Notices were placed on the wall behind the counter such that when a\nmember of staff is engaging with a customer, the Notices will be behind him.\nThis detracts from its effectiveness as a black list for staff, but suggests that it\nwas intended to name and shame customers.\n\n9\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nWhether the Organisation developed and implemented the necessary data\nprotection policies and practices pursuant to section 12(a) of the PDPA\n23\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall develop\n\nand implement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to\nmeet its obligations under the PDPA.\n24\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation admitted to the PDPC that, at the\n\nmaterial time, it did not have in place any personal data protection policies or\npractices, or even internal guidelines with respect to personal data. As such, the\nOrganisation was in breach of section 12(a) of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n25\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nits obligations under sections 13, or in the alternative section 18, and 12(a) of\nthe PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to\nissue the Organisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with\nthe PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n26\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be made, the\n\nCommissioner took into account, as an aggravating factor, the actual or potential\nharm that was posed to the 11 banned members due to the sensitive nature of\nthe personal data disclosed.\n\n10\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n27\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative during investigations and the\n\nsole director of the Organisation delayed his overseas business trip in\norder to give his witness statement to the PDPC;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation did not have malicious intentions in disclosing\n\nthe personal data and had only displayed the Notices to maintain order\nin the LAN Shop and discourage criminal and undesirable activities\nfrom being carried out on its premises; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial action to remove the\n\nNotices before the PDPC sent it a Notice to Produce Documents and\nInformation.\n28\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors noted above,\n\npursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, the Commissioner hereby directs that\nthe Organisation to:\n(a)\n\ncomply with section 12(a) of the PDPA by developing and\n\nimplementing policies and practices that are necessary for the\nOrganisation to meet the data protection provisions of the PDPA within\n60 days of the date of the Commissioner’s direction; and\n\n11\n\n\fClub the Chambers\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 24\n\nThe Organisation pay a financial penalty of S$7,000 in\n\naccordance with the Commissioner’s direction, failing which interest at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n12\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $6,000 was imposed on Grabcar for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of GrabHitch drivers’ personal data.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Transport and Storage","PHV","Private Hire Vehicle"],"date":"2018-10-04","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Grabcar_Pte_Ltd_270918.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Grabcar","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/10/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-grabcar","timestamp":"2018-10-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\nCase No DP-1706-B0871\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1706-B0871\n\n27 September 2018.\nBackground\n1\n\nThis case involves the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of\n\nGrabHitch drivers in a Google Forms survey created by the Organisation that\nwas accessible online (the “Incident”). The Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) received a complaint from one of the drivers\nwhose personal data was disclosed in the Incident and commenced its\ninvestigations thereafter. The Commissioner set out below his findings and\ngrounds of decision based on the investigations carried out in this matter.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation was incorporated in September 2014 and has been\n\nproviding the GrabHitch service since November 2015. GrabHitch is a paid\ncarpooling service operated by the Organisation that matches individual noncommercial private car owners (“Hitch Drivers”) with people who are\ncommuting along the same route.1 Hitch Drivers are permitted to charge a fare\nto cover the Hitch Driver’s variable costs, such as petrol and car depreciation\nbased on the distance of the ride.\n\n1\n\nIndividuals who provide carpool trips that adhere strictly to the conditions set out in\nthe Road Traffic (Car Pools) (Exemption) Order 2015 are exempt from the certain\nrequirements under the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276), such as the requirement to obtain\nthe appropriate commercial licences and insurance.\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n3\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\nIn accordance with the Organisation’s Driver’s Code of Conduct, Hitch\n\nDrivers who fail to comply with the Terms and Conditions or Code of Conduct\nmay be penalised through account deactivation, the withholding, reduction or\nforfeit of driver incentives or credits, suspension or permanent banning.\nConduct that would warrant a suspension of a Hitch Driver’s account include\nfraud, booking and cancellation offences, offences concerning fares and\npayments and passenger experience, safety or security offences such as\nharassment.\n4\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had suspended the accounts\n\nof 20 Hitch Drivers for various offences such as unacceptable behaviour and/or\nusage of the platform; these Hitch Drivers had appealed their suspensions. Of\nthese 20 Hitch Drivers, two of them were also GrabCar drivers. The\nOrganisation created the “GrabHitch SG Appeal Form” using Google Forms, to\nallow the Hitch Drivers to submit an appeal to the Organisation and for the\nOrganisation to contact them for further investigation.\n5\n\nHitch Drivers whose accounts had been suspended were able to access\n\nthe Google Form on 16 June 2017 at 10am. They were required to fill up the\nfollowing fields in the Google Form (“Appeal Form Data”) if they wanted to\nsubmit an appeal to the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nName as per NRIC;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(c)\n\nMobile number;\n\n(d)\n\nVehicle Plate; and\n\n2\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n(e)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\nAppeal Statement to explain their case for appeal including\nreasons to justify the reactivation of their account.\n\n6\n\nThe Incident was the first time that the Organisation used Google Forms\n\nfor the purposes of collecting responses in respect of appeals. Its intention was\nto allow its employees to access and review the Appeal Form Data to review\nsuspensions. However, the employee who was responsible for uploading the\nGoogle Form had chosen the incorrect setting by selecting the setting\n“Respondents can: See summary charts and text responses”. As a result, all\nHitch Drivers who had submitted the Google Form to appeal their suspensions\nwere able to view all the Appeal Form Data contained in the responses, both\ntheir own as well as the other Hitch Drivers who had appealed. Investigations\ndisclosed that only the Hitch Drivers and the Organisation’s employees were\nable to access the Appeal Form Data.\n7\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation promptly removed\n\nthe ability of Hitch Drivers to access the Appeal Form Data. The total duration\nthat the Google Form was in use was less than 8 hours; the Appeal Form Data\nwas uploaded on the same morning that the complaint was received and access\nto the data by Hitch Drivers was removed by 5pm the same day.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\n9\n\nThe issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the information disclosed constituted personal data; and\n\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nEven though it was an employee of the Organisation who had uploaded\n\nthe Google Form with the wrong settings, under section 53(1) of the PDPA, any\n3\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\nact done or conduct engaged in by a person in the course of his employment\nshall be treated for the purposes of the PDPA as done or engaged in by his\nemployer as well as by him, regardless of whether it was done or engaged in\nwith the employer’s knowledge or approval. The Organisation is therefore\nresponsible for its employee’s conduct in relation to the Incident.\nWhether the information disclosed constituted personal data\n10\n\nIn this case, given that individual Hitch Drivers can be identified from\n\nthe Appeal Form Data which was disclosed in the Incident (specifically, the\nHitch Drivers’ names, mobile phone numbers, NRIC numbers, vehicle plate\nnumbers as well as their appeal statements), the Appeal Form Data is personal\ndata as defined in the PDPA. In this regard, the Organisation is required to\ncomply with the data protection obligations under the PDPA in respect of the\nAppeal Form Data.\n11\n\nAlso, the Organisation in its representations dated 14 May 2018\n\nindicated that the suspensions or bans were in relation to Hitch Drivers allegedly\neither exceeding the statutorily allowed number of trips per day or to “game”\nthe system. The Organisation has subsequently, on 1 June 2018, in response to\na question from the Commission on why the Organisation treated such\ntransgressions as worthy of a suspension, stated that:\nWe take gaming very seriously as it affects the integrity of our\nservice offerings. Also, it is against our driver Code of Conduct:\nhttps://www.grab.com/sg/driver/hitch/code-of-conduct/.\nI\ndraw your attention to the following clauses:\n\nProvide an honest service. Any form of cheating (e.g. Failure to\nreturn the full balance to passengers or requesting for full\npayments during promotional periods) or suspected fraudulent\nactivity is prohibited and will trigger further investigation from\n\n4\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\nthe Company, as we reserve the right to ensure all transactions\nare genuine.\n\nThe Company maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding all\ninfringements and violations of this Code of Conduct and the\nDriver acknowledges that this may result in suspension or\ntermination of user access to the Grab platform\n\n12\n\nIt is therefore the Organisation’s case that a driver who “games” the\n\nsystem exhibits a lack of probity suggestive of fraudulent intent. These are\nserious allegations and the Organisation ought to have treated such personal data\nwith the appropriate care in the knowledge that the unauthorised disclosure of\nthe Appeal Form Data would result in such serious allegations being disclosed\nas well.\n13\n\nAs noted at paragraph 4 above, two out of the 20 Hitch Drivers are also\n\ndrivers of GrabCar. In this regard, unlike GrabHitch, which is a non-commercial\nsocial carpooling service, GrabCar is a private-hire car service that allows\npassengers to book a chauffeured ride for a fee and can only be provided by\nvehicles and drivers with the appropriate commercial licences. There is\ntherefore the additional consideration that, pursuant to section 4(5) of the PDPA,\nthe data protection obligations do not apply to business contact information of\nthese two GrabCar drivers. (Business contact information is defined to be an\nindividual’s name, position name or title, business telephone number, business\naddress, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any other\nsimilar information about the individual, not provided by the individual solely\nfor his personal purposes.)\n14\n\nIn Re Comfort Transportation Pte Ltd and another [2016] SGPDPC 17\n\n(“Comfort Transportation”) (at [9]), the Commissioner found that taxi drivers’\nmobile phone numbers that were used for, or related to, their business as taxi\n\n5\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\ndrivers fell within the definition of “business contact information” because,\namong other things, the organisation disclosed the taxi drivers’ mobile phone\nnumbers to passengers as a means for them to contact the taxi driver after a\nbooking has been made. Thus, the name and mobile phone numbers provided\nby the two GrabCar drivers who were also Hitch Drivers are considered\nbusiness contact information. The vehicle plate number is not business contact\ninformation since this is a means of identification of the vehicle that was used\nto provide the commercial GrabCar service and the driver of the said vehicle,\nbut not a means of contacting the driver. That said, their NRIC numbers would\nnot fall within the definition of business contact information.\nWhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA\n15\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks. The Organisation represented\nthat it uses the Single Sign-On authentication process with Google’s suite of\nauthentication services to protect access to the Appeal Form Data. Access to the\nAppeal Form Data is accessible only to intended individuals through individual\nfile sharing permissions.\n16\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the Incident had occurred because the\n\nemployee responsible for uploading the Google Form had chosen the incorrect\nsetting “Respondents can: See summary charts and text responses”. At the time\nof the Incident, the Organisation did not have any policies or procedures to\nguide their employees regarding the use of Google Forms to collect personal\ndata nor did it provide any training. Following from the Incident, the\nOrganisation represented in its response to the first Notice to Produce dated 11\n\n6\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\nJuly 2017, that it was in the midst of preparing documents to better guide their\nemployees on the use of Google Forms to prevent a similar occurrence in the\nfuture.\n17\n\nThe Incident was the first time that Google Forms were used for the\n\npurposes of collecting responses (including the Hitch Drivers’ personal data) in\nrespect of appeals. Since there are easily accessible introductory articles such as\nthe Google support article “What can you do with Forms?”,2 the onus is on the\nOrganisation to ensure that it had a sufficient understanding and appreciation of\nthe product before making use of it, particularly where it will be used to collect,\nuse and/or disclose personal data.\n18\n\nThis is a position that was taken in Re GMM Technoworld Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2016] SGPDPC 18 (“GMM Technoworld”). In that case, the Organisation\ncreated an online warranty registration form using a third party paid plug-in for\nWordpress which allowed for the capture of personal data on the website.\nHowever, as a result of the Organisation’s misunderstanding and incorrect use\nof the functions of the Plug-in, the personal data of approximately 190 of its\ncustomers were displayed on its website.\n19\n\nAs observed in GMM Technoworld (at [12]):\n…the Formidable Forms website had webpages which provided\nadequate demonstrations, documentation and explanations of\nits products, including the Plug-in, accompanied by pictorial\nguides. In the Commission’s view, an organisation ought to\nhave sufficient understanding and appreciation of a product\nbefore making use of it. In this case, had the organisation\nstudied these sources, it would have become aware that use of\nthe Plug-in would result in the disclosure of the data collected\non the website since the Plug-in was designed to ease the\ncollection and display of information. For the organisation’s\n\n2\n\nSee <https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/forms/get-started/#!/>.\n\n7\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\npurpose of collecting but not displaying personal data, the\ndefault behaviour of the out-of-the-box features of this Plug-in\nwould not be appropriate. Alternatives could have been\nconsidered. If alternatives are not suitable and the organisation\ndecides to proceed with using the Plug-in, it should be\nresponsible for understanding the security features offered by\nthe Plug-in and it would have to set the security features\naccordingly. It would not be prudent for an organisation to use\na plug-in without first being clear of the default behaviour of its\nfunctions in relation to the collection of personal data, and\nwithout ensuring that the plug-in (if properly configured)\nadequately protects the organisation’s personal data.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n20\n\nIn light of the absence of any security arrangements to protect personal\n\ndata from such unauthorised disclosure, the Commissioner finds that the\nOrganisation has contravened section 24 of the PDPA.\nDirections\n21\n\nHaving found the Organisation to be in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give\nthe Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA.\n22\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed,\n\nthe Commissioner noted that the Appeal Form Data disclosed included the\nappeal statements which contained information about an individual driver’s\nsuspension from the GrabHitch service. The Organisation has indicated that\nthese suspensions were on the basis that the drivers were “gaming the system”.\nIn the Organisation’s own view, such “gaming of the system”, suggested a lack\nof probity on the part of the drivers. Such allegations could potentially cause\nactual or potential harm, injury or hardship, including reputational damage\nwhere disclosed without authorisation. Also, the personal data disclosed\n\n8\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\nincluded Hitch Drivers’ NRIC numbers. The aforesaid was treated as an\naggravating factor.\n23\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nthe personal data was only disclosed to a limited number of\n\nindividuals;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action to mitigate the impact of the\n\nbreach by removing access to the Google Form within the same day that\nthe Google Form was made available to the drivers. As such, the\npersonal data was only disclosed for around 7 hours;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation had cooperated fully with the investigation; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe Organisation had notified the Commission of the Incident,\n\nalbeit after the Commission had received a complaint from one of the\naffected Hitch Drivers.\n24\n\nThe Commissioner has also considered the representations made by the\n\nOrganisation through their letter of 14 May 2018. The Organisation’s\nrepresentations were as follows:\n(a)\n\nto reconsider the position that the Organisation did not have the\n\nrelevant data protection policies in place. In this regard, when the\nOrganisation was asked for copies of its policies and internal guidelines\nfor the protection of personal data which were valid as at the time of the\nIncident, the Organisation replied that it was in the process of drafting\nthe relevant standard operating procedures (“SOPs”). In its\nrepresentations, the Organisation clarified that it did in fact have relevant\n\n9\n\n\fGrabCar Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 23\n\ndata protection policies in place and that the reference to the SOPs was\nin fact an updated version of its data protection policies. The\nCommissioner has considered the evidence provided and accepts that\nthe Organisation did in fact have in place a data protection policy at the\ntime of the Incident;\n(b)\n\nThe Hitch Drivers’ appeal cases did not involve allegations of\n\nsafety or security offences and instead involved exceeding the allowed\n2 trips per day or “gaming” the system and that this type of case was\nmuch less sensitive than the facts in Re Credit Counselling Singapore\n[2017] SGPDPC 18. The Commissioner had already taken this point into\nconsideration in determining the quantum of the financial penalty.\n25\n\nThe Commissioner, after reviewing the Organisation’s representations\n\nas a whole, agreed to the Organisation’s request for a reduction in the financial\npenalty initially proposed.\n26\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case and the\n\nrepresentations made by the Organisation as summarised above, the\nCommissioner hereby issues a direction to the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of $6,000.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Galaxy Credit and Investments for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its borrowers, and using personal data not for a purpose that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.","tags":["Protection","Purpose Limitation","Warning","Finance and Insurance","Licensed moneylender"],"date":"2018-09-25","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Galaxy_Credit_and_Investments_Pte_Ltd_250918.pdf","nature":"Protection, Purpose Limitation","title":"Breach of the Protection and Purpose Limitation Obligations by Galaxy Credit and Investments","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/09/breach-of-the-protection-and-purpose-limitation-obligations-by-galaxy-credit-and-investments","timestamp":"2018-09-25","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\nCase No DP-1803-B1886\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nGalaxy Credit & Investments\nPte. Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1803-B1886\n25 September 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nIs it appropriate for a licensed moneylender, or any organisation, to\n\nattach a photograph of a debtor to a letter demanding payment of a debt and\nleave both the photograph and letter at the residence of the debtor? What is the\nobjective or purpose of such a practice? If the Organisation had considered these\nquestions, the unauthorised disclosure in this matter may very well have not\noccurred.\n2\n\nThe facts in this matter are straightforward and are not in dispute. On 16\n\nMarch 2018, the Registry of Moneylenders & Pawnbrokers, Ministry of Law\n(“ROMP”) informed the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) that the Organisation had sent three letters of demand, each\nwith a photograph of a borrower, [Redacted] (Replaced with “Mr T”), to the\nresidence of another borrower, [Redacted] (Replaced with “Mr W”). The\nCommission proceeded to investigate into an alleged breach of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a licensed Moneylender. As part of their business,\n\nthe Organisation issued letters of demand (“LODs”) to borrowers who defaulted\non the repayment of their loan. These LODs would be delivered to the defaulting\nborrowers by a third-party debt collector engaged by the Organisation. Prior to\neach delivery, the Organisation would provide their debt collector with the LOD\nand a photograph of the borrower. According to the Organisation, the purpose\nof providing a photograph was to help the debt collector correctly identify the\nborrower.\n4\n\nThe Organisation instructed the debt collectors to attach the photograph\n\nto the LOD and hand it to the borrower. If the borrower was not present, the\nOrganisation’s instruction to the debt collector was to place the photograph\ntogether with the LOD into a sealed envelope and leave the sealed envelope at\nthe borrower’s residence.\n5\n\nTo obtain photographs of all their borrowers, the Organisation took\n\nphotographs of each new borrower when they visited the Organisation’s\npremises to obtain the loans. These photographs were stored on the\nOrganisation’s system and only tagged to their respective borrower’s account at\nthe end of each day.\n6\n\nInvestigations revealed that Mr T and Mr W had both borrowed money\n\nfrom the Organisation on the same day, 17 October 2017. However, Mr W’s\nphotograph was not taken that day, and the Organisation’s staff had incorrectly\ntagged Mr T’s photograph to Mr W’s account.\n7\n\nMr W defaulted on his payment for the loan he had taken out and the\n\nOrganisation issued three LODs, dated 1st, 5th and 9th February 2018, to Mr W.\n\n2\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nThe assigned debt collector left all of them at Mr W’s residence as Mr W was\nnot present when the debt collector visited him on those dates. As a result of the\nincorrect tagging, Mr T’s photograph was attached to all three LODs. Mr T’s\nphotograph did not include any other identifying information. The Organisation\nwas only made aware of the alleged data breach upon notification by ROMP.\n8\n\nFollowing the incident, the Organisation explained to the Commission\n\nthat the incident involved a human error on their part. They attempted to recover\nthe wrongly attached photograph of Mr T, but were unable to locate or contact\nMr W. They subsequently informed the Commission that the following remedial\nactions were taken:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation changed their practice of tagging photographs\n\nsuch that all photographs of new borrowers would be tagged\nimmediately to ensure that each photograph had been taken and tagged\ncorrectly.\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation changed its practices relating to the use of the\n\nborrower’s photographs for debt collection. First, the photographs\nwould no longer be attached to the LOD and handed to the borrower or\nleft at the borrower’s residence. Second, the debt collector would be\nhanded a copy of the photograph for identification purposes, but the\nphotograph would be returned to the Organisation for shredding after\neach LOD was delivered. Third, a new photograph would be generated\nfor the debt collector if a subsequent trip to the same borrower’s\nresidence was required.\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation was looking into providing more data\n\nprotection training for their employees.\n\n3\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n(d)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nThe Organisation also informed and reminded all of their\n\nemployees to follow the relevant guidelines recommended by the\nCommission.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nThe issues to be determined are as follows:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations\n\nunder section 24 of the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 18(a) of the\n\nPDPA.\n10\n\nAs a preliminary point, it was not disputed that the photographs of the\n\nOrganisation’s borrowers fell within the definition of “personal data” under\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA as it was clearly possible to identify the borrowers\nfrom that data and, in fact, that was the Organisation’s intention in collecting\nthe photographs of borrowers. Further, the Advisory Guidelines on Key\nConcepts in the PDPA (revised on 27 July 2017) at [5.10] consider photographs\nwith a facial image of an individual as personal data.\n11\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner also found that the Organisation had not\n\nbreached their consent obligation. Notably, the Organisation’s collection of\ntheir borrowers’ photographs for the purpose of debt recovery did not require\nconsent as it fell within the exception in paragraph 1(i) of the second schedule\nto the PDPA. In any case, the Organisation had obtained consent from their\nborrowers before taking their photographs. They had also obtained consent from\ntheir borrowers, as part of their contract, to “release all or some of [their]\npersonal/loan/contract details to [third party organisations] for the purpose of\n\n4\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\n… debt recovery”. They were therefore not in breach of their consent and\nnotification of purpose obligations under Sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under section 24\nof the PDPA\n12\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect the personal\n\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n13\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner finds that the Organisation did not have\n\nadequate measures in place to ensure that borrower’s photographs were\ncorrectly tagged to the borrower’s accounts. Their practice of tagging the\nborrower’s photographs at the end of each day instead of immediately tagging\nthe photographs when they were taken created an obvious vulnerability; this\narrangement was susceptible to errors being made in the tagging of photographs.\nTo this end, the mistagging of Mr T’s photograph could have been prevented if\nthe Organisation had immediately tagged photographs to the account of the\nrespective borrower once the photographs were taken. This would have clearly\nreduced the possibility of incorrect tagging.\n14\n\nAs such, the Deputy Commissioner finds that the Organisation had\n\nfailed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in\nits possession and within its control. The Organisation is, therefore, in breach\nof section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nWhether the Organisation had used the personal data for a purpose that a\nreasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances\n15\n\nSection 18 of the PDPA provides, inter alia, that an organisation may\n\ncollect, use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that\na reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. As\nobserved in AIA Singapore Private Limited [2016] SGPDPC 10 at paragraph\n18:\n“It should be borne in mind that Section 18 of the PDPA is an\nindependent obligation that organisations would need to\ncomply with even if it had obtained the consent from the\nrelevant individual for the collection, use or disclosure of his or\nher personal data. This is an important aspect of the PDPA as\nit is effective in addressing excesses in the collection, use or\ndisclosure of personal data under broadly-worded consent\nclauses.”\n\n16\n\nDespite the fact that Organisation had obtained consent for use of their\n\nborrowers’ personal data for the purposes of debt collection, the issue before the\nDeputy Commissioner was whether the use of the borrower’s photograph, by\nplacing it together with a LOD in a sealed envelope and leaving it at his or her\nresidence, was a usage of personal data that a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate in the circumstances.\n17\n\nIn our earlier decision of Credit Counselling Singapore [2017] SGPDPC\n\n18, the Commissioner considered the financial information of an individual,\nwhich includes information of the individual’s indebtedness, to be “sensitive\npersonal data” (at [15]). In particular, the Commissioner explained that:\n“Disclosure of an individual’s indebtedness to other third\nparties could lead to harm to the individual because it could\nresult in social stigma, discrimination or tarnish his reputation.\nThese are real possibilities that can affect a person’s life. Hence\nthe confidentiality of the individual’s financial information\nshould not be treated lightly.”\n\n6\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nA similar position has also been adopted by foreign data protection authorities\nin United Kingdom, Canada and Hong Kong. The point to be reiterated here is\nthat organisations who have access to such personal data, such as licensed\nmoneylenders, should exercise a greater degree of diligence and care in the\nhandling and use of such personal data.\n18\n\nThe Organisation explained that the purpose of handing the photograph\n\nto the debt collector was so that the debt collector could identify the borrower\nbefore serving the LOD. However, they did not provide an explanation for their\npractice of placing the borrower’s photograph together with the LOD and\nhanding it over to the borrower or leaving it at the borrower’s residence.\n19\n\nIn determining whether the use of personal data is for a purpose that\n\nwould be considered appropriate by a reasonable person, the Deputy\nCommissioner would consider the purpose of such use as expressed by the\nOrganisation. However, given that the Organisation had failed to address the\npurpose of placing the borrower’s photograph together with the LOD and\nleaving it at the residence of the borrower, even though the Organisation was\nasked, the Deputy Commissioner draws the inference that there was no\nappropriate purpose for using the borrower’s photographs in such a manner.\nFurther, there is no obvious reason for this practice. As such, the Deputy\nCommissioner finds that the practice of placing a borrower’s photograph\ntogether with an LOD in an envelope and leaving it at the borrower’s residence\nis not for a purpose that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the\ncircumstances of this matter and is therefore a breach of section 18(a) of the\nPDPA. The Organisation should have exercised greater care in handling this\nsensitive personal data, and used it only where appropriate.\n\n7\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nDirections\n20\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of sections 18(a) and 24\n\nof the PDPA, the Deputy Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the\nPDPA to give the Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure\ncompliance with the PDPA.\n21\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nthe Organisation, the Deputy Commissioner took into account the following\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nThe personal data disclosed in the data breach comprised a\n\nphotograph of Mr T, which was sensitive personal data as it indicated\nthat Mr T was an existing borrower of the Organisation.\n(b)\n\nThe unauthorised disclosure had been to a single third party;\n\n(c)\n\nNo other complaints of the photograph disclosed being misused\n\nhave been received hitherto;\n(d)\n\nThe risk of substantive loss or damage is low having regard to\n\nthe fact that no further documentation of Mr T were attached to the\nphotograph;\n(e)\n\nWhile attaching the photograph to the LOD and leaving it at the\n\nresidence was an inappropriate use of personal data, its effect was\nminimal since it was placed in a sealed envelope and not publically\ndisplayed;\n(f)\n\nThe Organisation had since stopped the practice of attaching the\n\nborrower’s photograph to the LOD; and\n\n8\n\n\fGalaxy Credit & Investments Pte Ltd\n\n(g)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 22\n\nThe Organisation had undertaken measures proactively and\n\nswiftly to improve on its processes to prevent a recurrence of the\nincident.\n22\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, the Deputy Commissioner has\n\ndecided not to issue any direction to the Organisation to take remedial action or\nto pay a financial penalty. Instead, the Deputy Commissioner has decided to\nissue a Warning to the Organisation for the breach of its obligations under\nsections 18(a) and 24 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n9\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Jade E-Services for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent webpages containing customers’ personal data from being cached and displayed to other customers.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Wholesale and Retail Trade","Online clothing retail services","e-commerce fashion"],"date":"2018-09-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Jade_E-Services_Singapore_Pte_Ltd.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Jade E-Services Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/09/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-jade-e-services-singapore","timestamp":"2018-09-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 21\nCase No DP-1801-B1632\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nJade E-Services Singapore Pte.

Ltd.\n[2018] SGPDPC 21\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1801-B1632\n11 September 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nThe complaint concerns the failure to protect the personal data of\n\nindividuals in the possession or under the control of Jade E-Services Singapore\nPte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”). The Organisation is in the online clothing retail\nbusiness and operates the e-commerce fashion retail website www.zalora.sg (the\n“Website”) in Singapore.\n2\n\nThe Complainant was a customer of the Organisation. She filed her\n\ncomplaint with the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\non 30 January 2018. The Complainant said she logged into her user account on\nthe Website and was shown the account subpages of another customer. She\ncould see the other customer’s name, contact number, birth date, email address\nand residential address.\n\n\fJade E-Services Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 21\n\nMaterial Facts and Findings\n3\n\nThis case concerns section 241 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\n(the “PDPA”). The issue was whether the Organisation had made reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data of its customers that was in\nits possession or under its control. The Organisation was in possession and\ncontrol of the personal data in the user account subpages of its customers.\nCustomers, such as the Complainant, could access their user accounts on the\nWebsite.\n4\n\nAs bot traffic took up much of the Website’s bandwidth, the\n\nOrganisation introduced a bot manager service on 30 January 2018. The bot\nmanager would identify whether a request for subpages of the Website was\nmade by a bot. It would then serve identified bots with cached subpages having\nthe same URL as the actual subpages requested, therefore saving bandwidth. If\nthere were no cached subpages with the same URL, the bot manager served the\nrequested subpages. However, it would cache the subpages visited to be served\nto subsequent bot requests. The cache was refreshed every 24 hours.\n5\n\nThe bot manager had a setting that would have prevented user account\n\nsubpages containing personal data from being cached if it had been applied (the\n“Setting”). The Organisation, however, did not consider the possibility that the\nbot manager might misidentify an actual user as a bot. They believed that if\nusers had logged in to the website with their username and passwords, the bot\n\n1\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires organisations to protect personal data in their possession or\nunder their control. They are required to make reasonable security arrangements against\nunauthorised access, collection, modification and other risks listed in section 24.\n\n2\n\n\fJade E-Services Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 21\n\nmanager would not consider them as a bot, and therefore not cache their account\nsubpages. As such, the Organisation did not apply the Setting.\n6\n\nIn the present complaint, the bot manager misidentified a user who\n\nlogged in with his password as a bot. It cached her account subpages, which\ncontained her personal data. They were then served to the Complainant, who\nwas also misidentified as a bot. The Organisation should not have taken the risk\nof allowing web subpages with personal data to be cached for display. It should\nhave applied the Setting from the start, when introducing the bot manager, to\nprotect its customers’ personal data. Following the incident, the Organisation\nhad, on 1 February 2018, applied the Setting to disable the caching of subpages\ncontaining personal data.\nConclusion\n7\n\nI find on the facts above that the Organisation did not make reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data of its customers. The\nOrganisation is therefore in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. I took into\naccount the number of affected individuals (estimated by the Organisation at\n23), the type of personal data at risk of unauthorised access and the remedial\naction by the Organisation to prevent recurrence. I have decided to issue a\nwarning to the Organisation for the breach of its obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA as neither further directions nor a financial penalty is warranted in\nthis case.\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n3\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Dimsum Property for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access of individuals’ personal data stored in web directories.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Real Estate","online platform for property owners"],"date":"2018-08-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Dimsum_Property_Pte_Ltd_210818.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Dimsum Property","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/08/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-dimsum-property","timestamp":"2018-08-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 20\nCase No DP-1805-B2096\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nDimsum Property Pte.

On 9 May 2018, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Personal\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that images of identification\ndocuments were made publicly accessible on the Website through 2 Web\ndirectories (or folders):\na. www.snappyhouse.com.sg\\templates\\bootstrap2responsive\\assets\\images\\avatar (the “Avatar Directory”); and\nb. www.snappyhouse.com.sg\\templates\\bootstrap2responsive\\assets\\images\\indentity (the “Identity Directory”).\n\n\fDimsum Property Pte.

These images included photographs of\nindividuals, and one even included a photograph of a user’s passport. The\nOrganisation intimated that image of the passport may have been intentionally\nor erroneously uploaded by the user.\n4\n\nThe Identity Directory contained images of identification documents\n\nuploaded by 30 registered users for verification purposes. The Organisation had\nbeen collecting and storing these documents in the folder since November 2015,\nuntil the Website was taken down on 24 May 2018.\n5\n\nIn total, the personal data of 31 individuals were accessible to the public.\n\nThe passport image in the Avatar Directory and the 30 identification documents\nin the Identity Directory disclosed personal data such as individuals’ name,\nphotograph, address, passport number, NRIC number, thumbprint, date of birth,\nplace of birth, gender, nationality, and date of issue/expiry of passport.\n6\n\nThe Organisation had engaged the services of an overseas vendor (the\n\n“Vendor”) to design and develop the Website. The completed Website was\ndelivered in November 2015. No personal data had been transferred to the\nVendor for the development of the Website.\n7\n\nThe Organisation subsequently hired its own in-house developers in\n\nNovember 2015. The in-house developers took over the development and\nadministration of the Website in January 2016. However, there was no further\nupdate or development of the Website since July 2016, and users continued to\nregister on the Website and use the Website’s functions until March 2018.

The Organisation was unclear if the Identity Directory had been\npublicly accessible at the time when the Website was delivered by the Vendor,\nor had been made publicly accessible by its own in-house developers.\n8\n\nThe Organisation was in possession and control of the personal data that\n\nappeared on the Website. Section 241 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) therefore required the Organisation to make reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data, which included protecting against the\nrisk of unauthorised access. Moreover, the protection obligation did not extend\nto the Vendor as the Vendor did not process any personal data on behalf of the\nOrganisation and was not a data intermediary. The Organisation therefore\nretained full responsibility for the IT security of its website, and the personal\ndata contained within.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nThe issue was whether the Organisation had made reasonable security\n\narrangements to protect the personal data of its customers that was in its\npossession and control. The Organisation admitted that it was unaware of the\nneed to protect the personal data that it stored in the web directories. This, in\nturn, resulted in the Organisation’s failure to implement reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data it had collected and kept in the 2 web\ndirectories. The Organisation should have protected the personal data by\n\n1\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires organisations to protect personal data in their possession or\nunder their control. They are required to make reasonable security arrangements against\nunauthorised access, collection, modification and other risks listed in section 24.\n\n3\n\n\fDimsum Property Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 20\n\nimplementing access controls to limit web access to the 2 web directories to\nauthorised users.\nConclusion\n10\n\nIn light of the above, I find that the Organisation did not put in place\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its possession or\ncontrol against risk of unauthorised access. The Organisation is therefore in\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA. In assessing the appropriate enforcement\naction in this case, I took into account the following:\na. The Organisation’s prompt actions to remove the personal data from\npublic access;\nb. The number of individuals affected;\nc. The impact of the breach; and\nd. The Organisation had ceased operations of the Website.\n11\n\nHaving considered these factors, I have decided to issue a warning to the\n\nOrganisation for the breach of its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\nwithout any directions or financial penalty.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n4\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Singapore Cricket Association for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of individuals’ personal data on its website, and for failing to put in place data protection policies.","tags":["Protection","Accountability","Directions","Arts, Entertainment and Recreation"],"date":"2018-08-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Singapore_Cricket_Association_and_Ors_210818.pdf","nature":"Protection, Accountability","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Singapore Cricket Association","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/08/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-singapore-cricket-association","timestamp":"2018-08-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [19]\n\nCase No DP-1704-B0707\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\n(1) Singapore Cricket Association\n(UEN No. S65SS0010H)\n(2) Massive Infinity Pte Ltd\n(UEN No. 201131950M)\n\n… Organisations\n\nDECISION\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nSingapore Cricket Association & Ors.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [19]\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1704-B0707\n21 August 2018\n\n1\n\nThis case concerns the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of cricket players\n\non the Singapore Cricket Association’s (“SCA”) websites (the “Incident”). On 20 April 2017,\nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received a complaint regarding\nthe unauthorised disclosure of personal data on the player profile pages on the SCA’s websites\nand commenced its investigations thereafter. The Deputy Commissioner’s findings and\ngrounds of decision based on the investigations carried out in this matter are set out below.\n2\n\nThe SCA is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Singapore. It\n\nadministers various cricket leagues in Singapore with more than 100 cricket clubs participating\nacross several league divisions. The SCA owns the rights to the domain name\nwww.singaporecricket.org (the “First Domain”), which has served as the SCA’s official\nwebsite since August 2007 (“Website”). The SCA also owns the rights to the domain name,\nwww.cricketsingapore.com (“Second Domain”). Both domains were accessible to the public\nand the hosting of both domains were set up and managed by the SCA or on its instructions.\n3\n\nAll clubs and their players are required to register with the SCA in order to participate\n\nin any of the SCA leagues. To register new players, clubs are required to submit the following\nplayer personal data through the registration form on the SCA’s Website:1\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\nPlayer name;\n\n(b)\n\nPlayer photograph;\n\nClubs were also required to provide information such as the season, league, division and club the player will be\nplaying in as well as the player’s category, role, bowling style and batting style.\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n4\n\n(c)\n\nNRIC/FIN number;\n\n(d)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(e)\n\nEmail address; and\n\n(f)\n\nMobile number.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nPlayer profile pages which showed the registered player’s name, photograph, player\n\ncode (a unique identifier assigned to players upon registration) as well as player statistics\n(“Player Profile Information”) have been made available on the SCA’s Website since it was\nlaunched in August 2007. Player Profile Information was disclosed on the SCA’s Website to\nidentify players participating in the leagues and to promote interest in the sport by providing\nthe public information on the league players in the same way that some soccer and tennis\nplayers have public profiles.2\n5\n\nIn February 2016, SCA engaged Massive Infinity Pte Ltd (“MI”), a Singapore-based\n\nweb design and development company, to revamp its Website and design and develop a new\ncustom web portal for SCA (“Revamped Website”) in accordance with the website\ndevelopment specifications provided to MI. 3 However, as the SCA’s website development\nspecifications were set out in very general terms and did not specify the contents of the\nRevamped Website, details of the exact contents of the Revamped Website were communicated\nto MI in meetings, and through phone calls and Whatsapp text messages.\n6\n\nDuring the development and testing of the Revamped Website, the Second Domain was\n\nused as a trial or user acceptance testing site.4 In the course of conducting user acceptance tests,\nthe SCA requested the inclusion of some additional pages to the Revamped Website, such as\n\nGiven the SCA’s long-standing practice of publishing Player Profile Information on its Website, players were\ndeemed to have consented to the disclosure of the Player Profile Information when they registered to participate\nin the league through their respective clubs.\n3\nTogether with the Website revamp, the SCA also switched the web hosting company for the First Domain from\nan India-based web hosting company to one in Singapore. However, MI was only engaged to provide the user\ninterface design and web development of a new custom web portal and did not provide web hosting services.\n4\nThe Second Domain was removed by the SCA on 17 April 2017 after the First Domain had stabilised. MI had\nset up a staging environment (scastg.azurewebsites.net domain) (“Testing Domain”) for development and testing\npurposes. The Testing Domain was the only web hosting setup maintained by MI for development purposes and\nwas closed soon after the code was pushed to the SCA’s testing environment, i.e. the Second Domain, on 17\nNovember 2016. The Testing Domain was not accessible by search engines.\n2\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nthe player profile pages. These additional pages were not part of the original design and were\ntherefore not included in the design documents. Neither party was able to produce any evidence\nof instructions from the SCA on the type of player information that was to be shown on the\nnew player profile pages. While the SCA represented that its intention was for the Revamped\nWebsite to show the same Player Profile Information that was on its original Website, it\nconceded that it did not expressly highlight the type of player information that was to be\nincluded on the player profile pages on the Revamped Website.\n7\n\nIn the absence of any specific instructions on the required fields for the new player\n\nprofile pages, MI created the new player profile pages based on the information collected from\nthe SCA’s player registration page on the Website. Consequently, in addition to the Player\nProfile Information that had previously been disclosed on the Website, the new player profile\npages included fields for personal data such as the player’s NRIC/FIN number, date of birth,\nemail address and mobile number (the “Additional Player Personal Data”).\n8\n\nDuring the investigations, the parties gave conflicting accounts as to when the SCA was\n\nfirst shown the new player profile pages. MI represented that before the new player profile\npages with actual player data were pushed to the Second Domain, mock-up player profile pages\ncreated using “dummy data” were sent to the SCA for its review. The Revamped Website,\nincluding the new player profile pages with actual player data from the database of registered\nplayers’ data that the SCA had provided to MI (“Registered Players Database”),5 was pushed\nto the Second Domain for the SCA’s review and approval on 17 November 2016. The SCA,\nhowever, represented that it had only discovered that contrary to its intention, the Additional\nPlayer Personal Data was disclosed after MI uploaded the new player profile pages on the\nSecond Domain and subsequently on the First Domain.\n9\n\nThe SCA and MI held a meeting on 28 November 2016 to review the changes that MI\n\nhad made to the Revamped Website. However, the SCA claimed that at the time of the meeting,\nthe new player profile pages were missing from the Revamped Website. MI, in turn, stated that\nas the SCA did not raise any issues with the new player profile pages at the meeting, MI\n\n5\n\nThe SCA received the database of the registered players’ personal data from their previous vendor based in India.\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nassumed that the SCA had approved the content of the new player profile pages and they were\nto proceed to production as created.\n10\n\nThe Additional Player Personal Data was made available on the First Domain on or\n\naround 9 January 2017 after the system was migrated from the staging server (i.e. the Second\nDomain). Upon discovering that the Additional Player Personal Data was disclosed on the new\nplayer profile pages, the SCA took steps to remove them from the player profile pages leaving\nonly the Player Profile Information.\n11\n\nThe Additional Player Personal Data was disclosed on the respective player profile\n\npages and therefore publicly accessible for the following periods:\n(a)\n\nfrom the Second Domain, from 17 November 2016 until its removal on 6\n\nFebruary 2017;\n(b)\n\nfrom the First Domain, from around 9 January 2017 until its removal on 6\n\nFebruary 2017; and\n(c)\n\ncached versions of the Revamped Website continued to be listed among the\n\nsearch results on major online search engines until the SCA submitted a request for\ntheir removal in May 2017.\n12\n\nThe parties were unable to determine conclusively the exact number of players whose\n\npersonal data had been disclosed on the Revamped Website on the First and Second Domains.\nHowever, based on the number of pages cached by the search engines, the SCA estimated that\nas many as 100 players were affected.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n13\n\nThe main issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether MI breached section 24 of the PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\nwhether the SCA complied with its obligations under section 12(a) of the PDPA;\nand\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n(c)\n14\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nwhether the SCA breached section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nIt was not disputed that the Player Profile Information and Additional Player Personal\n\nData disclosed on the new player profile pages were “personal data” as defined in section 2(1)\nof the PDPA.\nWhether MI breached section 24 of the PDPA\n15\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks. MI was engaged by the SCA to revamp the Website and was subsequently instructed to\ncreate new player profile pages on the Revamped Website. The SCA gave MI a copy of the\nSCA’s Registered Players Database in order for MI to upload the players’ personal data to the\nnew player profile pages. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that the personal\ndata in the Registered Players Database was in MI’s possession or under its control at all\nmaterial times and MI was required to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n16\n\nHowever, MI intentionally disclosed the Additional Player Personal Data on the new\n\nplayer profile pages because it was under the impression that the SCA had intended for the\nAdditional Player Personal Data to be disclosed on the new player profile pages. In this regard,\nseeing as MI relied on the SCA for directions as to the personal data that was to be disclosed\non the player profile pages and there was no evidence that MI should have known what personal\ndata was to be disclosed from the SCA’s instructions or from the circumstances, the Deputy\nCommissioner finds that MI did not act in breach of its Protection Obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA when it disclosed the Additional Player Personal Data.\nWhether the SCA complied with section 12(a) of the PDPA\n17\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA imposes an obligation on organisations to develop and\n\nimplement policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA. The SCA represented, in a witness statement dated 12 June 2017 provided by\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\na representative authorised by SCA, that it did not have any internal guidelines and/or policies\nfor the protection of personal data at the time of the Incident and that it was in the process of\nreviewing this and coming up with a data protection policy and guidelines.6\n18\n\nIt bears repeating that the development and implementation of data protection policies\n\nis a fundamental and crucial starting point for organisations to meet their obligations under the\nPDPA.7 As the Deputy Commissioner highlighted in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 (at [32])\non the role of general data protection policies:\nData protection policies and practices developed and implemented by an\norganisation in accordance with its obligations under section 12 of the PDPA are\ngenerally meant to increase awareness and ensure accountability of the\norganisation’s obligations under the PDPA.\n19\n\nIn this regard, the Deputy Commissioner agrees with the observations in the Joint\n\nGuidance Note issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, the Office of the\nInformation and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta and the Office of the Information and\nPrivacy Commissioner for British Columbia that employees will be able to better protect\npersonal data when they are able to first recognise when a matter involves data protection:8\nTraining and general education on privacy are very important. Our Offices have\nseen instances where issues were not identified as privacy issues when they\nshould have been. As a result, appropriate steps were not taken to prevent or\naddress privacy breaches. In other cases, we have seen a lack of awareness or\nappreciation for privacy risks on the part of employees result in the development\nof products or services that were not compliant with applicable privacy law. In\nAlberta, human error is the most common cause of reported breaches resulting\nin a real risk of significant harm to an individual. Examples include: misdirected\nfaxes and mail, e-mail addresses viewable in mass e-mails, inappropriate\ndisposal of documents, and disclosure of passwords.\nEmployees will be able to better protect privacy when they are able to recognize\na matter as one that involves personal information protection.\n\n6\n\nThe SCA had a data protection officer but its data protection officer had not undergone any training on data\nprotection matters.\n7\nRe M Star Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 (at [25]).\n8\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of\nAlberta and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia, Getting\nAccountability Right with a Privacy Management Program <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacylaws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda-compliancehelp/pipeda-compliance-and-training-tools/gl_acc_201204/> at p 13.\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n20\n\nTherefore, by the SCA’s own admission, it failed to meet its obligations under section\n\n12(a) of the PDPA.\nWhether the SCA complied with section 24 of the PDPA\n21\n\nThe SCA obtained the Registered Players Database, which contained the personal data\n\nof all its registered players, from its previous vendor based in India. A copy of the Registered\nPlayers Database was handed over to MI “for a week” for MI to upload the players’ data onto\nthe new player profile pages. The SCA alone had the right to determine whether and how many\nof the players’ personal data would be held and presented in the Revamped Website. Hence,\nthe Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that the personal data in the Registered Players Database\nremained under the SCA’s control at all material times.\n22\n\nHaving considered the matter, the Deputy Commissioner finds that the SCA failed to\n\nput in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its control and\ntherefore acted in breach of its Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n23\n\nPlayer profile pages were in the SCA’s original Website and the SCA’s eventual actions\n\ndisclose its intention to retain player profile pages as a function of the Revamped Website. As\nstated in paragraph 5 above, the SCA did not provide sufficiently detailed requirements to MI.\nThe omission of the player profile pages was eventually discovered during user acceptance\ntesting. The SCA then requested that player profile pages be retained in the Revamped Website.\nAgain, the SCA did not provide detailed requirements specifications and MI was left to devise\nplayer profile pages based on the information provided by players via the online registration\nform. Needless to say, this disclosed too much personal data.\n24\n\nDespite the fact that the inclusion of player profile pages had been made during the\n\nfinal stages of the project, the SCA failed to follow up to check that this function of the\nRevamped Website had been properly implemented. Such an omission is particularly egregious\ngiven its context and chronology. A flaw in the Revamped Website had been identified by the\nSCA and certain directions had been given to MI. One would expect that the natural behaviour\nof the owner of a website would be to ensure that identified flaws are properly fixed. The\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nomission of the player profile pages and how this has been resolved by MI ought to have been\nin the SCA’s consciousness. This betrays the SCA’s lackadaisical attitude towards protection\nof the personal data of registered players and sets the context for the severity of its negligence\nwhich is examined below.\n25\n\nFirst, the SCA provided a database of all existing players in its Registered Players\n\nDatabase to MI. It should have clarified whether its intention was for all the personal data in\nthe Registered Players Database to be displayed in the new player profile pages. The SCA\nsimply assumed that MI would replicate the same fields in the previous player profile pages.\nAs owner of the Revamped Website, the onus is on the SCA to give clear instructions to MI.\nAs a result of the SCA’s failure to state in clear terms the required fields to be created in the\nnew player profile pages, the Additional Player Personal Data of as many as 100 registered\nplayers were disclosed on the First and Second Domains.\n26\n\nSecond, considering that the registered players’ personal data would be disclosed in the\n\nnew player profile pages, the SCA ought, at the very least, to have reviewed the new player\nprofile pages before MI uploaded it to the First and Second Domains. Had the SCA done so,\nthe disclosure of the Additional Player Personal Data could have been avoided. It bears\nrepeating that this omission is especially egregious given the fact that the SCA had identified\na flaw, which would have meant that this omission should have been in its consciousness, but\nit failed to follow up with ensuring that it had been properly addressed.\n27\n\nSimply assuming that MI would replicate the same fields in the previous player profile\n\npages is a clear derogation of its protection obligation. The provision of proper and clear\ninstructions to the designer and developer of a website that holds personal data can and should\nform part of the protection obligations of the organisation that owns it. In failing to do so, the\nSCA is in breach of the protection obligation. Further, as mentioned above, the Deputy\nCommissioner found that the SCA’s website development specifications lacked website\ncontent details. As a result, instructions and details of the SCA’s requirements were conveyed\nto MI piecemeal in meetings and through phone calls and Whatsapp text messages, which\nappears to have led to confusion and miscommunication between the parties as to the exact\nrequirements for the Revamped Website.\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n28\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nRegardless of whether the SCA was shown the new player profile pages at the 28\n\nNovember 2016 meeting or earlier, the Deputy Commissioner finds that at least between 28\nNovember 2016 and 6 February 2017,9 the SCA could have and ought to have, but failed to,\ndiscover and prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the Additional Player Personal Data on the\nnew player profile pages. However, the SCA was unable to explain why it had failed to pick\nup on the unintended disclosure of the Additional Player Personal Data earlier or provide\nsufficient information on what arrangements or measures (if any) were implemented to review\nthe changes made to the Website.\n29\n\nAt this juncture, the Deputy Commissioner reiterates that organisations that engage\n\nservice providers to process personal data on their behalf should clarify and properly document\nthe nature and extent of service provided.\n30\n\nThis was highlighted in Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and Ors. [2016] SGPDPC 19 (at\n\n[51]) where the Commissioner emphasised the need for a clear meeting of minds as to the\nservices the service provider has agreed to undertake:\nIt is unclear whether T2’s actions would have been different had it been engaged\nto do more than enhancing the design of the site. Data controllers that engaged\noutsourced service providers have to be clear about the nature and extent of\nservices that the service provider is to provide. There must be a clear meeting of\nminds as to the services that the service provider has agreed to undertake, and\nthis should be properly documented. Data controllers should follow through with\nthe procedures to check that the outsourced provider is indeed delivering the\nservices. In the absence of such clarity of intent and procedures, it is risky to\nhold that the outsourced service provider is a data intermediary. In any case, the\nCommission has found that T2 is not a data intermediary for the reasons set out\nat paragraphs 35 to 38 above.\n[Emphasis added.]\n31\n\nAlso, as highlighted in the Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (at [4.2.1]),\n\norganisations that engage IT vendors to develop and/or maintain their websites should ensure\nthat their IT vendors are aware of the need for personal data protection:\n\n9\n\nAs mentioned above, the SCA removed the Additional Player Personal Data from the First and Second\nDomains on 6 February 2017.\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nOrganisations should emphasise the need for personal data protection to their IT\nvendors, by making it part of their contractual terms. The contract should also\nstate clearly the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the PDPA. When\ndiscussing the scope of the outsourced work, organisations should consider\nwhether the IT vendor’s scope of work will include any of the following:\n\n\nRequiring that IT vendors consider how the personal data should be handled\nas part of the design and layout of the website.\n\n\n\nPlanning and developing the website in a way that ensures that it does not\ncontain any web application vulnerabilities that could expose the personal\ndata of individuals collected, stored or accessed via the website through the\ninternet.\n\n\n\nRequiring that IT vendors who provide hosting for the website should ensure\nthat the servers and networks are securely configured and adequately\nprotected against unauthorised access.\n\n\n\nWhen engaging IT vendors to provide maintenance and/or administrative\nsupport for the website, requiring that any changes they make to the website\ndo not contain vulnerabilities that could expose the personal data.\nAdditionally, discussing whether they have technical and/or non-technical\nprocesses in place to prevent the personal data from being exposed\naccidentally or otherwise.\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n32\n\nTherefore, in light of the above, the Deputy Commissioner finds that the Organisation\n\nfailed to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of the\nAdditional Player Personal Data and is therefore in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nDirections\n33\n\nHaving found that the SCA is in breach of sections 12(a) and 24 of the PDPA, the\n\nDeputy Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the SCA such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n34\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner took into account the following factors in assessing the\n\nbreach and determining the directions to be imposed:\nAggravating factors\n\n\fSingapore Cricket Association & Ors\n\n(a)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 19\n\nthe personal data disclosed included the registered players’ NRIC/FIN numbers;\n\nMitigating factors\n(b)\n\nthe SCA took prompt action to mitigate the impact of the breach by removing\n\nthe Additional Player Personal Data from the player profile pages on the First and\nSecond Domains soon after it discovered the Incident; and\n(c)\n35\n\nthe SCA cooperated fully in the investigation.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Deputy Commissioner\n\nhereby directs the SCA:\n(a)\n\nto develop and implement policies and practices that are necessary for the SCA\n\nto meet its obligations under the PDPA within 90 days from the date of this direction;\n(b)\n\nto conduct personal data protection training for its employees to ensure that they\n\nare aware of, and will comply with the requirements of the PDPA when handling\npersonal data within 90 days from the date of this direction; and\n(c)\n\nto inform the office of the Commissioner of the completion of the above\n\ndirections within 7 days of implementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"MCST 4436 (River Isles) was not found to be in breach of the PDPA in relation to allowing subsidiary proprietors to view CCTV footage.","tags":["Not in Breach","Real Estate"],"date":"2018-08-02","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_River_Isles_020818.pdf","nature":"","title":"No Breach of the Access Obligation by MCST 4436 (River Isles)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/08/no-breach-of-the-access-obligation-by-mcst-4436-(river-isles)","timestamp":"2018-08-02","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\nCase No DP-1711-B1315 and DP-1711-B1316\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nManagement Corporation Strata Title\nPlan No. 4436\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\n\nManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — DP-1711-B1315 and DP-1711-B1316\n2 August 2018\n\nBackground\n1\n\nThe Complaint concerns the Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436 (the\n\n“Organisation”) of River Isles Condominium (“River Isles”) permitting a subsidiary\nproprietor to view the CCTV footage in the security guardhouse in the presence of two council\nmembers but without the presence of a security supervisor. The Organisation is formed to\nmanage the River Isles.\n2\n\nOn 6 and 7 November 2017, two subsidiary proprietors of River Isles (collectively\n\nknown as the “Complainants”) complained that the Organisation had allowed a fellow\nsubsidiary proprietor to view the CCTV footage without supervision, notwithstanding the\npresence of the two council members. The purpose for viewing was to locate a missing cat on\n2 November 2017. The Complainants were concerned other individuals might be captured in\nthe said CCTV footage.\n3\n\nThe Complainants alleged there was no security supervisor nor staff of Savills Property\n\nManagement Pte Ltd, the managing agent (“MA”) present during the viewing. Although two\ncouncil members were in attendance, the Complainants were of the view that only security\nguards, the MA’s staff or police could view the CCTV footage.\n4\n\nIn its responses, the Organisation averred that section 47 of the Building Maintenance\n\nand Strata Management Act (“BMSMA”) applies. Section 47 states that any subsidiary\nproprietor has the right to ask for inspection as well as request for a copy of any other record\nor document in the possession of the Organisation. Consequently, the request to view the\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\n\nCCTV footage by the subsidiary proprietor was, according to the Organisation, an inspection\nof a document that was permitted under section 47 of the BMSMA.\n5\n\nIn this case, it is not disputed that the individual who applied for and viewed the CCTV\n\nfootage was a subsidiary proprietor at the material time. Investigations disclosed that the\ninspection of the CCTV footage was carried out on 2 November 2017 at about 2110hrs by the\nsubsidiary proprietor in the presence of two council members. The CCTV footage that was\ninspected consisted footages of the lift lobby on 29 October 2017 and the subsidiary proprietor\nviewed it for about 20-30 minutes.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n6\n\nThis case concerns the operation of the subordination provision in section 4(6)1 with\n\nrespect to the access obligation under 212 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”)\nand its interaction with a subsidiary proprietor’s right to inspect and take copies of documents\nunder section 47 of the BMSMA. In particular, the issues are:\n(a)\n\nWhether CCTV footage is considered a document or record under section 47 of\n\nthe BMSMA; and\n(b)\n\nWhether the subordination provision in section 4(6)(b) of the PDPA applies to\n\ndisplace section 21 of the PDPA in respect of a subsidiary proprietor’s request for\ndocuments and records under section 47 of the BMSMA.\n(a)\n\nWhether CCTV footage is a document under section 47 of the BMSMA\n\n7\n\nIn the case of Tan Hee Chye, relying on the definition of online Oxford Dictionaries,\n\nStrata Titles Board (“STB”) accepted that the ‘audio recordings’ fell within the definitions of\n‘document’ and ‘record’. STB viewed that MCST should make available the audio recordings\nfor inspection under section 47 of the BMSMA.\n\n1\n\n2\n\nUnder Section 4(6)(b) of the PDPA, unless otherwise expressly provided, the provisions of other written\nlaw shall prevail to the extent that any provision of Parts III to VI is inconsistent with the provisions of\nthat other written law.\nSection 20 of the PDPA requires the organisation to provide access to personal data about an individual\nthat is in its possession or under its control subject to exceptions enumerated in the Fifth Schedule or\nsubsection (3). Pertinent to this case is subsection (3)(c), which limits the data subject’s right of access\nwhere it is reasonably expected to reveal personal data about another individual.\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436\n\n8\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\n\nIt is trite law that the meaning of the word “document” given the broadest definition\n\nand is capable of accommodating any form or medium on which information can be recorded\nin a material form. The courts have held that documents include electronic documents like\nemails, audio and video files, and even storage media and recording devices like hard disks. 3\nThe Supreme Court’s Practice Directions on electronic discovery enumerates a list of\nreasonably usable file formats for the production of electronic documents during discovery\nwhich includes file formats for both audio and video files.4\n9\n\nThe present case deals with video files in the form of CCTV footages. Since audio\n\nrecordings can come within the meaning of “document” or “record”, I do not see any reason\nwhy a video record should be treated with any exception. Accordingly, I am of the view that\nCCTV footages should also fall within the ambit of documents or records to which a subsidiary\nproprietor has a right to inspect and take copies under section 47 of the BMSMA.\n(b)\n\nThe interaction of the access obligation under section 21 of the PDPA and a subsidiary\n\nproprietor’s right to inspection under section 47 of the BMSMA\n10\n\nSection 47 of the BMSMA states that the Organisation shall make available for\n\ninspection any document or record in the custody or under the control of the Organisation: see\nTan Hee Chye v The MCST Plan No. 395 STB No. 83 of 2014 (“Tan Hee Chye”). As such, the\nOrganisation has a legal obligation to provide inspection and copies of documents or records\nto any subsidiary proprietor under section 47 of the BMSMA.\n11\n\nSection 21 of the PDPA gives a data subject the right to access personal data about him\n\nthat the Organisation has in its possession or under its control. The data subject’s right of access\nis curtailed by subsection (2) and (3). Subsection (2) absolves the Organisation from providing\n— “is not required to provide” (but presumably has a discretion to provide if it is reasonable to\ndo so) — access in any of the situations enumerated in the Fifth Schedule. In contrast,\nsubsection (3) is a mandatory injunction that prohibits the Organisation from providing access\n— “shall not provide” — in any of the situations enumerated therein. In the present case, the\npertinent provision is subsection (3)(c). The Organisation cannot provide (and has no discretion\nin the matter) access to personal data that can reasonably be expected to reveal personal data\n3\n\nSee Sanae Achar v Sci-Gen Ltd [2011] 3 SLR 967; [2011] SGHC 87, at [10].\n\n4\n\nSee Part V of the Supreme Court Practice Directions and Appendix E Part 4.\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\n\nabout another individual. The PDPC has issued advisory guidelines5 on the operation of section\n21 of the PDPA which requires organisations to redact personal data about other individuals\nfrom documents that are provided to a data subject pursuant to a data subject access request,\nunless consent for disclosure have been obtained from these other individuals.\n12\n\nThe subordination provision in section 4(6)(c) of the PDPA becomes operative when\n\nthere are inconsistencies between the provisions of any other written law and the provisions in\nParts III to VI of the PDPA. It operates by placing the PDPA provisions in subordination to\nother written law, such that the provisions of such other written laws shall prevail in the event\nof any inconsistencies. In the present case, the two potentially inconsistent provisions are\nsection 47 of the BMSMA and section 21 of the PDPA.\n13\n\nThe subsidiary proprietor’s right to inspect and take copies of any document or record\n\nunder section 47 of the BMSMA is not subject to any restrictions. Whereas the data subject’s\naccess right under section 21 of the PDPA to access personal data about him is subject to\nrestrictions. A subsidiary proprietor has the right to inspect and take copies of CCTV footages\nunder section 47 of the BMSMA without any requirement for the redaction of personal data\nabout other individuals that happen to be captured as part of the video record. If the same\nrequest is made by the subsidiary proprietor under section 21 of the PDPA in exercise of his\ndata subject access rights, personal data of other individuals have to be redacted unless their\nconsent have been obtained.\n14\n\nIn the face of this inconsistency, I am obliged by section 4(6) of the PDPA to decide\n\nthat section 47 of the BMSMA shall prevail over section 21 of the PDPA in the present case,\nto the extent that the Organisation can provide inspection of CCTV footages to the subsidiary\nproprietor without the need to redact personal data of other individuals or to seek their consent\nfor such disclosure. However, it should be borne in mind that section 47 of the BMSMA only\napplies when it is a person entitled under that provision, eg a subsidiary proprietor, is making\nthe application for inspection of the CCTV record. It has no application when the request for\ninspection is made by any other resident or visitor to the property, in which case the request\nshould be handled as a data subject access request under section 21 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\nSee paragraph 4.8 of the Advisory Guidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics.\n\n\fManagement Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436\n\n15\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 18\n\nThis decision should be distinguished from Re Exceltec Property Management Pte Ltd\n\nand others6, also a decision that involved section 47 of the BMSMA, where it was decided that\ninformation on the strata roll was generally available to the public by reason that the class of\nperson entitled to apply was broadly defined and as a matter of fact there were few or no\nrestrictions imposed for a person to gain access to the strata roll: all an applicant was required\nto do was make an online application and pay the prescribed fee.7 In the present case, there is\nno evidence that the CCTV video footages was broadly accessible in the same manner. The\ncontrary was in fact true. Access in this case was restricted to a subsidiary proprietor and\ninspection was conducted in the presence of two other council members. Re Exceltec Property\nManagement Pte Ltd should not be interpreted in an overly broad manner to render all\ndocuments accessible under section 47 of the BMSMA to be publicly available. The analysis\nin Re Exceltec Property Management called for both a legal and a factual analysis. In order\nthat CCTV footages do not become de facto publicly available, management corporations\nwould do well to put in place policies and practices to ensure that only parties entitled to access\nunder section 47 of the BMSMA are given access to CCTV footages.\nConclusion\n16\n\nFor the reasons set out above, I am therefore of the view that the Organisation has not\n\nbreached section 21 of the PDPA when it provided the subsidiary proprietor inspection of the\nCCTV footages under section 47 of the BMSMA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n6\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 8.\n\n7\n\n[2018] PDP Digest 184; [2017] SGPDPC 8 at [33], et seq.\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $30,000 was imposed on Singapore Taekwondo Federation for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of minors’ NRIC numbers on its website.

It was represented by the Organisation that the purpose of\nuploading the PDF documents on its website was to enable students to verify\ntheir participation in the Championships.\n3\n\nOn 30 May 2017, a complaint was lodged by a member of the public\n\n(“Complainant”)\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nPersonal\n\nData\n\nProtection\n\nCommission\n\n(“Commission”), alleging that there was an unauthorised disclosure of the\nNRIC numbers of 782 students who were participants of the 2017\nChampionships. Whilst the NRIC numbers, within the PDF documents, were\nset out in columns that were minimised, and, hence, not immediately visible,\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nthere was an unauthorised disclosure of these NRIC numbers when the\nComplainant subsequently copied and pasted the contents of the PDF\ndocuments on to another document.\n4\n\nThe Commissioner sets out below his findings and grounds of decision\n\nbased on the investigations carried out in this matter.\nMaterial Facts\n5\n\nOn 19 May 2017, the Complainant chanced upon the PDF documents\n\non the Organisation’s website, which contained the names and schools of\nstudents who were participants of the 2017 Championships.\n6\n\nThe NRIC numbers of the students were not immediately visible to the\n\nComplainant in the PDF documents, as the NRIC numbers were set out in\ncolumns which were minimised. Nevertheless, when the Complainant copied\nand subsequently pasted the contents of the PDF documents on to another\ndocument, he was able to view the NRIC numbers of the students. The\nComplainant proceeded to inform the Organisation of this unauthorised\ndisclosure of the students’ NRIC numbers via email on 19 May 2017.\n7\n\nAs the Complainant did not receive any response from the Organisation,\n\nhe proceeded to lodge a complaint with the Commission on 30 May 2017. Upon\nreceiving the complaint, the Commission commenced an investigation into this\nmatter.\n8\n\nOn 31 May 2017, after the Organisation was notified by the Commission\n\nof the unauthorised disclosure of the students’ NRIC numbers, the Organisation\nremoved the PDF documents from its website. The Organisation represented\nthat it had also taken steps to contact Google to remove the cache, as well as\n\n2\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\ninstructed its staff to delete the relevant information in question before\nuploading any documents on to the Organisation’s website.\n9\n\nDuring the course of the Commission’s investigation, the Organisation\n\nmade the following representations in relation to its process of handling the\npersonal data of the students intending to participate in the Championships.\nFirstly, it would receive an encrypted Excel spreadsheet containing the personal\ndata of students intending to participate in the Championships, including their\nnames, NRIC numbers, dates of birth, gender, school, class, taekwondo grade,\nnames of taekwondo instructors and clubs, from the Physical Education Sport\nEducation Board of the Ministry of Education (“MOE”).\n10\n\nAfter receiving the encrypted Excel spreadsheet, the Organisation’s\n\nHead of the Tournament Department (“Tournament Head”) would typically\nproceed to rearrange the students’ personal data into programme lists and bout\nsheets using Microsoft Excel. The Tournament Head asserted that in relation to\nthe Excel spreadsheets containing the students’ personal data, he would “hide”\ntheir NRIC numbers, before converting the Excel spreadsheets into PDF\ndocuments.\n11\n\nThe Tournament Head describes the process as follows:\n“I will copy and paste the names, NRIC numbers, and schools\ninto a new excel spreadsheet. I will then hide the NRIC numbers\nand then add in the programmes into the new excel\nspreadsheet. I have been doing this since 2015.\nThereafter, I will send the new excel spreadsheet with the\nnames, schools, programme list and hidden NRIC numbers to\n[redacted] who will then convert it into a PDF list for uploading\nonto STF’s website. She also has been doing this since 2015 but\nshe does not know that I simply hide the NRIC numbers”.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n3\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n12\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nThe investigation carried out by the Commission sought to verify the\n\nassertion made by the Tournament Head. A check on the internet, including the\nwebsite of Adobe Systems Incorporated, the proprietor of the Adobe PDF\nsoftware, did not reveal the reappearance of “hidden” contents when copied to\na separate Microsoft Word or Excel document (“Alleged Bug”) to be a known\nissue or function.\n13\n\nIn addition, officers of the Commission had conducted tests to replicate\n\nthe result of the Alleged Bug. The officers of the Commission first copied the\nPDF documents in question found on the Organisation’s website to a newly\ncreated Microsoft Word document and found that the columns which were not\nvisible on the PDF documents appeared when copied to the Microsoft Word\ndocument. This verified the Complainant’s assertion. However, when the\nofficers of the Commission created a new Excel spreadsheet with properly\nhidden columns, this Alleged Bug did not occur. Subsequently, the officers of\nthe Commission discovered that this issue would only occur if the columns were\nminimised instead. In other words, if the columns in an Excel spreadsheet were\nminimised instead of hidden, and the Excel spreadsheet were to be converted\ninto PDF format, then the contents of the minimised columns would reappear\nwhen the PDF document was copied onto a Microsoft Word or Excel document.\n14\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Commissioner finds that the columns in the\n\nExcel spreadsheet prepared by the Tournament Head were not hidden but\nmerely minimised.\n15\n\nIn relation to the reason for purportedly hiding (but actually minimizing)\n\nthe column with NRIC numbers in the Excel spreadsheet, the Organisation\nrepresented that this was for the sake of convenience in submitting the results\nof the Championships to participating schools. Following the conclusion of the\n\n4\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nChampionships, participating schools would typically request for the name lists\nof the medalists and the results of the Championships, which would have to\ncontain the students’ NRIC numbers, so as to allow the schools to verify and\npresent colour awards to their students.\n16\n\nThe Organisation conceded that it was not aware that there were\n\ncolumns which had been minimised in the PDF documents, such that the NRIC\nnumbers in these columns appeared when the contents of the PDF documents\nwere copied and pasted to another document.\n17\n\nIn addition, the Organisation admitted during the course of the\n\ninvestigation that it was not aware of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”). Consequently, the Organisation did not appoint a data protection\nofficer (“DPO”), nor did it implement any policies or practices necessary for it\nto meet its obligations under the PDPA.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n18\n\nThe issues for determination are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation had complied with its obligation under\n\nsection 11 of the PDPA to designate one or more persons to be\nresponsible for ensuring that the Organisation complies with the PDPA;\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation had complied with its obligation under\n\nsection 12 of the PDPA to develop and implement policies and practices\nthat are necessary for the Organisation to meet its obligations under the\nPDPA; and\n(c)\n\nwhether the Organisation had complied with its obligation under\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA to implement reasonable security arrangements\n\n5\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nto protect personal data in the Organisation’s possession or under the\nOrganisation’s control.\n19\n\nAt the outset, although the Tournament Head represented during the\n\ninvestigation that the Organisation is managed mostly by a team of volunteers,\npursuant to section 53(1) of the PDPA, the Organisation would be responsible\nfor its employees (which includes volunteers1) actions which are engaged in the\ncourse of their employment2.\n20\n\nIn addition, the NRIC numbers that were disclosed constitutes personal\n\ndata as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA, as every single student in the PDF\ndocuments could be identified from the NRIC numbers disclosed. Accordingly,\nthe Organisation would be subject to the data protection obligations under Parts\nIII to VI of the PDPA.\nNature of personal data\n21\n\nAs a preliminary issue, the Commissioner first considered the nature of\n\nthe personal data in this matter.\n22\n\nThe personal data disclosed NRIC numbers which, according to the\n\nCommission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data\nProtection Act3 (“Key Concepts Guidelines”) and the Guide to Basic Data\nAnonymisation Techniques4 (“Anonymisation Guide”), constitute a data\n\n1\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n2\n\nSection 53 of the PDPA read with section 4(1)(b) of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\nRevised on 27 July 2017.\n\n4\n\nPublished on 25 January 2018.\n\n6\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nattribute that is assigned to an individual for the purposes of identifying the\nindividual and, on its own, identifies an individual.5 The Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics6 (“Selected Topics\nGuidelines”) also recognise that “NRIC numbers are of special concern to\nindividuals as they are unique to each individual” (emphasis added).7\n23\n\nIn addition, the NRIC numbers that were disclosed were the NRIC\n\nnumbers of students, minors who were less than 21 years of age. The Selected\nTopics Guidelines recognise that certain considerations may arise in this regard,\nincluding that “there is generally greater sensitivity surrounding the treatment\nof minors” (emphasis added).8 Therefore, good practices in protecting minors’\npersonal data include, amongst other things, placing “additional safeguards\nagainst [the] unauthorised disclosure of, or unauthorised access to, [the]\npersonal data of minors” (emphasis added).9\n24\n\nA similar approach in respect of minors’ personal data has been adopted\n\nin several other jurisdictions. In Canada, the Office of the Privacy\nCommissioner of Canada (“OPC”) has expressed that it “has consistently\nviewed personal information relating to youth and children as being\nparticularly sensitive and must be handled accordingly” (emphasis added).10\n\n5\n\nAnonymisation Guide at [3.1] and Key Concept Guidelines at [5.9].\n\n6\n\nRevised on 28 March 2017.\n\n7\n\nSelected Topics Guidelines at [6.1].\n\n8\n\nSelected Topics Guidelines at [8.12].\n\n9\n\nSelected Topics Guidelines at [8.12].\n\n10\n\nOPC, Guidance for businesses that collect kids’ information\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-and-kids/gd_bus_kids/>.\n\n7\n\nat\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n25\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Information Commissioner’s Office\n\n(“ICO”) has taken the view that “children need particular protection when [an\norganisation is] collecting and processing their personal data” (emphasis\nadded) and if an organisation processes children’s personal data, the\norganisation “should think about the need to protect them from the outset, and\ndesign [the organisation’s] systems and processes with this in mind”.11 The ICO\nhas also expressed that there are “important additional considerations that need\nto [be taken] into account when [an organisation’s] data subject is a child”\n(emphasis added).12\n26\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal\n\nData (“PCPD”) has taken the view that “children are identified as a vulnerable\ngroup who may have special needs in privacy protection” (emphasis added).13\n27\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it is evident that minors’ personal data would\n\ntypically be of a more sensitive nature, especially when it concerns unique\nidentifiers such as NRIC numbers. Accordingly, when it comes to the protection\nof “sensitive” personal data, organisations are required to take extra precautions\nand ensure higher standards of protection under the PDPA.\n\n11\n\nICO, Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (22 March 2018) at\n<https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protectionregulation-gdpr-1-0.pdf> at p. 155.\n\n12\n\nICO, Consultation: Children and the GDPR Guidance (21 December 2017) at\n<https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/consultations/2172913/children-and-thegdpr-consultation-guidance-20171221.pdf> at p. 19.\n\n13\n\nHong Kong, PCPD, 2015 Study Report on Online Collection of Children’s Personal\nData\n(December\n2015)\nat\n<https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/resources_centre/publications/surveys/files/sweep\n2015_e.pdf>.\n\n8\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under section\n11 of the PDPA\n28\n\nAt the outset, during the investigation, the Organisation admitted that it\n\nhad “no idea of the PDPA”, and consequently, was not aware of its data\nprotection obligations under Parts III to VI of the PDPA.\n29\n\nNotably, the Organisation’s lack of awareness of its data protection\n\nobligations is not a legitimate defence to a breach under the PDPA, as set out in\nRe M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 (“M\nStars Movers”) at [16]:\n“[i]t is a trite principle of law that ignorance of the law is no\nexcuse. Thus, the Organisation’s lack of awareness of its\nobligations under the PDPA cannot excuse its breach of the\nPDPA. The data protection provisions of the PDPA took effect on\n2 July 2014 after a “sunrise” period of more than a year from 2\nJanuary 2013. Since then, organisations have had ample\nopportunities to develop and implement appropriate policies\nand practices to comply with the PDPA. In any event, an\norganisation’s lack of awareness of its data protection\nobligations is not a legitimate defence to a breach.”\n\n30\n\nSection 11(3) of the PDPA requires the Organisation to designate one or\n\nmore individuals, i.e. the DPO, to be responsible for ensuring the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the PDPA.\n31\n\nThe Organisation confirmed that there was “no person appointed for the\n\nrole of Data Protection Officer”.\n32\n\nBy the Organisation’s own admission, the Commissioner finds that the\n\nOrganisation has failed to meet its obligations under section 11(3) of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner repeats the comments at paragraph 29 above that a lack of\nawareness of the obligations imposed by the PDPA does not amount to a\nlegitimate defence against a breach by the Organisation.\n\n9\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n33\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nThe Commissioner takes this opportunity to reiterate the importance of\n\nthe role of a DPO as set out in M Stars Movers at [33]:\n“[t]he DPO plays an important role in ensuring that the\norganisation fulfils its obligations under the PDPA. Recognition\nof the importance of data protection and the central role\nperformed by a DPO has to come from the very top of an\norganisation and ought to be part of enterprise risk\nmanagement frameworks…The DPO ought to be appointed\nfrom the ranks of senior management and be amply empowered\nto perform the tasks that are assigned to him/her… The DPO\nneed not – and ought not – be the sole person responsible for\ndata protection within the organisation…Every member of staff\nhas a part to play...”\n\n34\n\nGenerally, the responsibilities of a DPO include, but are not limited to:14\n(a)\n\nensuring compliance with the PDPA when developing and\n\nimplementing policies and processes for handling personal data;\n(b)\n\nfostering a data protection culture in an organisation and\n\ncommunicating personal data protection policies to stakeholders;\n(c)\n\nhandling and managing personal data protection related queries\n\nand complaints;\n(d)\n\nalerting management to any risks that may arise with regard to\n\npersonal data; and\n(e)\n\nliasing with the Commission on data protection matters, if\n\nnecessary.\n\n14\n\nPDPC, Data Protection Officers at <https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Organisations/DataProtection-Officers>.\n\n10\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n35\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that the DPO plays a vital role in\n\nimplementing and building a robust data protection framework to ensure an\norganisation’s compliance with its obligations under the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under section\n12 of the PDPA\n36\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop and\n\nimplement policies and practices that are necessary to meet its obligations under\nthe PDPA.\n37\n\nDuring the investigation, the Organisation confirmed that there was “no\n\npersonal data policy” implemented and represented that the manner of handling\nthe students’ personal data was an “unwritten SOP”.\n38\n\nBy the Organisation’s own admission, the Commissioner finds that the\n\nOrganisation has failed to meet its obligations under section 12(a) of the PDPA.\nSimilar to the above, the Commissioner repeats his comments at paragraph 29\nthat a lack of awareness of the obligations imposed by the PDPA does not\namount to a legitimate defence against a breach by the Organisation.\n39\n\nThe Commissioner takes this opportunity to reiterate the role of data\n\nprotection policies, as set out in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [32]:\n\n“…[d]ata protection policies and practices developed and\nimplemented by an organisation in accordance with its\nobligations under section 12 of the PDPA are generally meant\nto increase awareness and ensure accountability of the\norganisation’s obligations under the PDPA…”\n\n11\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n40\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nIn addition, M Stars Movers highlights the importance of the need for\n\norganisations to develop and implement data protection policies and practices\nat [27] to [28]:\n“…[a]t the very basic level, an appropriate data protection policy\nshould be drafted to ensure that it gives a clear understanding\nwithin the organisation of its obligations under the PDPA and\nsets general standards on the handling of personal data which\nstaff are expected to adhere to. To meet these aims, the framers,\nin developing such policies, have to address their minds to the\ntypes of data the organisation handles which may constitute\npersonal data; the manner in, and the purposes for, which it\ncollects, uses and discloses personal data; the parties to, and\nthe circumstances in, which it discloses personal data; and the\ndata protection standards the organisation needs to adopt to\nmeet its obligations under the PDPA.\nAn overarching data protection policy will ensure a consistent\nminimum data protection standard across an organisation’s\nbusiness practices, procedures and activities...”\n\n41\n\nFinally, the Commissioner reiterates past observations on the benefits\n\nand importance of documenting an organisation’s data protection policies and\npractices in a written policy, as per Re Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at\n[14]:\n“[t]he lack of a written policy is a big drawback to the protection\nof personal data. Without having a policy in writing, employees\nand staff would not have a reference for the Organisation’s\npolicies and practices which they are to follow in order to\nprotect personal data. Such policies and practices would be\nineffective if passed on by word of mouth, and indeed, the\nOrganisation may run the risk of the policies and practices\nbeing passed on incorrectly. Having a written policy is\nconducive to the conduct of internal training, which is a\nnecessary component of an internal data protection\nprogramme.”\n\n42\n\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the development and implementation\n\nof written data protection policies and procedures are important in ensuring an\norganisation’s compliance with its obligations under the PDPA.\n\n12\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under section\n24 of the PDPA\n43\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by implementing reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n44\n\nThe Commissioner’s assessment of whether the Organisation had\n\ncomplied with its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA would be confined\nto the NRIC numbers of students. As admitted by the Organisation during the\ncourse of the investigation, the NRIC numbers of students were not supposed to\nbe contained and disclosed in the PDF documents.\n45\n\nWhilst the encrypted Excel spreadsheet containing the students’\n\npersonal data was provided by the MOE, the entire process of compiling the\npersonal data into a separate Excel spreadsheet, converting the Excel\nspreadsheet into PDF documents and uploading the PDF documents were\nactions that were conducted solely by the Organisation, without any external\ninterference from the MOE or the entity responsible for maintaining the\nOrganisation’s website.\n46\n\nThat said, the Organisation was unaware and unable to explain why the\n\nNRIC numbers were left in the minimised columns in the PDF documents.\n\n47\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation’s mistake of not realising that the NRIC\n\nnumbers were present in minimised columns in the PDF documents and could\nhave been disclosed without authorisation, could be quite easily repeated. Any\nperson could simply copy the contents of the PDF documents and paste it on to\n\n13\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nanother document, thereby resulting in further unauthorised disclosures of the\nstudents’ personal data. Such potential impact and harm cannot be ignored,\nespecially when it involves the NRIC numbers of 782 students who were also\nminors, and whose personal data would thus be considered to be more sensitive\nin nature.\n48\n\nIt is precisely the fact that the unauthorised disclosure could have\n\nreoccurred quite easily due to the same mistake, that focus is drawn to the issue\nof whether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under section 24\nof the PDPA.\n49\n\nOn this issue, the Commission found that the Organisation did not\n\nappear to have taken sufficient steps towards protecting the personal data in its\npossession, to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data.\n50\n\nAn example of an administrative security arrangement which the\n\nOrganisation could have made in respect of the personal data in its possession,\nwas to “[c]onduct regular training sessions for staff to impart good practices\nin handling personal data and strengthen awareness of threats to security of\npersonal data”.15 The Organisation could have implemented staff training\nsessions to “[e]nsure that staff are trained and familiar with the software used\nto process…documents containing personal data. For example, staff using\nspreadsheets should be aware of how sorting the data incorrectly may lead to\nerrors”.16 Similarly, the Organisation could have adopted any of the following\nmeasures to ensure that personnel using Microsoft Excel to process personal\n\n15\n\nKey Concepts Guidelines at [17.5].\n\n16\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data (20 January 2017), at [2.1].\n\n14\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\ndata were well apprised and updated on the functions of the software, in\nparticular, the difference between columns that were “minimised” and “hidden”\nin an Excel spreadsheet:\n(a)\n\n“[e]nsure that new and existing staff receive regular training so\n\nthat they are well apprised and updated on the proper procedures for\nprocessing and sending personal data”;17\n(b)\n\n“[train] staff to ensure only necessary personal data are\n\nextracted”;18\n(c)\n\n“[k]eep ICT security awareness training for employees updated\n\nand conduct such training regularly”;19 and\n(d)\n\n“[provide] the appropriate training to ensure proper usage of\n\nthe software used.”20\n51\n\nGiven the nature of the personal data in question, the Organisation had\n\nnot taken into consideration what extra precautions would be required to protect\nthe sensitive personal data of the students, who are minors.\n52\n\nThe Key Concepts Guidelines express that an organisation should\n\n“implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\n\n17\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data (20 January 2017), at [2.2].\n\n18\n\nPDPC, Guide to Data Protection Impact Assessment (1 November 2017), at [7.2].\n\n19\n\nPDPC, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised on 20 January\n2017), at [5.2].\n\n20\n\nPDPC, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised on 20 January\n2017), at [17.7].\n\n15\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of sensitivity”.21 As set out in the\nCommission’s Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and\nSending Personal Data, “[d]ocuments or communications that contain sensitive\npersonal data should be processed…with particular care” (emphasis added).22\n53\n\nThe Key Concepts Guidelines goes on to state that (at [8.12]):\n“…given that there is generally greater sensitivity surrounding\nthe treatment of minors, it may be prudent for organisations to\nconsider putting in place relevant precautions, if they are (or\nexpect to be) collecting, using or disclosing personal data about\nminors. For example, organisations that provide services\ntargeted at minors could state terms and conditions in language\nthat is readily understandable by minors, or use pictures and\nother visual aids to make such terms and conditions easier to\nunderstand. Other good practices could include placing\nadditional safeguards against unauthorized disclosure of, or\nunauthorized access to, personal data of minors, or\nanonymising personal data of minors before disclosure, where\nfeasible.”\n\n54\n\nIn this regard, the Commissioner agrees with the OPC that, in the context\n\nof children’s personal data, safeguards that are implemented must be\n“commensurate with the amount and potential sensitivity of the information at\nrisk” and if the appropriate safeguards are not implemented, this “could, in the\nwrong hands, put children at unnecessary risk of harm”.23 In that case, the OPC\nfound that the personal data of approximately 316,000 Canadian children, in\naddition to approximately 237,000 Canadian adults, that were in the possession\n\n21\n\nKey Concepts Guidelines at [17.3].\n\n22\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data (20 January 2017), at [2.2].\n\n23\n\nPIPEDA Report of Findings #2018-001: Connected toy manufacturer improves\nsafeguards to adequately protect children’s information (8 January 2018) at\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigationsinto-businesses/2018/pipeda-2018-001/> at Overview.\n\n16\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nof a toy manufacturer had been compromised as the organisational and\ntechnological safeguards that were implemented at the time of the data breach\nincident were not commensurate with the amount and potential sensitivity of the\npersonal data.\n55\n\nWhen it comes to the protection of “sensitive” personal data, the\n\nOrganisation had failed to take extra precautions to guard against and prevent\nunauthorised disclosures of personal data, and failed to ensure a relatively\nhigher standard of protection of personal data under the PDPA. At a minimum,\nthe Organisation ought to have ensured that its staff in charge of creating,\nprocessing and converting the Excel spreadsheets were given proper and regular\ntraining to equip them with the knowledge to utilise the correct function to\nconvert the Excel spreadsheets into PDF documents that were routinely\npublished on the Organisation’s website.\n56\n\nNot only did the Organisation fail to develop and implement the\n\nappropriate security arrangements upon the PDPA coming into full force on 2\nJuly 2014, this failure had carried on well after 2 July 2014. Considering how\nthere were two other instances where the Organisation had uploaded the\npersonal data of students in the same manner, specifically for the 2015 and 2016\nChampionships, the Organisation’s prolonged failure to develop and implement\nreasonable security measures (for instance, in the form of proper and regular\nstaff training to equip staff with the knowledge to use the right Microsoft Excel\nfeature) to protect the personal data is also taken into consideration in this\ndecision.\n57\n\nGiven the absence of any security arrangements to protect personal data\n\nin its possession against unauthorised disclosure, the Commissioner finds that\nthe Organisation has contravened section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n17\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nDirections\n58\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of sections 11, 12 and\n\n24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\nto give the Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure compliance\nwith the PDPA.\n59\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nthe Organisation, the Commissioner took into account, as a mitigating factor,\nthe Organisation’s prompt remedial actions to rectify and prevent the recurrence\nof the data breach.\n60\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following aggravating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nthe personal data disclosed involved the NRIC numbers of\n\nminors, which constitute personal data of a sensitive nature, and the\ndisclosure of which could cause substantial actual or potential harm to\nthe students;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation showed a lack of awareness of its obligations\n\nunder the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation caused quite some delays in the investigation\n\nprocess. Despite the approval of an extension of time for responding to\nthe Commission’s Notice to Require Production of Documents and\nInformation issued under the Ninth Schedule of the PDPA, the\nOrganisation only responded after the Commission had sent subsequent\nreminders requesting for the Organisation’s response, and only after the\nPresident of the Organisation was copied in one of such email reminders.\n\n18\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n61\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nThe Commissioner has also reviewed the representations made by the\n\nOrganisation seeking a reduction in the financial penalty imposed, a summary\nof which follows:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation is a small registered charity with a thin budget;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation did not appoint a Data Protection Officer and\n\nas such were unaware of the requirement to have a Data Protection\nPolicy;\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took immediate remedial action;\n\n(d)\n\nThe breach was due to inadvertence and ignorance that the NRIC\n\ndata could be seen on its website;\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation acknowledged the unauthorized disclosure of\n\n782 students but that there is no specific information to suggest that the\ndata of the students involved in the 2015 and 2016 tournaments had been\nsimilarly disclosed;\n(f)\n\nThe delay was caused by their surprise at the lapse and their\n\nneed to obtain external advise as well as the Organisation’s internal\napproval process to respond to the PDPC;\n62\n\nIt should be noted that the Commissioner had already taken (c) above\n\ninto consideration in determining the financial penalty quantum. The\nCommissioner finds that the rest of the above representations do not justify a\nreduction in the financial penalty. The PDPA applies to all organisations and\nthe mere fact that the Organisation is a small charity is not a mitigating factor.\nIf the Organisation has cash flow issues, it is open to the Organisation to request\n\n19\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\nthat the penalty be paid in installments. Also, inadvertence and ignorance of the\nlaw are not mitigating factors.\n63\n\nOn the point of delay, the Organisation took 2 months to respond to the\n\nfirst Notice to Produce issued to the Organisation. The initial deadline to\nrespond to the Notice to Produce was on 23 June 2017, 2 weeks after the Notice\nto Produce was issued. PDPC granted the Organisation’s request for an\nextension of time to respond to the Notice to Produce by 31 July 2017. The\nOrganisation failed to meet this extended deadline and did not respond even\nafter a first reminder was sent on 2 August 2017. The Organisation only\nresponded to the Notice to Produce after a second reminder was issued on 10\nAugust 2017 and copied to the President of the Organisation. The Organisation\nhad already been granted the requested 5-month extension of time to respond\nand failed to do so within that time, only responding after 2 reminders were\nissued. The Commissioner finds that the 7 weeks given to the Organisation to\nrespond was more than sufficient to engage third party experts to assist the\nOrganisation in its investigations and to obtain the necessary internal approval.\nThe delay was therefore unacceptable.\n64\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the present\n\ncase, the Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to:\n(a)\n\npay a financial penalty of S$30,000 within 30 days from the date\n\nof this direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the Rules\nof Court in respect of judgment debts, shall be payable on the\noutstanding amount of such financial penalty;\n(b)\n\nappoint a DPO within 30 days from the date of this direction;\n\n20\n\n\fSingapore Taekwondo Federation\n\n(c)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 17\n\ndevelop and implement policies and practices that are necessary\n\nfor the Organisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA within 30\ndays from the date of this direction; and\n(d)\n\ninform the Commission of the completion of each of the above\n\ndirections in (b) and (c) within 1 week of implementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n21\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Flight Raja Travels for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of individuals’ personal data on its online travel booking system.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Accommodation and F&B"],"date":"2018-06-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Flight_Raja_Travels_Singapore_110618.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Flight Raja Travels","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/06/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-flight-raja-travels","timestamp":"2018-06-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCase No DP-1705-B0730\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [16]\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\nAnd\nFlight Raja Travels Singapore Pte.

Ltd.\n[2018] SGPDPC [16]\nMr. Yeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1705-B0730\n11 June 2018\n1\n\nThis complaint concerns a user of Flight Raja Travels Singapore Pte.\n\nLtd’s (the “Organisation”) online travel booking system (the “Booking\nSystem”). While using the Booking System, the user was able to access\ninformation of other users (the “Incident”).\n2\n\nWhat happened was that after the user resumed his session after time-\n\nout, the Booking System showed him 45 sets of booking records. The booking\nrecords accessed by the user contained the personal data of 72 other individuals.\n\nThis included name, passport number, booking ID, flight details (including the\nflight number, departing/ arrival date, time and airport), booking date, amount\npaid, and flight inclusions.\n3\n\nInvestigations were commenced under section 50 of the Personal Data\n\n4\n\nUp to December 2016, the Booking System was accessed through\n\nProtection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”). The material facts of the case are as follows.\n\nbrowser login via the Organisation’s website. The Organisation then introduced\na new application (the “New Mobile App”). The New Mobile App enabled\n\naccess through mobile devices without login. It recognised the mobile device\nIDs of registered users stored as part of their account information.\n\n\fFlight Raja Travels Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n5\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 16\n\nProper change management would have included full system integration\n\ntesting of the New Mobile App with the Booking System to detect any\nunintended effects from the changes. However, two unintended effects went\nundetected. They affected non-registered users who had just completed a\n\nbooking via the Booking System through a browser, and had been registered by\nthe Booking System as new users (“Newly Registered Users”).\n6\n\nThe first unintended effect was to change the behaviour of the Booking\n\nSystem when Newly Registered Users resumed their sessions following a Time-\n\nout. A Time-out occurred if their sessions happened to be idle for 30 minutes.\nThe System no longer redirected them to the homepage as it did before the\n\nchanges. Instead, they stayed on the same page where they could access the\n“Dashboard”.\n7\n\nThe second unintended effect was when the timed-out Newly Registered\n\nUsers accessed the Dashboard tabs. The Dashboard’s “past” “upcoming” and\n“all” tabs disclosed the records of bookings by other individuals. Each tab could\ndisplay a maximum 15 records thereby disclosing a total of 45 records.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nThe Complaint pertains to the protection obligation under section 241 of\n\nthe PDPA. In the context of the present case, when an organisation makes\n\nchanges to a system that processes personal data in its possession or control, the\norganisation has to make reasonable arrangements to prevent any compromise\nto personal data.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protection personal data in its possession\nor under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risk.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fFlight Raja Travels Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n9\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 16\n\nThe Organisation omitted to test the effects of access through the New\n\nMobile App with the existing access through browsers. Registered Users are\n\nidentified by their mobile device IDs that are associated with their user account.\nHowever, newly Registered Users who completed bookings through browsers\nhad no mobile device IDs stored in their accounts.\n10\n\nAn integration test plan should have considered whether such newly\n\nregistered users could be identified by other information in their accounts.\nHowever, in the absence of mobile device ID in a Newly Registered User’s\n\naccount, the browser retrieved and displayed other booking records in the\nDashboard tabs as mentioned above.\n11\n\nFurther, session time-out was a likely occurrence. This included time-\n\nout of browser sessions of Newly Registered Users. An integration test plan\n\nought to have anticipated this scenario. The Organisation was therefore found\nin breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n12\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of the PDPA, I am\n\nempowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. In assessing the\n\nimpact of the breach, I considered the fact that a specific set of circumstances\nwas needed for the disclosure to have occurred, and such a coincidence is\nuncommon:\n(a)\n\nThe user had never registered on the Website previously;\n\n(b)\n\nThe user made a booking and made payment;\n\n(c)\n\nThe user did not log our or close the browser window but instead\nleft the page idle for 30 minutes;\n3\n\n\fFlight Raja Travels Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\n13\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 16\n\n(d)\n\nThe user returned to the same webpage after 30 minutes; and\n\n(e)\n\nThe user clicked on the dashboard hyperlink.\n\nThe disclosure occurred only if payment had been made for one or more\n\ntravel tickets. This meant that disclosure would likely have been to bona fide\ncustomers rather than other persons. Additionally, the nature of the flaw made\n\nit less readily detectable by an attacker, compared with misconfigured firewalls\nor unpatched servers for instance.\n14\n\nFurther, I considered that disclosure to the complainant was limited to\n\n45 sets of booking records disclosed. At a maximum, the bug exposed a total of\n72 personal data sets of booking information.\n15\n\nAccordingly, I hereby direct the Organisation to carry out the following\n\nwithin 60 days:\n(a)\n\nAssess whether its application testing has been complete in order\n\nto discover and remedy any risk to personal data from the changes made\nto introduce the new mobile application function;\n(b)\n\nFurnish a report of the assessment as well as action taken in\n\nresponse; and\n\n4\n\n\fFlight Raja Travels Singapore Pte.

Ltd.\nMr Yeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1705-B0799\n24 May 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nThis matter involves a private educational institution that posted\n\ninformation about its students, including their names and photographs,\non a public social media page, in order to promote its courses. The\nOrganisation operates a private educational institution, known as “Spring\nCollege International Pte. Ltd.” (“SCI”), that offers various academic\ncourses to students of varying ages and levels. A complaint was made\nto the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) regarding the\nunauthorised disclosure of a student’s personal data on the\nOrganisation’s Facebook page. The complaint was made by the\nstudent’s parent (“the Complainant”).\n2\n\nThe Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision, based on\n\nthe investigations carried out in this matter, are set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nSince September 2010, the Organisation has maintained a\n\nFacebook page which is accessible to the general public, titled “Spring\nCollege International”. In December 2015, the Complainant enrolled her\nson (“Individual A”) as a student in SCI. Sometime thereafter, the\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nComplainant came across a post on the Organisation’s Facebook page,\ndated 24 April 2016 (“Post A”). The post contained the following text:\nApplication for Supplementary Admissions Exercise for International\nStudents\n1 We are pleased to inform you that your application for admission to\na secondary school through the Supplementary Admissions Exercise\nfor International Students is successful. The results of your application\nare as follows:\n…\n\n4\n\nPost A further set out the following information about Individual A:\n\nfull name; partially masked passport number; date of birth; application\nresult for Supplementary Admissions Exercise for International Students\n(“AEIS”); primary school assigned to; level of study; and the length of\nIndividual A’s study period in SCI.\n5\n\nThe Complainant subsequently discovered that Post A had been\n\nindexed by Google’s search engine, and would be publicly displayed as\na search result on Google if Individual A’s name was used as the search\nterm. The summary on Google’s search results page displayed part of\nthe information contained in Post A, including Individual A’s name,\npartially masked passport number and date of birth.\n6\n\nThe Complainant informed the Organisation of her objection to\n\nthe publication of her son’s details on its Facebook page, following which\nthe Organisation took down Post A and took steps to render Post A nonindexable by online search engines. The Complainant also submitted a\ncomplaint to PDPC, in which the Complainant alleged that the\nOrganisation had not obtained consent to publish her son’s personal\ndata on its Facebook page.\n\n2\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n7\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nIn the course of the investigation, three other posts containing\n\nstudent data on the Organisation’s Facebook page were uncovered,\ndated on or around 25 April 2016:\n(a)\n\nPost B: data set of an individual student (“Individual B”),\n\ncontaining full name; partially masked FIN number; partially\nmasked passport number; date of birth; photograph of Individual\nB standing under the Organisation’s wall logos, next to another\nindividual; application result for AEIS; primary school assigned to;\nlevel of study; and the length of Individual B’s study period in SCI;\n(b)\n\nPost C: data set of an individual student (“Individual C”),\n\ncontaining full name; partially masked FIN number (without\npassport number); date of birth; photograph of Individual C\nstanding, in between two other individuals, and under the\nOrganisation’s wall logos; application result for AEIS; primary\nschool assigned to; level of study; and the length of Individual C’s\nstudy period in SCI; and\n(c)\n\nPost D: titled “Top students of the preparatory course for\n\nAEIS”, containing information on multiple individual SCI students\ncomprising full names; mugshots of these individuals; course\nduration; schools assigned to; and the level of study.\n8\n\nThe Organisation did not dispute that the various Facebook posts\n\ncontained the personal data of its students. The Organisation also did\nnot deny responsibility for publishing the various Facebook posts.\nAccording to the Organisation, the various Facebook posts were made\nin order to share the activities and courses of SCI, for the purpose of\n\n3\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\ncreating brand awareness and attracting more students to register with\nSCI.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nThe issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation had complied with its obligation\n\nunder section 13 of the PDPA to obtain valid consent before\ndisclosing the personal data of its students; and\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation had complied with its obligation\n\nunder section 18 of the PDPA to only use and disclose personal\ndata for purposes (i) that a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate in the circumstances; and (ii) that its students have\nbeen informed of.\nThe Consent and Notification Obligations\n10\n\nUnder the PDPA, the concepts of notification of purpose and\n\nconsent are closely intertwined. The PDPA adopts a consent-first\nregime. Unless an exception to consent applies, individual’s consent has\nto be sought: see section 13 of the PDPA, which imposes on an\norganisation the obligation to obtain the consent of an individual before\ncollecting, using or disclosing that individual’s personal data (“Consent\nObligation”). Consent must, of course, be obtained from the individual\nwith reference to the intended purpose of collection, use or disclosure of\nthat individual’s personal data; section 20 of the PDPA requires an\norganisation to notify an individual of such intended purpose\n(“Notification Obligation”).\n\n4\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nPersonal Data Relating to Minors\n11\n\nAt this juncture, it is relevant to note that this case involved the\n\npersonal data of minors. Individual A was 9 years old at the time Post A\nwas made; Individual B was 8 years old at the time Post B was made;\nand Individual C was 11 years old at the time Post C was made. Post D\ncontained the personal data of numerous individuals who were also\nminors at the time the post was made.\n12\n\nAs discussed in the PDPC’s Advisory Guidelines on the Personal\n\nData\n\nProtection\n\nAct\n\nfor\n\nSelected\n\nTopics\n\n(“Selected\n\nTopics\n\nGuidelines”), certain considerations may arise when dealing with the\npersonal data of minors.1 In particular, where the personal data of a\nminor is involved, the issue of whether the minor is able to effectively\ngive consent on his own behalf may arise. In this regard, organisations\nshould take appropriate steps to ensure that the minor can effectively\ngive consent on his own behalf, or if not, the organisation should obtain\nconsent from an individual who is legally able to provide consent on the\nminor’s behalf, such as the minor’s parent or guardian.2\n13\n\nAs stated in the Selected Topics Guidelines:3\n8.1\nThe PDPA does not specify the situations in which a minor\n(that is, an individual who is less than 21 years of age) may give\nconsent for the purposes of the PDPA. In general, whether a minor can\ngive such consent would depend on other legislation and the common\nlaw…\n\n1\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act for Selected Topics\n(revised 28 March 2017) at [8.1] to [8.13].\n\n2\n\nSelected Topics Guidelines at [8.7] to [8.9].\n\n3\n\nSelected Topics Guidelines at [8.1], [8.3], [8.5] to [8.6].\n\n5\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\n…\n8.3\nFor situations where there is no legislation that affects whether\na minor may give consent, the issue would be governed by the\ncommon law. In this regard, the Commission notes that there is no\ninternational norm on when minors may exercise their own rights under\ndata protection laws… some countries have enacted legislation to\nspecifically protect minors below a certain age. For example, in the\nUnited States, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act\n(“COPPA”) requires certain organisations to obtain verifiable\nparental consent to collect personal data from children under 13\nyears of age.\n…\n8.5\nThe Commission notes that the age threshold of 13 years\nappears to be a significant one in relation to according protection to\nminors…\n8.6\nThe Commission is of the view that organisations should\ngenerally consider whether a minor has sufficient understanding of the\nnature and consequences of giving consent, in determining if he can\neffectively provide consent on his own behalf for purposes of the\nPDPA… the Commission will adopt the practical rule of thumb\nthat a minor who is at least 13 years of age would typically have\nsufficient understanding to be able to consent on his own behalf.\nHowever, where, for example, an organisation has reason to\nbelieve or it can be shown that a minor does not have sufficient\nunderstanding of the nature and consequences of giving\nconsent, the organisation should obtain consent from an\nindividual, such as the minor’s parent or guardian, who is legally\nable to provide consent on the minor’s behalf.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n14\n\nWhile there was no allegation in this case that the Organisation\n\nhad purported to obtain consent from individuals who lacked sufficient\nlegal capacity to give such consent, it is nevertheless worth highlighting\nthat it would be prudent for organisations to take additional precautions\nand/or safeguards when collecting, using or disclosing the personal data\nof minors, bearing in mind that there is “generally greater sensitivity\nsurrounding the treatment of minors”.4 There is no magic in the age of\n\n4\n\nSelected Topics Guidelines at [8.12].\n\n6\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\n13 years as selected by the PDPC. The key determinant is whether the\nminor or young person is capable of understanding the nature and\nconsequences of giving consent. The onus is on the organisation to\ndetermine whether consent may be obtained from a young person above\nthe age of 13 years or whether, despite being above 13 years of age, it\nis more prudent to obtain consent from the young person’s parent or\nguardian. Restricting my analysis only to the circumstances of this case,\nI would have thought that the use of minors’ personal data to publicise\nand market the Organisation’s services is one of those purposes that an\norganisation ought to have conducted itself with a greater degree of\nprudence and should have sought consent from the young person’s\nparent or guardian, even if the young person had been older than 13\nyears. I probably would have come to a different conclusion if, for\nexample, the young person was participating in a school activity and a\nphotograph had been taken during the event and used by the\norganisation in its regular newsletter, college annual or blog that reports\non its activities and sporting achievements. In any event, the minors in\nthis case were all below 13 years and thus, even by the rule of thumb\nadopted in the Selected Topics Guidelines, consent ought to have been\nobtained from the minors’ parents or guardians.\nWhether the Organisation Complied with its Obligation to Obtain\nConsent for the Disclosure of its Students’ Personal Data\n15\n\nIn its responses to the PDPC, the Organisation stated that, when\n\nregistering with SCI, students (or their parents, as the case may be)\nwould be required to sign an enrolment form which contained a term\nstipulating that they would adhere to SCI’s student handbook. The\nrelevant term in the enrolment form is stated as follows:\n\n7\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nBy signing the form, I acknowledge that I was informed that the course\nis on-going. I confirm that all documents provided by me are true. I\nhave received and will adhere to the student handbook issued by SCI.\n\n16\n\nClause 15.1 of SCI’s student handbook, entitled “Data Protection\n\nNotice & Consent”, states:\n15.1\nThe information provided in Application Form is to enable to\nSCI to:\n(a)\nAdministering and/or managing the\napplication(s) for Admission and Enrolment;\n(b)\n\nApplicant’s\n\nManaging the Applicant’s relationship with SCI\n\n(including the announcement of statements or notices of the\nApplicant, sending the Applicant marketing, advertising and\npromotional information, including materials and information\non courses in SCI, general student-related activities within\nSCI, as well as related talks, seminars and/or events via postal\nmail, electronic mail, SMS or MMS, fax and/or voice calls;\nand);\n(c)\nProcessing the Applicant’s application(s) for\nscholarships and/or financial aid, and if successful,\nadministering and/or managing the Applicant’s scholarship\nand/or financial aid programmes, which may include use of\npersonal data for direct marketing purposes for event\ninvitations, surveys and/or publicity of SCI’ financial aid\nprogrammes;\n(d)\nResponding to requests for information from public\nagencies, ministries, statutory boards or other similar\nauthorities\n(e)\nAllow the compilation and analysis of statistics\nfor marketing purpose\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n17\n\nClauses 15.1(a) to (d) of the student handbook are concerned\n\nwith matters that can best be described as administrative in nature.\nThese clauses are not relevant to the disclosure of students’ personal\ndata on the Organisation’s Facebook page in the present case.\n\n8\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n18\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nIn its responses to the PDPC, the Organisation sought to rely on\n\nclause 15.1(e) of its student handbook, in order to assert that it had\nobtained consent for the disclosure of its students’ personal data in its\nvarious Facebook posts. However, I do not think that clause 15.1(e) of\nthe student handbook adequately covers the disclosure of personal data\nin the various Facebook posts by the Organisation in this case. Clause\n15.1(e) contains a general reference to the “compilation and analysis of\nstatistics”. The intent and purpose of statistical analysis is very different\nfrom the use in this case. Statistical analysis goes towards identifying\nhow the Organisation may be more effective in delivering its services, in\nthis case, educational services. This is an acceptable use of personal\ndata, whether in an anonymised form, aggregated (or compiled) or even\nin personally identifiable form (with consent or in reliance on the research\nexceptions in the PDPA). Organisations ought to, and are encouraged\nto do so, in order that they understand their customers better and can\nfine tune their products or services to better cater to their customers’\nneeds and preferences. Of course, one of the ends is to enable the\norganisation to design its marketing strategy more effectively. The point\nto note is that the use of the data is indirect and goes towards a business\nfunction, in this case the Organisation’s marketing strategy.\n19\n\nThe use of data directly in marketing is also a valid business\n\npurpose. But the intent and purpose is markedly different from statistical\nresearch. Marketing is intended to promote the organisation’s products\nor services to new or existing customers. While I am no expert in\nmarketing practices, what I do know is that the profiling of positive\nexamples and the association of an organisation’s products or services\nwith success stories is not an uncommon practice. Its effectiveness is a\nquestion that each organisation that chooses to adopt such a practice\n9\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nneeds to be satisfied with, and is not within the domain of personal data\nprotection laws. What is within the domain of personal data protection\nlaws is whether the individual whose image and other personal data will\nbe used has consented to such use, or whether there is some other\nlawful justification that an organisation may rely upon. In this regard, the\nvarious Facebook posts published by the Organisation clearly identified\nstudents individually, and showed their details on an individual basis. It\nis clear that the Organisation’s aim of profiling these individuals was for\nmarketing purposes with the intent to promote its services to new (or\neven existing) customers. In the premises, I do not think that the purpose\nfor which such personal data was disclosed can reasonably be said to\nfall within a “compilation” or “analysis of statistics” for marketing\npurposes. On the contrary, the personal data was used directly as part\nof the Organisation’s marketing campaign by featuring success stories.\nParenthetically, I had intimated in my earlier decision in Re My Digital\nLock Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 3 that this is an area where there is\noverlapping coverage between personal data protection law and the\nlaws protecting privacy, specifically personality rights that may be\nprotected under defamation law. In the present case, I have confined my\nanalysis to breaches of the Consent and Notification Obligations under\nthe PDPA.\n20\n\nThe student handbook also contained the following Clause 15.5:\n15.5\nBy attending school activities & event, you consent to the use\nof your photograph, voice, likeness, and image in any broadcasts of\nthis event and in subsequent productions drawn from video or audio\nrecordings of this event. The photographs and recordings may be\npublished or broadcasted in the official SCI and affiliates’ publications\nand in publicity materials, including the SCI and affiliates’ websites and\nsocial media…\n\n10\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n21\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nAs Clause 15.5 of the student handbook refers to “photographs”\n\nand “publicity materials”, the Organisation could arguably rely on this\nclause of the student handbook for consent to post photographs of\nstudents on its Facebook page for publicity purposes, if such\nphotographs were taken at events organised by the Organisation. The\npurposes that are notified by Clause 15.5 relates to how the Organisation\nmay use video footage and photographs of its activities for publicity\npurposes. For such purposes, the primary focus is on the activities of the\nOrganisation and the involvement of the individual students are\nsecondary (although it may not be incidental or minor). The intent is to\ncreate favourable impressions of the Organisation by featuring its\nactivities and perhaps even in its students’ achievements in sporting and\nother activities. This purpose is markedly different from profiling selected\nstudents and associating their academic achievements with the\nOrganisation. In this type of use, the student becomes the subject and\nthe focus. Where the student becomes the subject and the purpose is to\nassociate his or her academic achievement for the commercial\nobjectives of the Organisation, specific consent ought to be obtained,\nand this ought to be obtained from his or her parent or guardian, as the\npurpose of use has probably crossed into commercial use. Moreover,\nthis clause of the student handbook would not cover the disclosure of\nother personal data on the Organisation’s Facebook page, such as\nstudents’ names, date of birth, school assigned to and level of study.\n22\n\nIn light of the above, it follows that the Organisation has not\n\ncomplied with its Notification Obligation under section 20 of the PDPA,\nto inform the parents or guardians of its students, who are minors, of the\npurpose(s) for which the Organisation disclosed its students’ personal\ndata on its Facebook page, in respect of Posts A, B, C and D minimally.\n11\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nThe Organisation has, therefore, breached its Consent Obligation under\nsection 13 of the PDPA to obtain consent from such minors’ parents or\nguardians for the same.\n23\n\nFurther, given the finding that the Organisation has not complied\n\nwith its Notification Obligation under section 20 of the PDPA, the\nOrganisation is also in breach of section 18 of the PDPA.\nThe Organisation’s Follow-Up Remedial Actions\n24\n\nAs mentioned above, the Organisation took steps to remove Post\n\nA from its Facebook page and to make the post non-indexable by online\nsearch engines. Sometime after the aforementioned breaches had\noccurred, the Organisation represented that it had “created” a “Marketing\nConsent and Release Form” (“MRF”), which the Organisation then\ninstructed its staff to use in order to obtain consent for using students’\npersonal data for marketing purposes.\n25\n\nAn extract from the MRF reads:\nI, ____________________ (name), __________________(NRIC)\nirrevocably authorize the school, its employees, and its agents, to use\nmy / my child’s name, information, picture, and likeness as recorded\nby the school for any purpose that the school deems appropriate,\nincluding promotional or advertising efforts. I specifically authorize the\nschool, its employees, and its agents, to use, reproduce, exhibit, or\ndistribute my / my child’s name & information and likeness for such\npurpose in any communications medium currently existing or later\ncreated, including without limitation print media, television, and the\nInternet.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n26\n\nThe MRF purports to give the Organisation a very broad\n\ndiscretion to use students’ information, by using the catch-all phrase “for\nany purpose that the school deems appropriate”. In this respect, apart\n\n12\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nfrom the accompanying words “including promotional or advertising\nefforts”, the MRF does not provide individuals with any greater specificity\nor details as to the purposes for which the Organisation may use their\npersonal data.\n27\n\nIt falls on me to highlight the following passage from the Advisory\n\nGuidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act, which\nwould be pertinent in this instance:5\n… if an organisation’s Data Protection Policy sets out its purposes in\nvery general terms (and perhaps for a wide variety of services), it may\nneed to provide a more specific description of its purposes to a\nparticular individual who will be providing his personal data in a\nparticular situation (such as when subscribing for a particular service),\nto provide clarity to the individual on how his personal data would\nbe collected, used or disclosed.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n28\n\nIn my view, the language used in the MRF is so broad such that\n\nit cannot reasonably be said to provide adequate clarity to individuals on\nthe purposes for which their personal data would be used, and does not\nfulfill the requirements of section 20 of the PDPA.\n29\n\nAdditionally, I note from the extract of the MRF as set out in\n\nparagraph 25 above, that the MRF purports to “irrevocably authorize” the\nOrganisation to use students’ personal data for “any purpose that the\nschool deems appropriate”. Needless to say, an overly-broad consent\nclause like this is unlikely to stand up to scrutiny and will probably not be\neffective in notifying purpose and thus any consent obtained in reliance\n\n5\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) at\n[14.13].\n\n13\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\non it rests on weak foundations. Furthermore, this provision in the MRF\nis potentially contrary to the requirements of section 16 of the PDPA:\n(a)\n\nsection 16(1) of the PDPA provides that individuals may at\n\nany time withdraw any consent given under the PDPA in respect\nof the collection, use or disclosure of their personal data for any\npurpose; and\n(b)\n\nsection 16(3) of the PDPA further provides that an\n\norganisation must not prohibit an individual from withdrawing\nsuch consent.6\n30\n\nIn my view, the provision in the MRF that the Organisation be\n\n“irrevocably” authorised to use students’ personal data effectively seeks\nto prohibit such individuals from withdrawing their consent to the use of\ntheir personal data. Supposing that the MRF had been obtained by the\nOrganisation from the students’ parents or guardians in this case, I may\nnot have hesitated to find that it is ineffective as being contrary to the\nrequirements under section 16 of the PDPA. However, I am also mindful\nof other circumstances where an irrevocable promise may be\npermissible, for example, in a professional modelling agreement an\nindividual executes an irrevocable release in return for modelling fees\nfrom an advertisement agency for a specific client’s marketing campaign,\nin which case the bargain that is struck ought to be respected. The\nanalysis would involve a detailed discussion of the interaction of the\nconsent provisions of the PDPA and contractual principles. But this is\n\n6\n\nSection 16(3) of the PDPA further provides that this section does not affect the legal\nconsequences arising from such withdrawal.\n\n14\n\n\fSpring College International Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 15\n\nnot an analysis for this case nor do I need to reach such a conclusion in\nthese grounds.\n31\n\nIn the final analysis, I do not think that the MRF validly notifies the\n\nparents or guardians of the minors of the specific marketing use of their\nchild or ward’s personal data, nor is it acceptable in its current form for\nuse in the context of the present pedagogical relationship between the\nOrganisation and its students, as it purports to provide for an irrevocable\nwaiver of the students’ right to withdraw their consent, which is contrary\nto section 16 of the PDPA.\nDirections\n32\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of sections 13 and\n\n18 of the PDPA, I am empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give\nthe Organisation such directions as I deem fit to ensure compliance with\nthe PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n33\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be\n\nimposed on the Organisation, I took into account the following factors in\nits mitigation:\n(a)\n\nthere was no complaint or allegation received to the effect\n\nthat there was any loss or damage accruing to individuals as a\nresult of the Organisation’s breach;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation demonstrated a willingness to take\n\nremedial actions upon being informed of the breach by the\nComplainant; and\n\n15\n\n\fSpring College International Pte.

The Organisation is a consumer credit bureau. It aggregates\n\ncredit-related information from its participating members. The risk profiles of\nindividuals are presented in its Enhanced Consumer Credit Report (“ECCR”).\n2\n\nThe complainant had a bankruptcy application taken out against him in\n\nJune 2012. The bankruptcy application was withdrawn by the creditor in July\n2012. The Complainant was given a “HX” risk grade in this ECCR. A “HX”\n\nrisk grading meant that there could be a past or existing bankruptcy record\nassociated with the Complainant. The Complainant felt that a “HX” risk grading\nwas inaccurate as he thought that it implied that he had an outstanding\n\nbankruptcy record or was not creditworthy. He therefore requested the\nOrganisation to amend his risk grading.\n3\n\nThe Organisation informed the Complainant that it was its practice to\n\ndisplay bankruptcy-related data for 5 years. The Complainant then lodged a\ncomplaint against the Organisation to the Personal Data Protection Commission\n\n\fCredit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 14\n\non 24 May 2017. The complaint was that the Organisation had retained his\npersonal data when it was no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n4\n\nThis case concerns the accuracy and retention obligations under the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”), with respect to the bankruptcy\ninformation in the ECCR. In particular, the issues are:\na.\n\nWhether the Organisation had made a reasonable effort to ensure\nthat the personal data it had collected was accurate and complete\npursuant to section 23(b); and\n\nb.\n\nWhether the Organisation had retained the Complainant’s personal\n\ndata when it was no longer necessary for legal or business purposes\npursuant to section 25 of the PDPA.\n\nDid the Organisation breach Section 23(b) of the PDPA?\n5\n\nSection 23(b) of the PDPA requires an organisation to make a reasonable\n\neffort to ensure that the personal data collected by or on behalf of the\norganisation is accurate and complete if the personal data is likely to be\ndisclosed by the organisation to another organisation.\n6\n\nIn this case, the Organisation had explained that a “HX” rating merely\n\nmeant that there was a past or existing bankruptcy record associated with the\nindividual concerned. A “HX” rating did not represent that the individual was a\nbankrupt. The Organisation had also cautioned creditors against upfront\n\nrejection of credit applications of applicants with “HX” ratings. This buttresses\n2\n\n\fCredit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 14\n\nthe Organisation’s positon that “HX” rating alone does not determine\ncreditworthiness.\n7\n\nAccording to the Association of Banks in Singapore (“ABS”), financial\n\ninstitutions (“FIs”) consider information from several sources when making\n\nlending decisions. Apart from searches with credit bureaux, FIs also conduct\npublic registry searches1. Records from the Insolvency & Public Trustee Office\n\n(“IPTO”) also showed that he was not a bankrupt. FIs would have been able to\nobtain the same information on the Complainant when conducting their own\ndue diligence. Generally, FIs’ creditworthiness assessment vary according to\n\ntheir risk appetite, internal assessment policies, portfolio delinquency and loss\nexperience.\n\nDid the Organisation breach section 25 of the PDPA?\n8\n\nSection 25 of the PDPA requires an organisation to cease retaining its\n\ndocuments containing personal data, or remove the means by which the personal\n\ndata can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to\n\nassume that the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer\n\nserved by retention of the personal data; and retention is no longer necessary for\nlegal or business purposes.\n9\n\nThe Organisation displays bankruptcy-related information for 5 years in\n\nits ECCR.2 This aligns with the display period of the publicly available\n\nInsolvency Search maintained by the Insolvency & Public Trustee Office.

The Organisation is a telecommunications company which\nprovides fibre broadband services in Singapore.\n2\n\nThe Complainant terminated his account with the Organisation on 25\n\nSeptember 2016. He claimed that he did not have any outstanding debt with the\nOrganisation. However, he was subsequently contacted by Apex Credit on two\noccasions.\n\nThe purpose was to pursue payment of outstanding amounts\n\npurportedly owed to the Organisation. First was via letter sent to the\nComplainant on 3 October 2016. Second was via a phone call on 10 October\n2016. The Organisation disclosed that its systems had identified the\nComplainant’s account for debt collection based on its debt aging status.\n\n\fMyRepublic Limited\n\n3\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 13\n\nThis case concerns section 131 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\n(“PDPA”). In particular, the issues are:\n(a)\n\nWhether consent was given by the Complainant for his personal\n\ndata to be used for debt collection purposes; and\n(b)\n\nwhether it was reasonable for the Organisation to have deemed\n\nthat the Complainant was in debt at the material time.\n(a)\n\nWhether consent was given by the Complainant for his personal data\n\nto be used for debt collection purposes?\n4\n\nWhen customers sign up for the Organisation’s services, their consent\n\nwere obtained for the use of their personal data for debt management purposes.\nThis was accomplished through the Organisation’s terms and conditions, which\nstate:\n“By having the Services we provide activated in your premises\nand/or by using them you are giving us your consent to use\nyour personal information for … credit assessment, debt\nmanagement, preventing fraud… .” [Emphasis added]\n\n5\n\nThe Complainant had therefore consented for his personal data to be\n\nused for debt management when he signed up for the Organisation’s services.\n\n1\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA requires either that (a) the individual gives, or is deemed to\nhave given, his consent to the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data; or (b)\ncollection, use or disclosure without consent is required or authorised under the PDPA\nor any other written law.\n\n2\n\n\fMyRepublic Limited\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 13\n\nWas it reasonable for the Organisation to deem that the Complainant\n\nwas in debt at the material time?\n6\n\nThe incident was caused by an administrative time-lag in the\n\nOrganisation’s systems. Investigations disclosed the following: The bank GIRO\ndeduction for the amount owed by the Complainant to the Organisation was\nsuccessfully processed on 28 September 2016. The Organisation’s aging report\nto identify “terminated” and “suspended” accounts with outstanding payments\nwas updated for records up to 29 September 2016, 2359 hours. Although The\nbank GIRO deduction report was received by the Organisation on 29 September\n2016, it was only updated on 30 September 2016. As a result, the Complainant’s\naccount was included in the aging report and sent to Apex Credit on 30\nSeptember 2016. Based on the aging report received, Apex Credit commenced\ndebt collection efforts against the Complainant.\n7\n\nI am mindful that while the PDPA imposes data protection obligations\n\non organisations, the Act does not demand infallibility in an organisation’s\npersonal data processing activities and systems. Rather, it requires organisations\nto do what is reasonable to fulfil their obligations. Batch processing of arrears\nstatus is commonly practiced. In this case, administrative time-lag was one day.\nDebt collection efforts took place within a short span of 8 days and it\nimmediately ceased once Apex Credit was informed by the Complainant that\nthe outstanding payment had been settled.\n8\n\nI find that a weekly update of customers’ account status to be a\n\nreasonable practice. I also note that the inconvenience to the Complainant was\nno more than a letter and phone call, both of which were private\ncommunications directed to him. Apart from annoyance and the displeasure of\nhaving to deal with requests to repay a debt that he had already settled, there\n\n3\n\n\fMyRepublic Limited\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 13\n\nwas no embarrassment or harm caused. I am therefore of the view that the\nOrganisation has not breached section 13 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n4\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Watami Food Service Singapore for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access of employees’ personal data stored online.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Accommodation and F&B"],"date":"2018-05-14","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Watami_Food_Service_Singapore_140518.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Watami Food Service Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-watami-food-service-singapore","timestamp":"2018-05-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [12]\nCase No DP-1711-B1312\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012\n\nAnd\n\nWatami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fWatami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nWatami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [12]\n\nMr. Yeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1711-B1312\n14 May 2018\n\n1. Watami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) is in the restaurant business.\nOn 10 November 2017, information was received the Organisation’s internal Staff Code\nName List (the “List”) was accessible via its website. The List contained personal data of\n405 employees of the Organisation, namely their full names and staff codes.\n2. The List was to facilitate the entry of new employee staff codes into the Organisation’s\npoint-of-sale system. This information is not current as it was dated between 2009 and\n2013. The List was meant for internal use within the Organisation.\n3. The Organisation did not know when or why the List was uploaded into the Organisation’s\nwebsite server. As there was no restriction on access, the List was indexed by search\nengines and made publicly searchable online. The URL containing the List was\nsubsequently removed by Fairwin International Limited (“Fairwin”), a vendor the\nOrganisation engaged to maintain its website.\n4. The Organisation was in possession and/or control of the personal data in the List. Section\n241 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”) required the Organisation to protect the\npersonal data in the List. This included protection against risk of unauthorised access.\n5. I rely on the common law concept of res ipsa loquitur in this case as the Organisation is\nunable to explain how the List which it maintained for internal use was uploaded onto its\n\n1\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by\ntaking reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks.\n\n2\n\n\fWatami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nwebsite. The Organisation also did not exercise reasonable control of the information on\nits website, since it was not aware that the List has been accessible on its website and\nsearchable via online search engines.\n6. Neither did it adopt reasonable steps to monitor against information leak on its website.\nThe period that the List was thus exposed could possibly have commenced from 2013, but\ncould also have been a shorter period. The Organisation’s poor oversight and control did\nnot enable it to establish the period of exposure. As a result, the personal data of its staff\nremained on its website undetected until being contacted by the PDPC. Exercising better\noversight of its website content could have led to an earlier discovery and removal of the\nURL giving access to the List.\n7. In the course of investigations, it was further discovered that the Organisation failed to train\nits staff to protect the personal data in its possession or control. The Organisation’s privacy\npolicy included proper personal information management. However, its staff were not\ntrained in protecting personal data other than occasional reminders, for example to use\nalphanumeric passwords. No formal instructions were given to staff on the Organisation’s\ndata protection policies or other forms of data protection training.\n8. Accordingly, I find that the Organisation did not put in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect personal data in its possession or control against risk of\nunauthorised access. The Organisation is therefore in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n9. In assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation,\nI took into account the following:\na.\n\nThe Organisation’s prompt instruction to Fairwin to delete the URL on its website;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation’s cooperation in the investigation; and\n\nc.\n\nIts remedial measures, where the Organisation restricted access to the website\nserver to only one person, also reminded all staff that all documents containing\nsensitive personal data should be password-protected and not be uploaded online.\n\n10. In view of the factors noted above, I have decided to issue a warning to the Organisation\nfor the breach of its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA as neither further directions\nnor a financial penalty is warranted in this case.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n3\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Information Technology Management Association (Singapore) for failing to put in place reasonable security measures to prevent the accidental disclosure of the personal data of 28 individuals via email.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Information and Communications"],"date":"2018-05-14","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Information_Technology_Management_Association_Singapore_140518.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Information Technology Management Association Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-information-technology-management-association-singapore","timestamp":"2018-05-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 11\nCase No DP-1708-B1019\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012\n\nAnd\n\nInformation Technology Management Association (Singapore)\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fInformation Technology Management Association (Singapore)\n\nInformation Technology Management Association (Singapore)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 11\n\nMr. Yeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1708-B1019\n14 May 2018\n\n1. On 10 August 2017, the Organisation informed the Commission of its inadvertent\ndisclosure of personal data. The facts disclose a straightforward breach of section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n2. The Organisation engaged a travel service provider to organise a study trip for 49 delegates.\nOn 8 August 2017, the Organisation received an email with two attachments from the travel\nservice provider. One attachment was a list containing full names, gender, nationality, dates\nof birth and passport numbers of 28 delegates (the “List”).\n3. The Organisation forwarded the email to the 49 delegates on 10 August 2017. The List was\ninadvertently included in the email. This resulted in the inadvertent disclosure of the\npersonal data in the List.\n4. One delegate provided feedback to the Organisation on the List. Upon notification of the\nerror, the Organisation promptly emailed an apology to the 28 delegates. It subsequently\ncontacted all 49 recipients and requested that they delete the copy of the List that they had\nreceived.\n5. The issues to be determined in this case are:\na.\n\nWhether the Organisation breached section 24 of the PDPA to protect the personal\ndata in the List; and\n\nb.\n\nWhether the Organisation breached section 12(a) of the PDPA to develop and\nimplement policies and practices to comply with the Act.\n2\n\n\fInformation Technology Management Association (Singapore)\n\nDid the Organisation breach section 24?\n6. An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control under\nsection 24 of the PDPA (“Protection Obligation”). In this regard, it must take reasonable\nsteps to prevent unauthorised access, copying, modification, or disposal personal data.\n7. The Organisation’s core business was running a membership programme. Its functions\ninvolved frequent sending of emails including personal data. The Commissioner’s Guide\nto Preventing Accidental Disclosure when Processing and Sending Personal Data\n(published on 20 January 2017) states that employees should ensure that attachments are\nchecked and verified that they are for the intended recipients. In this case, the Organisation\nhad failed to do so when sending the email containing the List to all 49 recipients. The\nresult was the personal data in the List being disclosed to delegates who were not intended\nto receive such data of other delegates. The Organisation was therefore found in breach of\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\nDid the Organisation breach section 12(a)?\n8. Section 12(a) required the Organisation to develop and implement policies and practices to\ncomply with the PDPA.\n9. The Organisation had a Personal Data Protection Statement (“PDP Statement”). It outlined\nhow collected personal data might be used. It also stated that access to personal data was\nlimited to employees who needed to process it. Likewise, personal data would be shared\non a need-to-know basis. For external communications, personal data would be shared only\nwhen there was a “legitimate reason”. An employee was assigned to process all personal\ndata handled by the Organisation. The employee had previously attended formal training\non the requirements of the PDPA and had been briefed on the Organisation’s protection of\npersonal data.\n10. It was assessed that the Organisation’s PDP Statement complied with the requirement under\nsection 12(a) to develop policies to meet its obligations under the PDPA. Its attempts to\nlimit access to personal data to the employee who had been given PDPA compliance\ntraining was assessed to comply with the requirement to implement the policies in its PDP\nStatement. Finally, the Organisation’s efforts to implement its personal data protection\npolices under section 12(a) were taken as forms of practices on the ground to help\nemployees to manage the risk of unauthorised disclosure of or access to personal data\nthrough emails and other external communications.\n11. Accordingly, the Organisation was not found in breach of section 12(a) of the PDPA.\nRemedial measures taken\n3\n\n\fInformation Technology Management Association (Singapore)\n\n12. Following the incident, the Organisation required employees to review all emails and\nattachments before sending or forwarding. They are also required to check whether\npersonal data is being sent to unintended and/or unauthorised recipients.\n13. In assessing this case, I took into account the following:\na.\n\nThe Organisation’s prompt action to inform all 49 delegates to delete the List;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation’s voluntary notification of the incident and cooperation in the\ninvestigation; and\n\nc.\n\nThe Organisation’s remedial measures assessed to be reasonable to address risk of\nsimilar incidents.\n\n14.

Ltd.\n\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1707-B0901\n3 May 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nOn 30 June 2017, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a data breach notification from the Organisation, AIG\n\nAsia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd (the “Organisation” or “AIG”), informing the\nCommission that:\n(a)\n\nthe personal data of some of the Organisation’s policyholders\n\n(for its Individual Personal Accident product) had been compromised\n\nand disclosed to an unauthorised party (the “Unauthorised\nDisclosure”); and\n(b)\n\nthe Unauthorised Disclosure had occurred because the\n\nOrganisation had stipulated an incorrect facsimile number on the policy\nrenewal notices issued to its policyholders, which had caused its\npolicyholders to fax their renewal notices to a third party, Tokyu Hands\nSingapore Pte. Ltd. (“Tokyu Hands”) instead of the Organisation.\n2\n\nOn account of the notification made, the Commissioner commenced an\n\ninvestigation under section 50 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”) to ascertain whether the Organisation had breached its obligations\nunder the PDPA. The Commissioner’s findings and decision are set out below.\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a general insurance company, and among the largest\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation implemented a new electronic policy administration\n\ngeneral insurance companies in Singapore.\n\nsystem on 29 November 2016. This system was responsible for generating\n\nforms including for its Individual Personal Accident product. These forms\n\nincluded the quote application form, endorsement quote form, policy schedule,\nendorsement schedule and renewal notice.\n5\n\nThe form which is the subject of the data breach notification is the\n\nrenewal notice. The renewal notice is a form that is generated by the\n\nOrganisation and sent to a policyholder to notify the policyholder on policy\nrenewal and to facilitate the policyholder renewing his or her policy. The\npolicyholder can renew his or her policy by endorsing the renewal notice and\nreturning it to the Organisation.\n6\n\nThe renewal notice generated by the Organisation contains personal data\n\nof the policyholder including the policyholder’s name, address and policy\ndetails as well as, depending on the policy, personal data of the policyholder’s\nfamily members (the “Personal Data”). The renewal notice also contains a\n\nsection which allows policyholders to provide their updated personal data such\nas updated address, email address and/or telephone numbers to the Organisation\nas well as their payment details.\n7\n\nFrom 29 November 2016 (when the new system was implemented) and\n\nuntil 19 May 2017, an incorrect facsimile number was indicated on all the forms\ngenerated by the system for the Individual Personal Accident product, including\n\nthe renewal notice. This incorrect facsimile number was provided by a member\n2\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nof the Organisation’s staff during the development of template forms for the\n\nsystem. This incorrect facsimile number was formerly in use by the\nOrganisation prior to 11 March 2011 but is now in use by Tokyu Hands.\n8\n\nAs a result of the incorrect facsimile number, policyholders who were\n\nsending and returning their renewal notices to the Organisation during this\n\nperiod by facsimile had their renewal notices sent to Tokyu Hands instead of\nthe Organisation.\n9\n\nThe incorrect facsimile number was (fortuitously) corrected when the\n\nOrganisation conducted a standardisation exercise on its system to ensure that\nthe same contact information was provided across the Organisation’s different\n\nforms for different products. Even then, the Organisation did not realise that\nthere had been an error in the facsimile previously provided. It was only on 29\nMay 2017 that the Organisation became aware of the error after receiving notice\n\nfrom Tokyu Hands that it had been receiving the renewal notices intended for\nthe Organisation.\n10\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that Tokyu Hands had\n\nreceived approximately 1 to 5 facsimiles weekly that were intended for the\n\nOrganisation. In other words, for the period from 29 November 2016 to 29 May\n2017, between 25 to 125 renewal notices intended for the Organisation could\nhave been sent to Tokyu Hands. It also appears that the majority of these\n\nrenewal notices had been sent by the Organisation’s own agents (on behalf of\nits policyholders).\n11\n\nThe renewal notice with the incorrect facsimile number had been in\n\ncirculation for a period of six months. In this regard, even after the notices were\n\ncorrected, Tokyu Hands continued to receive renewal notices intended for the\n3\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nOrganisation by facsimile, with 11 such notices received between 30 May 2017\n\nand 25 July 2017. Such risk would of course reduce with the passage of time.\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation had in its representations, by way of its letter of\n5 April 2018, confirmed that any outstanding renewal notices have by now\nlapsed and, as such, it is unlikely that any further renewal notices would be\n\nfaxed to the wrong number. Given the process put in place between the\nOrganisation and Tokyu Hands to contain the breach, any possibility of further\nrenewal notices being faxed to Tokyu Hands was not considered in determining\n\nthe quantum of financial penalty to be imposed. Nonetheless, there was no\nreduction of the financial penalty on the basis of the Organisation’s\nconfirmation that that the renewal notices have since lapsed.\n12\n\nIn addition to correcting the facsimile number, the Organisation has\n\nsince taken additional steps to address the data breach and the impact on affected\npolicyholders:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation has sought and obtained confirmation from\n\nTokyu Hands that it has either destroyed or returned to the Organisation,\n\nall renewal notices received by Tokyu Hands, and that no copies of such\nnotices have been retained;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation has made arrangements to contact Tokyu\n\nHands on a bi-weekly basis, and to collect any renewal notices that may\nhave been sent to Tokyu Hands;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation had on 1 June 2017, communicated to all its\n\nproducers and agents, the correct facsimile number to be used;\n\n4\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n(d)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nthe Organisation is (or will be) undertaking a thorough review of\n\nall other forms used in its system to ensure that the contact and facsimile\nnumbers are correct; and\n(e)\n\nthe Organisation has taken steps to reverse any negative impact\n\non the policies of policyholders who had sent their renewal notices to\n\nTokyu Hands instead of the Organisation (e.g. lapsed policies due to late\nrenewal submissions have been backdated and renewed).\n13\n\nThe Organisation has also put in place measures to reduce the risks of a\n\nsimilar incident by:\n(a)\n\nrequiring its managers to verify the accuracy of contact\n\n(b)\n\nincluding in the user acceptance testing process for its systems,\n\ninformation collated by its staff; and\n\na step to confirm that documents sent using the contact details provided\nby the Organisation is received by the intended recipient.\nCommissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nIssues to be determined\n14\n\nAn investigation was conducted into the unauthorised disclosure. The\n\nissue in the present case is whether the Organisation had breached section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA in providing an erroneous facsimile number on the renewal notices\n\nto which policyholders were to fax the duly completed renewal notices,\n\nresulting in the notices (and the personal data contained therein) being sent to\nan unauthorised third party.\n\n5\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n15\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nThere is no question or dispute that the data in the renewal notice is\n\n“personal data” as defined under the PDPA. The data concerned comprised of\n\nnames, addresses, policy details, payment details and contact details of\n\npolicyholders. There is also no question or dispute that the PDPA applies to the\nOrganisation as it falls within the PDPA’s definition of “organisation”.\nThe Organisation was in control or possession of the Personal Data\n16\n\nTaking the formulation of the elements of a breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA from Re Hazel Florists & Gifts Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 9 at [8], the next\n\nquestion to be asked is whether the Personal Data is in possession or control of\n\nthe Organisation such that the obligation to make reasonable security\narrangements attaches in respect of the Personal Data.\n17\n\nThe Organisation was in possession of the Personal Data for the\n\nfollowing reasons. First, it had the Personal Data of each of the affected\nindividuals on record as each of them had an existing relationship with the\n\nOrganisation. Second, it generated the renewal notices with the Personal Data\npre-filled such that the individual need only sign the renewal notice and return\n\nit by facsimile transmission. It is only where there had been changes to the\n\nPersonal Data on record that the individual had to provide updated information.\n18\n\nThe Organisation was also in control of the Personal Data. While there\n\nis no definition of “control” in the PDPA, the meaning of control in the context\n\nof data protection is generally understood to cover the ability, right or authority\nto determine (i) the purposes for; and/or (ii) the manner in which, personal data\nis processed, collected, used or disclosed.\n19\n\nIn this regard, the Hong Kong Administrative Appeals Board, in the case\n\nof Shi Tao v. The Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (Administrative\n6\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nAppeal No. 16 of 2007), agreed with the view of the Hong Kong Privacy\nCommissioner for Personal Data that control “can either mean the physical act\nof collecting, holding, processing or using the personal data or it can mean the\n\nability of determining the purpose for which or the manner in which the data are\nto be collected, held, processed or used”. Further, the UK Information\nCommissioner’s Office (“ICO”), in its guidance1 on the difference between data\ncontrollers and data processors stated that “[t]he data controller determines the\npurposes for which and the manner in which personal data is processed. It can\ndo this either on its own or jointly or in common with other organisations. This\nmeans that the data controller exercises overall control over the ‘why’ and the\n‘how’ of a data processing activity”.\n20\n\nIt is clear that the Organisation which collected, processed and used the\n\nPersonal Data for the purposes of providing its clients with insurance services\nwas in control of the Personal Data. The Organisation determined what personal\n\ndata it required to provide its services and the purposes for, and the manner in,\n\nwhich the Personal Data was collected, processed, used and disclosed. This is\nnot in dispute. In particular, the Organisation was in a position to decide, and\ndid in fact do so, that as a matter of providing a better experience to its customers\nwhen renewing their policies, it pre-filled the renewal notices with each\n\ncustomer’s Personal Data on record. This clearly demonstrates the\nOrganisation’s control of the Personal Data.\n\n1\n\nU.K., ICO, Data controllers and data processors: what the difference is and what the\ngovernance implications are (6 May 2014) <https://ico.org.uk/media/fororganisations/documents/1546/data-controllers-and-data-processors-dpguidance.pdf> at [15].\n\n7\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n21\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nGiven that AIG is an organisation within the definition of the PDPA and\n\nthat it is in possession and control of the Personal Data, section 24 of the PDPA\napplies to it in respect of the Personal Data.\n22\n\nHowever, before assessing whether the Organisation had made\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data, the\n\nCommissioner, for completeness, assessed whether the Organisation was in\ncontrol of the payment details and updated contact details which were entered\n\ninto the renewal notice by, or on behalf of, the individual policyholders after the\nrenewal notices left the Organisation’s actual possession.\n23\n\nIn this regard, in Re The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and another [2016]\n\nSGPDPC 22, it was found that there is a distinction between the possession and\n\ncontrol of personal data and that an organisation that does not possess personal\n\ndata may still be in control of the personal data (albeit in that case, the personal\ndata was processed by a data intermediary on behalf of the organisation).\n24\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation designed the renewal notice, pre-\n\nfilled in the forms with relevant data including the Personal Data and stipulated\nthe fields in the renewal notice which the individual policyholders were\nsupposed to fill up, including the payment details and the updated contact\n\ndetails. The Organisation also devised the process for which policyholders may\nrenew their insurance policies by faxing the duly completed renewal notice to\n\nthe facsimile number it provided. Therefore, the Organisation was solely\nresponsible for determining the purposes for which the payment details and\nupdated contact details were collected, processed and used and directing the\n\nmanner and mode of transmitting the renewal notice (and the Personal Data\n\ncontained therein). Therefore, insofar as the policyholders were transmitting the\n\nrenewal notices (and their personal data) in accordance with the Organisation’s\n8\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\ninstructions, such Personal Data was within the Organisation’s control at the\n\nmaterial time (i.e. when the personal data was filled in and faxed to the\nerroneous facsimile number).\n25\n\nThe Commissioner therefore finds that the Organisation was in\n\npossession and control of the Personal Data (including the payment details and\n\nthe updated contact details where such data was filled in by policyholders)\nwithin the meaning of section 24 of the PDPA.\n26\n\nThe final issue that remains is whether the Organisation had taken\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data concerned, when\nthe Personal Data was in the Organisation’s possession and control.\n\nWhether reasonable security arrangements taken by the Organisation\n27\n\nThe fact that personal data had been disclosed to an unauthorised party\n\nby an error or flaw in an organisation’s systems and processes does not\nautomatically mean that the organisation is liable under section 24 of the PDPA\nfor failing to take reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data.\n28\n\nFor the purposes of section 24, the Commissioner has to consider what\n\nsecurity arrangements (if any) an organisation had implemented to prevent such\nunauthorised disclosure, and whether those arrangements are reasonable.\n29\n\nIn this case, the Organisation failed to stipulate the correct facsimile\n\nnumber to which the duly completed renewal notices were to be sent. Such a\n\nfailure would necessarily (and did) result in the notices being sent and disclosed\nto an unauthorised third party to whom the incorrect facsimile number belongs.\n\nThe issue is therefore whether the Organisation had taken reasonable\n\n9\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\narrangements to prevent an unauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data\nthrough the stipulation of an incorrect facsimile number.\n30\n\nThe investigations found that the Organisation did not have any security\n\narrangements to prevent such unauthorised disclosure. In particular, the\nOrganisation did not have any arrangement or process to verify the accuracy of\nfacsimile numbers uploaded or in use by its systems (and in the forms generated\n\nby its system). The Organisation clarified in its representations that it relied on\n\nthe facsimile numbers provided by the relevant departments within the\nOrganisation when entering the numbers into the new system and verifying that\nthe numbers keyed in matched the numbers provided by the relevant\ndepartments. There was, however, no check to verify that the facsimile numbers\n\nwere up to date. When the system was developed and tested, the scope of the\ntesting only involved a verification that the facsimile number in the template\nforms (which was then incorrect) corresponded with the forms generated by the\n\nsystem. Also, the user acceptance testing process did not provide for the tester\n\nto send a test fax to the facsimile number to verify that the document was\nreceived.\n31\n\nThis failure to undertake any verification is particularly alarming given\n\nthat the incorrect facsimile number had not been in use by the Organisation for\nover five years by the time it was uploaded into the system. The incorrect\n\nfacsimile number was (fortuitously) corrected almost six months after the\nsystem was operative, without the Organisation realising that there had been an\n\nerror. The Commissioner is of the view that merely verifying the facsimile\nnumbers entered into the system against the facsimile numbers provided by the\n\nrelevant departments was wholly insufficient as a security arrangement and did\n\nnot warrant a reduction in the penalty imposed. In fact, had the foregoing\nverification also not been present, the Commissioner may have increased the\n10\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\npenalty imposed, as it would show a very grave lack of basic information\nsecurity practices.\n32\n\nThe Commissioner also takes the view that it is only reasonable for a\n\ncompany like the Organisation to have some arrangement to ensure that the\ncontact details they provide for the purposes of receiving personal data are\n\naccurate. As a general insurer, the Organisation receives a large volume of\n\ndocuments containing personal data of its many existing and prospective\npolicyholders. It is therefore incumbent on the Organisation to stipulate correct\n\nand updated contact details (and ensure that they have done so) to avoid the risk\n\nof such personal data being sent to an unauthorised third party instead (as in the\npresent case).\n33\n\nOne of the considerations that an organisation should factor into its\n\ninformation security arrangements is the monitoring of its systems and\n\nprocesses to detect potential data security breaches (such monitoring to detect\n\ndata security breaches will be referred to as “data security monitoring”). In\nthis regard, the Organisation intimated that it does monitor its renewal business\n\nbut that its monitoring did not indicate any significant deviation. It is not clear\nwhether the Organisation monitored the number of renewal notices it received\n\nby fax (which was the suggestion by the Commissioner) as opposed to the\n\ngeneral renewal business (including renewals by other means and not just by\nway of facsimile). The monitoring of the general renewal business would not\nconstitute data security monitoring; instead this is generally done for business\n\nreasons and any data security aspect would be incidental. However, the\n\nmonitoring of the number of renewal notices received by facsimile, may\n\nconstitute a data security monitoring measure. To be clear, such a data security\nmonitoring measure would not have prevented the unauthorised disclosure or a\n\nfinding of breach given the facts of this matter. Any such data security\n11\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nmonitoring measure would, nevertheless, be imperative in containing any\nunauthorised disclosure. The monitoring of the number of renewal notices\nreceived by facsimile would have been a very basic and relatively inexpensive\nform of data security monitoring and would have, likely, only provided\nsufficient feedback after a significant period. In the circumstances, and\n\nconsidering all the facts of this case and the Organisation’s representations, the\nCommissioner is of the view that the penalty imposed in this case (set out at\n\nparagraph 38 below) is warranted and maintains his decision on the quantum of\nthe penalty.\n34\n\nThe Organisation has maintained that the data breach arose due to\n\ninadvertent human error. As it has been noted on a number of occasions\n(including in Re Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17), inadvertent human\n\nerror is not a valid reason for an organisation failing to comply with section 24\nof the PDPA.\n35\n\nAccordingly, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation has\n\nbreached section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n36\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nits obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered\nunder section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as it\n\ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\n\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nmillion.\n\n12\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte. Ltd\n\n37\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 8\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nthe Organisation in this case, the Commissioner considered the following\nfactors:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation had initiated the data breach notification to the\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action (described in paragraphs 12\n\nCommission and was cooperative in the investigations;\n\nand 13 above) to mitigate the impact of the data breach and to prevent\nfuture breaches of a similar nature from occurring;\n(c)\n\nthe extent of the unauthorised disclosure was limited, and the\n\ndisclosure was only to a single third party, Tokyu Hands (which has\nconfirmed that it has destroyed or returned the renewal notices received).\nWhile the exact number of affected individuals cannot be determined\nand there remains a possibility that individuals continue to be affected,\n\nthe Commissioner is satisfied that the Organisation has taken steps to\nminimise the impact to any affected individual.\n\n13\n\n\fAIG Asia Pacific Insurance Pte.

Subsequently, on 30 June 2017,\nthe Organisation submitted a voluntary notification of a breach of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) which confirmed the Complainant’s\nallegations and provided details surrounding the Complaint.\n\n2\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\n4\n\nOn 5 June 2017, the Organisation printed a batch of 426 letters that were\n\nsent out to its clients. These letters were no more than a page long. The vast\nmajority of the 426 letters (the “Policy Letters”) that the Organisation printed\nwere letters reminding its clients to pay their insurance premium (“Premium\nReminder Letters”). This batch of letters also included 6 letters (“Policy\nCancellation Letters”) informing the relevant clients of the termination of their\ninsurance policies with the Organisation, and 32 letters recording the relevant\nclients’ non-acceptance of the Organisation’s offer of insurance coverage\n(“Non-Take Up Letters”). The personal data (“Personal Data”) found in these\nletters are set out in the table below:\n\nPolicy Cancellation\nLetters\n\nNon-Take Up\nLetters\n\nPremium Reminder\nLetters\n\nName;\n\nName;\n\nName;\n\nFull residential address;\n\nFull residential address;\n\nType of policy;\n\nFull residential\naddress; and\n\nPolicy number; and\n\nType of policy.\n\nPolicy number; and\n\nEndorsement number.\n5\n\nType of policy;\nPremium amount.\n\nThe Organisation was informed by some of its clients that, similar to the\n\nComplainant, they had each received a Policy Letter addressed to them the\nreverse of which was a letter addressed to another client (the “Incident”).\n6\n\nAn investigation was carried out under section 50(1) of the PDPA in\n\nrelation to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Organisation’s process for printing the Policy Letters\n7\n\nThe Organisation’s process for printing the Policy Letters was largely\n\nautomated. Policy Letters issued by the Organisation to be mailed to its clients\n\n3\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\nwould be sent to the system (the “Printing System”) used by the Organisation’s\nprint room operators. The computer files containing these Policy Letters were\nprogrammed, before the files were sent to the Printing System, to be printed\neither in simplex (ie printed on a single side of the paper) or duplex (ie printed\non both sides of the paper) according to the type of letters to be printed. The\nprint room operators would initiate the printing of the Policy Letters by\nreleasing the files in the print queue.\n8\n\nOn 5 June 2017, according to the Organisation one of the three printers\n\nin the print room was “overloaded”. The Organisation uses the term\n“overloading” to describe the situation when too many files were automatically\nsent to one of the printers in the print room. This was a fairly common\noccurrence and there was a procedure to handle this overloading. The print room\noperator on duty would have to manually transfer the print files from one printer\nto another to ensure that the printing load was spread evenly across the three\nprinters. The procedure for the manual transfer of print jobs was as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe print room operator was required to select the specific file\n\nto be transferred.\n(b)\n\nThe print room operator would then select the file name and\n\nchoose the option “forward”. A dialog box stating “enable queues” will\nappear.\n(c)\n\nThe print room operator would then select the particular printer\n\navailable to receive the file for printing and type in ‘(dept)_simplex’ or\n‘(dept)_duplex’ under ‘queue name’ in the dialog box.\n9\n\nAs a matter of protocol, the print room operator is required to choose to\n\nprint the file in the format it was originally sent to the Printing System when he\n\n4\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\nundertakes the manual transfer of the print job from one printer to another. In\nother words, if a letter sent to the Printing System was to be printed in simplex\nformat, then the print room operator should choose to print the letter in simplex.\n10\n\nHowever, on this occasion the print room operator had mistakenly\n\nchosen to print the letters in duplex instead of simplex format. This led to two\ndifferent Policy Letters addressed to two different policyholders being printed\non each sheet of paper that was printed during the print run.\nFindings and Assessment\nIssue for determination\n11\n\nThe issue to be determined is whether the Organisation had, pursuant to\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA, put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect\nthe Personal Data from unauthorised disclosure.\n12\n\nSection 24 requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks.\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA\nThe Personal Data was disclosed without authorisation\n13\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data fell within the definition of\n\n“personal data” under section 2 of the PDPA as it was possible to identify the\nImpacted Clients from that information alone. It is also not in dispute that the\nPersonal Data was disclosed mistakenly and without authorisation.\n\n5\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\n14\n\nBased on the investigations carried out, the Commissioner found that the\n\nunauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data was a result of a breach of the\nOrganisation’s obligation to make reasonable security arrangements for the\nprotection of the Personal Data. The reasons for this finding are set out below.\nThe Organisation did not implement any measures to prevent the Incident\n15\n\nAccording to the Organisation, the print room operator was required to\n\nconduct a visual check (“visual check”) of 10% of printed letters for the quality\nof print and alignment. The print room operator was also required to reconcile\n(the “Reconciliation”) the number of letters printed as shown on the electronic\ncounter of the individual printers with the number of letters sent for printing as\ndisplayed on the Printing System. The quantity of the printouts would be\nrecorded in a printout log book (the “Log Book”). No other checks or security\narrangements were implemented with respect to the printing process to prevent\nthe unauthorised disclosure of personal data.\n16\n\nThe Commissioner was of the view that the visual check and\n\nReconciliation were not designed to adequately address the protection of\npersonal data.\n17\n\nSuch checks were to be undertaken by the same print room operator who\n\nprinted the letters. As has been traversed in other cases, it is not advisable for\nan organisation to rely on a member of its staff checking his own work to ensure\nthat he has undertaken a task properly to meet the Organisation’s protection\nobligation under section 24 of the PDPA: see Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14\nat [28]; Re Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [20] - [21].\n18\n\nFurther, these checks had little to do with protecting personal data. The\n\nvisual check was a check to ensure that the print on the letters were legible and\n\n6\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\nnot faded or smudged and that the letter was correctly aligned such that words\nwere not missing or cut off. The Organisation did not require the print room\noperator or any other staff to check that the information on both sides of duplex\nprinted letters were meant for the same individual. There was also no\nrequirement to check that Policy Letters were printed in the correct format,\neither simplex or duplex, as it was originally sent to the Printing System when\na manual transfer of print jobs was undertaken.\n19\n\nThe Reconciliation check would not catch an error in the choice of print\n\nformat as the reconciliation was based on the number of letters which were sent\nto be printed against the number of pages printed as shown on the electronic\ncounter of the printers. The number of pages printed would not change whether\nor not the letters were printed in the simplex or duplex format, it will merely\nshow the number of pages printed in total. If 5 letters sent to the Printing System\nwere printed, the electronic counter on the printer would show that 5 pages were\nprinted, whether or not the letters were printed in the simplex or duplex format.\n20\n\nWhile investigations showed that a check was implemented at the\n\nenveloping stage, this check also did not address situations such as this Incident.\nAt the enveloping stage, letters would be inserted into a mail insertion machine\nfor enveloping by one of the Organisation’s mail insertion operators. The mail\ninsertion operator was required to reconcile the number of sealed envelopes with\nthe number of sheets of paper printed by the print room operator. If instead, the\nmail insertion operator was required to reconcile the number of sealed envelopes\nwith the number of letters sent for printing, the Incident would likely have been\nprevented. As it stands, however, this final check also did not address situations\nsuch as this Incident.\n\n7\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\n21\n\nGiven that the Personal Data includes insurance data of the Complainant\n\nand other policyholders, the Commissioner would also highlight that\ninformation such as the type of insurance policy and insurance premium\namounts have been determined in the past to be sensitive personal data: Re Aviva\nLtd & anor [2016] SGPDPC 15 at [38(b)]. The Commissioner has in the past\nexpressly stated his view that an Organisation should accord a higher standard\nof protection to sensitive personal data: Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [18]\n– [19]. In this case, the standard of protection provided was not even sufficient\nfor non-sensitive personal data.\n22\n\nIn the circumstances, taking the printing and enveloping process as a\n\nwhole, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation did not implement\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the\nPersonal Data.\nOrganisations are required to preserve documents and records relating to an\ninvestigation\n23\n\nBefore moving on to the remediation action taken by the Organisation\n\nand to the directions in this matter, the Commissioner takes this opportunity to\nremind the Organisation and organisations in general about their duty to\npreserve evidence, including but not limited to documents and records, in\nrelation to an investigation by the PDPC.\n24\n\nThis issue arises in this case because the Organisation was unable to\n\nprovide copies of the Log Book when asked pursuant to the investigations\npowers set out in the Ninth Schedule of the PDPA; the Organisation alleged that\nthe copies were destroyed, in line with the Organisation’s three-month retention\nperiod for such records. Notably, the destruction of copies of the Log Book took\nplace after the commencement of investigations.\n\n8\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\n25\n\nThe Commissioner does not look favourably on the destruction or\n\ndeletion of potentially relevant documents and records and may impose tough\nsanctions on any organisation that is found to have destroyed or deleted such\ndocuments or records.\n26\n\nAnalogous to the preservation of evidence in civil proceedings, the\n\nCommissioner will consider, in deciding on the necessary and appropriate\nsanctions to be imposed, amongst other things, whether the deletion or\ndestruction of the documents or records was deliberate (which includes\nnegligent or reckless conduct resulting in destruction) and to what extent did the\ndeletion or destruction of the records or documents prejudice a fair investigation\ninto a potential breach of the PDPA.1 In summary, the approach of the\nCommission will be to first consider whether a fair investigation into a potential\nbreach of the PDPA is possible. If investigations may still proceed, particularly\nin reliance on evidence that may still substantially be obtained from other\nsources, the Commission may draw adverse inferences against the organisation\nthat failed to preserve and produce any piece of evidence to the effect that had\nthe evidence been produced, it would have been adverse to its case (see section\n116 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97)).2 Adverse inferences may also be drawn\nagainst a complainant if the evidence ought to have been preserved and\nproduced by the complainant.\n27\n\nAnother pertinent factor for consideration is whether the litigation or\n\nlegal proceedings was anticipated or contemplated by the party that destroyed\n\n1\n\nK Solutions Pte Ltd v. National University of Singapore [2009] 4 SLR(R) 254 at [125].\n\n2\n\nSection 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) states: “The court may presume the\nexistence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the\ncommon course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in\ntheir relation to the facts of the particular case”.\n\n9\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\nthe document or record. In the case of K Solutions Pte Ltd v. National University\nof Singapore [2009] 4 SLR(R) 254, the appellants had anticipated litigation for\nsome time before its action was filed, and had given instructions to its staff to\nback up the email in their accounts. The high court did not find it credible that\nall of the appellant’s internal emails had been deleted without backup, and\ndetermined that the appellants had deliberately suppressed documents and had\nlied about it.3 In contrast, the court in Tan Chor Chuan v. Tan Yeow Hiang\nKenneth [2004] SGHC 259 dismissed the plaintiff’s application for striking out\nas it did not find anything sinister in the defendant’s explanation for the deletion\nof the email in question – it was the defendant’s practice to delete emails from\ntheir computer systems regularly to free up memory space; the defendants saw\nno necessity to archive or keep copies of emails after the EGM; and litigation\nhad not been anticipated at the time. The court determined that the deletion of\nthe email was not an attempt to pervert the course of justice.4 In K Solutions, the\ncourt exercised its discretion to dismiss the case brought by the party in default.\nApplying the same principles to investigations conducted by the Commission,\nthe Commissioner may discontinue or refuse to conduct investigations under\nsection 50(3)(e) of the PDPA.\n28\n\nThe obligation to preserve evidence is taken further by section 50(4) of\n\nthe PDPA, which imposes an obligation on organisations to retain records\nrelating to an investigation, for one year or such longer period as directed, after\nthe investigation has been completed. This ensures that evidence relevant to any\npossible application for reconsideration or appeal from an investigation remains\navailable even after investigations are completed.\n\n3\n\nK Solutions Pte Ltd v. National University of Singapore [2009] 4 SLR(R) 254 at [131]\n– [137].\n\n4\n\nTan Chor Chuan v. Tan Yeow Hiang Kenneth [2004] SGHC 259 at [24] – [25].\n\n10\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\n29\n\nGiven the foregoing, the Commissioner takes the view that organisations\n\nshould have a detailed litigation hold policy in place to ensure that documents\nand records relating to an investigation or potential investigation of a breach of\nits obligations under the PDPA are preserved and not deleted, disposed of or\ndestroyed. Organisations should also ensure that relevant procedures and\npractices are fully implemented to give effect to such a litigation hold policy.\n30\n\nIn respect of the matter at hand, however, the Commissioner is of the\n\nview that the contents of the Log Book, which were meant to have recorded the\nReconciliation check by the print room operator, were not required for the\nCommissioner to make a finding of breach of section 24 given the finding that\nthe Reconciliation was not a security arrangement designed to prevent the\nIncident. As such, the Commissioner did not impose any sanctions against the\nOrganisation for the failure to preserve copies of the relevant Log Book.\nRemediation Actions Taken by the Organisation\n31\n\nThe Commissioner notes that after the data breach incident, the\n\nOrganisation undertook the following remediation actions:\n(a)\n\nthe manual transfer of print jobs may now only be activated by\n\nthe supervisors of the print room operators. Once activated, the print\nroom operators may undertake the manual transfer of print jobs under\nthe oversight of the supervisors;\n(b)\n\nboth the print room operators and mail insertion operators are\n\nnow required to check that the letters are printed in the correct format\n(ie either in the simplex or duplex formats) by comparing the files sent\nfor printing in the Printing System with the printed letters before\nenveloping. The checks will be done on 20% of letters printed in a batch\n\n11\n\n\fNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd\n\non a random basis where no manual transfer of print jobs is undertaken.\nWhere a manual transfer is undertaken, the print room operator and the\nmail insertion operator are required to check all letters; and\n(c)\n\nthe above measures have been included in the Standard\n\nOperating Procedure (“SOP”) for the print and mail room operations. A\nbriefing was also held for the print and mail room operators to inform\nthem of the changes in the SOP.\nDirections\n32\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give\n\nthe Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the PDPA.

The Personal Data Protection Commission (the “PDPC”) was\ninformed of the Incident on 22 July 2017 and commenced its investigations\nthereafter. I set out below my findings and grounds of decision based on the\ninvestigations carried out in this matter.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a registered charity under the National Council of\n\nSocial Services, which objectives include seeking to eliminate poverty housing\nworldwide by providing decent and affordable housing. In furtherance of its\nobjectives, the Organisation organises community involvement programmes,\nwhere volunteers can participate in activities such as mass clean-up events.\nAfter such events, the Organisation would generally send out a CIP letter to\nacknowledge and verify each individual volunteer’s participation.\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n3\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nThe Incident involved the disclosure of a batch of CIP Letters in an email\n\n(the “Email”) that was prepared by a manager (the “Manager”) in the\nOrganisation. The CIP Letters were created using the mail merge function in\nMicrosoft Word which would fill in a CIP letter template with the names and\nNRIC numbers of the volunteers. This created a single Microsoft Word\ndocument containing the CIP Letters for all the volunteers, which the Manager\nthen converted from Microsoft Word to PDF format. The Manager then sent the\nPDF containing the entire batch of CIP Letters to another member of staff\n(“Admin Staff”), along with the volunteers’ email addresses and instructed the\nAdmin Staff to send out the CIP Letters.\n4\n\nThe Organisation’s usual practice was for the document containing the\n\nentire batch of CIP Letters to be segregated and split into individual CIP Letters\nbefore each CIP Letter was individually sent to its respective volunteers.\nHowever, in this case, neither the Manager nor the Admin Staff had prepared\nand/or handled any CIP Letters prior to the Incident. The Manager failed to\ninstruct the Admin Staff on the proper procedure.\n5\n\nOn 20 July 2017, the Admin Staff sent a mass email to all the volunteers\n\nwho were involved in the mass clean-up event, attaching the PDF document\nwhich contained the entire batch of CIP Letters. As a result, the PDF attachment\ncontaining the CIP Letters revealed the names and NRIC numbers of all the\nvolunteers who had participated in the Organisation’s mass clean-up event.\nAdditionally, the Email was also sent with the email addresses of all the\nrecipients in the “cc” field. Consequently, the Organisation received two emails\nfrom the volunteers who had received the Email, expressing their concern that\ntheir personal data had been disclosed to other parties without their consent.\n\n2\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n6\n\nThe issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under\n\nsection 12 of the PDPA; and\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the\n\nPDPA.\n7\n\nAs a preliminary point, the names, NRIC numbers and email addresses\n\ndisclosed in the Email and CIP Letters fall within the definition of “personal\ndata” under section 2(1) of the PDPA, as it was clearly possible to identify an\nindividual from that data.\n8\n\nPursuant to section 53(1) of the PDPA, any act done or conduct engaged\n\nin by a person in the course of his employment shall be treated for the purposes\nof the PDPA as done or engaged in by his employer as well as by him, regardless\nof whether it was done or engaged in with the employer’s knowledge or\napproval. The Organisation is therefore responsible for its employees’ conduct\nin relation to the Incident.\n(a)\nWhether the Organisation complied with its obligations under section\n12 of the PDPA\n9\n\nSection 12(a) of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop and\n\nimplement policies and practices that are necessary to meet its obligations under\nthe PDPA. Section 12(c) of the PDPA also requires the organisation to\ncommunicate to its staff information about such policies and practices.\n10\n\nThe Organisation claimed to have instructed its employees on the\n\nOrganisation’s obligations under the PDPA and the importance of safeguarding\n3\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nits volunteers and donors’ personal data. Employees who were required to deal\nwith personal data were also briefed on the following data protection practices\nand procedures “on a need basis”:\n(a)\n\nto use the “bcc” function when sending out mass emails;\n\n(b)\n\nto send the CIP Letters individually;\n\n(c)\n\nto avoid sharing collected personal data with unauthorised third\n\nparties;\n(d)\n\nto contact individuals only for purposes that they have given\n\nconsent;\n(e)\n\nto use personal data only for the purposes for which it was\n\ncollected; and\n(f)\n11\n\nto secure all documents containing personal data safely.\n\nHowever, there were no documented policies, practices or procedures in\n\nrelation to sending out the CIP Letters. Indeed, the Incident could very well have\nbeen averted if the Organisation had implemented, and documented, a standard\noperating procedure for the sending out of the CIP Letters. By the\nOrganisation’s own admission, the Manager had omitted to instruct the Admin\nStaff on the Organisation’s usual procedure for sending out the CIP Letters and\nshe “should have written down the instruction clearly for [the Admin Staff],\nwhich [she] had forgotten to do.”\n12\n\nI take this opportunity to reiterate the benefits and importance of\n\ndocumenting an organisation’s data protection policies and practices in a written\n\n4\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\npolicy as\n\nemphasised in\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nRe Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7\n\n(“Furnituremart.sg”) at [14]:\n“The lack of a written policy is a big drawback to the protection\nof personal data. Without having a policy in writing, employees\nand staff would not have a reference for the Organisation’s\npolicies and practices which they are to follow in order to\nprotect personal data. Such policies and practices would be\nineffective if passed on by word of mouth, and indeed, the\nOrganisation may run the risk of the policies and practices\nbeing passed on incorrectly. Having a written policy is\nconducive to the conduct of internal training, which is a\nnecessary component of an internal data protection\nprogramme.”\n\n13\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation was unable to demonstrate or produce\n\nany evidence that it had developed and implemented policies and practices\nnecessary for it to comply with its obligations under the PDPA in respect of\nsending out the CIP Letters.\n14\n\nIn addition, the Organisation did not provide any formalised data\n\nprotection training for its employees. As the Commissioner observed in Re\nNational University of Singapore [2017] SGPDPC 5 (at [21]), data protection\ntraining may fall under both the openness obligation (specifically, section 12 of\nthe PDPA) and the protection obligation (section 24 of the PDPA). Data\nprotection training is an effective mode of communication of the Organisation’s\npolicies and practices to fulfil the openness obligation (section 12(c) of the\nPDPA).\n15\n\nThe Manager’s failure to communicate the Organisation’s data\n\nprotection policy was evidenced by the Admin Staff’s lack of awareness of the\nuse of the “bcc” function and the implications of her actions in respect of the\nEmail. Although the Admin Staff claimed to have been instructed on the “rules\nwith regard to volunteers’ personal details”, the fact that she: (a) did not query\n\n5\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nwhether it was appropriate to send the entire batch of CIP Letters containing\npersonal data to all the volunteers; and (b) did not think to check whether the\nemail addresses of the recipients of a mass email should be inserted in the “bcc”\nfield instead of the “to” or “cc” fields suggests that there was a lack of awareness\nof the Organisation’s obligations under the PDPA.\n16\n\nAccordingly, I find that the Organisation has breached its openness\n\nobligation, given that it did not develop and implement a data protection policy\nas necessary for the Organisation to meet its obligations under the PDPA at the\ntime of the Incident, and it did not communicate its data protection policies and\npractices to its staff, as required under sections 12(a) and (c) of the PDPA.\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA\n\n17\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect the personal\n\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n18\n\nIn this case, the Organisation’s informal practices and verbal reminders\n\n“on a need basis” were an insufficient security arrangement for the purposes of\ncompliance with section 24 of the PDPA. The Organisation did not implement\nany checks and controls to prevent or minimise the risk of unauthorised\ndisclosure of personal data. Knowing that the output produced by the Microsoft\nWord mail merge function was a single file containing the CIP Letters for all\nvolunteers in the batch, the Organisation did not implement technical\n\n6\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\narrangements such as installing IT tools1 that would have enabled the CIP\nLetters to be generated from the CIP letter template as separate documents. At\nthe minimum, greater awareness of the need to protect the personal data of\nvolunteers would have prompted the Admin Staff to process the PDF or\nMicrosoft Word document containing the entire batch of CIP Letter manually\nin order to split the document into individual PDF files. The Manager would\nalso have had a role to play in ensuring that this was done and could have\nimplemented simple process checks to identify errors. Furthermore, technical\ncontrols could also have been installed to remind employees to use the “bcc”\nfunction when multiple email addresses are pasted in the “to” or “cc” field.\nUnnecessary disclosure of NRIC numbers\n19\n\nAt this juncture, I observe that the disclosure of the volunteers’ NRIC\n\nnumbers in the CIP Letters was unnecessary as the CIP Letters had already\nreferred to the volunteers by their full names. Given that an individual’s NRIC\nnumber is a permanent and irreplaceable identifier which can be used to unlock\nlarge amounts of information relating to the individual, organisations should not\ndisclose an individual’s NRIC number except where it is required under the law\nor where it is necessary to accurately establish and verify the identity of the\nindividual by way of the same. It is not apparent to me that the need to identify\nan individual in a CIP Letter was to such a degree of specificity that his or her\nNRIC had to be included. The nature and function of a CIP Letter did not\nnecessitate the publication of the volunteer’s NRIC number.\n\n1\n\nThere were IT tools reasonably available that would have enabled the CIP Letters to\nbe generated from a template as separate documents. For instance, the installable PDF\nSplit & Merge program allows a single PDF or Microsoft Word output from a mail\nmerge operation to be processed into individual PDF files.\n\n7\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n20\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nOrganisations that choose to disclose more sensitive data than are\n\nrequired for their business or legal purposes have to be able to defend such\ndecisions and bear the burden of ensuring an appropriate level of security for\nthe personal data of varying levels of sensitivity. As observed in Re Aviva Ltd\n[2017] SGPDPC 14 (at [18]):\n“The Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA states\nthat an organisation should “implement robust policies and\nprocedures for ensuring appropriate levels of security for\npersonal data of varying levels of sensitivity”. This means that\na higher standard of protection is required for more\nsensitive personal data.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n21\n\nIn the premises, I find that the Organisation failed to make reasonable\n\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and control,\nas the Organisation:\n(a)\n\ndid not put in place basic administrative security arrangements\n\nsuch as setting out its data protection policies and procedures in writing;\n(b)\n\ndid not implement any checks and controls to ensure that its\n\nemployees were complying with its data protection practices and\npolicies;\n(c)\n\ndid not provide any formalised data protection training for its\n\nemployees;\n(d)\n\nfailed to properly supervise the employees who were in charge\n\nof preparing and sending out the CIP Letters; and\n(e)\n\ndid not have any other form of security arrangement to protect\n\nits volunteers’ personal data.\n\n8\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nDirections\n22\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of sections 12(a), 12(c),\n\nand 24 of the PDPA, I am empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the\nOrganisation such directions as I deem fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n23\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed, I\n\ntook into account, as an aggravating factor, the fact that the personal data\ndisclosed included the volunteers’ NRIC number, which was of a sensitive\nnature.\n24\n\nI also took into account the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe disclosure only affected a limited number of people; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation had cooperated fully in the PDPC’s\n\ninvestigation.\n25\n\nPertinently, the PDPC has recently issued a public consultation on the\n\nproposed advisory guidelines for NRIC numbers, which, inter alia, discourages\nthe indiscriminate use of NRIC numbers. Due weight has been given to the\nunsatisfactory practices that currently abound. Our practices as a society need\nto be improved as we become more knowledgeable about the risks of identity\ntheft and other identity-related risks (and I do not restrict this caution as\nreferring only to online risks). In future, similar conduct may call for the\nimposition of a financial penalty as proposed changes to the advisory guidelines\non the collection, use and disclosure of NRIC numbers are implemented. This\ncase should serve as a clarion call for all organisations to start handling personal\ndata such as NRIC numbers, which are unique and permanent identifiers of\nindividuals, with a much higher degree of care and discernment than the present.\n\n9\n\n\fHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd\n\n26\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 9\n\nI hereby issue the following directions to the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nto conduct a review of all its activities involving the handling of\n\npersonal data of its volunteers and donors;\n(b)\n\nto put in place a data protection policy, including process\n\nsafeguards and written internal policies, such as standard operating\nprocedures, to comply with the provisions of the PDPA;\n(c)\n\nto arrange for personal data protection training for its staff; and\n\n(d)\n\nto complete the above directions within 90 days from the date of\n\nthis decision and inform the Deputy Commissioner of the completion\nthereof within 1 week of implementation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $12,500 was imposed on Aventis for using the personal data of individuals beyond the notified purposes, and for failure to give effect to the withdrawal of consent within a reasonable time.","tags":["Consent","Purpose Limitation","Notification","Financial Penalty","Directions","Education"],"date":"2018-04-30","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Aventis_300418.pdf","nature":"Consent, Purpose Limitation, Notification","title":"Breach of Notification and Consent Obligations by Aventis","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/04/breach-of-notification-and-consent-obligations-by-aventis","timestamp":"2018-04-30","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCase No DP-1705-B0766\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [7]\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\nAnd\nAventis School of Management Pte.

Ltd.\n[2018] SGPDPC [7]\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1705-B0766\n30 April 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nThe present matter concerns an individual (the “Complainant”) who\n\nhad signed up to receive a free brochure for a specific programme organised by\nthe Organisation, but ended up also receiving numerous marketing emails from\n\nthe Organisation that were unrelated to the programme which the individual was\ninterested in. The question raised is whether the Organisation’s “use” of the\nComplainant’s personal data to send him the marketing emails without his\n\nconsent is a breach of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). In the\nCommissioner’s findings, the answer is in the affirmative.\n2\n\nThe Commissioner also found that the Organisation had failed to carry\n\nout the Complainant’s request to remove his email address from the\n\nOrganisation’s mailing list in a timely manner, which led to further marketing\nemails being sent to the Complainant after the withdrawal request was made.\n3\n\nThe Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision of the matter are\n\nnow set out below.\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nThe Organisation is an educational institution that collaborates with\n\noverseas universities to offer degrees, courses, and programmes to students\nacross various disciplines such as Finance, Marketing, and Business.\n5\n\nThe Complainant was interested in one of the programmes offered by\n\nthe Organisation, and submitted his name, email address, and contact number\nthrough a web form on the Organisation’s website, titled “Take Action Today –\nDownload Free Brochure”, at http://asm.edu.sg/california-state-university on\n12 January 2017.\n6\n\nAfter signing up for this free brochure, the Complainant started\n\nreceiving marketing emails from the Organisation promoting various courses\nand programmes. For example, one of the marketing emails was titled “3\n\nPsychological Discoveries on How to Convert Difficult People into Cooperative\nComrades”. Another title was “How to Lead and Motivate Multi-Generational\nTeams through ‘Yin’ and ‘Yang’”. The email addresses of the senders were often\n\ndifferent for each marketing email, such as “noreply@training-event.net” or\n\n“noreply@singapore-event.net”. The email addresses did not display a visible\n\nassociation to the Organisation’s domain name (as set out in the preceding\nparagraph).\n7\n\nThe Complainant then lodged a complaint with the Personal Data\n\nProtection Commission (“PDPC”) on 15 May 2017, and subsequently provided\n\n2\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nthe PDPC with screenshots or actual samples of 15 such emails (“the\nMarketing Emails”) he had received from the Organisation.1\n8\n\nAccording to the Complainant, he had attempted to unsubscribe from\n\nthe Marketing Emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” hyperlink found in the\n\nMarketing Emails. Additionally, the Complainant had also sent messages to two\nemail\n\naddresses,\n\nnamely\n\n“success@aventisglobal.edu.sg”\n\nand\n\n“shirley@aventisglobal.edu.sg”, which were found within the Marketing\n\nEmails, with a request to be removed from the Organisation’s mailing list.\nBetween 19 April 2017 to 24 May 2017, the Complainant made a total of 5\nunsubscribe requests, but to no avail.\n9\n\nAccording to the Organisation, it had only received the Complainant’s\n\nrequest on 15 May 2017 because the two email addresses that the Complainant\n\nhad sent his request to were no longer in use by the Organisation, as the email\naddresses were assigned to a staff who had left the Organisation.\n10\n\nFollowing the Complainant’s complaint of the matter to the PDPC, the\n\nPDPC had also informed the Organisation to remove the Complainant’s email\n\naddress from the mailing list. At that point in time, the Organisation was\n\nundergoing a system upgrade and transitioning from its existing customer\nrelationship management (“CRM”) system to a new one. Due to a technical and\n\nadministrative glitch in the process of porting over customer data to the new\nCRM system, the Complainant’s email address was still included in the\n\nOrganisation’s mailing list, causing the Complainant to continue to receive the\n\n1\n\nThese 15 Marketing Emails comprised emails from the Organisation that were sent on\n5 May 2017; 7 May 2017; another on 7 May 2017; 8 May 2017; 15 May 2017; 18 May\n2017; 23 May 2017; another on 23 May 2017; 10 June 2017; 14 June 2017; 15 June\n2017; 16 June 2017; 17 June 2017; 18 June 2017; and 19 June 2017.\n\n3\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nMarketing Emails. The Organisation finally corrected this issue in June 2017,\n\nand provided confirmation to the PDPC that it had fulfilled the Complainant’s\nrequest on 21 June 2017.\n11\n\nBased on the Commissioner’s investigations, the Organisation had used\n\nthe same web form to collect the personal data of 6,109 individuals, and had\nsent marketing emails to 719 other individuals.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nIssues in this case\n12\n\nAt the heart of the matter lies the issue of whether the Complainant\n\nconsented to receive the Marketing Emails when he submitted his personal\ndetails to the Organisation.\n13\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA requires that organisations collect, use or\n\ndisclose personal data about an individual if consent is obtained unless an\nexception to consent applies. Section 14(1)(a) of the PDPA requires that such\nconsent must be given for purposes that have been notified to the individual.\n14\n\nFurther, section 18 of the PDPA allows organisations to collect, use and\n\ndisclose personal data only for purposes which a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances and for which the impacted individual\nhas been notified.\n15\n\nGiven the above, if an organisation were to collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data for a purpose different than what an individual has been notified\n\nof, or has consented to, then the organisation would be in breach of the consent\nobligation under section 13 of the PDPA and the purpose limitation obligation\nunder section 18 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n16\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nThe Commissioner also considered whether, even if the Organisation\n\nhad complied with its obligations under sections 13 and 18 of the PDPA, the\n\nOrganisation would nevertheless be in breach of section 16(4) of the PDPA.\nSection 16(4) requires organisations to give effect to the withdrawal of an\nindividual’s consent for the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data.\n\nThis issue arises due to the Organisation’s delay in removing the Complainant’s\n\nemail address from its mailing list, which consequently led to the Organisation’s\ncontinued use of the Complainant’s personal data to send him additional\nMarketing Emails.\n\nThe Organisation did not have valid consent to use the Complainant’s\npersonal data to send him the Marketing Emails\n17\n\nAccording to the Complainant, he had provided his personal data on the\n\nweb form only for the purposes of receiving a copy of the free brochure from\nthe Organisation to find out more about the specific programme which he was\n\ninterested in. This consent did not extend to the Organisation being able to use\nthe personal data that was collected to send the Complainant the Marketing\nEmails which were unrelated to the programme he was interested in. By this\nreasoning, the Organisation had not complied with section 13 of the PDPA\n\nbecause the Organisation had used his name and email address for a different\npurpose (ie to send him Marketing Emails) from which the Complainant had\nagreed to when submitting his information.\n18\n\nThe Organisation disagreed with this, and provided the PDPC with its\n\nwebsite’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, claiming that the Complainant was\n\nsufficiently notified of, and had consented to, the Organisation using his\n\npersonal data to send him the Marketing Emails. Having reviewed the\n\nOrganisation’s website (including the web form), Terms of Use and Privacy\n\n5\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nPolicy, the Commissioner did not accept the Organisation’s explanation for the\nfollowing reasons.\n\nThe web form did not indicate that the Organisation would use the personal\ndata keyed into the form by individuals to send out the Marketing Emails\n19\n\nThe pertinent presentation and content of the web form is as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe title of the web form states “Take Action Today – Download\n\n(b)\n\nThis is followed by a line beneath the title which reads: “Kindly\n\n(c)\n\nBelow this line, there are 5 input boxes, comprising of three\n\ntwo\n\ndrop-down\n\n(d)\n\nRight below the last input box, there is a text which reads:\n\nFree Brochure”.\n\nfill in the simple form and download a FREE brochure”.\n\nboxes for a user to input his name, email address, contact number, and\n“Specialization”.\n\nboxes\n\nlabelled\n\n“Program\n\nInterested”\n\nand\n\n“[s]ubmitting this form meant your consent for our representative to\ncontact you”.\n(e)\n\nThe last item in the web form is a button labelled “Submit Now”\n\nfor the user to click to submit the form.\n20\n\nTo an ordinary user of this web form (“user”), these elements convey\n\nthat upon submitting the form, the user would have agreed to the Organisation\n\ncollecting the user’s personal data for the purposes (a) of the Organisation\nproviding a free brochure to the interested user, and (b) for a representative of\n\nthe Organisation to contact the user with regard to the programme which the\nuser was interested in. There is nothing in the web form that suggests that the\n6\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nOrganisation intends to use the name, email address or contact number to send\n\nout marketing emails to the user, in particular marketing emails on a subject\n\nmatter that did not relate to the programme that the user was interested in. In the\n\npresent case, the information provided did not sufficiently notify the\nComplainant of these additional purposes and the Complainant cannot be said\nto have consented to the Organisation using his personal data for the purpose of\nsending him the Marketing Emails.\n\nThe Organisation’s Privacy Policy allowed the Organisation to use the\npersonal data of the Complainant only for the purposes of providing the\nComplainant with the brochure of the specific programme he requested and to\ncontact the Complainant in respect of the said programme\n21\n\nThe Organisation claims that besides the web form, its website’s Terms\n\nof Use and Privacy Policy also provided valid notification of the purposes for\n\nthe use of the personal data collected through the web form and thereby had\nobtained consent for the purposes of sending Marketing Emails to the\nComplainant. The Commissioner did not find this explanation satisfactory.\n22\n\nThe portion of the Privacy Policy found on the Organisation’s website\n\npertinent to the collection of the Complainant’s personal data through the web\n\nform states the following under the section “Information Collected by E-mail\nand Online Transactions”:\n\n“If you send us an e-mail, we will collect your email address and\nthe contents of your message. We will use your email address\nand the information included in your message to respond to\nyou, to address the issues you identify, and to improve this web\nsite.\nWe may also use your email address to notify you about\nupdates, services, special events or activities offered by us and\nour partners.

We may redirect your email\nmessage or information you provided through an online\ntransaction to our office other than the one which originally\nreceived the message or information in order to better respond\nto you.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n23\n\nThe references to “an online application or an information request\n\nform” includes the web form completed by the Complainant as the web form\n\nwas essentially a request for further information on a specific programme and\n\nwould, therefore, be considered a “transaction” for the purposes of the Privacy\nPolicy.\n24\n\nLooking at the pertinent portion of the Privacy Policy, the Organisation\n\nhas conveyed that it will only use personal data collected as a result of a\ntransaction “for purposes for which the transaction was intended”. In this case,\nthe intention in respect of the transaction in question – the provision of personal\ndata in the web form to obtain a brochure on a specific programme – was for\nthe purposes as set out above in paragraph 20. In the circumstances, the consent\n\nobtained by the Organisation from the Complainant was for the Organisation to\nprovide a brochure to the Complainant on the specific programme in which he\nwas interested and for a representative of the Organisation to contact the\n\nComplainant with regard to the said programme, and not for the purposes of\nsending Marketing Emails to the Complainant.\n\n8\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nThe Organisation’s Terms of Use does not apply in respect of personal data\ncollected through the web form\n25\n\nWhile the Organisation’s Terms of Use is referred to in the Privacy\n\nPolicy, the Commissioner is of the view that the Terms of Use does not provide\nthe Organisation with the consent to use the Complainant’s personal data for the\npurposes of sending out Marketing Emails. The reference to the Terms of Use\nin the Privacy Policy reads as follows:\n\n“By using the Site, you consent to the collection, use and\nprocessing of your personally identifiable information by us in\nthe manner and for the uses described in this Privacy Policy\nand our Terms of Use. We reserve the right to make changes\nto these policies as appropriate, and will alert you to any\nchanges made” [emphasis added.]\n\n26\n\nCertain portions of the Terms of Use only apply to specific groups of\n\npeople, i.e. “Students”, “Employees/Staff”, and the “General Public”. In the\npresent case, the Complainant is neither a student nor employee or staff of the\n\nOrganisation. As such, the Commissioner has focused on the following portion\n\nof the Terms of Use applicable to the “General Public” in determining whether\n\nconsent had been obtained from the Complainant to allow the Organisation to\nsend Marketing Emails to him:\n\nPurpose for the Collection, Use & Disclosure of Personal\nData\n\nDepending on your relationship with us, the personal data\nwhich we collect from you may be used and/or disclosed for the\nfollowing purpose:\nFor General Public\n\nAVENTIS as an educational institution often organise a myriad\nof training, upgrading and career related activities in which\ngeneral public are invited to participate. While it is impossible\nto list all the events in which we hope the public will participate,\nsome events that you as a member of the public can look\nforward to include corporate outreach programmes, seminars,\nworkshops, talks, exhibitions, etc. Naturally, in encouraging a\nvibrant interaction with the public, there will be opportunity,\n\n9\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nand often a need, to collect, use and/or disclose personal data\nfrom members of the public.\nThe key reasons are as follows:\n\n\nFor verification purposes for Events\n\n\n\nTo keep you updated of future Aventis Events/products\nwhich we feel may interest you\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor administrative purposes for certain Events\n\nFor marketing/publicity purposes\n\nFor any other purpose arising in respect of the\nenvironment within which an institution of higher\nlearning such as AVENTIS operates which is reasonable\ngiven your relationship with AVENTIS\n\nIn almost all of the above situations, it will be up to you as to\nwhether, and to what extent, you wish to provide us with your\npersonal data. Typical data collected include participant’s\nname, email and phone numbers. Based on the information\nprovided, the general public may be contacted by various\nchannels including through social media, Whatsapp, emails,\nphone calls, postal mail, electronic mail, SMS and/or voice\ncalls; …\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n27\n\nWhile the Organisation’s Terms of Use as set out above do refer to the\n\nuse of personal data for the purposes of keeping users updated of future events\n\nand products as well as for marketing and publicity purposes, the Terms of Use,\nunlike the Privacy Policy, does not mention the collection of personal data\n\nonline, either through any online application, information request form, or web\nforms. Applying the legal maxim generalia non specialibus derogant (ie where\n\na contract contains general terms and specific terms the specific terms are to be\ngiven greater weight than the general terms if there is a conflict between the\n\ntwo2), the Commissioner finds that greater weight should be given to the Privacy\nSir Kim Lewison, The Interpretation of Contracts, 6th ed. (London:\nSweet & Maxwell, 2015) at [7.05].\n2\n\n10\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nPolicy which specifically deals with the purposes for which personal data\ncollected through the web form would be used. The provisions in the Terms of\n\nUse would be inconsistent with the Privacy Policy if the Terms of Use are\ngenerally applicable to personal data collected through the web form.\n28\n\nAccordingly, in the Commissioner’s findings, the Organisation did not\n\nprovide notification of the purposes for which the marketing emails were sent\nout, and consequently, the Complainant also did not provide consent to his\npersonal data being used for such purposes. The observations made above are\n\nequally applicable in respect of the Organisation’s failure to limit the use of the\n\nComplainant’s personal data to the notified purposes. In the circumstances, the\nOrganisation is in breach of sections 13 and 18 of the PDPA.\n\nEven if the Organisation had consented to the sending of the Marketing\nEmails, it failed to give effect to the Complainant’s withdrawal of consent\n29\n\nIn the case at hand, even if the Organisation had obtained the requisite\n\nconsent and provided the relevant notification, the Organisation would have\n\nnevertheless failed to comply with section 16(4) of the PDPA as it did not give\neffect to the Complainant’s withdrawal of consent within a reasonable time.\n30\n\nIn this regard, the unsubscribe requests and the emails from the\n\nComplainant requesting to be removed from the Organisation’s mailing list (as\nset out in paragraph 8 above) as well as the same request made through PDPC\n\n(as set out in paragraph 10 above) would have all, individually, triggered the\nOrganisation’s obligation to give effect to the Complainant’s withdrawal of\nconsent. These requests were sent between 19 April 2017 and 24 May 2017.\n\nHowever, the Organisation only fulfilled the Complainant’s request in June\n\n2017; with the PDPC receiving confirmation of this from the Organisation on\n21 June 2017. The Organisation admitted to receiving the Complainant’s emails\n11\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nat least by 15 May 2017. It took the Organisation about a month to effect the\nComplainant’s request to be removed from the Organisation’s mailing list from\nthe time it admitted to receiving the Complainant’s request.\n31\n\nThis runs afoul of the obligation under section 16(4) of the PDPA which\n\nrequires organisations to put in place accessible means for data subjects to be\nable to withdraw consent to the collection, use and disclosure of their personal\ndata.\n32\n\nAs stated in the PDPC’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the\n\nPDPA, as a general rule of thumb, organisations should give effect to a\n\nwithdrawal notice within ten (10) business days.3 Should the organisation\nrequire more time to give effect to a withdrawal notice, it is good practice for\n\nthe organisation to inform the individual of the time frame by which the\nwithdrawal of consent will take place.\n33\n\nAccordingly, given that the Organisation has taken such a long time to\n\ngive effect to the withdrawal of consent to use the Complainant’s personal data\nto send the Marketing Emails, the Commissioner is also of the view that the\n\nOrganisation has, in the alternative, failed to comply with section 16(4) of the\nPDPA.\n34\n\nBefore leaving the discussion on the Organisation’s section 16\n\nobligation, the Commissioner notes that the unsubscribe facility provided for in\n\nthe Organisation’s Marketing Emails was included to comply with section 11\nof the Spam Control Act (Cap. 311A) (“Spam Control Act”) which states that:\n\n3\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) at\n[12.42].\n\n12\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\n“Any person who sends, causes to be sent or authorises the\nsending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages in bulk\nshall comply with the requirements in the Second Schedule.”\n\n35\n\nThe Second Schedule provides that every unsolicited commercial\n\nelectronic message (such as marketing emails sent in bulk without having\n\nobtained the consent of the individual recipients) shall contain a method for the\nrecipients to unsubscribe from receiving such electronic messages in the future.4\n\nThe sender is not allowed to send any further unsolicited commercial electronic\n\nmessages to recipients who have unsubscribed after the expiration of 10\nbusiness days after the day on which the unsubscribe request was submitted.5\n36\n\nThe Commissioner is of the view that any recipient of a marketing email\n\nwho submits an unsubscribe request using the unsubscribe facility provided by\nthe sender of the marketing email (as required by the Spam Control Act)\nprovides notice to the sending organisation, for the purposes of the PDPA, of\n\nthe recipient’s withdrawal of consent in respect of the use of the recipient’s\npersonal data for the purposes of sending the recipient marketing emails.\n37\n\nOrganisations should therefore be aware that the unsubscribe facility\n\nserves a twofold purpose – (a) compliance with section 11 of the Spam Control\n\nAct, and (b) as a way for an individual recipient of marketing emails to provide\nnotice to the sending organisation of his withdrawal of consent to the use or\n\ndisclosure of his personal data for the purposes of sending him marketing\n\nemails, in accordance with section 16 of the PDPA. A failure to give effect to\n\nan unsubscribe request may lead to a breach of section 11 of the Spam Control\nAct and, as in this case, a breach of section 16(4) of the PDPA.\n\n4\n5\n\nParagraph 2(1) of the Second Schedule of the Spam Control Act.\nParagraph 2(7) of the Second Schedule of the Spam Control Act.\n\n13\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n38\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Commissioner is not making any\n\ndetermination in respect of the Organisation’s compliance with its obligations\nunder section 11 of the Spam Control Act as such disputes are within the\njurisdiction of the courts.\n\nEnforcement Action by the Commissioner\n39\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nits obligations under the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under section\n29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure\n\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay\na financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n40\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be made, the\n\nCommissioner considered, as an aggravating factor, the fact that the\n\nOrganisation had failed to take timely or reasonable steps to resolve or\n\nremediate the matter, despite receiving multiple requests from both the\n\nComplainant and the PDPC. Another aggravating factor the Commissioner took\ninto account was the high number of affected individuals; the Organisation had\nused the same web form to collect the personal data of 6,109 individuals, out of\nwhich 719 individuals had received similar marketing emails not specific to the\nprogrammes that these individuals were interested in from the Organisation.\n41\n\nThe Commissioner also considered, as a mitigating factor, the fact that\n\nthe Organisation has been generally cooperative with the investigation and\nprovided its responses to the PDPC’s questions promptly.\n42\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of S$12,500 within 30 days from the date of the Commissioner’s\n\n14\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\ndirection. Additionally, the Organisation is directed to carry out the following\nwithin 30 days:\n(a)\n\ncease the use of personal data about individuals for purposes\n\n(b)\n\nreview its procedures and processes for the withdrawal of\n\nwhich the individuals have not been notified; and\n\nconsent by individuals to ensure that such withdrawals are effected upon\nthe receipt of reasonable notice.\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n43\n\nThe Organisation submitted its representations by way of a letter dated\n\n5 April 2018 from its solicitors. The Organisation indicated that the\nCommissioner should consider its track record of acting in accordance with\n\nunsubscribe requests, that it acted quickly to improve its administration of\n\nunsubscribe requests by on-boarding a new platform to deal with such\nunsubscribe requests and that the delay in responding to the Complainant’s\n\nunsubscribe request was due to its migration to the new platform which is a one-\n\noff occurrence. The Organisation also indicated that it had not received the\ninitial unsubscribe requests of the Complainant.\n44\n\nThe Commissioner is of the view that the above representations do not\n\nwarrant a reduction in the penalty imposed for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation has not adduced any evidence to show that it\n\nhas a track record of acting in accordance with unsubscribe requests. In\n\nany event, even if it was able to show the same, the main finding here is\nthat there was a breach of the consent obligation. Complying with the\n\nwishes of individuals to be unsubscribed from mailing lists does not\naddress the main finding that the Organisation collected and used\n15\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\npersonal data for purposes for which the Complainant did not consent to\nin the first place. At most, it is a remediation of its initial breach.\n(b)\n\nWhile the Organisation may have on-boarded a new platform to\n\nbetter comply with its obligations to give effect to a withdrawal of\n\nconsent, the Organisation took about a month to give effect to the\nComplainant’s wishes to be removed from its mailing list. While the\n\nOrganisation has attempted to explain this by claiming that this delay\nwas caused by the on-boarding of the new platform, the Organisation\nshould have put in place measures in the interim to ensure that the\nComplainant did not receive any further marketing material from the\nOrganisation.\n(c)\n\nThe Commissioner had already given the Organisation the\n\nbenefit of the doubt with respect to the date on which it became aware\n\nof the unsubscribe requests and based his findings and the determination\nof the penalty quantum on the Organisation’s agreement that it at least\n\nbecame aware of the Complainant’s unsubscribe request on 15 May\n2017.\n\n16\n\n\fAventis School of Management Pte. Ltd.\n\n45\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 7\n\nThe Organisation also sought to compare the penalty imposed against\n\nthem with previous cases. The Commissioner highlights that the penalty\nimposed in each case is based on the facts in each case and is only arrived at\n\nafter a detailed consideration of the facts in each case and a comparison with\npast cases which are broadly similar. In this case, given the aggravating and\n\nmitigating factors present as set out at paragraphs 40 and 41 above, the\nCommissioner decided that a penalty of $12,500 was warranted.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n17\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $5,000 was imposed on SMU Alumni Association for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of membership applicants from unauthorised disclosure.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Education"],"date":"2018-04-30","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_SMU_Alumni_Association_300418.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by SMU Alumni Association","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-smu-alumni-association","timestamp":"2018-04-30","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\nCase No DP-1706-B0828\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nSingapore Management University\nAlumni Association\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1706-B0828\n\n30 April 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nThe Organisation, Singapore Management University Alumni\n\nAssociation, is a registered society under the Societies Act (Cap. 311),\nand is a society which caters to persons who are alumni of the Singapore\nManagement University (“SMU”).\n2\n\nOn 7 June 2017, the Complainant informed the Personal Data\n\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) that by entering an\nidentification number (e.g. NRIC number) on a webpage1 of the\nOrganisation’s website, one could retrieve and access the membership\napplication status and personal data of an individual to whom that\nidentification number relates.\n3\n\nOn account of the complaint made, an investigation was\n\ncommenced under section 50 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(the “PDPA”) to ascertain whether the Organisation had breached its\n\n1\n\nhttps://members.smuaa.org.sg/app_smuaa/smuaa-check-application-status.\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\nobligations under the PDPA. The material facts of the case are as\nfollows.\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nThe Organisation introduced the webpage on 28 February 2017\n\nto enable applicants, who had applied to be members of the\nOrganisation, to check on the status of their membership application.\nThe webpage was publicly accessible online and the URL of the\nwebpage was also provided by the Organisation to applicants by way of\nan email. Instructions on how to use the webpage could be found on the\nOrganisation’s website.\n5\n\nAn applicant could, by entering his identification number,\n\nspecifically either a FIN or NRIC number, onto the webpage, gain access\nto details associated with his application such as the application status,\nand also his personal data such as name, identification number, contact\nnumber, address, email, and other details relating to his education at\nSMU (e.g. graduation year and course).\n6\n\nApart from this requirement to enter an identification number, no\n\nother security measures or access controls were implemented to restrict\naccess to personal data of the applicants through the webpage. Hence,\nfrom 28 February 2017 until 12 June 2017 (when remedial actions were\ntaken by the Organisation), any person with the identification number of\nan applicant would have been able to access the personal data of that\napplicant through the webpage.\n7\n\nIn contrast, the Organisation indicated that it had comparatively\n\nmuch stronger internal controls for access to the same data in question.\n\n2\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\nThe data was stored in their Customer Relationship Management (CRM)\nsystems and only authorised employees who had been issued individual\nlogin credentials could access the data with their credentials.\n8\n\nAs at 12 June 2017, the personal data of some 297 applicants\n\nwere rendered accessible through the webpage in such a manner.\n9\n\nAfter receiving notice of the complaint, the Organisation\n\nundertook the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nWhen informed of the complaint on 12 June 2017, the\n\nOrganisation, on the same day, disabled the webpage to prevent\nany unauthorised access to the personal data. Subsequently, the\nOrganisation introduced additional requirements of inputting an\napplicant’s email or mobile number (in addition to his identification\nnumber) to access his data on the webpage, with the data\naccessible also reduced to the applicant’s application status,\nreceipt number and date (i.e. the removal of personal data not\notherwise required to ascertain the application status). From 4\nJuly 2017, this feature and the webpage were entirely removed\nfrom the Organisation’s website.\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation formed a committee to handle all matters\n\nrelating to the complaint, and also undertook investigations,\nincluding a security audit, to determine the extent to which the\npersonal data of the applicants had been compromised for the\nrelevant period between 28 February 2017 and 12 June 2017.\nThe server access logs for the webpage were examined to\ndetermine if any persons had exploited the vulnerability of the\nwebpage (in using only an identification number as an access\n3\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\ncontrol) to gain unauthorised access to personal data. From the\ninvestigation results presented by the Organisation, it appears\nthat it is unlikely that any such unauthorised access had occurred.\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation also represented that it had implemented\n\norganisation governance measures to improve PDPA awareness\nand\n\ncompliance\n\nwithin\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation,\n\nincluding\n\n(i)\n\nimplementing internal operating procedures on data protection;\n(ii) requiring employees handling personal data to complete the\ndata protection e-learning modules on the Commission’s website;\nand (iii) plans to conduct risk assessment exercises to determine\ndata protection competency.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nIssues to be Determined\n10\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by taking reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n11\n\nThe issue in the present case is whether the Organisation had\n\nbreached section 24 of the PDPA by only securing personal data of the\napplicants in the manner described in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.\n12\n\nThere is no question or dispute that the data in question\n\nconcerned “personal data” as defined under the PDPA. The data\nconcerned comprised of names, identification numbers, contact\ninformation and addresses. There is also no question or dispute that the\npersonal data was under the control of the Organisation.\n4\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n13\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\nThe issue that remains is whether the Organisation had taken\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data\nconcerned, by securing personal data of the applicants in the manner\ndescribed in paragraphs 5 and 6 above.\n14\n\nIn Re ABR Holdings Limited [2016] SGPDPC 16 (“Re ABR\n\nHoldings”), it was stated at [16] that:\n“where a single string of numbers is the only security\narrangement serving both to identify and authenticate\naccess to personal data, the numbers can possibly\nconstitute reasonable security arrangements depending\non the sensitivity of the personal data being protected, and\nonly if this number was unique, unpredictable and\nreasonably well-protected.”\n15\n\nAccordingly, in the case of Re ABR Holdings, it was found at [17]\n\nthat the use of identification numbers to serve the separate functions of\nidentification and authentication to access personal data on the website\nof a membership programme could not constitute reasonable security\narrangements (within the meaning of section 24 of the PDPA) given,\namongst other things, that “tools were readily available online that can\nsimulate or generate UIN numbers (such as NRIC and birth certificate\nnumbers)”.\n16\n\nIn the present case, the Commissioner for Personal Data\n\nProtection (“Commissioner”), following from the decision in Re ABR\nHoldings, likewise finds that securing the personal data of applicants\nusing only identification numbers to serve the functions of identification\nand authentication to access personal data does not constitute\nreasonable security arrangements.\n\n5\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n17\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\nThe Organisation represented that it had instituted internal\n\norganisational measures and security standards to protect and restrict\naccess to such personal data within its Organisation (see paragraph 7\nabove). Yet, when it came to protecting and restricting access to the\nsame data from the public, where the risks of unauthorised access is\nundoubtedly higher, the Organisation inexplicably failed to extend at\nleast similar standards of protection, and instead relied on a standard\nthat was much lower. The Organisation itself, in its response to the\nCommissioner’s 2nd Notice to Require Production of Documents and\nInformation (“NTP”), admitted that its use of FIN/NRIC numbers as an\nindividual’s sole login credentials for the website was “not a good enough\nprotection as it [would] reveal the full application details of the individual”.\nThe Organisation further admitted that the unauthorised access of\npersonal data via its website came about due to the “lack of PDPA\nknowledge in [its] team”.\n18\n\nAccordingly, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation has\n\ncontravened section 24 of the PDPA.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n19\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in\n\nbreach of its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the\nCommissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue the\nOrganisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with\nthe PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n20\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions (if any) to\n\nbe made, the Commissioner considered, as an aggravating factor, the\n6\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\nsensitivity of the personal data involved, which included FIN/NRIC\nnumbers. In this regard, the Organisation made representations\nintimating that the fact that FIN/NRIC numbers were involved should not\nhave been included as an aggravating factor given that a person trying\nto access the personal data would have already known the FIN/NRIC\nnumbers. Although the potential population that is at risk is small, the\nrisk to the affected individual is high. Moreover, the use of an NRIC\nNumber generation tool would make it relatively easy for a motivated\nhacker to systematically query the webpage and, if successful, he would\nhave been able to definitively link the NRIC number to the full name,\naddress and other personal data of the member, potentially resulting in\nsignificant harm to the individual, such as through identity theft or an\nunauthorised person impersonating the affected member.\n21\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nthere was no evidence to suggest there had been any\n\nactual loss or damage resulting from the risk of unauthorised\naccess or disclosure of personal data. In this regard, we refer to\nthe server logs provided by the Organisation as set out at\nparagraph 9(b) above which showed that it was unlikely that any\nunauthorised access of personal data occurred. The Organisation\nalso confirmed in it its representations that there has been no\nactual exposure of personal data;\n(b)\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation\n\nhad\n\ninvestigations; and\n\n7\n\ncooperated\n\nfully\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\n\fSingapore Management University Alumni Association\n\n(c)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 6\n\nthe Organisation took prompt action (described in\n\nparagraph 9) to remedy the breach when notified.\n22\n\nIn its representations, the Organisation also asked the\n\nCommissioner to consider the alleged obscurity of the website and the\ndifficulty in finding the personal data in question as a mitigating factor.\nThe Commissioner does not view this as a mitigating factor. Once the\ninformation is accessible on the internet, the fact that it may not be\nimmediately found is not by itself a mitigating factor. Instead, what is\nimportant is whether there was evidence of actual loss or damage as a\nresult of the incident. The Commissioner had already taken into\nconsideration the lack of actual loss or damage as a mitigating factor in\ndetermining the financial penalty quantum in this case before the\nOrganisation submitted its representations.\n23\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, pursuant to section 29(2) of\n\nthe PDPA, the Commissioner hereby directs that the Organisation pay a\nfinancial penalty of S$5,000 within 30 days of the Commissioner’s\ndirection, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court\nin respect of judgment debts, shall be payable on the outstanding\namount of the financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $6,000 was imposed on Actxa for breach of Section 13 (Consent Obligation) and Section 18 (Purpose Limitation Obligation) of the PDPA.","tags":["Consent","Purpose Limitation","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"2018-04-19","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision_Actxa_190418.pdf","nature":"Consent, Purpose Limitation","title":"Breach of Consent and Purpose Limitation Obligations by Actxa","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/04/breach-of-consent-and-purpose-limitation-obligations-by-actxa","timestamp":"2018-04-19","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\nCase No DP-1611-B0320\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nActxa Pte. Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nActxa Pte. Ltd.\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1611-B0320\n\n19 April 2018\nBackground\n1\n\nOrganisations are increasingly integrating information technology\n\ncomponents and computer network connectivity into the products they develop\n(“connected devices”). The embedded technology and connectivity helps turn\nordinary products, such as a weighing scale, into a “smart” version of the\nproduct with the ability to collect and transfer data wirelessly through the\nnetwork.\n2\n\nThese connected devices have the potential to offer a multitude of\n\nbenefits to improve the lives of users of these devices. A “smart” refrigerator\nmay be able to understand your grocery shopping habits, alert you when you are\nlow on ingredients you commonly use and order these ingredients from an\nonline grocery store and pay for the purchase. A “smart” pacemaker may warn\nyou when you have an impending heart attack, notify the nearest hospital and\ncall for an ambulance.\n3\n\nOrganisations may use multiple connected devices to collect users’\n\npersonal data. This would assist organisations in providing an integrated suite\nof services. As an example, an organisation may collect your body\nmeasurements from a “smart” weighing machine and your dietary preferences\n\n1\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nfrom your “smart” refrigerator and suggest the amount of daily exercise you\nshould undertake to maintain a healthy body weight through your “smart”\nwatch. Some of these organisations may rely on a single document to notify\nusers of the purposes, and obtain consent, for the collection, use and disclosure\nof personal data collected through these connected devices and across different\nplatforms. To be clear, there is nothing wrong with this practice. However, such\norganisations need to ensure that they comply with their notification and consent\nobligations across all these different connected devices and any other platforms\nor sources used to collect personal data.\n4\n\nIn this matter, Actxa Pte. Ltd. (“the Organisation”), which sells\n\nhealthcare and fitness related Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices, such as\n“smart” weighing scales, relied on its website’s privacy policy to notify its\ncustomers of the purposes, and to obtain the customers’ consent, for the\ncollection of personal data across all the Organisation’s platforms. The\nOrganisation did not have separate privacy policies, or other documentation,\nrelating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal data collected through\nthe IoT devices it develops and sells.\n5\n\nThe issue for determination in this case is whether the Organisation, via\n\nits website’s privacy policy, sufficiently notified its customers of the purposes,\nand obtained the customers’ valid consent, for the collection, use and disclosure\nof personal data collected through the IoT devices the Organisation develops\nand sells.\nMaterial Facts and Documents\n6\n\nThe IoT devices which the Organisation develops and sells include (a) a\n\n“smart” weighing machine (the “Scale”), marketed under the brand “Sense\nSmart Scale”, that uses bioelectrical impedance analysis technology to measure\n2\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nbone mass, muscle mass, total body fat and total body water, as well as (b)\nwearable fitness trackers (collectively, the “Fitness Trackers”), marketed\nunder the brands “Actxa Swift” and “Actxa Swift+”, that use built-in\naccelerometers to wirelessly detect movements of the user to track the user’s\nactivity levels throughout the day.\n7\n\nThese IoT devices collect data via sensors fitted to these devices. A user\n\ncan download and install an app (the “Actxa App”) onto his mobile device,\ncreate his user account, and link the IoT devices to his user account. Thereafter,\nthe user can access the data collected by the IoT devices through the Actxa App\nto monitor his health data, such as sleep pattern, heart rate and weight trends.\nThe Actxa App will reflect the data collected by the IoT devices; though the\ndata may also be amended by the user. The data is automatically collected by\nthe Organisation’s servers through the Actxa App.\nPersonal Data collected through the Actxa App and the IoT devices\n8\n\nWhen a user downloads the Actxa App and creates an account, the user\n\nwill be asked to submit the following personal data via the Actxa App: name;\nemail; password (encrypted); gender; date of birth; height; weight; profile\npicture (optional); and country (“Personal Data Set A”). This type of personal\ndata is often referred to as declared data.\n9\n\nThe Scale collects the following personal data: weight; height; Body\n\nMass Index (“BMI”); total body water; total body fat; bone mass; and muscle\nmass (“Personal Data Set B”). It is possible for the Scale to be used\nindependently of the Actxa App, in which case it will operate as a simple and\nunconnected weighing scale.\n\n3\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n10\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nThe Fitness Trackers collect the following personal data: steps and goal;\n\ncalories and goal; distance and goal; active minutes and goal; sleep duration and\ngoal; start of sleep (date and time); end of sleep (date and time); sleep duration;\nand raw sleep data (“Personal Data Set C”).\n11\n\nPersonal Data Sets B and C are typically referred to as observable data\n\nas these are collected through sensors either in the Scale or Fitness Trackers.\nThe volume of observable data that is collected through regular usage of the\nScale or Fitness Trackers will be much higher than declared data in Personal\nData Set A. For convenience the defined terms “Personal Data Set A”, “Personal\nData Set B” and “Personal Data Set C” will be collectively referred to as\n“Personal Data” in this decision.\n12\n\nAt the material time, a total of 2,609 customers had downloaded and\n\nused the Actxa App, out of which 40 customers were users of the Scale and\n2,569 customers were users of the Fitness Trackers.\nThe Complaint\n13\n\nA complaint was made to the Personal Data Protection Commission\n\n(“Commission”) on 7 November 2016 by an individual (the “Complainant”)\nalleging that the Organisation failed to notify him of, and obtain his consent for,\nits collection of his personal data.\n14\n\nThe Complainant’s spouse had bought a Scale from the Organisation’s\n\nwebsite (the “Website”) on or around 2 November 2016. The Complainant\ndownloaded the Actxa App, created an account and profile, and started using\nthe Scale around the same time.\n\n4\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n15\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nOn 5 November 2016, the Complainant sent an email to the Organisation\n\nrequesting a refund for the Scale, alleging that the Actxa App transferred the\nComplainant’s personal data to the Organisation’s server without the\nComplainant’s knowledge or consent.\n16\n\nIn response to the Complainant’s request, the Organisation deleted the\n\nComplainant’s account, removed all his personal data from its server, and\nprovided the Complainant with a full refund for the Scale.\nThe Organisation’s Privacy Policy\n17\n\nAt the time when the complaint was made, the Organisation had a\n\nprivacy policy that was effective from September 2015 (“Privacy Policy”). All\nusers of the Actxa App (“Actxa App users”) were required to agree to this\nPrivacy Policy before they were allowed to use the Actxa App. The\nOrganisation confirmed that all Actxa App users, regardless of which IoT\ndevice they were using, were required to agree to the same Privacy Policy.\nNotably, the Privacy Policy did not contain any references to the collection, use\nand disclosure of personal data through the Actxa App, Scale or other IoT\ndevices, and instead only referenced the Actxa Website.\n18\n\nHowever, after the complaint was made, the Organisation issued a\n\nrevised privacy policy which took effect from 13 December 2016 (“Revised\nPrivacy Policy”), and included specific references to the Actxa App and details\non the types of personal data that it collected, used and disclosed. According to\nthe Organisation, all Actxa App users have been notified of the Revised Privacy\nPolicy via email.\n\n5\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nCommissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n19\n\nThe issues to be determined in this case are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation failed to obtain the consent of the\n\nComplainant and other Actxa App users before collecting and/or using\ntheir personal data in breach of section 13 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) (“Consent Obligation”); and\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation failed to collect and use personal data\n\nonly for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate\nin the circumstances and for which the impacted individual has been\ninformed (“Purpose Limitation Obligation”).\nWhether the Organisation is in breach of section 13 of the PDPA\n20\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA prohibits organisations from collecting, using\n\nor disclosing personal data about an individual unless:\n(a)\n\nthe individual gives, or is deemed to have given, consent under\n\nthe PDPA to such collection, use or disclosure; or\n(b)\n\nthe collection, use or disclosure of the personal data without the\n\nindividual’s consent is required or authorised under the PDPA or any\nwritten law.\n21\n\nIn the present case, the Commissioner is of the view that the\n\nOrganisation did not obtain valid consent from the Complainant and other Actxa\n\n6\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nApp users to collect Personal Data Sets B and C1 (collectively referred to as the\n“Observed Personal Data”) and store the said personal data on the\nOrganisation’s servers. The Organisation represented to the Commissioner that\nit collected the Personal Data of the Complainant and other individuals so that\nthe Actxa App would be able to “display, store and retrieve the data and present\nhistorical data for the user’s consumption”.\n22\n\nThe Organisation relies on its Privacy Policy to obtain consent for, and\n\nnotify the Actxa App users of, the collection, use and disclosure of Personal\nData. However, the Privacy Policy only made reference to the Website and did\nnot expressly address the collection, use and disclosure of personal data via the\nScale and other IoT Devices through the Actxa App. The first few sentences of\nthe Privacy Policy reads as follows:\n“This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Actxa\nwebsite (collectively, the “Website” located at www.actxa.com).\nActxa, the provider of the Website (referred to as “use” or “we”),\nis committed to protecting your privacy online in compliance\nwith Personal Data Protection Ordinance (PDPO) (“PDPO”).\nPlease read the following to learn what information we collect\nfrom you (the “User” or the “End User”) and how we use that\ninformation…\n…\n“Information Gathering\nActxa only collects two types of information about our Website\nUsers: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally\nIdentifiable Information.\nPersonally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable\nInformation is information that pertains to a specific End Use.\nThe information we collect includes but is not limited to your\nname, email address, phone number to complete registration.\n\n1\n\nAs will be discussed later at paragraphs [30] to [34], the Actxa App users are deemed\nto have provided consent for the collection and use of Personal Data Set A by virtue of\nsection 15 of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nWe use this information to provide services and customer\nsupport to you.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n23\n\nThere is no mention of the Actxa App throughout the entire Privacy\n\nPolicy nor any mention of how the Personal Data of Actxa App users may be\ncollected by the Organisation from the Actxa App. The complete absence of any\nreference to the Actxa App in the Privacy Policy shows that the Privacy Policy\nwas only intended to govern the data collection activities undertaken through\nthe Actxa Website, and not the Actxa App nor the IoT Devices. The opening\nstatement of the Privacy Policy, makes express reference to the Actxa Website\n(and even provides the URL link). In addition, the subsequent paragraph in the\n“Information Gathering” portion of the Privacy Policy refers to information\ncollected from “Website Users” without any reference to users of the Actxa\nApp, Scale and other IoT Devices. From the above, it is clear from the wording\nthat the Privacy Policy was tailored to the Actxa Website, and the Organisation\nmade no effort to adapt the Privacy Policy to include the personal data\nprotection activities carried out through the Actxa App, Scale and other IoT\nDevices.\n24\n\nThe Organisation alleged that since the Privacy Policy would be shown\n\nto the Actxa App users prior to their use of the Actxa App, the Actxa App users\nwould have known that the Privacy Policy was applicable to the Actxa App and\nIoT devices, and not just the Website. However, in the Commissioner’s view,\nthis is not an acceptable practice. Displaying a Privacy Policy that has no\nrelevance to the Actxa App cannot amount to proper notification for the Actxa\nApp users, and consent, if any, that is obtained in this manner cannot be valid.\nIt may well be that consent obtained through pretence or obfuscation could\namount to a deceptive or misleading practice under section 14(2)(b) of the\nPDPA. To be clear, there is nothing to suggest that in this case, the Organisation\n8\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nwas any more culpable than mere omission. Pertinently, it is not a reasonable\nnor acceptable practice to expect individuals who were shown the Privacy\nPolicy to figure out how the Organisation intends for the terms which are\ntailored to collection of data from the Actxa Website to be adapted for the\ncollection, use or disclosure of personal data via the Actxa App, Scale and other\nIoT Devices.\n25\n\nCompared to declared personal data in Personal Data Set A, the volume,\n\nvariety and velocity of generation (and collection) of the Observed Personal\nData is much higher. The feature set of the Actxa App is non-trivial and likely\nto become more sophisticated with successive new releases. The use of the\nObserved Personal Data can also be expected to change in tandem. Accordingly,\nthe purposes for which such personal data will be used should be properly\nnotified to the Actxa App users, in order to obtain their consent. In the\ncircumstances, the Organisation failed to obtain consent from the Actxa App\nusers for, and notify them of, the collection and use of the Observed Personal\nData before collection and, thus, the Organisation is in breach of section 13 of\nthe PDPA.\n26\n\nOther data protection authorities take similar positions in respect of\n\nproviding clear notification to users to obtain adequate consent. In Canada, the\nOffice of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (“OPC”), in a case relating to\ntargeted advertising, emphasised the importance of providing clear notification\nfor adequate consent by stating the following:2\n\n2\n\nPIPEDA Report of Findings # 2013-017: Apple called upon to provide greater clarity\non its use and disclosure of unique device identifiers for targeted advertising\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigationsinto-businesses/2013/pipeda-2013-017/> at fifth bullet point in the “Lessons Learned”\nsection at p 2.\n\n9\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\n“Organizations must make a reasonable effort to ensure that\nthe individual is advised of the purposes for which their\npersonal information will be used. To make the individual’s\nconsent meaningful, the purposes must be stated in such a\nmanner that the individual can reasonably understand how the\ninformation will be used or disclosed”.\n\n27\n\nThe case above concerned a unique device identifier (“UDID”) that was\n\nused by Apple Canada Inc. (“Apple”), and disclosed to third party app\ndevelopers via Apple’s iOS operating system, for the purpose of delivering\ntargeted advertising to iOS device users. The OPC considered the UDID to be\nsensitive personal information as it could be used to create a detailed user\nprofile. Although Apple offered easily accessible opt-out options for the use of\nthe UDID with regard to the delivery of targeted advertising, the OPC found\nApple’s privacy policy to be insufficient as a form of notification as it contained\nstatements which were too broad and generalised. As a result, the OPC\nrecommended Apple to, amongst other things, amend its privacy policy to\ninform its users in a manner that is “clear, apparent and understandable” how\nit uses UDIDs to deliver advertising and interest-based ads.3\n28\n\nIn another case, the OPC issued a report of its findings after an\n\ninvestigation into the complaints filed by the Canadian Internet Policy and\nPublic Interest Clinic against Facebook Inc. (“Facebook”). The OPC found,\ninter alia, that Facebook had not been clear or specific enough in its notification\nto its users concerning the collection of a user’s date of birth (“DOB”) such that\nthe user had the necessary information to make an informed choice about\nconsent.4 As such, the OPC required Facebook to amend its privacy policy so\n\n3\n\nIbid. at [48].\n\n4\n\nPIPEDA Report of Findings #2009-008: Report of Findings into the Complaint Filed\nby the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic (CIPPIC) against Facebook\n\n10\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nas to better explain the purpose for which a user’s DOB is collected and used.\nFacebook was also required to indicate in its pop-up notification that it collected\na user’s DOB for the purposes of targeted advertising.5\n29\n\nIn the present case, the Commissioner notices that the first line of the\n\nOrganisation’s Privacy Policy makes explicit reference to the “Personal Data\nProtection Ordinance (PDPO)”, which presumably refers to the main data\nprotection legislation in Hong Kong, instead of the PDPA, which is the main\ndata protection legislation in Singapore. This suggests that the Organisation may\nnot have had Singapore data protection law in mind when it was crafting its\nPrivacy Policy. The Commissioner understands that it is common for\norganisations to adopt a consistent approach across all the jurisdictions in which\nthey have operations and/or presence through privacy policies which apply\nacross jurisdictions. Organisations are reminded that if they choose to adopt\nsuch an approach, they should ensure that such privacy policies are compliant\nwith Singapore law.\nIs the Complainant deemed to have consented to the collection and use of his\npersonal data?\n30\n\nIn certain case, an individual may be deemed to have consented to the\n\ncollection, use and disclosure of his personal data even if he has not actually\ngiven consent. Section 15(1) of the PDPA provides that an individual is deemed\nto consent to the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data for a purpose\nif:\n\nInc. Under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act by\nElizabeth\nDenham\nAssistant\nPrivacy\nCommissioner\nof\nCanada\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigationsinto-businesses/2009/pipeda-2009-008/> at [51].\n5\n\nIbid. at [56].\n\n11\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n(a)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nthe individual voluntarily provides the personal data to the\n\norganisation for that purpose, and\n(b)\n31\n\nit is reasonable that the individual would do so.\n\nIn the Commissioner’s view, the Complainant could be deemed to have\n\nconsented to the Organisation collecting, using and disclosing his Personal Data\nSet A as he had voluntarily entered Personal Data Set A into the Actxa App\nduring the account and profile creation phase and it was reasonable that he\nwould provide the Organisation this personal data for purpose of setting up and\nmanaging his account on the Actxa App.\n32\n\nHowever, in respect of Personal Data Set B, whilst the Complainant had\n\nused the Scale and Actxa App voluntarily, he was unaware that his Personal\nData Set B was being collected by the Organisation and stored on the\nOrganisation’s servers. While the state of knowledge of the individual cannot\nbe the limiter on the scope of deemed consent, neither can the purposes for\nwhich consent is deemed be so vague or broad that deemed consent ceases to\nbe meaningful. Deemed consent is intended to be relied on in situations where\nthe purpose for collection, use or disclosure of personal data is so clear that the\nreasonable bystander would have assumed that the individual would ordinarily\nhave provided his consent. Deemed consent is helpful where the transaction is\nnot complex or where it is closely entwined with the performance of an\nunderlying contract. For example, supplying one’s payment details and shipping\ndetails during an e-commerce transaction, or when engaging a courier to make\na delivery. Where the purpose for which consent is provided is clear, the scope\nof the consent that is deemed can also be reasonably demarcated.\n\n12\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n33\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nIn this case, the Commissioner considered the possibility that the\n\nfeatures of the Scale and the Actxa App collectively establishes the purposes\nand that consent is deemed for this set of purposes. However, this approach may\npossibly supplement an inadequate Privacy Policy but cannot be used to\nconstruct an absent one for a set of complex functionalities and customer\nrelationship like the present. The feature set of the Actxa App can be expected\nto change over time and Observed Personal Data will be used in different ways.\nFurther, the relationship between Organisation and customer may last\nindefinitely, depending on the period of time the customer continues to use the\nScale and the Actxa App. These features militate against reliance on deemed\nconsent. In this case, as explained above, there is no Privacy Policy for the Scale\nor the Actxa App and, for reasons just provided, deemed consent cannot be\nrelied on to create one by operation of law.\n34\n\nSimilarly, other Actxa App users may be deemed to have consented to\n\nthe Organisation’s collection, use and disclosure of their Personal Data Set A,\nbut not their Observed Personal Data (depending on which IoT device they use)\nfor the same reasons articulated above. In the circumstances, the Organisation\nis found to be in breach of the section 13 obligation for failing to obtain consent:\n(a)\n\nfrom the Complainant for the collection, use and disclosure of\n\nhis Personal Data Set B; and\n(b)\n\nfrom Actxa App users for the collection and use of Observed\n\nPersonal Data depending on which IoT device they use.\n35\n\nWith more developers creating mobile apps, it is unsurprising that\n\nguidance has been issued to guide app developers. In the United Kingdom, the\nInformation Commission’s Office (“ICO”) has published guidance for mobile\n\n13\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\napp developers, which states that “transparency about purpose is crucial”6 and\nsets out important points that developers should take into consideration when\ndrafting notification to users in a mobile environment. In particular, the\nguidance also highlights how organisations can give their users more control\nover their privacy such as providing notification when their data is about to be\nuploaded to the Internet:7\n“If your app processes personal data in an unexpected way or\nis of a more sensitive nature you might need to consider the use\nof additional 'just-in-time' notifications or other alert systems\nto inform the user what's happening. For example, if geolocation services are running in the background or you are\nuploading data to the internet, consider using clear and\nrecognisable icons to indicate that this is occurring and where\nnecessary the option to stop (eg to cancel an upload).”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n36\n\nThe use of just-in-time notifications in order to obtain consent\n\ndynamically and in bite-sized portions (as opposed to a lengthy privacy policy)\nis one of the ways that the Commission has recommended for adoption in its\nGuide to Data Sharing.8\n37\n\nSimilarly, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data of\n\nHong Kong (“PCPD”) has issued an information leaflet in which it highlights\n\n6\n\nUK, ICO, Privacy in mobile apps: Guidance for app developers (December 2013)\n<https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1596/privacy-in-mobile-appsdp-guidance.pdf> at p. 10.\n\n7\n\nIbid. at p. 17.\n\n8\n\nPDPC, Guide to Data Sharing (27 July 2017) <https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Legislationand-Guidelines/Guidelines/Other-Guides> at [3.6] - [3.7].\n\n14\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nthe privacy implications that mobile app developers should consider, including\nthe designing of a privacy policy statement:9\n“Privacy Policy Statement (PPS)\nApps Developers should prepare a PPS to outline their policies\nand practices in relation to personal data. Technical terms and\nelusive language should be avoided in the PPS. It should be\neasily readable and easily understandable, and in appropriate\nlength. Its location on the mobile apps should be prominent. Its\navailability also on the businesses’ normal websites is\nrecommended.\nGiving examples in PPS\nWhen describing the purposes for which the information is to\nbe used in the PPS, Apps Developers should consider giving\nreal-case examples (as opposed to generic statements) specific\nto the mobile apps to assist mobile device users in\nunderstanding why such information needs to be collected,\naccessed or shared.\nRelevance and Accuracy\nApps Developers should ensure that their PPS are accurate and\nspecific for individual mobile apps. If the description is vague\nor unclear, the Apps Developers may be perceived as hiding the\nreal purpose of data collection and access. Similarly, if the PPS\nis copied or extracted from a standard template or another\nmobile app, Apps Developers have to review the contents to\nensure their relevance and accuracy.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n38\n\nThe Commissioner agrees with many of the general positions taken by\n\nthe PCPD. In this regard, a privacy policy for a mobile app should, amongst\nother things:\n(a)\n\naim to enhance a user’s understanding as to why certain personal\n\ndata needs to be collected, accessed or shared;\n\n9\n\nHK, PCPD, Personal data privacy protection: what mobile app developers and their\nclients\nshould\nknow\n(November\n2012)\n<https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/publications/files/apps_developers_e.pdf> at p. 5.\n\n15\n\n\fActxa Pte.

This may include directing the\n\n16\n\n\fActxa Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 5\n\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nmillion as the Commissioner thinks fit.\n42\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed to\n\nthe Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account the following\nmitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation had accepted the complaint in good faith and\n\ntaken prompt steps to broaden the coverage of its Privacy Policy.

The facts of this matter are uncomplicated and the\napplication of the law is straightforward. Of note, however, is that this incident\nis disappointingly similar to a prior incident involving the Organisation (see Re\nAviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 (“Re Aviva Ltd [2017]”)), for which the\nOrganisation was found to be in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act (“PDPA”) and fined $6,000.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a multinational insurance company that offers\n\nvarious types of insurance plans to its policyholders.\n3\n\nOn 8 June 2017, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”)\n\ninformed the Organisation that it had received a complaint on the unauthorised\ndisclosure (the “Incident”) as set out at paragraph 1 above. The Organisation\nwas unaware of the Incident prior to the notification from MAS. The\nOrganisation in turn notified the Personal Data Protection Commission\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\n(“Commission”) on 15 June 2017. An investigation was carried out under\nsection 50(1) of the PDPA in relation to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n4\nissued\n\nThe Incident occurred during the enveloping of underwriting letters\nthrough\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s\n\nunderwriting\n\ndepartment\n\n(the\n\n“Department”) to individual clients who signed up for group insurance\npolicies. Staff in the Department print out underwriting letters to be issued to\nthe Organisation’s clients. Each staff will then place the relevant underwriting\nletter into the case file of each individual client and place the file onto a tray for\nan administrative staff to pick it up. The relevant administrative staff is to pick\nup the case files from the trays, remove the underwriting letter, fold it, and seal\nthe underwriting letter in an envelope. The envelope is then placed in the mail\nbasket to be delivered to a postal services company.\n5\n\nOn the day of the Incident, 1 February 2017, the Department processed\n\nabout 90 distinct underwriting letters. These underwriting letters were issued to\nindividual clients who had requested for an increase in insurance coverage to\nupdate them on the status of their requests. The personal data disclosed in each\nunderwriting letter included an individual’s full name, residential address,\nmedical conditions and the sum assured (the “Personal Data”).\n6\n\nOne of the administrative staff (the “Admin Staff”) folded 4\n\nunderwriting letters, each of which were addressed to a unique individual client,\nat the same time. However, the Admin Staff forgot that the letters were meant\nto be sent to different individuals and enclosed all 4 letters in a single envelope.\nAs a result, the 4 underwriting letters were sent to the Recipient Client and the\npersonal data of the 3 Impacted Clients were disclosed to the Recipient Client\nwhen the envelope was opened.\n\n2\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nFindings and Assessment\nIssue for determination\n7\n\nThe issue to be determined is whether the Organisation had, pursuant to\n\nsection 24 of the PDPA, put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect\nthe Personal Data from unauthorised disclosure.\n8\n\nSection 24 requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks.\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA\nThe Personal Data were disclosed without authorisation\n9\n\nIt is not disputed that the Personal Data fell within the definition of\n\n“personal data” under section 2 of the PDPA as it was possible to identify the 3\nImpacted Clients from that information alone.\n10\n\nIt is also not in dispute that the Personal Data were disclosed mistakenly;\n\nthe disclosure was therefore without authorisation.\n11\n\nBased on the investigations carried out, the Commissioner finds that the\n\nunauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data was a result of a breach of the\nOrganisation’s obligation to make reasonable security arrangements for the\nprotection of the Personal Data. The reasons for this finding are set out below.\n\n3\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nThe Organisation relied solely on the administrative staff to perform their\nduties diligently\n12\n\nUpon investigation, it was discovered that there were no processes or\n\nsafeguards put in place to prevent the Incident. Just as in Re Aviva Ltd [2017],\nthe Organisation merely relied on the administrative staff to perform their duties\ndiligently.\n13\n\nRandom checks on the enveloping carried out by the administrative staff\n\nwere not conducted. This was despite the fact that a total of 4 permanent staff\nand 2 temporary staff were tasked to carry out the enveloping of such\nunderwriting letters. It is surprising that none of the 4 permanent staff were\ntasked with a supervisory role to conduct random checks. In fact, the\nOrganisation did not have in place any checks on the enveloping work of the\nadministrative staff at any time prior to the dispatch of the letters to individual\nclients.\n14\n\nThe Organisation did not even have a process to check if the number of\n\nletters sent out corresponded with the number of underwriting letters scheduled\nto be sent out on the day. This would have been the most basic check and would\nlikely have prevented the Incident, but even this was not conducted. To be clear,\nit is unlikely that such a basic arrangement on its own would suffice for the\npurposes of complying with section 24; such an arrangement would still leave\npotential foreseeable errors (eg one of the pages of a letter being mistakenly\nincluded in an envelope to be sent to another individual) unaddressed. It would,\nhowever, have been better than nothing.\n15\n\nAs it was made clear in Re Aviva Ltd [2017], relying solely on\n\nemployees to perform their tasks diligently is not a sufficiently reasonable\n\n4\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nsecurity arrangement and is a breach of the Organisation’s obligation under\nsection 24.\nPersonal data of a sensitive nature should be safeguarded by a higher level of\nprotection\n16\n\nThe personal data found in the underwriting letters included data of a\n\nsensitive nature such as financial and medical data (Re Aviva Ltd [2017] at [17]).\n17\n\nAll forms or categories of personal data are not equal; organisations need\n\nto take into account the sensitivity of the personal data that they handle. In this\nregard, the Commissioner repeats the explanation in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] (at\n[18]) on the higher standards of protection that should be implemented for\nsensitive personal data:\nThe Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA states\nthat an organisation should “implement robust policies and\nprocedures for ensuring appropriate levels of security for\npersonal data of varying levels of sensitivity”. This means that\na higher standard of protection is required for more sensitive\npersonal data. More sensitive personal data, such as insurance,\nmedical and financial data, should be accorded a\ncommensurate level of protection. In addition, the Guide to\nPreventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data expressly states that documents that contain\nsensitive personal data should be “processed and sent with\nparticular care”.\n\nThe Organisation encountered a similar incident due to the lack of security\narrangements surrounding its enveloping process but failed to take any heed\nfrom the prior incident\n18\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to implement any reasonable security\n\narrangements in respect of the enveloping process here is perplexing given the\noccurrence of a previous incident (the “Prior Incident”) suffered by the\nOrganisation and which, as mentioned above, is the subject of the decision in\nRe Aviva Ltd [2017].\n\n5\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n19\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nIn the Prior Incident, the Organisation had mistakenly mailed insurance\n\ndocuments which were meant for one policyholder to another policyholder. Just\nas in the present case, the Organisation relied solely on its administrative staff\nto perform their duties diligently and had not implemented any security\narrangements to prevent the disclosure of personal data arising from the\nenveloping process.\n20\n\nAs set out in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] (at [37]), the Organisation\n\nimplemented the following checks as of 3 December 2016 within its processing\ndepartment to mitigate against enveloping errors:\n(a)\n\na random check amounting to a sample size of about 10% would\n\nbe conducted; and\n(b)\n\nif an error is detected, the team leader would conduct a 100%\n\naudit of the work of the staff who had erred for a period of 1 week.\n21\n\nThe investigations show that the above checks were not implemented\n\nacross all departments within the Organisation. Notably, the Department\ninvolved in the present case (ie underwriting department) was not amongst those\ndepartments in which the above checks were implemented.\n22\n\nIf the Organisation did not appreciate the fact that a lack of security\n\narrangements in the enveloping process would potentially lead to an\nunauthorised disclosure of Personal Data before the occurrence of the Prior\nIncident, it should have become acutely aware of this potential after the Prior\nIncident was reported or at least by the time it had concluded its internal\ninvestigations on 3 December 2016.\n\n6\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n23\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nThe Organisation had about 2 months (from 3 December 2016 to 1\n\nFebruary 2017, ie the time of the Incident) to implement some form of security\narrangement to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal data arising out\nof mistakes in the enveloping process across its departments. This was,\nhowever, not done. In fact, even till as late as 8 June 2017, when MAS notified\nthe Organisation of the Incident, no security arrangements were implemented to\nprevent such incidents. Clearly the checks which were implemented in respect\nof the Prior Incident were not complex and could have been rolled out to the\nrest of the departments within the Organisation which also handled enveloping\nin a short span of time. In fact, the Organisation had been able to implement\nsome checks as security arrangements (as set out below at paragraphs 26(d) and\n26(e) in respect of the enveloping of underwriting letters by 15 June 2017\n(within 7 days after it became aware of the Incident).\n24\n\nWhether or not the checks (described below at paragraph 26), would\n\nhave prevented the Incident from occurring is beside the point. What is\negregious in this case is that the Organisation failed to put in place any security\narrangements in the Department, as it was obliged to under the PDPA, to counter\nthe potential of an unauthorised disclosure of personal data through mistakes in\nthe enveloping process even though a similar incident involving an enveloping\nprocess within the Organisation had taken place about 2 months prior to the\nIncident. By 3 December 2016, the Organisation knew about the process gaps\nand the need for safeguards arising from its internal investigations into the Prior\nIncident. Even as it was implementing the recommended safeguards, the\nOrganisation failed to conduct a more thorough review of its internal\ndepartments in order to identify more completely those departments that are\nsubject to the same vulnerabilities and risk similar failures as the Prior Incident.\nIt cannot be gainsaid that the Organisation’s failure to include the Department\n\n7\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nin its remedial plans arising from the Prior Incident contributed to the present\nincident.\n25\n\nTo be clear, the Commissioner is not making a finding as to the\n\nsuitability of the above checks as reasonable security arrangements for the work\nundertaken in the processing and underwriting departments. Neither is the\nCommissioner recommending that these checks be implemented throughout the\nOrganisation.\nRemediation Actions Taken by the Organisation\n26\n\nThe Commissioner notes that after the data breach incident, the\n\nOrganisation undertook the following remediation actions:\n(a)\n\nthe Recipient Client was contacted and the Organisation\n\nprocured the return of the underwriting letters addressed to the Impacted\nClients;\n(b)\n\nthe Impacted Clients were notified by the Organisation and were\n\ngiven shopping vouchers as a token of the Organisation’s apology;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation emphasised to the administrative staff the\n\nimportance of checking that the envelopes do not contain letters\naddressed to multiple individuals;\n(d)\n\nthe Organisation implemented random sampling checks of 2\n\nenvelopes per day and if any enveloping error is detected, a 100% check\nwill be conducted in respect of the enveloping work undertaken by the\nadministrative staff who had erred for one week; and\n\n8\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\n(e)\n\ndaily compulsory checks will be conducted to track the number\n\nof underwriting letters scheduled to be sent out each day and ensure that\nit is consistent with the number of envelopes containing these letters to\nbe mailed.\n27\n\nAs with the Prior Incident, the Commissioner has not reviewed the\n\nOrganisation’s considerations in deciding on the sample size for its random\nsampling checks and is not providing an opinion on the effectiveness of these\nrandom checks. The Commissioner, however, points out that with respect to the\nfollow up letters which were the subject of the Prior Incident, a random check\nof 2 envelopes per day amounted to a sample size of about 10%. Here, given the\nquantity of underwriting letters the Organisation processed on the day of the\nIncident (ie 90 letters), the sample size amounts to about 2%.\n28\n\nIn this regard, the Commissioner reiterates the observation he made in\n\nRe Aviva Ltd [2017] (at [40] - [41]):\nAs a general observation, the Commissioner highlights that\norganisations should take into account all relevant\ncircumstances and considerations when devising and\nimplementing fresh or enhanced security arrangements in\nrelation to the enveloping process to ensure compliance with\nsection 24 of the PDPA. Such circumstances and considerations\ninclude the likelihood of unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification or disposal of the Personal\nData and similar risks in relation to the enveloping process; the\nsensitivity of the Personal Data and the impact to the individual\nif an unauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the\nPersonal Data; the size of the organisation; and the amount of\nPersonal Data that it is subject to the enveloping process.\nThe Organisation may also wish to consider a graduated\napproach to sample checking. For example, the enveloping work\nof new members of staff and members of staff who have recently\nmade mistakes may be subject to stringent checks while the\nwork of senior members of staff with relatively few records of\nsuch mistakes may be subject to more moderate checks. It is\nnot automatous checks that are of utmost importance but the\nefforts that an organisation puts into the development of\n\n9\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nconsidered SOPs which focus on the protection of personal\ndata, which in turn contributes to the development of a positive\ndata protection culture amongst its staff.\n\nDirections\n29\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give\n\nthe Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay\na financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the\nCommissioner thinks fit.\n30\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed on\n\nthe Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account the following\naggravating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Personal Data disclosed, in particular the medical condition\n\nand sum assured, were sensitive in nature;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation is in the business of handling large volumes of\n\npersonal data, the disclosure of which may cause exceptional damage,\ninjury or hardship to the affected individuals; and\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation had encountered a similar incident prior to this\n\nIncident in which its lack of security arrangements surrounding the\nenveloping process resulted in the unauthorised disclosure of personal\ndata of one of the Organisation’s clients to another client due to a\nmistake by an employee of the Organisation during the enveloping\nprocess.\n31\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n\n10\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation had cooperated fully with investigations and\n\nwas forthcoming in admitting its mistake;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation had notified the Impacted Clients of the data\n\nbreach and offered them an apology and shopping vouchers, and had\nalso made arrangements to retrieve the wrongly delivered documents\nfrom the Recipient Client;\n(c)\n\nthe unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data was limited to one\n\nindividual; and\n(d)\n\nthere was no evidence to suggest that there had been any actual\n\nloss or damage resulting from the unauthorised disclosure.\n32\n\nPursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and the investigation and\n\nassessment of this matter having been completed, the Commissioner is satisfied\nthat the Organisation did not make reasonable security arrangements to protect\nthe Personal Data and is in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. Having carefully\nconsidered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commissioner hereby directs\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$30,000 within 30 days from the\ndate of the directions, failing which interest shall be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty.\nInformation Provided by the Organisation Subsequent to Receiving the\nCommissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n33\n\nThe Organisation by way of its letter dated 2 March 2018 provided the\n\nCommissioner with certain information subsequent to being informed of the\nCommissioner’s preliminary decision that the Organisation was in breach of\nsection 24 of the PDPA and the intention to impose the financial penalty as set\nout above at paragraph 32. The Commissioner reviewed the information in the\n\n11\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nsaid letter and has maintained his views on the matter, his decision to impose a\nfinancial penalty, as well as the quantum of the financial penalty.\n34\n\nThe information provided by the Organisation is summarised as follows:\n(a)\n\nDuring the material period, there was a surge in the volume of\n\nunderwriting letters as the Organisation had successfully bid for a large\ntender. Prior to the material period the Department had to process 40\nletters per day; with the increased sales resulting from the successful bid,\nthe Department had to process about 90 underwriting letters per day.\n(b)\n\nThe administrative staff was trained to carry out the staff’s duties\n\nincluding training on the importance of handling personal data.\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation was in the process of implementing a barcoding\n\nsystem for their mail to minimise manual intervention.\n(d)\n\nthe Department was aware of the Prior Incident. According to\n\nthe Organisation, every function (including the Department) across the\nOrganisation handling personal data was advised to take note of the Prior\nIncident, assess their respective processes and consider implementing\nnecessary controls to prevent similar occurrences with each function\nconsidering what practices or controls are appropriate for their\nprocesses.\n(e)\n\nthe Department assessed that the risk of unauthorised disclosure\n\nas a result of its processes and practices was low given that (i) the\nDepartment had not suffered such an incident prior to this; (ii) the staff\nhad been sufficiently trained; (iii) there was verification of the clients’\nname against an underwriting worksheet before the letters were folded;\nand (iv) they would be implementing a barcoding system.\n12\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\n(f)\n\nreputational damage (if any) on the Impacted Clients would be\n\nminimal.\n(g)\n\nthe Organisation took steps to inform the Impacted Clients and\n\napologised for the Incident.\n(h)\n35\n\nthe unauthorised disclosure was limited to one individual.\n\nThe points summarised above provided an explanation of how the\n\nOrganisation made its decision and the considerations that it undertook in its\nrisk assessment. The Department made an assessment of the risks and decided\nnot to implement the security measures introduced following the Prior Incident.\nClearly, the risk materialised and the Organisation has to be responsible for its\nconsequences.\n36\n\nThe Organisation’s representations concerning its plans to implement a\n\nbarcode system for processing mail cannot excuse the adoption of the security\nmeasures introduced in other parts of the Organisation in the interim since it has\ncontinuing obligations to protect its clients’ personal data. The future\nimplementation of a barcode system does not address the protection measures\nthat should have been put in place in the interim. It is precisely because of the\nrisk of fluctuating — and in this case, a surge of — workload that interim\nadoption of the security measures, pending introduction of the barcode system,\nis necessary.\n37\n\nWhile the Commissioner accepts that personal data protection training\n\nwhich is specific to the administrative staff’s role in handling personal data may\nin certain circumstances be a security measure, it does not detract from the\nnecessity and relevance for operational safeguards in the form of the security\nmeasures introduced following the Prior Incident.\n\n13\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n38\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 4\n\nPertinently, the Department verified the name of clients against an\n\nunderwriting worksheet, but this verification was conducted prior to the folding\nand enveloping of the letters and was not designed to prevent situations similar\nto both the Incident and Prior Incident where letters were sent to the wrong\nrecipient. More need not be said about the necessity for the Department to have\nadopted the security measures introduced following the Prior Incident even if to\ndo so was an interim measure pending the implementation of a barcode system.\n39\n\nThe points set out at paragraphs 34(f), (g) and (h) had been already taken\n\ninto consideration in assessing the quantum of financial penalty to be imposed.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"The investigation on alleged disclosure of personal data by My Digital Lock has been discontinued.

Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1612-B0423\n12 February 2018\n1\n\nThis is the third complaint lodged by the Complainant against My\n\nDigital Lock Pte. Ltd. (“the Organisation”). The first complaint was the subject\nof the decision in Re My Digital Lock Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 20.\nInvestigations were discontinued in respect of the second complaint, as the facts\nand allegations relied upon in the complaint were closely linked to legal\nproceedings which were ongoing at the time between the Complainant and the\nOrganisation, and it was determined that the matter was best dealt with through\nthe ongoing legal proceedings. In this third complaint, after a review of the\nmaterial facts, I exercised my discretion under section 50 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to discontinue investigations. I set out hereunder\nthe reasons for the exercise of my discretion in this case.\nBackground\n2\n\nSometime in October 2015, the Complainant purchased a digital lock\n\nfrom the Organisation for his home. Shortly after, the Complainant and the sole\ndirector of the Organisation (“Sole Director”) became involved in a dispute\nconcerning alleged defects in the Organisation’s product. The Organisation then\ntook out civil action in defamation in relation to certain remarks that were\nallegedly made by the Complainant concerning the Organisation’s business.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n3\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nSubsequently, the Sole Director posted screenshots of WhatsApp\n\nmessages, as well as photographs, on his personal Facebook page (“Facebook\nPage”). These WhatsApp messages and photographs were related to the then\nongoing dispute between the Organisation and the Complainant. The personal\ndata in the WhatsApp messages comprised the Complainant’s contact details,\nnamely, his mobile phone number and residential address.\n4\n\nOn 4 January 2016, the Complainant lodged a complaint with the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”) after discovering the\nunauthorised disclosure of his personal data on the Facebook Page. In respect\nof this complaint, a warning was issued to the Organisation for breaching its\nobligations under sections 13 and 24 on 4 November 2016. See Re My Digital\nLock Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 20 for the detailed grounds of this decision.\n5\n\nOn 9 September 2016, before the decision for the first complaint was\n\nissued, the Complainant lodged a second complaint concerning the\nOrganisation’s disclosure of his personal data on a publicly accessible blog.\nThis blog was the personal blog (“Blog”) of the Sole Director who had set it up\nwith the intent to respond to the various allegations made by the Complainant\nabout the Organisation’s business. The Sole Director posted images and\nscreenshots of the online allegations that had been made by the Complainant on\nvarious websites and forums, and appended his personal response to each of\nthese allegations.\n6\n\nOne of the images the Sole Director posted on his Blog was a letter sent\n\nby the Organisation’s solicitors to the Complainant in April 2016. The\nscreenshot was of an open window, in which was displayed a letter and the file\nname of this document was displayed in the title bar of the open window (“the\nLetter”). The Complainant’s name formed part of the file name of the Letter.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nAlthough the file name displayed in the window title was not redacted, the Sole\nDirector had taken care to redact the name and residential address of the\nComplainant in the body of the Letter that was displayed in the open window.\nInvestigations into the matter were discontinued as the matters arising from the\ncomplaint would have been more appropriately dealt with as part of the then\nongoing legal proceedings between the parties. Any claims or allegations made,\nor any facts relied upon, by either party would have very likely been relevant to\nthe civil proceedings as the Blog was set up by the Sole Director to refute the\nalleged defamatory remarks made by the Complainant – this goes to the crux of\nthe civil dispute between the parties.\n7\n\nI would, at this juncture, highlight the decision in Re M Star Movers &\n\nLogistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 (“M Star Movers”) and reiterate\nthat an organisation cannot be prevented from making reasonable and\nproportionate responses to defend itself from allegations made against it, even\nif personal data is disclosed in doing so. In M Star Movers, action was taken\nagainst the organisation because the personal data that was disclosed was\ndisproportionate in the circumstances and therefore the organisation was found\nto have acted unreasonably. In the second complaint, the Complainant had\nchosen to air his grievances with the Organisation on multiple public websites\nand forums. As investigations were discontinued, the Commissioner did not\nhave to address the issue whether naming the Complainant in his Blog in an\nattempt to refute the allegations made would have been a reasonable and\nproportionate response in the circumstances.\n8\n\nThe Complainant made his third complaint (“Complaint”) on 5\n\nNovember 2016. This time, the Complainant referred the Commission to a\nFacebook post where the Organisation had posted a copy of a police report that\nthe Organisation’s staff had made about a person who was allegedly harassing\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nthe staff of the Organisation. The Complainant was named by the Organisation’s\nmember of staff as the one who was carrying out such harassing acts.\n9\n\nInvestigations commenced on 8 December 2016. I subsequently directed\n\nthat investigations into the case be discontinued and an advisory notice issued\nto the Organisation. Although my decision was a discontinuance under section\n50(3) of the PDPA, I thought it helpful to provide detailed reasons for doing so.\nThis decision touches on issues that are fundamental to the administration and\nenforcement of the PDPA, namely:\n(a)\n\nwhen does a document containing personal data that is the\n\nsubject matter of a complaint become one that the Commissioner (or his\ndelegates) will consider exercising enforcement jurisdiction over;\n(b)\n\nhow does the PDPA sit within the framework of statutory and\n\ncommon law rights that collectively provide safeguards to the privacy\nof individuals in Singapore; and\n(c)\n\nhow does the Commissioner discern between a breach of the\n\nPDPA that ought to be investigated and cases for which private action\nin the civil courts enforcing the abovementioned framework of laws\nprovide better remedies to safeguard the privacy of individuals?\nDocuments containing personal data\n10\n\nWe start with the definition of “personal data” in section 2 of the PDPA.\n\nThis is a broad definition:\n“personal data” means data, whether true or not, about an\nindividual who can be identified —\n(a) from that data; or\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\n(b) from that data and other information to which the\norganisation has or is likely to have access.\n\n11\n\nThere are certain types of information that in and of themselves are\n\ncapable of identifying an individual. The Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts\nin the PDPA (revised on 27 July 2017) (“Key Concepts Guidelines”) at [5.10]\nprovides a list of information that is considered to be capable of doing so. While\nsuch information is capable of identifying an individual, it does not necessarily\nmean that anyone in possession of the information will be able to do so. The\ntouchstone used to compile the list is the one-to-one relationship of the\ninformation and the individual. Information on the list is not typically associated\nwith more than one individual, either scientifically (eg biometric signature and\nDNA profile), by convention (eg NRIC number) or as a matter of social norms\n(eg personal mobile phone number).\n12\n\nAt a higher level of abstraction, we consider the question when does a\n\ndocument contain information about an individual? What are the factors that the\nCommissioner considers in deciding whether the use or disclosure of personal\ndata in documents draws its scrutiny through the lens of the PDPA? The remarks\nthat follow apply not only to textual documents but images (eg photographs that\ncapture the image of an identifiable individual in the Advisory Guidelines on\nthe PDPA for Selected Topics (revised on 28 March 2017) at [4.2]) and audio\nvisual documents (eg CCTV footage in Re Management Corporation Strata\nTitle Plan No 2956 [2017] PDP Digest 238).\n13\n\nIn the UK case of Durant v. Financial Services Authority [2003] EWCA\n\nCiv 1746 (“Durant”), the Court of Appeal adopted the “biographically\nsignificant information” test where the recording of the information goes\nbeyond the mere “putative data subject’s involvement in a matter or an event\nthat has no personal connotations, a life event in respect of which his privacy\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\ncould not be said to be compromised”. The focus of the information should be\nthe data subject rather than some other person, or some transaction or event in\nwhich the data subject may have figured or have had an interest in: Durant at\n[28].\n14\n\nIn a subsequent case of Edem v. IC & Financial Services Authority\n\n[2014] EWCA Civ 92 (“Edem”), the English Court of Appeal cast doubt on the\nbiographically significant information test as the sole criterion. Without\nexpressly overruling the earlier decision in Durant, the court held that the\ndisclosure of the names of three individuals could be withheld on the basis that\nthey constituted personal data upon which the UK Data Protection Act 1998\nwas applicable. The court, agreeing with the Information Commissioner’s\nOffice (“ICO”) Data Protection Technical Guidance, took the view that it was\nnot “always necessary to consider ‘biographical significance’ to determine\nwhether data is personal data” – the only time to consider the “biographical\nsignificance” of the data is where the information is not “obviously about” an\nindividual or clearly “linked to” him: Edem at [21].\n15\n\nIn assessing whether an unauthorised disclosure or access of information\n\nabout an individual in a document ought to be one that requires scrutiny under\nthe PDPA, the approach that ought to be taken is to first consider whether the\ndocument is clearly about an individual or individuals. Hence, flight manifests\nthat serve the function of conveying information about the individuals on the\nflight will qualify: see Re Tiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd and others [2017]\nSGPDPC 6. Similarly, a letter that is intended to identify a former employee to\nthe organisation’s customers will also qualify: see Re Jump Rope (Singapore)\n[2016] SGPDPC 21. As the collection of documents increases, the purpose of\nrecording or conveying information about individuals becomes indisputable.\nHence, mishandling of customers’ insurance records (eg Re Ang Rui Song\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13), and breaches of information systems containing customer\nor membership records (eg Re Orchard Turn Developments Pte. Ltd. [2017]\nSGPDPC 12) are cases where the documents were clearly about individuals.\n16\n\nEven if a document is not clearly about the individual, such as the\n\ndocuments in Durant which pertained to Mr Durant’s complaint to the Financial\nServices Authority (“FSA”) about the conduct of Barclays Bank or about the\nFSA’s own conduct in their investigations of his complaint, the Commissioner\nwould consider whether the information is biographically significant. Consider\ninstant messaging communications, which will contain the identifier associated\nwith the author of each message: see Re Executive Coach International Pte. Ltd.\n[2017] SGPDPC 3. These identifiers are automatically inserted into the\ncommunication as a function of the communication system. Similarly, an\nexchange of social media posts will contain identifiers of who wrote each post,\nas will emails contain the sender and intended recipients’ names and email\naddresses. In and of themselves, such identifiers are intended to identify the\noriginator (or recipient) but does it mean that the purpose of each such message\nis to convey information about the originator by reason only of the inclusion of\nthe identifier? I do not think so. It is necessary to consider the content of the\nmessage. The content of the message must convey information about one or\nmore individuals. Thus in Re Black Peony [2017] PDP Digest 218, it was\ndecided that private communications such as WhatsApp messages per se will\nnot invariably be considered personal data.\n17\n\nThis approach applies to all types of documents, textual as well as\n\nmultimedia. This may be relevant in cases in which the Commissioner exercises\nhis discretion to suspend, discontinue or refuse to conduct an investigation.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n18\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nAt this juncture, I take the opportunity to highlight that an individual has\n\ntwo avenues through which he may address his concerns of a potential breach\nof the PDPA by an organisation. The individual may submit a complaint to the\nCommission. Where the individual has suffered loss or damage directly as a\nresult of the contravention, the individual may commence civil proceedings\nagainst the organisation under section 32 of the PDPA.\n19\n\nWhere the individual chooses to lodge a complaint with the\n\nCommission, the Commissioner (and his delegates) has discretion under section\n50(3) of the PDPA to suspend, discontinue or refuse to conduct an investigation.\nOne of the circumstances in which the Commissioner may exercise his\ndiscretion under section 50(3) of the PDPA is where the Commissioner deems\nthat the severity of the potential breach does not warrant taking any further\naction. Data protection regulators in other jurisdictions, such as the UK\nInformation Commissioner’s Office1, similarly take the same approach, as\nclearly every single data protection complaint cannot be investigated. In\ndetermining the severity of the potential breach, the Commissioner may\nconsider, amongst other things, the nature of the personal data affected, the\nnumber of people affected, whether the breach is due to systemic issues and the\nlikely effect on the individuals concerned. The biographical significance test\nwould be relevant when considering the nature of the personal data affected and\nthe likely effect on the data subject.\n20\n\nIn the present case, the document concerned was a police report made\n\nby a member of the Organisation’s staff concerning harassing conduct\npurportedly carried out by the Complainant. The disclosure of the\n\n1\n\nUnited Kingdom Information Commissioner’s Office. How we deal with complaints\nand concerns – A guide for data controllers at pg. 4\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nComplainant’s identity was therefore one of the purposes of the report and since\nthe allegation in the report was about the Complainant’s purportedly harassing\nconduct, the content of the report was therefore potentially of biographical\nsignificance. I have nevertheless decided to exercise my discretion in this case\nto discontinue investigations in this matter. The following discussion will\nexplain my exercise of discretion. A caveat ought to be inserted at this juncture\nthat this is not intended to be a comprehensive compendium of all\nconsiderations in the exercise of discretion. There will be future cases where\ndifferent aspects of the discretion will be explained, within the factual matrix of\nthose cases.\nThe intersection between the law protecting privacy and personal data\nprotection\n21\n\nIn order to explain the exercise of my discretion to discontinue\n\ninvestigations, it is necessary to understand the interaction between the\napplicable common law principles – by which I mean also to include statutory\ntorts – that protect privacy and the operations of the PDPA. Even if the\ninformation in a document has a purpose of conveying information about an\nindividual, it is not necessarily the case that the most appropriate remedies are\nin the civil administrative enforcement provisions of the PDPA. While it has oft\nbeen said that there is no right to privacy under common law, this statement\nought to be re-examined in light of developments in both the common law and\nstatutory torts in recent past. Without going into a lengthy dissertation, I posit\nthat while it is probably still true that the common law does not recognise a\ngeneral right to privacy, there exists today a framework of common law and\nstatutory torts that collectively protect an individual’s privacy. Individuals are\ntherefore able to prosecute their claims for invasions into their privacy by\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nprivate action before the civil courts much more effectively today than in the\npast.\n22\n\nThe Singapore courts have not made any explicit pronouncements that\n\na general tort of privacy exists nor that there is explicit provision for the\nprotection of privacy as a fundamental right in our Constitution; neither is there\nan omnibus privacy legislation in our statute books: see Gary Chan Kok Yew &\nLee Pey Woan, The Law of Torts Singapore (2nd Ed, 2015) at [16.011]. The\nstarting point in Singapore is therefore not very different from the common law.\nKaye v. Robertson [1991] FSR 62 (“Kaye v. Robertson”) has often been cited\nas authority for the proposition that there is no right to privacy in the common\nlaw. Kaye v. Robertson was a case which involved journalists intruding into the\nhospital room of a well-known actor and taking photographs of him. The UK\nCourt of Appeal acknowledged that “[it] is well-known that in English law there\nis no right to privacy, and accordingly there is no right of action for breach of\na person’s privacy”: per Glidewell LJ. at 66. This position was confirmed in\nWainwright v. Home Office [2004] 2 AC 406 when the House of Lords declined\nto recognise a general right of privacy which would extend to physical privacy\ninterferences. Although our Court of Appeal traversed the authorities in the case\nof ANB v. ANC [2015] 5 SLR 522 (“ANB v. ANC”), the question whether a\ncommon law right of privacy should be recognised was intentionally left open:\nsee ANB v. ANC at [20] – [23].\n23\n\nPrivacy, as a standalone common law right, is steadily gaining\n\nrecognition in some parts of the Commonwealth. Recent developments in\nCanada and New Zealand that recognise a general common law right to\nseclusion are discussed in a subsequent section: see discussion below at [24].\nMost recently, the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy\n(Retd.) and ANR v. Union of India and Ors Writ Petition (Civil) No 494 of 2012\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\n(“Puttaswamy”) recognised the right to privacy as a constitutional right.\nAlthough the decision did not address the question whether privacy rights were\nenforceable as a common law tort, it was clear that the majority of the Supreme\nCourt felt that the right to privacy was a fundamental right protected by the\nIndian Constitution.\n24\n\nIt is unlikely that our courts would take the same approach as in\n\nPuttaswamy. In Lim Meng Suang v. Attorney-General [2015] 1 SLR 26, the\nSingapore Court of Appeal held that the right to privacy and personal autonomy\nshould not be read into the phrase “life or personal liberty” in Article 9 of the\nSingapore Constitution: at [44] – [47]. The Court of Appeal made it clear that\nthere is unlikely to be a constitutional right to privacy; the appellants cannot\n“obtain by the (constitutional) backdoor what they cannot obtain by the (private\nlaw) front door”: at [49]. However, the Court of Appeal left it open for there to\nbe a right to privacy “developed by way of the private law on privacy instead”:\nat [49].\n25\n\nWhile our courts have not recognised the existence of a general right to\n\nprivacy that is an actionable tort, or a fundamental right protected by our\nConstitution, that is not to say that our laws do not protect different aspects of\nprivacy. An appreciation of how privacy is protected by a framework of\ncommon law and statutory torts is a necessary primer for understanding the\ninteraction between the common law principles that protect privacy and the\noperation of the PDPA. It is apposite to preface the discussion by drawing a\ndistinction between those torts that indirectly protect privacy interests (eg\ntrespass to the person or land and nuisance), and the bundle of rights that a\ngeneral right to privacy protects. It is the latter that we train our focus on.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n26\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nWhat is privacy? A useful definition with which to commence our\n\ndiscussion is that which was provided by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D.\nBrandeis – the right to be let alone: see “The Right to Privacy” (1890) Harvard\nL. Rev. Vol. 4(5) 193 at 195. A helpful framework for discerning the contours\nof this right was offered by William L. Prosser (see “Privacy” (1960) 48 Cal. L.\nRev. 383 at 389 (“Prosser, Privacy”)):\n(a)\n\nthe right to seclusion – the right to prevent intrusions into one’s\n\nseclusion that exists independently of the tort of trespass to person or\nproperty;\n(b)\n\nthe right to prevent publication of private communication –\n\nrecent common law developments have started to recognise the\nexistence of this right independently of the law of confidentiality;\n\n27\n\n(c)\n\nthe right to prevent the appropriation of identity; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe right to prevent false publicity.\n\nThe Prosser categorisation provides a useful framework for examining\n\nthe different aspects of privacy. It is necessary to understand how this bundle of\nrights are currently protected by common law and statutory torts in order to\nappreciate the dynamics between remedies under these laws protecting an\nindividual’s privacy and the Commissioner’s role in the enforcement of the\nPDPA, which protects informational privacy and therefore sits within the\npenumbra of the laws protecting privacy.\nRight to seclusion\n28\n\nIntrusion upon seclusion or solitude involves an invasion of a victim’s\n\nprivate space or affairs. Some torts that are premised on trespass to property or\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nperson protect aspects of the right to seclusion, but to be effective, this right\nought not be dependent on an invasion of one’s person or property. The tort of\nprivacy based on the right to seclusion has been recognised in other countries.\nIn New Zealand, the High Court recognised the common law tort of intrusion\nupon seclusion as a standalone tort in C v. Holland [2013] 3 LRC 78 (“C v.\nHolland”). In that case, the claimant was a young woman who suffered deep\ndistress when she discovered that her boyfriend’s flatmate had covertly installed\na camera in the roof cavity above the bathroom to film her undressing and\nshowering. To establish a claim under the tort of intrusion upon seclusion, a\nclaimant had to show (see C v. Holland at [94]):\n(a)\n\nan intentional and unauthorised intrusion;\n\n(b)\n\ninto seclusion (namely, intimate personal activity, space or\n\naffairs);\n(c)\n\ninvolving infringement of a reasonable expectation of privacy;\n\nand\n(d)\n29\n\nthat is highly offensive to a reasonable person.\n\nIn Canada, the courts have also recognised a common law right of\n\naction for intrusion upon seclusion in the case of Jones v. Tsige (2012) ONCA\n32 (“Jones v. Tsige”). In that case, the defendant, who was in a relationship with\nthe claimant’s former husband, and who worked for the same bank as the\nclaimant but in a different branch, used her workplace computer to gain access\nto the claimant’s private banking records 174 times, for the alleged purpose of\nconfirming whether the claimant’s former husband was paying child support. In\nconfirming the existence of the intrusion-based privacy tort, the Ontario Court\nof Appeal adopted as essential elements the formulation in the US Restatement\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nof the Law, Second, Torts (1977) §652: “[o]ne who intentionally intrudes,\nphysically or otherwise, upon the seclusion of another or his private affairs or\nconcerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the\ninvasion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person”: Jones v. Tsige at\n[70].\n30\n\nIn Singapore, the High Court, in the case of Malcomson Nicholas Hugh\n\nBertram v. Naresh Kumar Mehta [2001] 3 SLR(R) 379 (“Malcomson”), was\nperhaps a little ahead of the times when it took a decidedly different turn from\nthe general common law position by recognising a tort of intentional\nharassment. The elements of this tort were (a) knowingly engaging in (b) a\nsufficiently repetitive course of conduct that would (c) cause worry, emotional\ndistress or annoyance to another person: Malcomson at [31]. The Court of\nAppeal in Tee Yok Kiat v. Pang Min Seng [2013] SGCA 9 did not question the\nexistence of the tort of intentional harassment. The similarities and differences\nbetween this tort of intentional harassment and the more recent torts of intrusion\nupon seclusion would have provided ample fodder for commentary.\nUnfortunately, while the New Zealand and Canadian courts were establishing\nequivalent torts of privacy, the High Court in the subsequent case of AXA\nInsurance Singapore Pte Ltd v. Chandran s/o Natesan [2013] 4 SLR 545 at [8]\n– [10], cast doubt on the existence of this common law right and called for\nlegislative intervention if such a right ought to be recognised.\n31\n\nThe tort of harassment is now enshrined in sections 3 and 4 of the\n\nProtection from Harassment Act (Cap. 256A) (“POHA”). POHA had expressly\nabolished the common law tort of intentional harassment and established that\nno civil proceedings shall be brought for the tort of harassment except as a\nstatutory tort under section 14 of POHA. POHA also introduced a statutory tort\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nof unlawful stalking: section 7. The operation of these sections are briefly\ndescribed in Ting Choon Meng v. Attorney-General [2016] 1 SLR 1248 at [15]:\n(a)\nSection 3 makes it an offence for a person to behave or\ncommunicate in a “threatening, abusive or insulting” way with\nthe intention of causing, and actually causing, “harassment,\nalarm or distress” to a victim;\n(b)\nSection 4 makes it an offence to behave or communicate\nin a “threatening, abusive or insulting” way towards a victim\nwho is likely to be caused “harassment, alarm or distress”; and\n(c)\nSection 7 makes “unlawful stalking” an offence, and\ndefines this as engaging in a course of conduct which involves\nacts or omissions associated with stalking and which causes\n“harassment, alarm or distress” to a victim, provided that there\nwas an intention to cause such “harassment, alarm or distress”\nor at least knowledge that this was a likely outcome.\n\n32\n\nCollectively, these statutory provisions can now be relied upon to protect\n\none’s seclusion from intrusion. These are still relatively new statutory torts and\ntime will tell if they provide the same umbrella of protection as a general tort of\nintrusion upon seclusion. If the excesses of the paparazzi caused alarm or\ndistress to Mr Kaye in Kaye v. Robertson, he may now resort to the statutory\ntort of harassment for relief. Similarly, the victim in C v. Holland may now seek\nrelief against her boyfriend’s flatmate under the tort of unlawful stalking. The\nprotection offered by these statutory torts no doubt covers physical intrusions,\nbut may extend to online activities where the communication content amounts\nto harassment or stalking conduct. In Benber Dayao Yu v. Jacter Singh [2017]\n5 SLR 316 at [25], it was held that “harassing conduct on the Internet, such as\nthose in the Web post in the present case would be covered by ss 3 and 4 of\nthe POHA.”\n33\n\nHowever, the victim in Jones v. Tsige probably may not be able to resort\n\nto these statutory torts to safeguard her bank accounts from the prying eyes of\nthe defendant. But there is room for the PDPA, which deals with informational\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nprivacy, to operate in conjunction with the aforementioned statutory torts to\nprotect intrusions into seclusion. The factual matrix of Jones v. Tsige can\npotentially be a breach of the protection obligation on the part of the bank (but\nmay provide no reliefs against the former husband or his lover, the defendant,\nas they were acting in a domestic or personal capacity). Likewise, the factual\nmatrix of Kaye v. Robertson can give rise to a claim for collection of personal\ndata without consent. Both of these breaches can now be enforced as private\nactions under section 32 of the PDPA. The right of private action under the\nPDPA protects informational privacy which is complementary to but distinct\nfrom the protection of one’s seclusion, although these rights may overlap and\nco-exist.\n34\n\nIt is open to debate whether there is still room for a common law tort of\n\nintrusion upon seclusion, although the contours of such a tort will be heavily\ninfluenced by the statutory torts under POHA and PDPA. This is not the place\nnor is it my intention to discuss the similarities and differences between the\nrange of conduct prohibited by the statutory torts under POHA and PDPA, and\nthose categories prohibited by a common law tort that prevents intrusion upon\nseclusion. Before leaving this category, it suffices for me to make the following\nobservations. First, the state of our laws does not leave one’s right to seclusion\nunprotected; as can be seen from the foregoing discussion, there are statutory\ntorts that collectively offer a significant degree of protection of one’s seclusion\nfrom unwanted intrusion. These are early days and the jurisprudence can be\nexpected to grow as more cases are brought before the courts, and more\ncommentaries are published. Second, a plaintiff seeking relief against his\nintruder by filing a civil claim can pursue one or more of the statutory torts in\nPOHA and PDPA, whereas a complaint lodged with the Commission is limited\nto redress for PDPA breaches. Third, our courts may well take a leaf from the\ncommon law developments in Canada and New Zealand and find sufficient\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nroom for the development of a general tort of intrusion into seclusion that\ncomplements the statutory torts under POHA and PDPA. This development of\nthe common law may only be declared by the courts, and then only when the\nappropriate case goes before them. Therefore, if the true mischief is an intrusion\nupon one’s seclusion, a civil claim before the courts is more likely to yield an\neffective set of reliefs than a complaint to the Commission.\nRight to prevent publication of private communication\n35\n\nAnother strand of development in the right of privacy is the recognition\n\nof the right to prevent publication of private communication. This has now been\nrecognised as a new cause of action distinct from an action for breach of\nconfidence in two House of Lords cases: see Campbell v. MGN Ltd [2004] 2\nAC 457 (“Campbell”) and Douglas v. Hello! Ltd [2008] 1 AC 1 (“Douglas”).\nIn Campbell, the House of Lords held that where the invasion of privacy is\noccasioned by a wrongful disclosure of personal information, “the essence of\nthe tort is better encapsulated now as misuse of private information”: per Lord\nNicholls of Birkenhead at [14]. In Douglas, it was explicitly recognised that\n“traditional” breach of confidence and misuse of private information had\nbecome separate and distinct wrongs: per Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at [255].\nThe key development in this tort is, to my mind, the availability of remedies\neven where the private communication does not have the necessary quality of\nconfidence, which had hitherto been the death knell to any action based on the\nbreach of confidentiality: see Coco v. AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1968] FSR\n415. While confidentiality protects secrecy, the cause of action for misuse\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\ninvolves the identification of private information as “something worth\nprotecting as an aspect of human autonomy and dignity”: Campbell at [50].2\n36\n\nWhile this development in the UK may be viewed as being necessitated\n\nby their obligation to give effect to the EU Human Rights Convention as enacted\nin the UK Human Rights Act 1998, the Singapore Court of Appeal in ANB v.\nANC observed that the English common law had recognised a right to privacy\nas long ago as the 1990 decision of Attorney-General v. Observer Ltd [1990] 1\nAC 109. The relationship between the right of privacy and breach of confidence\nwas also articulated in Hellewell v. Chief Constable of Derbyshire [1995] 4 All\nER 473 at 476:\n“If someone with a telephoto lens were to take from a distance\nand with no authority a picture of another engaged in some\nprivate act, his subsequent disclosure of the photograph would,\nin my judgment as surely amount to a breach of confidence as\nif he had found or stolen a diary in which the act was recounted\nand proceeded to publish it. In such a case, the law would\nprotect what might reasonably be called a right of privacy,\nalthough the name accorded to the cause of action would be\nbreach of confidence”.\n\n37\n\nThe Court of Appeal in ANB v. ANC recognised that such a right had\n\nemerged in the UK from the law of breach of confidence. Developments in other\ncommon law jurisdictions – New Zealand was specifically mentioned – and the\nstatutory developments in Singapore – principally, the enactment of the POHA\nand PDPA – were referred to as signalling an increasing recognition of the need\n\n2\n\nAs Lord Hoffman said in Campbell v. MGN Limited [2004] 2 AC 457: “the new approach takes\na different view of the underlying value which the law protects. Instead of the cause of action\nbeing based on the duty of good faith applicable to confidential personal information and trade\nsecrets alike, it focuses upon the protection of human autonomy and dignity – the right to control\nthe dissemination of information about one’s private life and the right to the esteem and respect\nof other people” (at [51]). See also, Tugendhat and Christie, The Law of Privacy and the Media,\n2nd ed. by Mark Warby QC, Nicole Moreham & Iain Christie eds., (Oxford: OUP, 2011) at\n[5.04].\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nto protect personal privacy: see ANB v. ANC at [22]. Whilst the Court of Appeal\nstopped short of making an express determination on the issue as it was deciding\nan interlocutory appeal, it recognised that the question of “whether we should\nafford, like the courts in England and various other jurisdictions, protection to\none’s privacy by way of the law of confidence regardless of whether such a right\nis guaranteed under the Constitution … [the] extent to which we should adopt\nsuch jurisprudence, ie, the circumstances under which the law of confidence\nwould extend its protection to private information acquired without consent”\ngave rise to serious questions to be tried. The Court of Appeal concluded by\ncautioning that it was “by no means endorsing or encouraging, the identification\nof a right to protection of private information under our law of confidence”:\nANB v. ANC at [23].\n38\n\nThis right to prevent misuse of private communication and\n\ninformational privacy often – but not necessarily always – coexist. Private\ncommunications that interlocutors are keen to prevent misuse of often contain\ninformation that is personal or intimate, and frequently personal information of\na biographical nature. A couple of observations may be made. First, the right to\nprevent the misuse of private information seeks to prohibit the publication of\ninformation that was meant to be private. The PDPA prevents, in this context,\ndisclosure of personal data without authority. The range of communications\nthat the common law right protects is broader, as it extends beyond personal\ninformation to communications content. For example, an intimate conversation\nwithin the confines of a taxicab may not contain any personal information. The\nright to prevent its publication lies with the common law right to prevent\npublication of private information, not with the PDPA. Also, a document that\ncontains personal information incidentally (eg names and contact details in a\nletter or email) may not be one that the Commissioner will consider exercising\nenforcement jurisdiction over: see discussion above, at [15] et seq, on whether\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nthe document conveys personal information or the information is biographically\nsignificant.\n39\n\nSecond, the common law right will protect private information in the\n\nnature of personal data from publication even if the information is publicly\navailable. Thus, the taking of a photograph in a public space may be an\ninfringement of privacy, if it intrudes into the individual’s personal space: per\nLord Hoffman in Campbell at [75], “the widespread publication of a\nphotograph of someone which reveals him to be in a situation of humiliation or\nsevere embarrassment, even if taken in a public place, may be an infringement\nof the privacy of his personal information”. The taking of a photograph in a\npublic place would attract the “publicly available exception”3 in the PDPA,\nwhich obviates the need to obtain consent and provide notification: see\nexamples in the Key Concepts Guidelines at [12.63]. Although consent and\nnotification are not required, section 18(a) of the PDPA may still operate to limit\nthe collection, use or disclosure of such personal data to appropriate purposes.\nIn determining the appropriateness of any particular purpose, considerations of\nthe data subject’s objective expectation of privacy may conceivably be\nentertained. In this manner, the PDPA may provide similar protection to\npublicly available personal data as the common law. Personal data that was\npublicly available at the time it was collected can continue to be used or\ndisclosed without the need for consent, even if the personal data is subsequently\ntaken offline: see Key Concepts Guidelines at [12.61].\n40\n\nIt may therefore be said that an interlocutor who wishes to prevent\n\nmisuse of his private communication should look towards the new tort\n\n3\n\nAs found in paragraphs 1(c) of the Second Schedule, 1(c) of the Third Schedule, and 1(d) of the\nFourth Schedule to the PDPA.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nestablished in Campbell and Douglas, with an eye on the PDPA where the\nprivate information is in the nature of personal data. The same observations\nmade in respect of the right to prevent intrusion upon seclusion may be\nreiterated here: a private claimant prosecuting his case in the civil courts can\nplead both the common law tort to prevent publication of private information as\nwell as pursue a private claim based on breaches of the PDPA. This not only\nprovides him with a potentially more comprehensive set of reliefs, but will also\nprovide the courts with the opportunity to consider adopting into our case law\nthe same common law right in Campbell and Douglas. The Commissioner does\nnot have the vires to extend its jurisdiction in these directions when\ninvestigating into a complaint.\nPersonality rights\n41\n\nI deal with the final two of Prosser’s categories collectively, as both\n\nrelate to the protection of one’s personality from misuse or abuse.\nRight to prevent appropriation of identity (personality and publicity rights)\n42\n\nThe right of publicity is the right of an individual to control the\n\ncommercial exploitation of an individual’s fame or identity: see David Tan,\nImage Rights and Data Protection, NUS Law Working Paper Series 2017/010\n(“David Tan, Image Rights and Data Protection”) at p. 4. This extends to his\nname, image, voice, signature, or any other distinguishing characteristic which\nidentifies him, and as such are considered personal data. Unsurprisingly, the\nKey Concepts Guidelines at [5.10], similarly lists data that on its own can\nidentify an individual as “unique identifiers”: eg full name, facial image and\nvoice of an individual. Needless to say, there must be commercial value in these\ncharacteristics in order for the right to publicity to provide a remedy for financial\nloss suffered as a result of unauthorised use: see the exposition of the law in the\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nUnited States in relation to publicity rights in Tugendhat and Christie, The Law\nof Privacy and the Media, 2nd ed. by Mark Warby QC, Nicole Moreham & Iain\nChristie, eds., (Oxford: OUP, 2011) at [3.110] – [3.114].\n43\n\nThe right of publicity may be protected under intellectual property law,\n\nspecifically, the law of passing off. Individuals may bring a cause of action\nunder the tort of passing off to prevent false and unauthorised celebrity\nendorsements of goods and services. In the case of Irvine v. Talksport Ltd [2002]\n1 WLR 2355 (“Irvine”), the English High Court acknowledged the expansion\nof the law of passing off to include cases of false endorsement. Insofar as an\nindividual acquires a valuable reputation or goodwill, the law of passing off will\nprotect it from unlicensed use by other parties. However, the claimant must be\nable to prove two interrelated facts: (i) at the material time, the claimant had\nsignificant reputation or goodwill, and (ii) the actions of the defendant gave rise\nto a false message which would be understood by a not insignificant section of\nhis market that his goods have been endorsed, recommended or approved of by\nthe claimant: Irvine at [46].\n44\n\nGiven that there is a right of private action under the PDPA, it has been\n\ncommented that the PDPA confers an “incidental personality right” on the\nindividual, similar to the right of publicity: David Tan, Image Rights and Data\nProtection at p. 1. Whether the PDPA effectively creates a right of publicity\nregime in Singapore is open to debate. This and other pertinent issues are\ndetailed in two articles and I can do no better than to refer the interested student\nto these commentaries: (a) David Tan, Image Rights and Data Protection; and\n(b) Gilbert Leong, Foo Maw Juin & Kenneth Fok, “Protecting the Right of\nPublicity under the PDPA” [2017] PDP Digest 293 (“Gilbert Leong et al.,\nProtecting the Right of Publicity under the PDPA”).\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nRight to prevent false publicity (defamation and malicious falsehood)\n45\n\nThe tort of false light publicity has been described as protecting interests\n\nsimilar to reputation, whilst having the same overtones of mental distress as in\ndefamation: Prosser, Privacy at p. 400. At the heart of this false light tort is the\nneed to protect the reputation of the person. Reputation is protected by English\nlaw in a number of ways, including malicious falsehood, passing off, and\ndefamation. In Tolley v. JS Fry & Sons Ltd [1931] AC 333 (“Tolley”), an\namateur golfer, who was depicted without his knowledge or consent in a\nnewspaper advertisement for a Fry’s chocolate bar, sued in defamation arguing\nthat the advertisement implied that he had compromised his reputation and\nstatus as an amateur golfer. Ultimately the House of Lords held in favour of the\namateur golfer for defamation.\n46\n\nIn Singapore, there has not been any express recognition of a tort of false\n\nlight publicity, nor any indication that the PDPA was formulated to encompass\nsuch a tort. If the case of Chiam See Tong v. Xin Zhang Jiang Restaurant Pte\nLtd [1995] 1 SLR(R) 856 (“Chiam See Tong”) is taken to set any precedent, it\nwould be that any such rights are likely to be found in the areas of the law of\ndefamation. In Chiam See Tong, the plaintiff successfully sued in defamation\nfor damages and an injunction when a photograph taken of him at a restaurant\nfor a charity fund raiser was subsequently used by the defendant as\nadvertisements. It was held that to the ordinary reader, the photograph suggested\nthat the plaintiff had consented to publicise the restaurant4.\n\n4\n\nIf Irvine is followed in Singapore, a plaintiff in a similar case in Singapore may be able to sue\nboth under the tort of defamation and passing off.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n47\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nRecently, the English Court of Appeal in Prince Moulay Hicham Ben\n\nAbdullah Al Alaoui of Morocco v. Elaph Publishing Ltd [2017] 4 WLR 28 held\nthat a data protection claim could be linked to a defamation claim for the reason\nthat they were different causes of action which were directed to protecting\ndifferent aspects of the right to private life, and the relevant provisions of the\nUK Data Protection Act 1998 included the aim of protection from being\nsubjected unfairly and unlawfully to distress: at [43]. It would be too much of\nan extrapolation to read into this case – which was essentially an interlocutory\nappeal dealing with the issue of whether amendments to pleadings ought to be\npermitted – anything beyond the proposition that these are parallel remedies\nwhich the plaintiff may legitimately pursue.\n48\n\nIt is in the area of personality rights that the area of overlap between the\n\nPDPA and common law rights is the greatest, since both operate on information\nthat is essentially personal data. This is also the area where the contours between\nany common law right – this area of law is more developed in the United States\nthan in the rest of the common law world – and statutory rights under the PDPA\nhave yet to come under judicial scrutiny in Singapore. Based on the available\ncommentary, the following observations may be made.\n49\n\nIt has been observed that an individual may not have recourse under the\n\nPDPA, if the personal data is found in a publicly available space, even where\nan individual’s fame has been commercially exploited: see David Tan, Image\nRights and Data Protection at p. 15, and Gilbert Leong et al., Protecting the\nRight of Publicity under the PDPA at p. 297. It has also been pointed out that\nthe definition of “personal data” does not adequately deal with the “associative\nvalue” that celebrities bring to products and services: David Tan, Image Rights\nand Data Protection at p. 4. Consequently, one may draw the conclusion that\nprivate action under the PDPA will probably have limited chance of\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nsuccessfully preventing the classical scenario in which celebrities seek to\nprevent misuse or abuse of their personality when their identity is taken from a\npublicly available source: see Tolley and Chiam See Tong.\n50\n\nPrivate individuals are likely to have more success in relying on the\n\nPDPA to prevent misuse or abuse of their identity on the basis of use or\ndisclosure without consent. But these are not what the cases on publicity rights\nthus far deal with. Perhaps the PDPA and the right of publicity are means to\ndifferent ends – while the right of publicity seeks to protect the commercial\nvalue of the name or image of the individual, the PDPA seeks to hold\norganisations accountable for the proper and respectful handling of personal\ndata, by imposing a standard of conduct that permits reasonable use, processing\nor disclosure while preventing misuse or abuse of personal data. This distinction\nmay, in future, guide the Commissioner’s exercise of discretion when\nconsidering whether to commence investigations into complaints with\npersonality rights undertones.\n51\n\nTo be clear, while I have mentioned some causes of action above which\n\nmay not as yet be recognised by the Singapore courts, I would exercise my\ndiscretion under section 50(3) to suspend, discontinue or refuse to conduct\ninvestigations where I believe there is a more appropriate cause of action which\nis recognised under Singapore law. But it is necessary to emphasise that our\nlaws provide existing options to protect the privacy of an individual and this is\nan area that is expected to evolve. The PDPA deals with informational privacy\nand it would be a mistake to distort it in order to address privacy issues that it\nwas not meant to address. Maintaining a macro perspective is necessary for the\nlaw in this area to develop.\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nThe Commissioner’s exercise of discretionary investigative powers in this\ncase\n52\n\nIt is against this backdrop of common law and statutory torts that\n\ncollectively protect privacy rights that I explain the exercise of my discretion in\nthis case.\nI.\n\nThe Commissioner’s discretionary investigative powers\n\n53\n\nSection 50 of the PDPA provides me with the powers of investigation to\n\ndetermine whether an organisation is in breach of the PDPA. The powers of\ninvestigations are spelt out in the Ninth Schedule to the PDPA. Section 50(3)\nprovides me a discretionary power to suspend, discontinue or refuse to conduct\nan investigation under specific circumstances. The relevant circumstance in this\ncase is:\n(e) the Commission is of the opinion that -(i) a complaint is frivolous or vexatious or is not made in good\nfaith; or\n(ii) any other circumstances warrant refusing to conduct,\nsuspending or discontinuing the investigation.\n\n54\n\nIn this case, the Complainant and the Organisation were engaged in civil\n\nproceedings before the District Courts. I understand that those proceedings have\nnow been settled. The prime consideration is whether the subject matter of the\npresent Complaint is better resolved through the judicial process or by an\ninvestigation into alleged breaches of the PDPA.\nII.\n\nAction founded in the other areas of privacy\n\n55\n\nHaving considered the complaint, I came to the view that the true nature\n\nof the Complainant’s claim is for protection of his privacy which extends\nbeyond protection of his personal data (which in the Complaint to the\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\nCommission involves no more than the disclosure of his name), and thus this is\nnot the appropriate office to investigate his claims. This is where the foregoing\n(somewhat lengthy) discussions about the interaction of the law on data\nprotection and privacy becomes relevant.\n56\n\nThis Complaint is the third complaint made by Complainant against the\n\nOrganisation. The alleged infringement concerns the posting of a police report\nmade by a member of the Organisation’s staff containing the Complainant’s\nname on Facebook, effectively suggesting that the Complainant was the culprit\nwho carried out the online attacks and harassing acts. The Complainant is\nessentially alleging in this complaint that his reputation is affected by the\nFacebook post, because the disclosure of his name in the police report is akin to\nan accusation by the Organisation that the Complainant had been harassing the\nvictim. All this takes place against the backdrop of a civil dispute between the\nComplainant and Organisation.\n57\n\nThe immediate complaint raises issues relating to false light publicity\n\nthat (as discussed above) lies within the domain of the law of defamation, which\nseems to be the branch of common law that is most appropriate for the\ndevelopment of rights to prevent false light publicity. The personal data that is\ndisclosed is the Complainant’s name. The rest of the police report details\nconduct that is attributed to him which may be of biographical significance.\n58\n\nWhile it is possible for me to investigate into whether the circumstances\n\nleading to the disclosure of the police report involved unreasonable conduct on\nthe part of the Organisation, it is these same considerations that led me to\nconclude that addressing this one question would not be the most effective\nmeans of settling the dispute between the Complainant and the Organisation. As\nexplained in M Star Movers, an organisation cannot be prevented from\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\ndefending itself on the same public forum that a complainant chooses to\nventilate any dissatisfaction he may have against it. Disclosure of personal data\nmay sometimes be necessary; and it is only when disclosure is a\ndisproportionate response on the part of the organisation that the matter will be\ninvestigated under the PDPA. In order to determine whether to commence\ninvestigations, it becomes necessary to consider the allegations flowing between\nthe complainant and the organisation, as well as the history of dissatisfaction\nbetween them. Given the history between the Complainant and the\nOrganisation, resolving the dispute over the publication of the police report on\nFacebook is unlikely to settle the underlying dispute between them.\n59\n\nIn the final analysis, the history of exchanges between the Complainant,\n\nthe Sole Director and the Organisation disclose issues that can be better\naddressed before the courts. The legal issues that are potentially raised touch on\nthe Complainant’s expectations of privacy which, from our foregoing\ndiscussion, is protected by a framework of common law and statutory torts. I\nam unable to venture beyond the boundaries of the PDPA; the courts face no\nsuch constraint. The crux of the Complaint is that of publication of alleged\ndefamatory remarks in a police report. A resolution of the underlying dispute\nrelies on the framework of laws protecting privacy rights rather than the manner\nin which personal data is managed by the Organisation. Therefore, I did not\nthink that this case was suitable for investigations under the PDPA and\nexercised my discretion under section 50(3)(e)(ii) of the PDPA to discontinue\ninvestigations.\n60\n\nThe true nature of the Complaint revolves around the dispute between\n\nthe Complainant and the Organisation over the Complainant’s alleged online\nattacks and harassing acts. From the foregoing survey of our privacy laws, this\nis not an area that is exclusively within the domain of the PDPA. The POHA is\n\n\fMy Digital Lock Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [3]\n\npotentially relevant at least as an existing statutory tort; much more the potential\nof a common law right to privacy as in C v. Holland or Jones v. Tsige.\n61\n\nIndeed, it is specifically this category of cases that the PDPA was not\n\nmeant to cover. In the parliamentary debates leading to the enactment of the\nPDPA, it was mentioned by Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Information,\nCommunications and the Arts (as he then was) that “[o]n Mr Zaqy Mohamad’s\nsuggestion to cover cyber-bullying and other undesirable online behaviour, the\nBill is concerned with regulating the management and the protection of\npersonal data. It does not govern other actions of individuals online. This would\nbe more appropriately addressed by others laws.” (emphasis added.) (Sing.,\nParliamentary Debates, vol. 89 (15 October 2012) (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob\nIbrahim) at p. 41). I can do no better than to echo the Minister’s statement. I do\nnot think that the answer lies within the PDPA. On the precedent established in\nBenber Dayao Yu v. Jacter Singh, the answer today lies in sections 3 and 4 of\nthe POHA: see [32] above.\n62\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, I decided to exercise my\n\ndiscretion under section 50(3) of the PDPA to discontinue investigations into\nthis Complaint and issue an advisory notice to the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER FOR\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Advisory Notice"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Jiwon Hair Salon, Next@Ion, Next Hairdressing and Initia for failing to put in place data protection policies to comply with the provisions of the PDPA.","tags":["Accountability","Directions","Others"],"date":"2018-01-23","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GroundsofDecisionJiwonNextIonNextHairdressingInitia23012018.pdf","nature":"Accountability","title":"Breach of Openness Obligation by 4 Hair Salons","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2018/01/breach-of-openness-obligation-by-4-hair-salons","timestamp":"2018-01-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCase No DP-1612-B0431\n\n[2018] SGPDPC [2]\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\nAnd\n1.\n\nJiwon Hair Salon Pte.

Jiwon alleged that a former\nemployee (“Employee K”) had misappropriated the names and contact\n\nnumbers (collectively referred to as the “Personal Data”) of its customers by\nsurreptitiously accessing its customer management system (“CMS”).\n3\n\nAn investigation was conducted into Jiwon’s complaint and into the\n\nfollowing Organisations which Employee K had worked at after leaving Jiwon\n\nto determine if indeed Employee K was using the Personal Data from Jiwon’s\nCMS:\n\n\fJiwon Hair Salon Pte.

The facts disclose a\nstraightforward breach of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”), and\nthe Respondent does not deny committing the infringing acts. The\nCommissioner has accordingly found the Respondent in breach of sections 13\nand 20 of the PDPA.\n2\n\nThe Commissioner’s findings and grounds of decision are set out below.\n\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Respondent was employed as a telemarketer from 2004 to 2014.\n\nSometime in 2012, the Respondent started purchasing ‘leads’ to expand the\nreach of her marketing in order to hit her sales targets. These ‘leads’ typically\ncomprised an individual’s name, NRIC number, mobile number and annual\nincome range. A lead would typically cost between $0.20 and $0.30.\n4\n\nThe Respondent bought the leads from unknown online sellers and did\n\nnot retain the details of these transactions. Also, the Respondent did not check\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nor verify with the sellers that the leads she purchased were obtained legitimately\nwith the individuals’ consent.\n5\n\nOn average, the Respondent would buy approximately 10,000 leads per\n\nyear. According to the Respondent, her first purchase of leads was sometime in\nlate 2012 and her last purchase was sometime in either May or June 2014. At\nthe material time, the Respondent had in her possession approximately 30,990\nleads. The leads were stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.\n6\n\nFrom late 2012 up until 23 February 2017, the Respondent estimated\n\nthat she had re-sold the leads she had bought about 9 to 10 times, typically\ncharging customers between $0.05 to $0.20 per lead, depending on the number\nthey purchased. The Respondent would advertise the sale of the leads on various\nwebsites, and customers who wished to buy the leads would make payment to\nthe Respondent via a bank transfer. While conducting these transactions, the\nRespondent concealed her true identity by using an alias (with a corresponding\nemail address), her husband’s bank account number, and a mobile phone\nnumber registered under her friend’s name. The Respondent estimated she had\nmade a profit of $5,000 from selling these leads. The Respondent explained that\nshe had decided to re-sell the leads as a side-line to supplement her income.\nDuring this period of time, the Respondent was concurrently holding a job as a\ntelemarketer and engaging in an apparel business.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n7\n\nThe following two main issues were canvassed from the facts for the\n\nCommissioner’s determination:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Respondent was an “organisation” subject to the\n\nData Protection Provisions of the PDPA; and\n\n2\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n(b)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nwhether the Respondent’s sale and purchase of leads complied\n\nwith the Consent and Notification Obligations under the PDPA.\n8\n\nAs a preliminary point, it was not disputed that the 30,990 leads in the\n\nRespondent’s possession, each of which comprised an individual’s name, NRIC\nnumber, mobile number and annual income range, fell within the definition of\n“personal data” under section 2(1) of the PDPA as it was clearly possible to\nidentify an individual from that data.\n(a)\nWhether the Respondent was an “organisation” subject to the Data\nProtection Provisions of the PDPA\n9\n\nThe Commissioner first determined whether the Respondent was acting\n\nas an “organisation” for the purposes of the PDPA. This is a pertinent issue in\nthis case, because the Respondent is an individual, and the Data Protection\nProvisions1 are only applicable to an “organisation” under the PDPA. Although\nthe PDPA defines “organisation” broadly to include individuals,2 an individual\nis expressly excluded from the Data Protection Provisions in the PDPA if the\nindividual was acting in a personal or domestic capacity.3 Therefore, when it\ncomes to the application of the PDPA to individuals, it is usually germane to the\nissue to determine whether the individual was acting in a personal or domestic\ncapacity. If the individual was not acting in a personal or domestic capacity,\nthen she will be treated as an “organisation” for the purposes of the PDPA, and\nobliged to comply with the Data Protection Provisions.\n\n1\n\nAs borne out by Parts III to VI of the PDPA.\n\n2\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\nUnder section 4(1)(a) of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n10\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nOn the facts, the Respondent was clearly not acting in a personal or\n\ndomestic capacity in respect of the buying and selling of leads. The purchase\nand sales of the leads were not for her own personal use or purposes, but in order\nto make a profit. Under the PDPA, “business” includes an activity of any\norganisation, whether or not carried on for purposes of gain, or conducted on a\nregular, repetitive or continuous basis, but does not include an individual acting\nin his personal or domestic capacity. In this regard, the converse of a person\nacting in a personal or domestic capacity is one that acts in a business capacity.\nThis was the case for the Respondent in respect of the purchase and sale of leads.\n11\n\nIn earlier cases, the Commissioner had also found individuals, namely,\n\na registered salesperson4 and a financial consultant5, to come within the\ndefinition of an “organisation” under the PDPA. In those cases, the individuals\nhad been carrying out data processing activities for work or business purposes,\nand were thus not acting in a personal or domestic capacity.\n12\n\nGiven the above, the Respondent is as an “organisation” for the purposes\n\nof the PDPA, and subject to the Data Protection Provisions.\n(b)\nWhether the Respondent’s sale and purchase of leads complied with\nthe Consent and Notification Obligations under the PDPA\n(i) The Respondent’s buying and selling of leads were activities that fell under\nthe scope of the PDPA\n13\n\nThe PDPA governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal data\n\nby organisations. Given that the leads which the Respondent had purchased or\n\n4\n\nRe Chua Yong Boon Justin [2016] SGPDPC 13.\n\n5\n\nRe Ang Rui Song [2017] SGPDPC 13.\n\n4\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nsold comprised of personal data of individuals, these were activities that fell\nunder the scope of the PDPA. In respect of the purchase of leads by the\nRespondent, in which the Respondent acquired personal data from the seller of\nthe transaction, this amounted to a “collection” of personal data under the PDPA\nby the Respondent. In respect of the sale of leads by the Respondent, in which\nthe Respondent provided personal data to the buyer of the transaction, this\namounted to a “disclosure” of personal data under the PDPA by the Respondent.\n14\n\nThe relevant obligations under the PDPA that apply to the facts of this\n\ncase are the Consent and Notification Obligations. The Notification Obligation\nrequires an organisation to inform individuals of the purposes for the collection,\nuse and disclosure of personal data, while the Consent Obligation requires the\norganisation to obtain consent from the individual for such purposes of the\ncollection, use and disclosure. The appropriate provisions of the Notification\nand Consent Obligations are found in the Data Protection Provisions of the\nPDPA at sections 13 to 15 and 20 respectively.\n(ii) The Respondent was not subject to the Data Protection Provisions in\nrespect of the purchase and sale of personal data before the Appointed Day\n15\n\nAccording to the Respondent, she was first involved in the buying and\n\nselling of leads since 2012 to support her work as a telemarketer.\n16\n\nHowever, the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA only came into\n\neffect on 2 July 2014 (the “Appointed Day”). This means that during the period\nbefore the Appointed Day, the Respondent was not subject to or required to\ncomply with the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA in respect of the\ncollection, use and disclosure of the personal data found in the database of leads.\n\n5\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n17\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nNotwithstanding, after the Appointed Day when the Data Protection\n\nProvisions came into force, the Respondent was subject to the obligations under\nthe Data Protection Provisions in respect of both the existing personal data held\nin the Respondent’s possession or control, and any new personal data that the\nRespondent may come into possession or control with. The Respondent was\ntherefore obliged to take steps to comply with the Data Protection Provisions in\nrespect of both these sets of data. This includes obtaining consent from the\nindividuals for the use of the personal data for a new purpose, which the\nindividuals had previously not consented to, as it falls outside the purposes for\nwhich the personal data was originally collected under section 19 of the PDPA\n(as will be elaborated on below).\n18\n\nThis was a position that was taken in Re Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017]\n\nSGPDPC 17. In that case, Social Metric had processed personal data for its\nclients’ social marketing campaigns all the way back before the Appointed Day.\nThe Commissioner took the position that before the Appointed Day, Social\nMetric was not required to put in place reasonable security arrangements under\nsection 24 of the PDPA to protect the personal data in its possession or under\nits control. However, when the Data Protection Provisions came into force after\nthe Appointed Day, Social Metric needed to put in place such security\narrangements to protect both the existing and new personal data.\n(iii) Grandfathering provision may apply to the continued use but not sale of\npersonal data\n19\n\nAs the Respondent had been purchasing and selling personal data since\n\n2012, and before the Appointed Day, the question is whether the Respondent\ncan rely on the “grandfathering” provision under section 19 of the PDPA to\ncontinue to use or sell (ie disclose) such personal data to third parties after the\nAppointed Day. It should be noted that Respondent cannot continue to purchase\n6\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nor collect personal data after the Appointed Day, as the Data Protection\nProvisions would have kicked in on the Appointed Day, and would require the\nRespondent to provide notification to, and obtain consent from, the individuals\npursuant to the Consent and Notification Obligations (unless an exception\napplies).\n20\n\nThe grandfathering provision provides that organisations may continue\n\nto use personal data that they have collected before the Appointed Day, for the\npurposes for which the personal data was collected, unless consent is withdrawn\nor the individual gives an indication that there is no such consent.\n21\n\nIn respect of the personal data that was purchased or obtained before the\n\nAppointed Day, it may be possible for an organisation to continue using the\npersonal data if such use falls within the purposes of collection, such as for its\nown reasonable use (ie telemarketing purposes), provided that there was no\nindication that the individual did not consent to the continued use. This is a\nposition that the PDPC articulated in its Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts\nin the PDPA (“Advisory Guidelines”), of which an extract of the relevant parts\nis set out below:6\nThe effect of section 19 is that organisations can continue to\nuse personal data collected before the appointed day for the\nsame purposes for which the personal data was collected\nwithout obtaining fresh consent, unless the individual has\nwithdrawn consent (whether before on, or after the appointed\nday). Organisations should note that section 19 only applies to\n‘reasonable existing uses’ of personal data collected before the\nappointed day.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the purpose of telemarketing (i.e.\nsending a specified message to a Singapore telephone number)\ncould be a reasonable existing use.\n\n6\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) at\n[23.3]-[23.4].\n\n7\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n22\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nHowever, in this case, the Respondent went beyond using the personal\n\ndata for her own telemarketing purposes, and proceeded to sell personal data to\nthird parties. The “grandfathering” provision only permits the continued “use”\nof personal data for the purposes for which the personal data was collected. Such\n“use” does not extend to “disclosure” of personal data unless, as set out at\nparagraph 23.1 of the Advisory Guidelines, the disclosure “is necessarily part\nof the organisation’s use of such personal data”. In the case of the sale of\npersonal data, the disclosure of personal data is the main activity being carried\nout, and is not incidental to any of the organisation’s own uses of the personal\ndata. Thus, it is not a disclosure “that is necessarily part of the organisation’s\nuse of such personal data”. The PDPC has stated this position in its Advisory\nGuidelines as an example:7\nOrganisation XYZ has been selling databases containing\npersonal data. This would be considered a disclosure of\npersonal data and not a reasonable existing use under section\n19. After the appointed day, XYZ needs to ensure that consent\nhas been obtained before selling these databases again.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n23\n\nConsequently, the grandfathering provision would not apply to the\n\ninstances where the Respondent had been selling personal data before the\nAppointed Day, and continued to sell personal data after the Appointed Day. In\nrespect of personal data that was not sold before the Appointed Day, it is all the\nmore so that the Respondent cannot rely on the grandfathering provision,\nbecause there was never an existing practice of selling the personal data in the\nfirst place, and hence there is no “use” to be carried on in respect of the personal\ndata.\n\n7\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) at\n[23.6].\n\n8\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\n(iv) The Respondent’s sale of leads comprising of personal data after\nAppointed Day was a serious contravention of the PDPA\n24\n\nDuring the investigations, the Commissioner found no evidence that the\n\nRespondent had continued to purchase leads from the online sources after the\nAppointed Day. However, there was clear evidence that the Respondent was\nstill selling leads after the Appointed Day. In respect of the Respondent’s sale\nof such leads, the Commissioner finds that there was a clear breach of the\nConsent and Notification Obligations under the PDPA.\n25\n\nWhen questioned about the sale of personal data, the Respondent\n\nadmitted that she did not obtain consent from the individuals for the sale of their\npersonal data to third parties. The Respondent also admitted that she did not\ncheck or verify with the online sellers if they had obtained consent from the\nindividuals to the selling of their personal data. Similarly, the Respondent had\nalso admitted that she did not provide any notification to the individuals of the\nsale of their personal data. The Commissioner also carried out further\ninvestigations and separately contacted several individuals whose personal data\nwere found in the database of leads, and all of them confirmed that they had not\nconsented to their personal data to be disclosed or sold.\n26\n\nAccordingly, on the evidence that the individuals had not been informed\n\nof the sale of their personal data nor did they provide consent to the sale of their\npersonal data, the Respondent is in breach of both the Consent and Notification\nObligations under the PDPA.\n27\n\nThe sale of personal data in contravention of the PDPA is a serious\n\nbreach of the PDPA. In the UK, data selling is expressly prohibited by\nlegislation. Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) provides that\nit is an offence for any person who (a) knowingly or recklessly, without the\n\n9\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nconsent of the data controller, obtains or discloses personal data or procures\nsuch disclosure, or (b) sells or offers to sell the personal data so obtained.\nSpecifically, section 55(6) of the DPA clarifies that “an advertisement\nindicating that personal data are or may be for sale is an offer to sell the\npersonal data”.8 In this regard, both the advertisement of the sale of personal\ndata, and the actual sale of personal data carried out, would constitute an offence\nunder the DPA.\n28\n\nThe UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) has recently\n\nfound a data broker to be in breached of the DPA for obtaining customer data\nfrom various sources and selling the data to third party organisations for the\npurposes of direct marketing. The individuals whose data was traded by the data\nbroker were not informed that their personal data would be disclosed to the data\nbroker, or the organisations to which the data broker sold the data on to, for the\npurpose of sending direct marketing text messages. In total, the ICO found that\nthere were 580,302 records containing personal data that were disclosed without\nthe data subjects’ knowledge or consent.9 In terms of the harm, the ICO stated\nthat “the unlawful trade in personal data [led] directly to the wholescale\nsending of unsolicited direct marketing texts and the making of nuisance calls”,\nand was satisfied that the “cumulative amount of distress suffered by the large\nnumbers of individuals affected, coupled with the distress suffered by some\n\n8\n\nUK,\nData\nProtection\nAct\n<https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/55>.\n\n9\n\nUK, ICO, Monetary Penalty Notice: The Data Supply Company Ltd (27 January 2017)\n<https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/the-data-supply-company-ltd/> at\n[26], [29].\n\n10\n\n1998\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nindividuals, means that overall the level was substantial”.10 As such, the data\nbroker was found to be in breach of the DPA and was issued a monetary penalty\nof £20,000.\n29\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal\n\nData (“PCPD”) found that the Octopus group of companies (“Octopus\nGroup”), which provides an extensive smartcard payment system for transport\nand other services, had contravened the requirements of the Personal Data\n(Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) by entering into contracts with several business\npartners to sell its members’ personal data without their consent.11 In that case,\nthe Octopus Group had failed to inform individuals registering for its rewards\nprogramme that one of the purposes was the sale of their personal data for\nmonetary gain. This purpose was neither expressly stated in the terms and\nconditions on the member’s registration form, nor could it be said to be a\npurpose of use within the reasonable expectation of the individuals.12 In this\nregard, despite providing their signature on the registration form, the individuals\ncould not be said to have consented to the data selling. It should be noted that\nthe Hong Kong case had a widespread impact, eventually becoming the catalyst\nfor amendments to the data protection law in Hong Kong.\n\n10\n\nUK, ICO, Monetary Penalty Notice: The Data Supply Company Ltd (27 January 2017)\n<https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/the-data-supply-company-ltd/> at\n[32]-[34].\n\n11\n\nH.K., PCPD, The Collection and Use of Personal Data of Members under the Octopus\nRewards Programme run by Octopus Rewards Limited, Report Number R10-9866\n<https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/enforcement/commissioners_findings/investigatio\nn_reports/files/R10_9866_e.pdf>.\n\n12\n\nIbid.at [3.36] and [3.40].\n\n11\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n30\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nThe Commissioner likewise takes a serious view of such breaches under\n\nthe PDPA. There are strong policy reasons for taking a hard stance against the\nunauthorised sale of personal data. Amongst these policy reasons are the need\nto protect the interests of the individual and safeguard against any harm to the\nindividual, such as identity theft or nuisance calls. Additionally, there is a need\nto prevent abuse by organisations in profiting from the sale of the individual’s\npersonal data at the individual’s expense. It is indeed such cases of potential\nmisuse or abuse by organisations of the individual’s personal data which the\nPDPA seeks to safeguard against.13 In this regard, the Commissioner is prepared\nto take such stern action against organisations for the unauthorised sale of\npersonal data.\nEnforcement Action\n31\n\nGiven that the Commissioner has found the Respondent to be in breach\n\nof sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under\nsection 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it deems fit\nto ensure the Respondent’s compliance with the PDPA. This may include\ndirecting the Respondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not\nexceeding S$1 million as the Commissioner thinks fit.\n32\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed to\n\nthe Respondent, the Commissioner took into account the following aggravating\nfactors:\n\n13\n\nSing., Parliamentary Debates, vol. 89 (15 October 2012) (Assoc Prof Dr Yaacob\nIbrahim) at p. 1: “The personal data protection law will safeguard individuals’\npersonal data against misuse by regulating the proper management of personal data”.\n\n12\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n(a)\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nthe database of leads included personal data of a sensitive nature,\n\ni.e. NRIC numbers and salary ranges of individuals;\n(b)\n\nthe Respondent had used means to obscure her identity when she\n\nwas selling the leads, which is indicative of a guilty conscience and of a\npremeditated and deliberate contravention of the PDPA; and\n(c)\n\nas elaborated above at paragraph 30, the profiteering from the\n\nsales of personal data by organisations at the expense of consumer or\nindividuals is the very kind of activity which the PDPA seeks to curb,\nand hence, must be severely dealt with.\n33\n\nIn relation to the mitigating factors of this case, the Commissioner took\n\ninto account the fact that the Respondent had candidly admitted to the\nwrongdoing at the first instance, and co-operated fully with investigations.\nAdditionally, the Respondent was fully cooperative with the Commissioner’s\ninvestigations and was helpful in providing evidence of the matter.\n34\n\nCrucially, the Commissioner also considered the special financial\n\ncircumstances of the Respondent in determining a suitable amount of financial\npenalty to impose on the Respondent. During the course of investigation, the\nCommissioner learnt that the Respondent and her husband were of limited\nfinancial means and were earning modest salaries, and had a child and family\nto support. In the Commission’s assessment, imposing a high financial penalty\non the Respondent would likely place a crushing burden on the Respondent and\nher family in the circumstances and cause undue hardship.\n35\n\nFrom the evidence, the cumulative amount of payment received by the\n\nRespondent from the sale of the leads was unlikely to exceed $5,000, and this\nwas based on a conservative estimate. In addition, the investigation showed that\n\n13\n\n\fSharon Assya Qadriyah Tang\n\n[2018] SGPDPC 1\n\nthe Respondent was not carrying out the sale and purchase of personal data on\na large-scale basis, but was simply conducting these activities opportunistically\nand on the side to supplement her income.\n36\n\nAccordingly, taking into account all relevant factors of this case, and\n\ngiven the special financial circumstances that the Respondent is in, the\nCommissioner has decided to adjust the amount of financial penalty to an\namount which would adequately reflect the seriousness of the breach of the\nPDPA, but at the same time not impose a crushing burden on the Respondent or\nher family.\n37\n\nAlthough the Commissioner has imposed a lower financial penalty in\n\nthis case, this is exceptional and should not be taken as setting any precedent\nfor the extension of the same leniency or indulgences in other cases. The\nCommissioner wishes to remind organisations of their obligations under the\nPDPA and that it takes a serious view towards any unauthorised sale of personal\ndata.\n38\n\nThe Commissioner hereby directs the Respondent to pay a financial\n\npenalty of S$6,000 within 30 days from the date of the Commissioner’s\ndirection.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on ComGateway for not protecting its webpage against URL manipulation, which resulted in unauthorised disclosure of its customers' personal data.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Transport and Storage"],"date":"2017-12-29","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/GroundsofDecisionComGateway291217.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by ComGateway","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/12/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-comgateway","timestamp":"2017-12-29","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\nCase No DP-1611-B0368\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nComGateway (S) Pte.

Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1611-B0368\n29 December 2017\nBackground\n1\n\nOn 29 November 2016, the Complainant, a customer of the\n\nOrganisation, informed the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) that:\n(a)\n\nwhen the Organisation provided a shipping details webpage\n\n(“Shipping Webpage”), it disclosed the Complainant’s personal data\n(in the form of shipping details) to another customer (the “First Data\nBreach”); and\n(b)\n\nthe URL1 of the Shipping Webpage of one customer could be\n\nmanipulated to enable access to shipping details of other customers, by\nchanging the last character (the “Second Data Breach”).\n2\n\nThe shipping details included personal data such as the customer’s\n\nname, contact number and address.\n\n1\n\n<www.comgateway.com/ship_track_detail?shipId=MTYwMTExMQ>.\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n3\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nThe Commissioner ultimately found the Organisation not to be in breach\n\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in respect of the First Data\nBreach, but in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Second Data\nBreach. The Commissioner’s findings are now set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nThe Organisation operates an online portal that provides logistics,\n\nshopping (“buy-for-me”) and shipping services to its customers.\n5\n\nThe Organisation uses an electronic system and application through and\n\non its website (the “Website”) to process, track and manage shipping /\ntransaction orders from its customers.\n6\n\nThe Organisation had been conducting quarterly “Trustwave”\n\nvulnerability scans and annual penetration tests for its external and internal\nnetworks. The vulnerability scans were used to identify and report on network\nsecurity vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cybercriminals. The internal\npenetration test was conducted to evaluate the resiliency of the Organisation’s\nsystems to various attacks launched against internal network resources from the\nperspective of an unauthenticated attack on the internal network. The external\npenetration test was conducted to evaluate the resiliency of the Organisation’s\nsystems and networks to various attacks launched from the Internet. The\nOrganisation had also signed up for a managed firewall application which\nmonitors and protects its networks against attacks and data loss.\n7\n\nAdditionally, as part of its overall information technology (IT) security\n\narrangement, the Organisation also ran automated code checks to detect any\n“OWASP” top 10 application security risks on its Website. The Organisation\n\n2\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nhad last passed all the mentioned scans and tests in 2016 before the occurrence\nof the First and Second Data Breaches.\nIn respect of the First Data Breach\n8\n\nOn 28 November 2016, the Complainant was informed by another\n\ncustomer of the Organisation that when she accessed the Shipping Webpage, it\ndisplayed the Complainant’s name, contact number, address and shipping\ndetails.\n9\n\nThis was the first time that such an error had been reported to the\n\nOrganisation; further, the Organisation was unable to reproduce the error. It had\nsubsequently conducted tests and investigations to determine the cause of the\nFirst Data Breach, but was unable to determine conclusively the root cause\nbecause:\n(a)\n\ntests conducted on the components of the Website responsible\n\nfor generating unique Shipment IDs confirmed that these components\nwere functioning properly and that each shipment / transaction record\nhad been assigned a unique identifier;\n(b)\n\na review of the code used on the Website did not uncover any\n\ncoding issues or deficiencies that could have caused the breach;\n(c)\n\nthere were no known session variable management issues\n\nassociated with the Apache Tomcat software that the Organisation was\nusing;\n(d)\n\na review and analysis of log files relating to the First Data Breach\n\nrevealed that there was no session corruption that could have caused the\nbreach; and\n\n3\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n(e)\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nattempts to reproduce or replicate the breach in the production\n\nenvironment of the Website, e.g. by generating multiple transactions in\nthe same minute, were not successful.\n10\n\nEven though the root cause of the First Data Breach could not be\n\ndetermined, the Organisation has since taken the following remediation steps:\n(a)\n\nremoving all personal data from the Shipping Webpage such that\n\neven if the wrong Shipping Webpage was sent to a customer, no personal\ndata will be included in the shipping details; and\n(b)\n\nimplementing a logging function that creates a log entry\n\nwhenever a session variable mismatch occurred, which would provide\nthe Organisation with diagnostic data.\nIn respect of the Second Data Breach\n11\n\nThe complaint relating to the Second Data Breach is of a different\n\nnature. Unlike the First Data Breach, the Second Data Breach concerns the\nShipping Webpage and how its Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) could be\nmanipulated to enable access to the shipping and personal details of the\nOrganisation’s customers. The URL for the Shipping Webpage is sent by email\nto the Organisation’s customers.\n12\n\nEach of these URLs would take the following form: e.g.\n\n<www.comgateway.com/ship_track_detail?shipId=MTYwMTExMQ>, which\ncomprises the host information (i.e. www.comgateway.com), the path\ninformation (i.e. ship_track_detail?), and most importantly a unique query\nstring that is associated with the particular shipment to which the URL concerns\n(i.e. shipId=MTYwMTExMQ).\n\n4\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n13\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nThe Website allocates a unique Shipment ID for each shipment. The\n\nunique query string of the URL for the Shipping Webpage is formed by\nencoding the Shipment ID in Base64 (a binary to text encoding scheme). In the\nexample above, the query string “MTYwMTExMQ”, is encoded from the\nShipment ID “1601111”.\n14\n\nAs will be explained below, this format of URL string made it possible\n\nfor anyone to gain access to a customer’s Shipping Webpage by taking a URL\nand systematically changing the last character of the URL until, through trial\nand error, a workable link is derived.\n15\n\nAfter receiving notice of the complaint, the Organisation has since\n\naddressed this vulnerability by adding another unique variable to the URL of\nthe Shipping Webpage to prevent manipulation.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nIssues to be determined\n16\n\nThe shipping details that were compromised had comprised of names,\n\ncontact numbers and addresses of individuals. These were “personal data” as\ndefined under the PDPA.\n17\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data\n\nin its possession or under its control by taking reasonable security steps or\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n18\n\nThe issues in the present case are:\n\n5\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte.

This finding\nwas made after the OPC determined that the organisation had numerous\ntechnical safeguards in place at the time of the data breach aimed at\npreventing and detecting breaches, including (i) the use of firewalls, (ii)\nencryption of sensitive information, (iii) separate storage and\nobfuscation of encryption keys, and (iv) multiple intrusion detection\nsystems (through which the breach was detected). The effectiveness of\nthese safeguards was also independently evaluated on a regular basis\nthrough external vulnerability scans and audits.\n\n2\n\nOPC, PIPEDA Report of Findings #2014-004 (23 April 2014)\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigationsinto-businesses/2014/pipeda-2014-004/>.\n\n7\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n(b)\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nIn Sony PlayStation Network / Qriocity: Own Motion\n\nInvestigation Report3, the Office of the Australian Information\nCommissioner (“OAIC”) investigated Sony Computer Entertainment\nAustralia Pty Ltd and its related companies (“Sony”) following reports\nof unauthorised access to personal information of Sony’s customers on\nthe Sony PlayStation / Qriocity Network. Upon investigation, the OAIC\ndetermined that Sony had taken reasonable steps to protect information\non its network at the time of the data breach because Sony had a range\nof security safeguards in place to protect the personal information held,\nincluding (i) physical, network and communication security measures to\nprotect the information collected and stored in the network, (ii)\nencryption of credit card information, and (iii) internal information\ntechnology security standards that are based on the ISO standards for\ninternational information security.\n22\n\nIn the present case and in relation to the First Data Breach, the fact that\n\nthe cause of the data breach could not be established or that it was possibly a\nrare computer glitch did not absolve the Organisation of liability under Section\n24 of the PDPA. The Organisation must show that it had taken reasonable steps\nto protect personal data held in its possession and/or control. In this regard, the\nCommissioner is satisfied that the Organisation had, indeed, made reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect personal data from unauthorised access. By\nvirtue of the Organisation’s IT system undergoing regular and rigorous IT\nsecurity tests and scans on the system as described at paragraphs 6 and 7 above,\nand that the IT system had successfully passed all those tests and scans, this was\n\n3\n\nOAIC, Sony PlayStation Network/Qriocity: Own Motion Investigation Report (29\nSeptember 2011) <https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/commissioner-initiatedinvestigation-reports/sony-playstation-network-qriocity>.\n\n8\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\na sufficient indication that the Organisation’s IT security measures in place were\nadequate. Additionally, in respect of the First Data Breach, there was no\nevidence of any issues with the Website functions or services, which would\naffect the protection of the personal data held on the Website. This case appears\nto have given rise to an anomalous data breach that could not be replicated.\n23\n\nAccordingly, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation has not\n\ncontravened Section 24 of the PDPA in relation to the First Data Breach.\n24\n\nAs mentioned above, the Organisation has since removed all personal\n\ndata from its Shipping Webpages, such that even if the same glitch were to recur,\nthere would not be unauthorised access to personal data. While it is the\nprerogative of the organisation to take such steps, the Commissioner does not\nadvocate the removal of personal data purely as a risk avoidance measure if the\nremoval detracts from the usability of the Organisation’s Website. Such steps\nwould in the Commissioner’s view be excessive and unnecessary, especially if\nthere are other reasonable technical or operational means to achieve the\nobjective of protecting personal data.\nIn respect of the Second Data Breach\n25\n\nIn relation to the Second Data Breach, the Commissioner had found that\n\nthe URL of the Organisation’s Shipping Webpages was susceptible to\nmanipulation.\n26\n\nFrom 2 July 2014 (the Appointed Day when the data protection\n\nobligations of the PDPA came into effect) until the Organisation instituted the\nmeasures described in paragraph 15 above, about 108,085 customers had made\nshipments via the Organisation. In this regard, the security of the personal data\n\n9\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nof those customers (contained in the Shipping Webpages) were vulnerable to\nunauthorised access and could have been compromised.\n27\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 13 above, the URL of the Shipping Webpage\n\nis unique to each customer by virtue of a unique identifier (i.e. the Shipment ID\nencoded in Base64) at the end of the URL string. While seemingly a random\nstring of alphabets (in upper / lowercase), encoding a Shipment ID using Base64\nis not an actual means of encryption. Base64 is a common and simple encoding\nscheme for ensuring that only basic and printable characters are used, and to\navoid reserved characters which may have special meanings. Simply put,\nBase64 is a means of translating the Shipment ID of “1601111” from Arabic\nnumerals, to another language more suitable for use in URLs. Any item encoded\nin Base64 can be easily decoded through publicly available decoding tools.\n28\n\nA person with IT knowledge would be able to recognise that the\n\nShipment ID in the query string was encoded in Base64. Upon decoding the\nquery string, it would also be readily observable or deducible that the Shipment\nID is simply a function of the date of shipment and its sequence. With this\ninformation, one could reverse engineer and generate valid URLs of the\nShipping Webpages of the Organisation’s customers or even run a script to\nharvest personal data from such Shipping Webpages. Even an ordinary user\ncould systematically replace the last character of the URL of a provided\nShipping Webpage to arrive at valid URLs of Shipping Webpages of the\nOrganisation’s customers, which could then be accessed for the shipping details\nand personal data of those customers.\n29\n\nA test conducted on the query string showed that the URL of the\n\nShipping Webpage could be easily manipulated to obtain a valid URL of the\n\n10\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nShipping Webpage of another Shipment ID.4 During the test, it was discovered\nthat by sequentially replacing the last character of the encoded Shipment ID\nfrom A-Z (including both capital and small letters) and 0-9, it was possible to\nderive 3 other valid URLs.\n30\n\nThe Organisation also did not place limits or restrict access to the URLs\n\nso that only a specific customer of the Organisation has access to his own\nshipping details. Anyone could access the URL of a Shipping Webpage and the\npersonal data contained therein without needing to authenticate or to furnish\ninformation to verify the identity of the person that was accessing the URL. This\nallowed for another customer or even an outsider to have access to the\ncustomer’s shipping details.\n31\n\nThe personal data held on the Shipping Webpage was, therefore, not\n\nsecured from unauthorised access online. The ease of manipulation of the URL\nof the Shipping Webpage to derive the URL of other Shipping Webpages, and\nthe absence of any other security or access-control measures to protect the\nShipping Webpages, taken together, meant that personal data on the Shipping\nWebpages could be easily accessed by any person. Such a person could gain\naccess to the personal data held on the Shipping Webpages, whether or not the\nperson was a “motivated intruder” who had sought to gain unauthorised access\nto personal data of other individuals, or a person who had accidentally typed in\nan incorrect query string into the URL address bar.\n\n4\n\nThe vulnerable URL portion, e.g. MTYwMTExMQ, when decoded, is 1601111. This\nstring of numbers consists of the date (yy/mm/dd) and the sequence of the shipment\nfor that date. By changing the last character to small letter “a” to “f”, the decoded\nresults are 1601111; changing to “g” to “v” yielded 1601112; and changing to “w” to\n“z” resulted in 1601113.\n\n11\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n32\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nIn the response provided by the Organisation, the Organisation admits\n\nthat at the time of design and implementation of the Website and Shipping\nWebpage, they had not considered the susceptibility of the Shipping Webpage\nURL to manipulation and had, therefore, not taken any step to test or address\nthis vulnerability.\n33\n\nGiven the absence of any security arrangements to protect personal data\n\nagainst such unauthorised access, the Commissioner finds that the Organisation\nhas contravened Section 24 of the PDPA in relation to the Second Data Breach.\n34\n\nAlthough the Organisation had in place security arrangements\n\n(described in paragraphs 6 and 7 above) to protect personal data on its Website,\nincluding regular vulnerability scans, penetration tests, risks assessments and\nautomated code reviews; none of these arrangements, as the Organisation\nadmits, addresses the URL manipulation vulnerability. Hence, they would not\nassist the Organisation in avoiding liability under Section 24 of the PDPA in\nrespect of the Second Data Breach.\n35\n\nThis is not the first case where the Commissioner has found a failure to\n\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect URLs from being easily\nmanipulated to compromise the security of personal data, to be a contravention\nof Section 24 of the PDPA:\n(a)\n\nIn Re Fu Kwee Kitchen Catering Services and another [2016]\n\nSGPDPC 14, the URL of Fu Kwee Kitchen Catering Services’ (“Fu\nKwee”) webpage for previewing orders could be manipulated easily (by\nchanging the characters at the end of URL) to retrieve other orders of Fu\nKwee’s customers containing the customers’ personal data. The\nCommission found Fu Kwee in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA for\n\n12\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 19\n\nfailing to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect\npersonal data.\n(b)\n\nIn Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and others [2016] SGPDPC 19,\n\nthe URL of Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd’s (“Smiling Orchid”) webpage\nfor previewing orders could be manipulated easily (by changing the\ncharacters at the end of URL) to retrieve other orders of Smiling\nOrchid’s customers containing the customers’ personal data. The\nCommission found Smiling Orchid in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA\nfor failing to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect\npersonal data.\nDirections\n36\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of\n\nits obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Second Data\nBreach, the Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue\nthe Organisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the\nPDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay a financial penalty\nof such amount not exceeding S$1 million.\n37\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions (if any) to be\n\nmade, the Commissioner considered the following factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation handles a substantial volume of shipping\n\ntransactions for individual customers in Singapore and hence a\nsubstantial amount of personal data. It is therefore imperative that\nsecurity arrangements be implemented to protect personal data of its\ncustomers;\n\n13\n\n\fComGateway (S) Pte.

The Commissioner\nfound the Organisation to be in breach of its Protection Obligation under the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). The Commissioner’s findings\nand grounds for his decision are set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a registered charity under the National Council of\n\nSocial Services. The Organisation provides assistance to debt-distressed\nindividuals (whom it calls “clients”), such as credit counselling and facilitating\nthe establishment of a debt restructuring plan with creditors. The DMP is a\nvoluntary debt repayment scheme under which the Organisation helps clients,\nwho are facing difficulties or unable to repay their unsecured consumer debts,\nto work out a payment arrangement with their creditors.\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n3\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nThe data breach occurred when the Organisation sought to obtain a\n\nstatus update from its clients on the debts to be repaid to their creditors under\nthe DMP. At the material time, the Organisation had a total of [redacted] ‘active’\nDMP clients, of which 810 clients had received the questionnaire from the\nOrganisation via post requesting for a repayment status update. Of these 810\nclients, 297 clients failed to respond by the deadline. The Organisation then sent\nthree batches of follow-up emails to these 297 DMP clients.\n4\n\nOn 30 September 2016, an admin staff of the Organisation made a\n\nmistake when sending out one of the three batches of follow-up emails (the\n“Follow-up Email”). Instead of pasting the email addresses of 96 DMP clients\nin the “Bcc” field, the admin staff had inadvertently pasted the email addresses\nin the “To” field before proceeding to send the Follow-up Email out. This\nmistake caused the 96 email addresses and associated names (for some\nindividuals) to be displayed in the “To” field and were thus visible to all the\nrecipients of the Follow-up Email.\n5\n\nSubsequently, the Organisation received feedback from four DMP\n\nclients who were concerned that their identity had been disclosed to the rest of\nthe recipients. In addition, two DMP clients had clicked the “Reply All” button\nwhen submitting their completed questionnaire to the Organisation, which\nresulted in inadvertent disclosure of additional personal data (contained in the\nquestionnaire) to all the other recipients.\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nMain Issues for Determination\n6\n\nThe issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:\n\n2\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n(a)\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nwhether the information disclosed by the Follow-up Email\n\nconstituted personal data; and\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation had put in place reasonable security\n\narrangements to protect the personal data set in its possession or in its\ncontrol, as required under section 24 of the PDPA.\nIssue (a): Whether the information disclosed by the Follow-up Email\nconstituted personal data\n7\n\nThe starting point is whether the Follow-up Email that was sent out by\n\nthe Organisation had disclosed personal data of the 96 DMP clients.\n(i) The 96 email addresses were personal data\n8\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” to be data, whether\n\ntrue or not, about an individual who can be identified from that data; or from\nthat data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\naccess. In this case, all 96 email addresses disclosed in the Follow-up Email are\nconsidered personal data under the PDPA because the Organisation would also\nhave the name of individual to whom the email address belongs to, and would\nthus be able to identify the individual from that email address. The Protection\nObligation therefore attaches to the email addresses both as part of the\nOrganisation’s complete records of its DMP clients as well as when used on\ntheir own.\n9\n\nA copy of the Follow-up Email that was provided to the Personal Data\n\nProtection Commission (“PDPC”) revealed that there were three categories of\nemail addresses: (a) an email address which disclosed the full name of the\nindividual, eg “tan.ah.kow980@gmail.com”; (b) an email address which\ncontained the partial name of the individual, eg “ylt.rachel@hotmail.com”; and\n\n3\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\n(c) an email address from which no individual’s name could be deciphered eg\n“foodlover721@hotmail.com”.1 Prima facie, the disclosure of email addresses\ncoming under categories (a) and (b) would allow an outsider to identify the\nindividual because the name or partial name of the individuals have been\ndisclosed. Therefore, even from the perspective of an outsider, the Follow-up\nEmail had disclosed personal data of individuals to the outsider for categories\n(a) and (b) above.\n10\n\nAdditionally, investigations revealed that out of the 96 email addresses\n\nthat were disclosed, 16 individuals could be identified on online social media\nplatforms based on a search of their email addresses. As stated above, the\ndefinition of “personal data” under the PDPA includes data that can be\nidentified from (a) that data coupled with (b) other information to which the\norganisation has or is likely to have access. Since the “other information” that\nis needed to identify the 16 individuals behind the email addresses disclosed is\nreadily available on various social media platforms, the email addresses of those\n16 individuals would allow a person who had access to the email addresses to\nidentify the 16 individuals. In this day and age where access to the Internet is\nprevalent and there is widespread use of social media platforms, it would be\nunrealistic to ignore the Internet as a source of information to identify an\nindividual.\n\n1\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, these examples are not the actual email addresses disclosed\nin the data breach and are purely for illustration purposes only. Any resemblance to an\nactual email address is purely coincidental, and there is no intention to identify any\nindividual.\n\n4\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\n(ii) The context of the Follow-up Email rendered the communication content\nand personal data sensitive\n11\n\nThis is a case where the personal data, in the form of contact details,\n\nwhich ordinarily would not have been sensitive were rendered sensitive by\nreason of the context of their disclosure. The nature and context of the Followup Email is crucial to this analysis. As mentioned above, the Organisation had\nsent the Follow-up Email as part of the periodic update from its DMP clients to\nobtain the status of their debt repayment. The Follow-up Email contained a\n“DMP Status Update Form” in which individuals were required to provide the\nOrganisation with information about their state of indebtedness by selecting one\nof several available options. For example, one option was “I have completed my\nDMP repayment to all my creditors…Please assist to remove my DMP status\nfrom my Credit Bureau Singapore’s credit report”. Another available option\nwas “I am servicing my DMP repayment every month with no missed payment\nin the last 12 months.” Yet another option that individuals could select was “I\nhave missed one or more payments in the last 12 months and I wish to seek\nassistance from CCS. I will contact CCS within the next two weeks to discuss\nmy case.” Further down the form, the individual was to fill up his particulars,\nincluding his name and NRIC number.\n12\n\nGiven the above, the fact that an individual is included on the list of\n\nemail addresses in the Follow-up Email would indicate that the individual is\neither currently facing financial debt, or was previously in debt, and that the\nindividual is obtaining, or had previously obtained, assistance under the DMP\nscheme to pay off the debt.\n13\n\nTherefore, if an individual’s identity had been revealed by the disclosure\n\nof his or her email address in the Follow-up Email, it would also mean that the\n\n5\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nindividual’s financial information (i.e. his debt status as a current or former\ndebt-distressed individual) would be divulged by the Follow-up Email.\n14\n\nAt the time when the Follow-Up Email was sent out by the Organisation,\n\nit contained a blank DMP Status Update Form, and hence, no other personal\ninformation of individuals was disclosed to the recipients of the Follow-Up\nEmail beyond the disclosure of the individual’s financial information.\n15\n\nThat the financial information is sensitive personal data of an individual\n\nis a position that has been taken by the Commissioner, as well as foreign data\nprotection authorities.\n16\n\nIn the earlier decisions of the PDPC, the PDPC found that financial\n\ninformation such as a policyholder’s bank account details (consisting of the\nname of the bank, branch of the bank, the bank account number and the account\nholder’s name);2 and an individual’s central depository account details\n(consisting of the account holder’s name, address, account number, securities\nholdings, transaction and payment summaries)3 to be personal data that is of a\nsensitive nature.\n17\n\nThe Information & Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia has\n\ntaken a similar position in a case involving the unauthorised disclosure of the\nnames of the members of the trade unions, as well as the amount of strike pay\nthey were paid and still owed to the union, the commissioner took the view that:4\n\n2\n\nRe AIA Singapore Private Limited [2016] SGPDPC 10 at [5] and [19].\n\n3\n\nRe Central Depository (Pte) Limited and another [2016] SGPDPC 11 at [8] and [24].\n\n4\n\nOrder P17-01: Construction Maintenance and Allied Workers Local 2423\n<https://www.oipc.bc.ca/orders/2020> at [39].\n\n6\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\n“financial information connected to an individual is generally\nsensitive information, particularly when it involves a debt.\nOwing money to another party (whether an individual or any\nlegal entity) is generally a private matter between those parties.\nIn my view, the fact that money was borrowed and is owed\ncould, whether justified or not, lead to moral judgements about\nthe individuals and their spending, financial choices, earning\npower or about their character generally. In particular, a lapse\nin, or lack of, payment to that party may be considered\nparticularly sensitive information, given the stigma that may be\nattached to an individual having a delinquent debt.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n18\n\nIn another Canadian case, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of\n\nAlberta found that the actions of an employee of an organisation, who had\ndisclosed personal data (comprising an individual’s name, telephone number,\ncreditor name, amount owing, last payment amount, last payment date and\nunique account number) to an unauthorised third party debt settlement agency,\nhad caused there to be a real risk of significant harm posed to the affected\nindividuals. In finding the organisation in breach of the Personal Information\nProtection Act (PIPA), the commissioner stated that:5\n“the personal information involved could be used to cause harm\nto affected individuals in the form of financial loss,\nembarrassment and harassment by an unauthorized third\nparty debt collection agency. In my view, these are significant\nharms.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nGiven the type of sensitive personal data disclosed, the Commissioner took the\nposition that this would give an unauthorised debt collection agency “enough\npersonal information to potentially convince affected individuals it is\n\n5\n\nP2015-ND-02:\nCBV\nCollection\nServices\n<https://www.oipc.ab.ca/media/386982/P2015_ND_02.pdf> at p. 3.\n\n7\n\nLtd.\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nauthorized to collect the debt”,6 which would then lead to the abovementioned\nharms.\n19\n\nDisclosure of an individual’s indebtedness to other third parties could\n\nlead to harm to the individual because it could result in social stigma,\ndiscrimination or tarnish his reputation. These are real possibilities that can\naffect a person’s life. Hence, the confidentiality of the individual’s financial\ninformation should not be treated lightly.\n20\n\nThe above view is captured in the comments provided by the\n\nInformation Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) in its Guide to data protection.\nWhen considering the definition of ‘sensitive personal data’ under the UK Data\nProtection Act 1998, the ICO explained that “[the] presumption is that, because\ninformation about these matters could be used in a discriminatory way, and is\nlikely to be of a private nature, it needs to be treated with greater care than\nother personal data.”7\n21\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner\n\nof Canada (“OPC”) has taken the position that “a simple reference to an\noutstanding debt, even without disclosing specific details about the debt, is\npersonal information”.8 In that case, a bank had telephoned the complainant’s\n\n6\n\nP2015-ND-02:\nCBV\nCollection\nServices\n<https://www.oipc.ab.ca/media/386982/P2015_ND_02.pdf> at p. 3.\n\n7\n\nUK, ICO’s Guide to data protection: Key definitions of the Data Protection Act (7 July\n2017) <https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/>\nat p. 4.\n\n8\n\nSee OPC, Interpretation Bulletin: Personal Information (October 2013), Part III:\nApplication in Different Contexts <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacylaws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-actpipeda/pipeda-compliance-help/pipeda-interpretation-\n\n8\n\nLtd.\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nemployer after a confrontation between the complainant and a bank manager.\nThe employer’s internal affairs bureau then sent an internal email which stated\nthat the complainant was involved in a civil dispute with the bank, and that he\nhad “incurred a sizeable debt and was under financial pressure”.9 The\ncommissioner found that this internal email containing that single reference to\nthe complainant’s indebtedness and financial situation was personal information\nthat should not have been disclosed.\n22\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Officer of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal\n\nData (“PCPD”) has taken the position that financial information, including an\nindividual’s indebtedness, constitutes sensitive data. The PCPD’s Guidance on\nthe Proper Handling of Customers’ Personal Data for the Banking Industry\nprovides that:10\n“[information] showing the financial problems of a customer\nsuch as default in payment is commonly recognised as sensitive\ndata, and should therefore be handled with extra care.

As will be elaborated on\nbelow, when it comes to the protection of “sensitive” personal data,\norganisations are required to take extra precautions and ensure higher standards\nof protection under the PDPA.\n24\n\nGiven that the disclosure of email addresses was made by the\n\nOrganisation inadvertently (as opposed to an intentional one), the issue for\ndetermination is whether the Organisation had put in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data of its DMP clients against\nunauthorised disclosures pursuant to section 24 of the PDPA.\nIssue (b): Whether the Organisation has complied with its Protection\nObligation under Section 24 of the PDPA\n(i) Stronger controls and greater measures needed to protect sensitive\npersonal data\n25\n\nWhen it comes to the protection of sensitive personal data, there is a\n\nneed to put in place stronger security measures because of the actual or potential\nharm, and the severity of such harm, that may befall an individual from a misuse\nor unauthorised use of such data. The Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in\nthe PDPA state that an organisation should “design and organise its\narrangements to fit … the possible harm that might result from a security\nbreach”, and to “implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring\n\n10\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nappropriate levels of security for personal data of varying levels of\nsensitivity”.11\n26\n\nSome examples of these precautions to protect sensitive personal data\n\ninclude, but are not limited to, good email procedures and encryption\ntechnology. The Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing\nand Sending Personal Data specifically encourages organisations to undertake\nsecurity measures to prevent the sending of personal data to the wrong\nrecipients, including “[implementing] email procedures to ensure all emails\nsent externally to a group of recipients have the recipients’ email addresses\nplaced in ‘bcc’ fields to avoid disclosing recipients’ email addresses to all other\nrecipients of the email”.12 In another example, the Guide to Securing Personal\nData in Electronic Medium suggests organisations adopt encryption as a\nsecurity measure when emails contain confidential or sensitive personal data\nthat “has a higher risk of adversely affecting an individual if such personal data\nis compromised.”13\n27\n\nIn adopting this view on implementing greater safeguards for more\n\nsensitive personal data, the Commissioner agrees with the observations made\nby the OPC in the PIPEDA Report of Findings #2014-003 that organisations\n“must protect personal information by implementing security safeguards\nappropriate to the sensitivity of the information” and that the “more sensitive\n\n11\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2016) at\n[17.3].\n\n12\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data at [2.1], ninth bullet point, p. 5.\n\n13\n\nPDPC, Guide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium (revised 20 January\n2017) at [14.3].\n\n11\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\ninformation should be safeguarded by a higher level of protection”.14 In that\ncase, the OPC found that an insurance company had lost its policyholders’ files\ncontaining sensitive personal data as the safeguards for the control and tracking\nof the insurance files at the time of the data breach incident were inadequate.\n(ii) The Organisation failed to implement adequate administrative security\nmeasures\n28\n\nThe Organisation’s mistake of pasting the list of recipient email\n\naddresses in the “To” field instead of the “Bcc” field was a straightforward one,\nand could have been quite easily repeated. All it takes is just a few “wrong”\nclicks of the button, and the list of email addresses could be pasted in the wrong\nfield and sent out with the unauthorised disclosure of email addresses. Yet the\nimpact of the unauthorised disclosure cannot be ignored – personal information\nof 96 clients, including their sensitive financial information, have been\ndisclosed with the potential that such disclosure may cause harm to these\nindividuals.\n29\n\nIt is precisely that the mistake can be so easily made and repeated which\n\ndraws into focus the issue with the Organisation’s arrangements to protect\npersonal data. The Organisation did not have the appropriate checks and\ncontrols to prevent or minimise such mistakes from occurring (which could\neasily happen again). The types of checks and controls to be implemented could\nrange from an additional layer of supervision or oversight before the email is\nsent, to sending such emails individually (eg using the mail merge function of\n\n14\n\nPIPEDA Report of Findings #2014-003: Insurance company overhauls its security\nsafeguards following privacy breach <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-anddecisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2014/pipeda-2014-003/>, first\nand second bullet points in the “Lessons Learned” section at p. 2.\n\n12\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nOutlook). Whatever the way, the staff runs through the important steps to be\ntaken with his or her supervisor, who can provide guidance or corrections to the\nstaff before the action is carried out. Alternatively, it could be in the form of a\ntechnical control which ensures that the email addresses are correctly pasted in\nthe “bcc” field of the email instead of the “To” field. The Organisation,\nhowever, did not have any checks or controls in place.\n30\n\nThe Commissioner is not suggesting that organisations would need, for\n\nexample, to have the added layer of supervision in all cases where emails\ncontaining personal data are being sent out. As mentioned above, organisations\nare to put in place security arrangements that are commensurate with the\nsensitivity of the data in question – a balance of considerations. In relation to\npersonal data that is of a non-sensitive nature, it may be the case that a second\nlayer of checks is not needed for admin staff to send out the email, if, for\nexample, the admin staff has gone through the relevant training on data\nprotection.\n31\n\nHowever, since the personal data here was of a sensitive nature, the\n\nOrganisation needed to implement a higher level of security to protect the data\n(as so described at paragraphs 25 to 27 above). As mentioned above, the\nOrganisation’s lack of any checks and controls was unacceptable in the given\ncontext. Moreover, the Organisation did not seem to have taken any steps\ntowards protecting the personal data. This is evident from the lack of\ndifferentiation, in the Organisation’s processes, between an email that was sent\nout by the Organisation which did not contain personal data, and an email which\ncontained personal data (and sensitive personal data). In both cases, the admin\nstaff was able to send out the email indiscriminately, without requiring further\nprecautions or steps to be taken to protect those emails which contained personal\ndata.\n\n13\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n32\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nThe nature of the Organisation’s work is a relevant factor to be taken\n\ninto consideration. It routinely handles large volumes of sensitive financial\npersonal data of individuals. This being the case, it is foreseeable that there will\nbe risks of inadvertent disclosure of sensitive personal data. The process in\nwhich emails containing reminders to submit repayment status updates are sent\nto its clients ought to have been identified as one which carries with it a\nsignificant risk of inadvertent disclosure. There was therefore no excuse for the\nOrganisation not to already have a system of checks and controls in place to\nprevent or minimise such unauthorised disclosure of personal data. As a matter\nof good practice, the Organisation could have also carried out a data protection\nrisk assessment, which would have helped to identify and address the specific\nrisk of disclosure that has arisen in this case.\n33\n\nThe Organisation mentioned that, at that time, it had planned to put in\n\nplace a “mail-merge” software which would allow for mass emails to be sent\nindividually to clients. But it had only started using it from November 2016\nonwards; by which time the Follow-up Email had already been sent out (it was\nsent out on 30 September 2016). The fact that there was a solution like the “mailmerge” software which could have ameliorated the risks of unauthorised\ndisclosure of personal data also exemplifies the Commissioner’s position that\nthe Organisation could have done more to protect the personal data of their\nclients. With the benefit of hindsight, perhaps this incident would have been\navoided had the mail merge solution been implemented sooner.\n34\n\nGiven the Commissioner’s findings above that the Organisation has not\n\nput in place adequate security arrangements to protect the personal data of its\nclients, it is therefore concluded that the Organisation was in breach of the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n14\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n35\n\nIn respect of the Commissioner’s findings that the Organisation is in\n\nbreach of section 24 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered under\nsection 29 of the PDPA to give the Organisation such directions as it deems fit\nto ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the PDPA. This may include\ndirecting the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not\nexceeding S$1 million as the Commissioner thinks fit.\n36\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed to\n\nthe Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into account the following\naggravating factors:\n(a)\n\ninformation about an individual’s adverse financial condition\n\nand/or state of indebtedness was sensitive personal data, and the\ndisclosure of which could cause actual or potential harm, injury or\nhardship to the individual, including serious reputational damage and\nembarrassment;\n(b)\n\ngiven the nature of the Organisation’s business of handling large\n\nvolumes of sensitive personal data, the Organisation ought to have put\nin place a system of checks for any sensitive personal data that may be\ndisclosed, but it did not do so; and\n(c)\n\nthe data breach incident may cause members of the public to lose\n\ntrust in such credit counselling organisations to safeguard their personal\ndata, which may frustrate the larger national credit management efforts.\n37\n\nThe Commissioner also took into account the following mitigating\n\nfactors:\n\n15\n\n\fCredit Counselling Singapore\n\n(a)\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 18\n\nthe Organisation had cooperated fully with the Commissioner’s\n\ninvestigations and had readily admitted its mistake without delay;\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation had promptly notified all the affected recipients\n\nof the data breach incident and offered them an apology alongside a\nrequest to delete the Follow-up Email;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation has counselled the admin staff who made the\n\nmistake, and has taken further steps to prevent future data breaches such\nas its plans to conduct an organisation-wide refresher course on\ncompliance with the PDPA, and deploying the “mail-merge” software,\nmentioned above, within two months; and\n(d)\n\nthere were no other data breach incidents reported apart from this\n\none.\n38\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of\nS$10,000 within 30 days from the date of the Commissioner’s direction, failing\nwhich, interest, at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment\ndebts, shall be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n16\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $18,000 and directions were issued to Social Metric for leaving the personal data exposed to the world wide web via unprotected URL links; and failure to remove personal data of its clients’ customers from its website when they no longer served a legal or business purpose.","tags":["Protection","Retention Limitation","Financial Penalty","Directions","Information and Communications"],"date":"2017-11-27","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds-of-Decision-Social-Metric-271117.pdf","nature":"Protection, Retention Limitation","title":"Breach of Protection and Retention Obligations by Social Metric","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/11/breach-of-protection-and-retention-obligations-by-social-metric","timestamp":"2017-11-27","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\nCase No DP-160-A712; DP-1604-A713\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-160-A712; DP-1604-A713\n\n27 November 2017.\nBackground\n1\n\nThis case involves a company which, as part of its social media\n\nmarketing campaigns conducted for and on behalf of its clients, created\nwebpages containing the personal data of its clients’ customers; and\nsubsequently failed to remove those webpages from the world wide web, even\nafter the social media marketing campaigns were over.\n2\n\nA complaint was made to the Personal Data Protection Commission\n\n(“PDPC”) regarding the unauthorised disclosure of personal data on these\nwebpages on the world wide web. The Commissioner undertook an\ninvestigation into the matter, and the Commissioner sets out his findings and\ndecision on the matter below.\nMaterial Facts and Documents\n3\n\nSocial Metric is a digital marketing agency that provides social media\n\nmarketing services. As part of these services, Social Metric would collect\npersonal data of its clients’ customers for various purposes, for example, as a\nform of customer engagement, or to analyse the customer demographics,\namongst other things.\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n4\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nFor the webpages in question, Social Metric had created nine webpages\n\n(the “Webpages”) for various social media contests that Social Metric\nconducted for and on behalf of its clients. These Webpages were found on\nSocial Metric’s website at https://www.socialmetric.com (the “Website”). The\nWebpages consisted of tables that listed out various particulars of individuals.\nThey were created for internal administrative and client use.\n5\n\nThe personal data in these nine Webpages included individuals’ names;\n\nemail addresses; contact numbers; employers; occupations; date and time of\nregistration; and other miscellaneous information including, “places to visit” (eg\nstates in Australia), “activities” (outdoor sports), and “purpose” (eg personal\ngrowth). In particular, two out of the nine Webpages also contained the personal\ndata (name and age) of about 155 children. The Commissioner’s investigations\ndisclosed that such personal data was provided by the individuals directly (ie by\nthe individual sending his or her personal data to Social Metric through\nFacebook’s private message function), and were not obtained from publicly\navailable sources.\n6\n\nBased on the date and time of registration of the nine Webpages, it was\n\nobserved that all the personal data contained therein, except for two individuals,\nwere collected and disclosed before the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) came into full force on 2 July 2014 (“Appointed Day”). In respect\nof the two individuals, the personal data of one of the individuals (name, email\naddress, contact number) was disclosed on 24 December 2014, while the\npersonal data of the other individual (name and email address) was disclosed on\n15 September 2015.\n7\n\nSocial Metric was first informed by the Complainant of the unintended\n\ndisclosure of personal data on the nine Webpages on 27 April 2016. Following\n\n2\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nthe complaint made by the Complainant to the PDPC, the PDPC had also\ninformed Social Metric about the disclosure on the Webpages in May 2016.\nAfter being informed about the Webpages, Social Metric took down three out\nof the nine Webpages. However, at the time of the Commissioner’s\ninvestigation, six out of the nine Webpages were still available on the world\nwide web. These remaining six Webpages contained the personal data of\napproximately 558 individuals. As at 11 July 2016, all the Webpages have been\ntaken down. The personal data was therefore left on the Webpages for a period\nof at least 2 months since the time that Social Metric had first been informed of\nthe personal data that was held on its Website until they were all completely\ntaken down. By the Commissioner’s estimate, given that some of the marketing\ncampaigns had ended by the Appointed Day, some of the personal data would\nhave been left on the Webpages for more than two years after the respective\nevents.\nCommissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nIssues for Determination\n8\n\nBased on the facts, there were two main issues for determination before\n\nthe Commissioner:\n(a)\n\nwhat were Social Metric’s obligations under the PDPA with\n\nrespect to the personal data found on the Webpages that were exposed\non the internet;\n(b)\n\nwhether Social Metric complied with these obligations.\n\nSpecifically,\n(i)\n\nwhether Social Metric complied with its Retention\n\nLimitation Obligation under section 25 of the PDPA when it\n\n3\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nretained the personal data of its clients’ customers even after the\nsocial media marketing campaigns were over; and\n(ii)\n\nwhether Social Metric has complied with its Protection\n\nObligation under section 24 of the PDPA, given the unauthorised\ndisclosure of personal data on the Webpages.\n(a) Social Metric’s obligations under the PDPA\ni.\n\n9\n\nHow did the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA apply to\nSocial Metric?\nAs the Webpages were created before the Data Protection Provisions of\n\nthe PDPA (ie Parts III to VI of the PDPA) came into force on the Appointed\nDay, it is necessary to examine how Social Metric came to take on these\nobligations under the PDPA in respect of the Webpages.\n10\n\nBefore the Appointed Day, the Data Protection Provisions of the PDPA\n\nwere not in force, and hence, Social Metric was not subject to these provisions\nin relation to the personal data that it had processed for its clients’ social\nmarketing campaigns. After the Appointed Day, the Data Protection Provisions\nunder the PDPA came into force, and at such time, it became incumbent on an\norganisation (as in this case, Social Metric) to take proactive steps to comply\nwith these obligations under the PDPA in respect of the existing personal data\nheld in their possession or control, as well as any new personal data that it may\ncome into possession or control with.\n11\n\nThis means that, for example, if there were no security arrangements\n\npreviously to protect the existing personal data the organisation was holding,\nthe organisation has a positive duty to put in place security arrangements after\nthe Appointed Day. It was not enough for the organisation to leave things status\n\n4\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nquo, if this would not enable the organisation to meet the requirements and\nstandards of the Protection Obligation. As provided in Section 24 of the PDPA,\nthe security arrangements must be “reasonable”.\n12\n\nWhat has just been described about the PDPA obligations coming into\n\noperation and applying after the Appointed Day is to be contrasted with the\n‘grandfathering’ provision under section 19 of the PDPA, which also applies to\npersonal data held by an organisation before the Appointed Day. In essence,\nsection 19 of the PDPA allows an organisation to continue to use (but not\ndisclose) personal data that was collected before the Appointed Day for such\npurposes for which the personal data was collected, without having to obtain\nconsent under the Data Protection Provisions. As mentioned in Re Comfort\nTransportation Pte Ltd and another [2016] SGPDPC 17, personal data collected\nbefore the Appointed Day as business contact information could continue to be\nused after the Appointed Day as such. Notwithstanding the grandfathering of\nthe purpose for usage, the organisation would have to still comply with the rest\nof the Data Protection Provisions.\n13\n\nFrom the above analysis, therefore, Social Metric has the obligation to\n\ncomply with the Data Protection Provisions under the PDPA in respect of the\nexisting personal data that were held on its Website.\nii.\n\n14\n\nIn what capacity did Social Metric take on such obligations\nunder the PDPA?\n\nIn order to determine what obligations apply to Social Metric under the\n\nPDPA, it is apposite to consider the capacity that Social Metric was in when it\nwas carrying out the data processing activities on the personal data of its clients’\ncustomers – ie as a data intermediary or an organisation. This is because\n\n5\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\ndifferent sets of obligations and responsibilities may apply depending on the\ncapacity that Social Metric is in.\n15\n\nUnder the PDPA, when an organisation carries out data processing\n\nactivities on behalf of another, the organisation is considered a data\nintermediary. The PDPA obligations that would apply to a data intermediary\npursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA are limited to two obligations – the\nProtection Obligation and Retention Limitation Obligation. In comparison, an\n“organisation” under the PDPA, for which the data intermediary is performing\nthe data processing, would be subject to the full range of obligations under the\nPDPA. This is so, even though the organisation may have engaged a data\nintermediary to implement the necessary data protection measures for the\norganisation. Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that “an organisation shall\nhave the same obligation under this Act in respect of personal data processed\non its behalf and for purposes by a data intermediary as if the personal data\nwere processed by the organisation itself”.\n16\n\nBeyond the different sets of obligations that may apply to an\n\norganisation or data intermediary, there may also be different responsibilities\nthat an organisation or data intermediary may undertake under the PDPA. As\nexplained in Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd and others [2016] SGPDPC 19, in a\nsituation where the data processing activities are carried out by the\norganisation’s external vendor, the organisation has a supervisory or general\nrole for the protection of the personal data, while the data intermediary has a\nmore direct and specific role in the protection of personal data arising from its\ndirect possession of or control over the personal data. This means that the\norganisation can still be liable for a data breach for failing to meet its\nresponsibility, even though its data intermediary was found to have its own\nresponsibility, and vice versa.\n\n6\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n17\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nIn this case, at the point of collection of personal data, Social Metric was\n\ncarrying out the collection on behalf of its clients for the marketing campaigns,\nand was thus acting as a data intermediary for its clients. Next, with regard to\nSocial Metric posting the personal data of its clients’ customers on the Website,\nthat, too, was done in the capacity as a data intermediary. The Website was put\nup for the purposes of the marketing campaigns of Social Metric’s clients. It\nwas when the marketing campaigns had ended, and Social Metric had held on\nto the personal data (which was still posted on the Website) for a longer period\nthan was reasonable, that Social Metric can no longer be considered a data\nintermediary in relation to such activities.\n18\n\nThere are two main reasons for this position. First, the social marketing\n\ncampaigns were already over, and both Social Metric and its clients had no\nfurther purpose in retaining the personal data on the Website. Social Metric\ncannot be said to be “[processing] personal data on behalf of” its clients by the\nprotracted retention of the personal data on its Website. Indeed, as mentioned\nabove, based on the Commissioner’s estimate, some of the personal data was\nkept on its Website for more than two years. Accordingly, at some point in time,\nSocial Metric was no longer a data intermediary within the definition of this\nterm under the PDPA. Instead, Social Metric was now acting on its own accord\nin relation to the personal data that it held, and had taken on the full\nresponsibility of protecting such personal data. Second, Social Metric had a\nstandard operating procedure (“SOP”) to dispose of the personal data after the\nmarketing campaigns in its contract for service with its clients had ended. As\nfar as the clients were concerned, it was reasonable to expect Social Metric to\ncarry out the disposal upon the completion of the marketing campaigns, and\nthere was no evidence that Social Metric’s clients were aware that Social Metric\nhad failed to dispose of the personal data. In the premises, it would not be logical\nnor fair if the PDPA imposes a continuing obligation on Social Metric’s clients\n7\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nto protect the personal data. Since Social Metric had failed to carry out what it\nwas supposed to do (ie to dispose of the personal data after the marketing\ncampaigns), it bears the risk for whatever happens to the personal data that was\nheld in its hands after the marketing campaigns were over.\n19\n\nSocial Metric had therefore assumed the full data protection\n\nresponsibilities of an “organisation” under the PDPA after the end of the\nmarketing campaigns. This is a position that has been adopted by foreign data\nprotection authorities as well.\niii.\n\n20\n\nForeign authorities on the issue of a data intermediary taking\non responsibilities of an organisation\n\nThe foreign data protection authorities have taken the position that a data\n\nprocessor, which was originally engaged to perform data processing activities\nfor or on behalf of a data controller, could subsequently take on the data\nprotection responsibilities of a data controller under certain circumstances, for\nexample, where the data processor uses the personal data for its own\nunauthorised purposes, or for additional purposes not envisaged by the data\ncontroller, or for its own benefit.\n21\n\nAccording to the guidance issued by the UK’s Information\n\nCommissioner’s Office, Data controllers and data processors: what the\ndifference is and what the governance implications are (“ICO guidance”), a\ndata processor may become a data controller in its own right, albeit to a limited\n\n8\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nextent, when, for example, the processor breaks the agreement with its data\ncontroller. The ICO guidance provides that:1\n“65.\nA data processor will have access to the personal data\nheld by the controller or controllers it provides its services to\nbut it cannot have any of its own data controller responsibilities\nfor that data. However, in certain situations this may change\nand it will become a data controller in its own right if only\nto a limited extent.\n…\n67.\nIf a data processor breaks the agreement with its\ndata controller, for example by using the data for its own\nunauthorised purposes, then it will also take on its own\ndata controller responsibilities. This includes the duty under\nthe first data protection principle to process, including to\nobtain, personal data fairly and lawfully. Where a data\nprocessor takes the personal data the controller has entrusted\nit with but breaks the terms of its contract by using the data for\nits own purposes, it is likely to be in breach of the first principle\nand the ICO could take enforcement action against it…”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n22\n\nSimilarly, in the EU, the European Commission has issued Opinion\n\n1/2010 on the concepts of “controller” and “processor” which describes a\nscenario where a data processor which conducts marketing activities may be\nconsidered to be a data controller and become subject to data protection\nobligations:2\n“In these cases - where there is a good definition of purposes,\nbut little or even no guidance on technical and organizational\nmeans - the means should represent a reasonable way of\n\n1\n\nU.K., Information Commissioner’s Office, Data controllers and data processors: what\nthe difference is and what the governance implications are (6 May 2014)\n<https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1546/data-controllers-anddata-processors-dp-guidance.pdf> at paras. [65], [67].\n\n2\n\nE.U., European Commission, Art. 29 Data Protection Working Party, Opinion 1/2010\non the concepts of “controller” and “processor” (16 Feb 2010)\n<http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2010/wp169_en.pdf>\nat\np.14.\n\n9\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nachieving the purpose(s) and the data controller should be fully\ninformed about the means used. Would a contractor have an\ninfluence on the purpose and carry out the processing (also)\nfor its own benefit, for example by using personal data\nreceived with a view to generate added-value services, it\nwould be a controller (or possibly a joint controller) for\nanother processing activity and therefore subject to all the\nobligations of the applicable data protection law.\nExample No. 3: Company referred to as data processor\nbut acting as controller\nCompany MarketinZ provides services of promotional\nadvertisement and direct marketing to various\ncompanies. Company GoodProductZ concludes a\ncontract with MarketinZ, according to which the latter\ncompany\nprovides\ncommercial\nadvertising\nfor\nGoodProductZ customers and is referred to as data\nprocessor. However, MarketinZ decides to use\nGoodProducts customer database also for the purpose\nof promoting products of other customers. This\ndecision to add an additional purpose to the one for\nwhich the personal data were transferred converts\nMarketinZ into a data controller for this processing\noperation. The question of the lawfulness of this\nprocessing will still be assessed in the light of other\nArticles (6-8).”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n23\n\nThis means that where a data processor has an influence on the purpose\n\nof the processing, and carries out a separate processing activity which is\ndifferent from the purpose that the data controller envisaged or which is for the\ndata processor’s own benefit, then the data processor could be considered a data\ncontroller for that separate processing activity.\n24\n\nWhilst Singapore does not have the concept of a “data controller” or a\n\n“data processor” in its data protection regime, these terms taken from the UK’s\nData Protection Act 1988 and the EU Directive 95/46/EC do bear similarities to\nthe concept of “organisation” and “data intermediary” respectively in the PDPA.\nAs such, the Commissioner is of the view that the general principles mentioned\nabove are useful and supportive of the position that the Commissioner has taken.\n\n10\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\n(b) In this case, Social Metric’s compliance with its Retention Limitation and\nProtection Obligations comes into focus\n25\n\nAccordingly, while Social Metric had initially held the de facto role of\n\na data intermediary (before the Appointed Day) during the marketing\ncampaigns, Social Metric had subsequently taken on the role of an\n“organisation” when it held on to the personal data on its Website after the\nmarketing campaigns with its clients were over.\n26\n\nIn this case, the pertinent issues relate to Social Metric’s compliance\n\nwith its Protection and Retention Limitation Obligations. This is because the\nnature of the breach and the subject of complaint in this case relate to (a) Social\nMetric’s failure to protect the personal data on the Webpages from unauthorised\naccess; and (b) Social Metric’s failure to remove personal data of its clients’\ncustomers from its Website in accordance with its SOP or a reasonable period\nthereafter justifiable for legal or business purposes (“the tail period”). These\nare obligations that are common between Social Metric as data intermediary or\nas organisation. Had the period of retention been shorter, and Social Metric\nstayed as a data intermediary, its alleged misconduct would have been analysed\nas breaches of the Retention Limitation and Protection Obligations qua data\nintermediary. Where in this case, a considerable period has passed, and the data\nintermediary has morphed into an organisation, it is not meaningful to split hairs\nand analyse part of the period in which Social Metric had held on to the data as\na breach of a data intermediary’s Retention Limitation and Protection\nObligations while analysing the rest of this period as a breach of an\norganisation’s Retention Limitation and Protection Obligations. With the\neffluxion of time that Social Metric had held on to the data, there was nothing\nto separate Social Metric’s responsibilities under the Retention Limitation and\nProtection Obligations from that of a data intermediary or an organisation –\n\n11\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nSocial Metric ultimately took on the role and responsibility as an “organisation”\nunder the PDPA for the protection of personal data. The entire period in excess\nof “the tail period” should be analysed as a breach of an organisation’s Retention\nLimitation and Protection Obligations.\n27\n\nWe turn now to the assessment of whether or not Social Metric has\n\ncomplied with its Retention Limitation and Protection Obligations.\ni.\n\n28\n\nWhether Social Metric has complied with the Retention\nLimitation Obligation\nUnder the Retention Limitation Obligation, an organisation is obliged to\n\ncease retaining its documents containing personal data, or remove the means by\nwhich the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon\nas it is reasonable to assume that: (a) the purpose for which the personal data\nwas collected is no longer served by retaining the data; and (b) retention is no\nlonger necessary for legal or business purposes. As limbs (a) and (b) of section\n25 of the PDPA are conjunctive, this means that if the organisation still has\npurposes for retaining the personal data under either limb (a) or limb (b) of\nsection 25 of the PDPA, the organisation is allowed to retain such personal data.\n29\n\nOn the facts of this case, Social Metric held on to the personal data even\n\nthough the marketing campaigns were over. Under limb (a) of section 25 of the\nPDPA, the purpose for which the personal data was collected was no longer\nbeing served by retention of the personal data. Additionally, based on the\nevidence in this matter, there was nothing to indicate that Social Metric had any\nlegal or business purpose under limb (b) of section 25 of the PDPA for keeping\nthe personal data either. Since the purpose of retention as a data intermediary\nwas no longer valid, retention as an organisation is all the more indefensible.\nAccordingly, Social Metric has failed to show that it had any purpose for\n\n12\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nretaining personal data pursuant to limbs (a) and (b) of section 25 of the PDPA,\nand it is therefore in breach of section 25 of the PDPA.\nii.\n\n30\n\nWhether Social Metric has complied with the Protection\nObligation\n\nAs explained above at paragraphs 25 to 26 above, Social Metric has an\n\nobligation to protect personal data under the Protection Obligation as an\norganisation under the PDPA (pursuant to Section 24 of the PDPA). Social\nMetric had taken on the role of an “organisation” when it held on to the personal\ndata on its Website after the marketing campaigns with its clients were over,\nand it was in such a capacity that it had the duty to protect the personal data in\nits possession or control after the Protection Obligation came into force on the\nAppointed Day.\n31\n\nThe Commissioner finds that Social Metric failed to comply with its\n\nProtection Obligation. Social Metric had failed to limit access to the Webpages,\nand had left the personal data on the Webpages exposed to the world wide web.\nThere were no security or access controls on the Website or on any of the\nWebpages, such as a password protection. Any member of the public could have\naccessed the personal data of the clients’ customers through the Webpages.\n32\n\nThis case is analogous to the case Re Propnex Realty Pte Ltd [2017]\n\nSGPDPC 1, where it was found that the organisation failed to properly protect\npersonal data as it did not have any security controls or restrictions (ie proper\nauthentication system) to prevent access from the world wide web over the\nwebpages that were stored on the server. Similar to Re Propnex Realty Pte Ltd,\ntherefore, the present case may be characterised as one which Social Metric had\nfailed in its Protection Obligation to put in the necessary controls to prevent\naccess to personal data held on its Webpages. It was not one where, for example,\n\n13\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nthe organisation had intentionally disclosed personal data on its website. In\nthose cases, the Commissioner may look into the further issues of whether the\norganisation was in breach of its Consent and Notification Obligations for\ndisclosing personal data without consent and/or notification. This is illustrated\nby the case of Re My Digital Lock Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 20.\n33\n\nAdditionally, not only did Social Metric fail to put in the necessary\n\nsecurity measures upon the PDPA coming into full force on 2 July 2014 (ie the\nAppointed Day), this had carried on well after 2 July 2014. As mentioned earlier\nat paragraph 6, there were two instances where Social Metric had uploaded\npersonal data of the two individuals on the Webpages in December 2014 and\nSeptember 2015 respectively. Social Metric’s prolonged failure to put in place\nthe necessary security measures was inexplicable and a flagrant breach of its\nProtection Obligation under the PDPA.\n34\n\nSocial Metric alleged that the reason why the customers’ personal data\n\nwas publicly accessible online was due to oversight or forgetfulness on its part.\nThese are not valid excuses.\n35\n\nIn consideration of the above, Social Metric, in allowing the Webpages\n\ncontaining personal data to be made publicly available and failing to implement\nreasonable security arrangements over the Webpages, was in breach of the\nProtection Obligation.\nThe Commissioner’s Directions\n36\n\nPursuant to section 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner is empowered to\n\ngive Social Metric such directions as it deems fit to ensure Social Metric’s\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing Social Metric to pay a\n\n14\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the\nCommissioner thinks fit.\n37\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed to\n\nSocial Metric in this case, the Commissioner took into account the following\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nthe fact that personal data (names and ages) of about 155 children\n\nwere disclosed;\n(b)\n\nSocial Metric did not take prompt remedial actions after being\n\ninformed of the data breach by the Commissioner;\n(c)\n\nSocial Metric had, on more than on occasion, informed the\n\nCommissioner that the personal data in question had been deleted when\nthis was not the case; and\n(d)\n\nSocial Metric was generally uncooperative throughout the\n\ninvestigation process. Social Metric demonstrated its uncooperative\nattitude by making unsubstantiated claims such as informing the\nCommissioner that the data breach was a result of an external hack, and\nthat it had engaged freelance developers located in the Philippines to set\nup and maintain the Website without providing any evidence of their\nclaims. In addition, Social Metric also caused multiple delays in the\ninvestigation process when it repeatedly missed the Commissioner’s\ndeadlines to reply.\n38\n\nHaving completed its investigation and assessment of this matter, the\n\nCommissioner is satisfied that Social Metric was in breach of the Protection\n\n15\n\n\fSocial Metric Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 17\n\nObligation and the Retention Limitation Obligation under sections 24 and 25 of\nthe PDPA respectively.\n39\n\nIn consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances of the present\n\ncase, the Commissioner hereby directs Social Metric to:\n(a)\n\nscan and confirm that its Website no longer stores publicly\n\naccessible personal data that is not supposed to be disclosed to the\npublic; and\n(b)\n\npay a financial penalty of S$18,000 within 30 days from the date\n\nof the Commissioner’s direction, failing which, interest, at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n40\n\nThe Commissioner emphasises that he takes a very serious view of any\n\ninstance of non-compliance with the PDPA, and he urges organisations to take\nthe necessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commissioner will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n16\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to M Stars Movers for disclosure of a customer's personal data via social media without consent, failure to appoint a Data Protection Officer, and failure to institute policies and practices that are necessary for the organisation to meet the obligations imposed under the PDPA.","tags":["Accountability","Consent","Directions","Transport and Storage"],"date":"2017-11-15","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---m-stars-movers---151117.pdf","nature":"Accountability, Consent","title":"Breach of Consent and Openness Obligations by M Stars Movers","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/11/breach-of-consent-and-openness-obligations-by-m-stars-movers","timestamp":"2017-11-15","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\nCase No DP-1612-B0418\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nM Stars Movers & Logistics\nSpecialist Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner— Case No DP-1612-B0418\n15 November 2017\nBackground\n1\n\nThis case highlights the risks that organisations face when they fail to\n\ndevelop and implement policies, practices and procedures to protect personal\ndata when communicating with its customers or other individuals through social\nmedia.\n2\n\nIn this matter, a customer (the “Complainant”) of the Organisation,\n\nwhich provides professional moving services, alleged that the Organisation had\ndisclosed her personal data on its Facebook page without her consent.\n3\n\nThe findings and grounds of decision based on the investigations carried\n\nout in this matter are set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n4\n\nSometime in December 2016, the Complainant engaged the\n\nOrganisation’s professional moving services. The Complainant voluntarily\nprovided her name, mobile number and residential addresses (i.e. the addresses\nwhere the items were to be picked up and delivered to) to the Organisation to\nprovide the services.\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n5\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nDissatisfied with the allegedly unsatisfactory services provided by the\n\nOrganisation, the Complainant left a negative review in a public post on the\nOrganisation’s Facebook page. Amongst other things, there was a disagreement\nas to when the Organisation was required to return the S$100 deposit to the\nComplainant.\n6\n\nThe Organisation publicly responded to the Complainant’s review in the\n\ncomment section of the Complainant’s post on its Facebook page. In its\nresponse, the Organisation identified the Complainant by her English name and\nsurname (“name”) and residential address (collectively referred to as the\n“Personal Data”) and informed the Complainant that she would receive her\ndeposit once she returned the carton boxes that the Organisation had previously\nprovided to her to assist her in moving her belongings.\n7\n\nShortly after the Organisation had disclosed the Complainant’s Personal\n\nData on its Facebook page, the Complainant sent the Organisation a private\nFacebook message requesting the immediate removal of her residential address\nfrom the Organisation’s Facebook page. The Organisation denied any\nwrongdoing and refused to remove the Complainant’s address from its\nFacebook page until it was advised to do so by the office of the Commissioner.\n8\n\nThe Organisation’s explanation was that it had disclosed the\n\nComplainant’s name and residential address in its response to identify the\nComplainant “to ensure that [it was] refunding the money of $100 [i.e., the\ndeposit] to the correct person”.\n9\n\nThe Organisation admitted in the course of the investigations that it was\n\nnot aware of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Consequently,\n\n2\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nit did not appoint a data protection officer (“DPO”) nor did it implement any\ndata protection policies or guidelines.\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n10\n\nThe issues for determination are:\n(a)\n\nwhether the Organisation had disclosed the Complainant’s\n\npersonal data without consent or authorisation; and\n(b)\n\nwhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations\n\nunder sections 11 and 12 of the PDPA.\n11\n\nThe information disclosed by the Organisation is clearly “personal data”\n\nwithin the meaning of section 2(1) of the PDPA as the Complainant could be\nidentified from the information disclosed. The Organisation did not dispute this.\nWhether the Organisation had disclosed the Complainant’s personal data\nwithout consent or authorisation\n12\n\nSubject to certain exceptions,1 in accordance with section 13 read with\n\nsection 14 of the PDPA, organisations may only collect, use or disclose personal\ndata about an individual with the consent of that individual (the “Consent\nObligation”).\n13\n\nAn individual may, in some circumstances pursuant to section 15 of the\n\nPDPA, be deemed to have consented to the collection, use and disclosure of\n\n1\n\nPursuant to section 17 of the PDPA read with the Second, Third and Fourth Schedule\nof the PDPA.\n\n3\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nhis/her personal data where he/she voluntarily provided the personal data and it\nis reasonable that he/she would voluntarily provide the data.2\n14\n\nThe Complainant engaged the Organisation to move her belongings to\n\nher new home. It is in this context that the Complainant provided her Personal\nData to the Organisation; so that the Organisation would know the location from\nwhich to pick up the Complainant’s belongings and the delivery address. No\nevidence has been adduced of the Complainant consenting to the disclosure of\nthe Personal Data on the Organisation’s public Facebook page. Further, the\nDeputy Commissioner finds that the Complainant is not deemed to have\nconsented to the said disclosure as the two limbs for making a finding of deemed\nconsent under section 15(1) of the PDPA have not been made out. In this\ncontext, it cannot be said that this manner of disclosure of the Complainant’s\nPersonal Data by the Organisation in its response to her review on its Facebook\npage was within the Complainant’s reasonable contemplation.\n15\n\nThe Organisation’s explanation that it replied to the Complainant’s\n\nFacebook post with the Personal Data as it wanted to confirm the identity of the\nComplainant does not address the reason the Organisation publicly disclosed\nthe Personal Data on its Facebook page. The Organisation’s objective of\nensuring the identity of the Complainant was not better served by disclosing the\nPersonal Data publicly on its Facebook page instead of privately communicating\nwith the Complainant directly. There was no legitimate reason for disclosing\nthe Personal Data to third parties. Given the Organisation’s admission of its lack\nof awareness of the PDPA and the obligations it imposes, it is more likely than\n\n2\n\nSection 15 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nnot, that the Organisation disclosed the Personal Data simply for convenience\nwithout further consideration.\n16\n\nIt is a trite principle of law that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Thus,\n\nthe Organisation’s lack of awareness of its obligations under the PDPA cannot\nexcuse its breach of the PDPA. The data protection provisions of the PDPA took\neffect on 2 July 20143 after a “sunrise” period of more than a year from 2\nJanuary 2013. Since then, organisations have had ample opportunities to\ndevelop and implement appropriate policies and practices to comply with the\nPDPA. In any event, an organisation’s lack of awareness of its data protection\nobligations is not a legitimate defence to a breach.\n17\n\nIt is apropos to address an issue which commonly arises in the context\n\nof an organisation’s communications through its commercial social media page.\nWhen is it ever acceptable to disclose personal data when an organisation is\nresponding to public comments? It is unlikely that the terms of ex ante consent\nor scope of deemed consent can cover such disclosures.\n18\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner advises caution in disclosing personal data\n\nwhen responding to public comments. An organisation should not be prevented\nor hampered from responding to comments about it using the same mode of\ncommunications that its interlocutor has selected. In some situations, it may be\nreasonable or even necessary to disclose personal data in order to advance an\nexplanation. An individual who makes false or exaggerated allegations against\nan organisation in a public forum may not be able to rely on the PDPA to prevent\nthe organisation from using material and relevant personal data of the individual\n\n3\n\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (Commencement) Notification 2014.\n\n5\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nto explain the organisation’s position on the allegations through the same public\nforum.\n19\n\nThe following observations may be made in this context about the\n\napproach that the Commission adopts. First, the Commission will not engage in\nweighing allegations and responses on golden scales in order to establish\nproportionality. The better approach is to act against disclosures that are clearly\ndisproportionate on an objective standard before the Commission intervenes in\nwhat is essentially a private dispute (in this case the dispute was the\nComplainant’s alleged dissatisfaction of the services provided by the\nOrganisation). Second, the disclosure may sometimes be justified by exceptions\nto consent. For example, disclosures in the course of the Organisation’s\ninvestigations into alleged breaches of agreement or into conduct that may give\nrise to tortious claims. Disclosures in reliance of exceptions to consent will\nnevertheless have to be limited in scope in order to achieve the purposes of the\napplicable exception. Third, even in the absence of consent (whether express or\ndeemed) or an applicable exception, it may nevertheless be objectively\nreasonable for the Organisation to disclose personal data in response to\nallegations made against it. Section 11(1) of the PDPA exhorts organisations in\ndischarging its responsibilities under the PDPA to “consider what a reasonable\nperson would consider appropriate in the circumstances.” This requires factspecific analysis and the burden is on the Organisation to justify that the\ncircumstances were atypical, the disclosure was warranted and its actions were\nreasonable.\n20\n\nIn the present case, the Complainant had posted a lengthy complaint on\n\nthe Organisation’s Facebook page, amounting to approximately 500 words. The\nOrganisation responded in three separate posts. Having perused the\nexplanations and considered the context of the disclosure of the Personal Data,\n\n6\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nit cannot be said that the disclosure of the Personal Data had any nexus to the\nallegations and explanations. Hence, the disclosure in its response was clearly\ndisproportionate. The Organisation’s response was not made in the context of\nan investigation into a civil dispute (although one patently existed), nor did it\nfall within any other exception. Finally, the Organisation’s disclosure was\nunwarranted and unreasonable as it was made, more likely than not, for\nconvenience without further consideration (see paragraph 15 above).\n21\n\nGiven the foregoing, the Deputy Commissioner finds that the disclosure\n\nof the Personal Data on the Organisation’s Facebook page was made in breach\nof its Consent Obligation under the PDPA.\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under sections\n11 and 12 of the PDPA\n22\n\nSection 11(3) of the PDPA requires an organisation to designate one or\n\nmore individuals (i.e. the DPO) to be responsible for ensuring compliance with\nthe PDPA and section 12(a) of the PDPA requires an organisation to develop\nand implement policies and practices that are necessary to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA (collectively, the “Openness Obligation”).\n23\n\nDuring the investigations, the Organisation admitted that it was not\n\naware of the PDPA and consequently, its data protection obligations4 under the\nPDPA. The Organisation also confirmed that, at the material time, it did not\nimplement any data protection policies or practices, nor did it appoint a DPO.\n24\n\nIn the circumstances, the Deputy Commissioner finds that, by its own\n\nadmission, the Organisation failed to meet its obligations under sections 11(3)\n\n4\n\nUnder Parts III to VI of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nand 12(a) of the PDPA. In this regard, the Deputy Commissioner repeats his\ncomments made at paragraph 16 above that a lack of awareness of the\nobligations imposed by the PDPA does not amount to a legitimate defence\nagainst a breach by the Organisation.\nData protection policies\n25\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner takes this opportunity to highlight that the\n\ndevelopment and implementation of data protection policies is a fundamental\nand crucial starting point for organisations to comply with their obligations\nunder the PDPA.\n26\n\nIn this regard, the Deputy Commissioner repeats the Commissioner’s\n\nguidance in Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at paragraph [32] on the role of\ngeneral data protection policies:\n“Data protection policies and practices developed and\nimplemented by an organisation in accordance with its\nobligations under section 12 of the PDPA are generally meant\nto increase awareness and ensure accountability of the\norganisation’s obligations under the PDPA…”\n\n27\n\nAt the very basic level, an appropriate data protection policy should be\n\ndrafted to ensure that it gives a clear understanding within the organisation of\nits obligations under the PDPA and sets general standards on the handling of\npersonal data which staff are expected to adhere to. To meet these aims, the\nframers, in developing such policies, have to address their minds to the types of\ndata the organisation handles which may constitute personal data; the manner\nin, and the purposes for, which it collects, uses and discloses personal data; the\nparties to, and the circumstances in, which it discloses personal data; and the\ndata protection standards the organisation needs to adopt to meet its obligations\nunder the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n28\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nAn overarching data protection policy will ensure a consistent minimum\n\ndata protection standard across an organisation’s business practices, procedures\nand activities (e.g. communications through social media).\n29\n\nA general data protection policy is, however, not the be all and end all\n\nof data protection. Specific practices, processes, procedures and measures need\nto be put in place by organisations to protect personal data. In this regard, the\nDeputy Commissioner agrees with the following comments made by the Office\nof the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s decision in the case of Google Inc.\nWiFi Data Collection5 on the necessity to put in place real and effective\nmeasures to ensure an organisation’s accountability for the personal data it\nhandles:\n“The obligation that organizations must have in place the\nproper practices, as a matter of accountability, concords with a\ngrowing international recognition that the protection of\npersonal information requires real and effective measures. It is\nthis Office’s view that organizations need to implement\nappropriate and effective measures to put into effect the\nprinciples and obligations of the Act, including effective\ncompliance and training programs, as an essential part of\nensuring that organisations remain accountable for the\npersonal information they collect, use or disclose.”\n\n30\n\nOrganisations with a social media or other online presence (e.g. social\n\nmedia forums), particularly those that rely on such platforms to communicate\nwith its customers, ought to develop appropriate policies, practices and\nprocedures that amply address the risks of disclosing personal data on social\nmedia or other online sites.

Recognition of the importance of data\nprotection and the central role performed by a DPO has to come from the very\ntop of an organisation and ought to be part of enterprise risk management\nframeworks. This will ensure that the board of directors and C-level executives\nare cognisant of the risks. The DPO ought to be appointed from the ranks of\n10\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nsenior management and be amply empowered to perform the tasks that are\nassigned to him/her. If not one of the C-level executives, the DPO should have\nat least a direct line of communication to them. This level of access and\nempowerment will provide the DPO with the necessary wherewithal to perform\nhis/her role and accomplish his/her functions. The DPO need not – and ought\nnot – be the sole person responsible for data protection within the organisation.\nProperly implemented, data protection policies will touch most, if not all, parts\nof an organisation. Every member of staff has a part to play. The DPO is the\nperson within an organisation responsible for implementing the policies and\npractices, just as the board and C-level executives are ultimately accountable to\nshareholders and owners for any failure to comply.\n34\n\nThe responsibilities of a DPO include, but are not limited to:6\n(a)\n\nensuring compliance with the PDPA when developing and\n\nimplementing policies and processes for handling personal data,\nincluding processes and formal procedures to handle queries and/or\ncomplaints from the public;\n(b)\n\nfostering a data protection culture and accountability among\n\nemployees and communicating personal data protection policies to\nstakeholders;\n(c)\n\nhandling and managing personal data protection related queries\n\nand complaints from the public, including making information about the\norganisation’s data protection policies and practices available on request\nto the public;\n\n6\n\nPDPC, Data Protection Officers at <https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/organisations/dataprotection-officers> at para 4.\n\n11\n\n\fM Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n(d)\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15\n\nalerting management to any risks that might arise with regard to\n\npersonal data; and\n(e)\n\nliaising with the Commissioner on data protection matters, if\n\nnecessary.\n35\n\nIn this regard, the Deputy Commissioner agrees with the position\n\nadopted in the Joint Guidance Note7 on the role and responsibilities of a DPO\n(or Privacy Officer in the Canadian context) in an organisation:\n“[organizations] must appoint someone who is responsible for\nthe privacy management program. Whether this person is a Clevel executive of a major corporation or the owner/operator of a\nvery small organization, someone must be assigned\nresponsibility for overseeing the organization’s compliance with\napplicable privacy legislation. Other individuals may be involved\nin handling personal information, but the Privacy Officer is the\none accountable for structuring, designing and managing the\nprogram, including all procedures, training, monitoring/auditing,\ndocumenting, evaluating, and follow-up. Organizations should\nexpect to dedicate some resources to training the Privacy\nOfficer.

Consequently, the\nprivacy management program’s importance must be recognized\nat all levels.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n36\n\nAgain, while the quote above is in respect of a Privacy Officer, it is\n\nequally applicable in the context of a DPO under the PDPA notwithstanding the\ndifferences between privacy and data protection.\n37\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that regardless of the size of an\n\norganisation, the DPO plays a vital role in building a robust data protection\nframework to ensure the organisation’s compliance with its obligations under\nthe PDPA.\nDirections\n38\n\nHaving found that the Organisation is in breach of sections 11(3), 12(a)\n\nand 13 of the PDPA, the Deputy Commissioner is empowered under section 29\nof the PDPA to give the Organisation such directions as he deems fit to ensure\ncompliance with the PDPA.

Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 16\nMr. Yeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No DP-1701B0440\n15 November 2017\nBackground\n1\n\nAn organisation’s requirement to prevent the unauthorised\n\ndisclosure or access of personal data under the Personal Data\nProtection Act (“PDPA”) is not absolute in nature; in that the obligation\nis not automatically breached upon the occurrence of a data leak. This\ncase provides a classic example of the application of this principle.\n2\n\nThe Complainant, a customer of the Organisation, discovered\n\nthat she had accessed the online BHG loyalty card account of another\ncustomer (“Customer V”) of the Organisation after she changed the\npassword to what she thought was her BHG loyalty card account. As a\nresult, the name, gender, date of birth, race, marital status, income group\n(based on income range) and residential address (collectively referred\nto as the “Personal Data”) of Customer V was inadvertently accessed\nby the Complainant.\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a department store with various outlets in\n\nSingapore. It operates a loyalty card programme called the BHG\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nRewards Card programme for customers who fulfil certain criteria (such\nas a minimum spend within an allocated period in order to qualify for the\nprogramme). Customers issued with a BHG Rewards Card earn points\non purchases made at the Organisation’s stores depending on the\namount spent. These points can then be used to redeem shopping\nvouchers for use at the Organisation’s stores. There are also other\nbenefits in joining the BHG Rewards Card programme, such as exclusive\npromotions and activities.\n4\n\nBoth the Complainant and Customer V met the prerequisites for\n\njoining the BHG Rewards Card programme and applied to join the\nprogramme on 26 December 2016.\nThe BHG Rewards Card registration process\n5\n\nCustomers who wish to register for the BHG Rewards Card\n\nprogramme are required to make their application at the Customer\nService Counter (“CSC”) at the Organisation’s stores. The registration is\ngenerally done by the customer on the Organisation’s electronic tablets\nby inputting certain personal data into an electronic registration form.\nAmongst other personal details, the customer is required to provide his\nmobile phone number and email address. The customer’s mobile phone\nnumber is used as the default User ID to access the customer’s BHG\nRewards Card account online.\n6\n\nWhen the customer is done keying the required personal data into\n\nthe electronic form, an employee of the Organisation at the CSC will\nassist the customer to submit the details. This would generate a\nmembership number and automatically “refresh” the screen; the details\nkeyed in by the customer would no longer be displayed. The\n2\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nmembership number is used as the default password to access the\ncustomer’s BHG Rewards Card account online.\n7\n\nAs a precaution, the employee assisting the customer with the\n\nregistration is required to also manually refresh the screen on the\nelectronic tablet by closing the registration form and opening a fresh\ninstance of the form before using the tablet again. The manual “refresh”\nprocedure is also to be undertaken if there are any technical problems\nin using the electronic tablet for the registration.\n8\n\nThe electronic tablet was also programmed to purge all the details\n\nkeyed into the form if there was inactivity for about 30 seconds.\nAccessing the customer’s online loyalty card account\n9\n\nAs set out above at paragraphs 5 and 6, a customer may access\n\nhis BHG Rewards Card account online by using his mobile phone\nnumber as his User ID and the membership number as his password. If\nthe customer forgets his membership number, he can request for a new\npassword to be sent to his email address which the customer would have\nkeyed in when registering for the loyalty card.\nThe registration of the Complainant’s and Customer V’s accounts\nwere affected because of technical problems with the electronic\ntablets at the Jurong Point store\n10\n\nOn 26 December 2016, both the Complainant and Customer V\n\nvisited the Organisation’s Jurong Point store and applied to join the BHG\nRewards Card programme. On the same day, the Assistant Retail\nManager (the “Assistant Retail Manager”) of the Jurong Point Store\nwho was tasked to assist customers in registering their BHG Rewards\n\n3\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nCard accounts had experienced technical problems with the two\nelectronic tablets used for registration. She informed the relevant\ndepartment of the technical issues.\n11\n\nWhen the Complainant approached her for assistance in\n\nregistering for the BHG Rewards Card, the Assistant Retail Manager\nhanded the Complainant one of the electronic tablets (“tablet 1”) to input\nthe required details into the electronic registration form. However,\ntechnical issues caused the electronic tablet to “hang” or become\nunresponsive a few times when the Complainant tried to input the\nrequired details. The Assistant Retail Manager decided to abandon the\nelectronic registration and instead asked the Complainant to fill in a\nphysical registration form and subsequently issued the Complainant with\na temporary BHG Rewards Card together with a membership number.\n12\n\nAccording to the Organisation, the technical issues experienced\n\nin typing the details into the electronic registration form was likely due to\none or both of the following:\n(a)\n\nThe\n\npostal\n\ncode\n\ndirectory\n\nuploaded\n\nonto\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s registration system was not up to date. The system\nfailed to recognise the postal code entered by the Complainant as\nher postal code was not included in the version which the\nOrganisation was using at the time, causing the electronic tablet\nto “hang”.\n(b)\n\nPoor Wi-Fi connection on the day meant that the electronic\n\ntablet would have had difficulty connecting to the Organisation’s\nregistration system.\n\n4\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n13\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nCustomer V who was at the CSC at the same time as the\n\nComplainant was also having problems with the other electronic tablet\n(“tablet 2”) which he was using to register for the BHG Rewards Card.\nA part time employee (“Employee A”) of the Organisation who was also\nstationed at the CSC was assisting Customer V. Employee A asked\nCustomer V to try using tablet 1 which was last used by the Complainant\ninstead. However, when Employee A handed tablet 1 to Customer V, the\nscreen was not refreshed properly and continued to display at least\nsome of the Complainant’s personal data. It is not known how much of\nthe Complainant’s personal data continued to be displayed, but as will\nbe explained in the next paragraph, at least the mobile phone number\nand email address of the Complainant continued to be displayed.\n14\n\nCustomer V proceeded to key the required details into the\n\nelectronic registration form using tablet 1. However, Customer V’s BHG\nRewards Card account was registered with the Complainant’s mobile\nphone number and email address.\n\nThis is likely because the\n\nComplainant’s mobile phone number and email address continued to\nappear on the form while Customer V was keying in his details. However,\nit is not clear why Customer V left the Complainant’s particulars on the\nform or why he did not alert Employee A or any other employee to the\nfact that the Complainant’s details were still visible on the form.\nCustomer V was able to complete and submit his electronic registration\nand was issued a BHG Rewards Card account number.\nThe Complainant accesses Customer V’s account information\n15\n\nOn the same day, the Complainant downloaded the app (“BHG\n\nApp”) which allowed customers to access their BHG Rewards Card\n\n5\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\naccounts and tried to log into her account. As explained above at\nparagraph 9, the default login credentials to the BHG App were the\nmobile phone number registered with the customer’s account (default\nuser ID) and the customer’s membership card account number (default\npassword). Given that the Complainant’s mobile phone number was tied\nto Customer V’s BHG Rewards Card account number, the login\ncredentials did not match and the Complainant was denied access to her\naccount.\n16\n\nThe Complainant, therefore, then submitted a password reset\n\nrequest to the Organisation by providing her mobile phone number and\nemail address in accordance with the Organisation’s password reset\nprocess. This password reset was successfully activated because the\nComplainant’s mobile phone number and email address matched the\ndetails with which Customer V’s account was registered. Once the\npassword was reset, the Complainant managed to log into what she\nthought was her account. However, once she accessed the Account, the\nComplainant realised that, except for her mobile phone number and\nemail address, the Account contained the personal data of Customer V.\nThe Complainant alerted the Organisation and this office of this\nunauthorised access.\nCommissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\n17\n\nThe issue to be determined in this case is whether the\n\nOrganisation complied with its protection obligation pursuant to section\n24 of the PDPA and implemented reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent the unauthorised access to the Personal Data.\n\n6\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n18\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nFor completeness, the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that the\n\n2 preconditions to the application of section 24 as stated in Re Hazel\nFlorist & Gifts Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 9 at [8] to [9] – that BHG\n(Singapore) Pte Ltd is an Organisation within the meaning of the PDPA\nand is in possession or control of the Personal Data – have been met\nand it is not in dispute that section 24 applies in this matter.\n19\n\nIt is also not disputed that the information to which the\n\nComplainant had access, as set out above at paragraph 2, falls within\nthe definition of “personal data” under section 2 of the PDPA as it was\npossible to identify Customer V from that information alone.\n20\n\nFurther, it is not disputed that the Complainant was not supposed\n\nto have access to the Personal Data; the access was therefore without\nauthorisation.\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA\nThe security arrangements implemented by the Organisation to prevent\nunauthorised access to the Personal Data\n21\n\nThe investigations by this office found that the following security\n\narrangements were implemented by the Organisation to prevent\nunauthorised access to the Personal Data:\n(a)\n\nAutomated “refresh” of the screen: The electronic\n\nregistration system was programmed such that the screen on the\nelectronic tablet would “refresh” once the electronic registration\nform was successfully submitted. This would mean that the\npersonal data keyed in by the customer would be deleted from\n\n7\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nthe registration form on the electronic tablet and would no longer\nbe displayed on the screen.\n(b)\n\nManual “refresh” of the screen: The Organisation’s staff\n\nassisting customers with their BHG Rewards Card registration at\nthe CSC are required to “refresh” the system on the electronic\ntablet before they hand the electronic tablet to the next customer.\nThis manual “refresh” is done by closing the open instance of the\nelectronic registration system and opening a fresh instance of the\nsystem. The manual “refresh” is also required to be done\nwhenever the staff encounter a technical issue with the electronic\ntablet. This manual “refresh” process and general guidance on\nhandling customer’s personal data was communicated to both the\nAssistant Retail Manager and Employee A through mandatory\ntraining programmes. The Assistant Retail Manager received onthe-job training sessions 3 days a week over a period of 10\nmonths, which included training in the electronic registration of\ncustomers’ BHG Rewards Card applications. Additionally, the\nAssistant Retail Manager was also trained by the Organisation’s\nin-house trainer on the electronic registration process. Employee\nA also received on-the-job training on the electronic registration\nprocess. Both staff completed the training before the incident\noccurred.\n(c)\n\nLogin credentials for the BHG App: The default login\n\ncredentials are set as a customer’s mobile phone number (user\nID) and membership card account number (password). Each\ncustomer who registers for the BHG Rewards Card will be\nassigned a unique 16-digit membership card account number that\n\n8\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nis automatically generated from the Organisation’s system once\na registration is completed.1\n(d)\n\nAuthentication for password reset requests: A customer\n\nmay request a password reset by providing the customer’s mobile\nphone number and email address, as a form of verification and\nauthentication by the system before a password reset is allowed.\n(e)\n\nAutomatic time-out: The electronic registration form is\n\nprogrammed to time out after about 30 seconds of inactivity, after\nwhich all the personal data keyed into the electronic registration\nform will be deleted.\nThe unauthorised access was caused by a confluence of events and\ncircumstances that would have been difficult to foresee\n22\n\nThe investigation determined that the unauthorised access was\n\ncaused as a result of the following events and circumstances:\n(a)\n\nThe Complainant’s electronic registration could not be\n\ncompleted meaning that the Complainant’s data was not\nautomatically cleared from the electronic registration form.\n(b)\n\nEmployee A did not correctly “refresh” tablet 1. In this\n\nregard the Assistant Retail Manager had handed tablet 1 to\nEmployee A and asked her to perform a manual “refresh”. The\n\n1\n\nSee Re ABR Holdings Limited [2016] SGPDPC 16 at [15] to [16], where it was held\nthat the organisation’s use of a single string of numbers as the only security\narrangement to identify and authenticate access to personal data may constitute\nreasonable security arrangements depending on the sensitivity of the personal data\nprotected only if the number is unique, unpredictable and reasonably well-protected.\n\n9\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nAssistant Retail Manager had on numerous occasions during the\nsame day asked Employee A to perform the manual “refresh” and\nchecked that it was done properly. On this occasion, the Assistant\nRetail Manager, given that Employee A had performed the\nmanual “refresh” properly on all of the earlier occasions and that\nthe CSC was very busy during this peak period, trusted Employee\nA to perform the manual “refresh” and did not check if it was done.\n(c)\n\nCustomer V did not alert either Employee A or the\n\nAssistant Retail Manager and continued with his registration\ndespite the Complainant’s data continuing to be displayed. This,\nto the Deputy Commissioner’s mind, is one of the baffling features\nof this case. Customer V did not provide his own mobile phone\nnumber and email address but left the contact details of someone\nelse in an online form that he was filling out himself. There is a\ncertain degree of responsibility that each person should exercise\nover his own personal data, even if this is no more than contact\ndetails that is freely disseminated. Customer V’s oversight in this\ncase was a key mistake in an unfortunate sequence of events.\n(d)\n\nOf all the fields of personal data keyed in by the\n\nComplainant, only the Complainant’s email address and mobile\ntelephone number were included in Customer V’s BHG Rewards\nCard account. Unfortunately, this was the exact information that\nallowed the inadvertent unauthorised access of the Personal\nData.\n23\n\nThe above explanation for the cause of the unauthorised access\n\nof the Personal Data shows that it was caused by a confluence of events\n\n10\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nand circumstances. It is clear that the Organisation recognised its\nobligation to protect its customers’ personal data and addressed its mind\nto the various scenarios in which the personal data of a BHG Rewards\nCard applicant could be disclosed or accessed without authorisation\nduring the registration process. It recognised that the automatic “refresh”\ncould potentially fail and as such the Organisation required its staff to\nperform a manual “refresh” as well. The requirement to perform a manual\n“refresh” and the process for doing so was communicated clearly to all\nstaff assisting at the Organisation’s CSCs. Besides the training\nprogrammes the Assistant Retail Manager and Employee A underwent,\nthe senior staff at the CSCs also supervise the other employees in\nperforming the manual “refresh” on a day-to-day basis. This supervision,\nwhich the Assistant Retail Manager performed during the day of the\nincident, served as another line of security during the registration\nprocess.\n24\n\nFinally, access to a customer’s BHG Rewards Card account\n\nwould only be granted if the user attempting to access the account knew\nthe said customer’s (i) mobile phone number; and (ii) the rewards card\nnumber or, in the case of a password reset request, the email address.\n25\n\nThe question that remains is whether the above arrangements\n\nwere reasonably appropriate in protecting the Personal Data from\nunauthorised access. In answering this question, the Deputy\nCommissioner notes that the wording of section 24 does not require an\norganisation to provide “an absolute guarantee”2 for the protection of\n\n2\n\nRe Tiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd and others [2017] SGPDPC 6 at [17].\n\n11\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control and takes reference\nfrom the Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA which\nrecommends that:3\n“…[e]ach organisation should consider adopting security\narrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the\ncircumstances, for example, taking into consideration the\nnature of the personal data, the form in which the personal\ndata has been collected (e.g. physical or electronic) and\nthe possible impact to the individual concerned if an\nunauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the\npersonal data.”\n26\n\nIn this case, the Personal Data, while important, were essentially\n\ndemographic and contact details. In such circumstances, would the\nOrganisation be required to implement security arrangements in addition\nto those that were already implemented at the time of the incident?\nLooking at the security arrangements that were implemented at the\nmaterial time, it is clear that the automatic “refresh”, the manual “refresh”\nand the supervisory checks would have all separately prevented the\nunauthorised access.\n27\n\nIn this incident, however, the circumstances were such that each\n\nof these arrangements failed individually. First, both tablets 1 and 2 were\nnot functioning properly during the day. Second, the Complainant’s\nregistration could not be submitted electronically and hence the\nelectronic registration form was not refreshed automatically. Third,\nCustomer V could not complete his registration with the tablet he was\ninitially given and instead used tablet 1 immediately after the\n\n3\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 27 July 2017) at\n[17.2].\n\n12\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nComplainant’s failed attempt to register using tablet 1. Fourth, Employee\nA did not properly perform a manual “refresh” of tablet 1 as was the\nprocess stipulated by the Organisation and as requested by the\nAssistant Retail Manager. This was despite Employee A performing the\nmanual “refresh” properly numerous times during the day. Fifth, the\nAssistant Retail Manager failed to check that the manual “refresh” was\ndone properly. Sixth, Customer V did not alert the staff at the CSC that\nthe Complainant’s personal details continued to appear on the electronic\nregistration form, and did not replace the details but continued to submit\nhis application with another person’s mobile phone number and email\naddress as part of his registration details. Seventh, the only details of the\nComplainant with which Customer V registered his account were the\nexact details which were required to allow the Complainant access to the\nPersonal Data.\n28\n\nLooking at the above, it is the Deputy Commissioner’s view that\n\nthis incident resulted from an unusual confluence of circumstances. Also,\nnothing in the investigations pointed to a systemic problem that caused\nthe unauthorised access to the Personal Data. This appeared to be a\none-off incident that would have been difficult to foresee. Therefore, the\nDeputy Commissioner is of the view that the security arrangements\nimplemented by the Organisation to prevent the unauthorised access of\nthe Personal Data were reasonable in the circumstances.\nRemedial Action by the Organisation\n29\n\nThe Organisation launched an internal investigation into the\n\nunauthorised access of the Personal Data when the Complainant alerted\n\n13\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nit to the incident. The Organisation undertook the following remedial\nactions:\n(a)\n\nResponding to the affected individual: The Organisation\n\ninformed Customer V of the unauthorised access to the Personal\nData and created new membership accounts for the Complainant\nand Customer V with the correct sets of personal data;\n(b)\n\nRemedial\n\naction\n\nconcerning\n\nstaff\n\ntraining:\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation scheduled refresher data protection training for all\nCSC staff and issued a warning to the Assistant Retail Manager\nfor her contributory role in the unauthorised access of the\nPersonal Data in order to deter the other CSC staff from deviating\nfrom the SOPs;\n(c)\n\nRemedial action concerning technical safeguards: The\n\nOrganisation instructed and scheduled its IT personnel to verify\nthe setting of its electronic tablets at all of its outlets and carry out\nextensive checks on all its electronic tablets to ensure proper\nfunction and correct settings. It also informed its vendor of the\ntechnical problems faced in using the tablets. The Organisation\nalso purchased and uploaded into its electronic registration\nsystem the most updated version of the postal code directory to\nprevent the same problem from recurring and provided every\noutlet with a new 4G Wi-Fi dongle to ensure a stable network\nconnection; and\n(d)\n\nFurther remedial action on operational processes: The\n\nOrganisation instructed its consultant to review the membership\nregistration process to consider only collecting names, mobile\n\n14\n\n\fBHG (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2017] SGPDPC16\n\nphone numbers and addresses in future registrations (with the\ncollection of other personal data optional) and to study a potential\nrevision of the verification process which grants customers\naccess to their membership accounts via the BHG App, including\nstronger authentication checks before a customer is able to\nrequest for a password reset.\nConclusion\n30\n\nOn balance, the Deputy Commissioner concludes that the\n\nOrganisation implemented security arrangements of a reasonable\nstandard to protect the personal data in its possession and under its\ncontrol, and therefore makes a finding of no breach in the present case.\nFurther, the Deputy Commissioner finds that the remedial actions\nundertaken by the Organisation satisfactorily addresses the residual\nharm caused by the unauthorised access to the Personal Data. There is,\ntherefore, no need for the Deputy Commissioner to issue any directions\nin this case.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n15\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $6,000 was imposed on Aviva for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of its insurance policyholder and his dependent.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance","Insurance"],"date":"2017-10-11","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---aviva-ltd---111017.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Aviva","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/10/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-aviva-oct","timestamp":"2017-10-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 14\nCase No DP-1611-B0323\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section\n50(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nAviva Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n[2017] SGPDPC 14\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner— Case No DP-1611-B0323\n11 October 2017\nBackground\n1\n\nCan an organisation fulfil its obligation to protect personal data by\n\nrelying solely on its employees to perform their duties diligently? That is\nultimately the question which the Commissioner had to determine in this\nmatter.\n2\n\nThe complaint which arose in this matter was that Aviva Ltd (“the\n\nOrganisation”) had disclosed personal data without authorisation\nbecause it had mistakenly mailed to one of its policyholders (the “First\nPolicyholder”) insurance documents which were meant for another\npolicyholder (the “Second Policyholder”). A family member of the First\nPolicyholder lodged a complaint on 8 November 2016 and the office of\nthe\n\nCommissioner\n\nproceeded\n\nto\n\ninvestigate\n\nthe\n\nmatter.\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner’s findings and the grounds of decision are set out below.\nMaterial Facts\n3\n\nThe Organisation is a multinational insurance company that offers\n\nvarious types of insurance plans to its policyholders.\n4\n\nOn 1 November 2016, the Organisation was alerted to the data\n\nbreach (the “Incident”) by a complaint from a family member of the First\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nPolicyholder. It undertook an internal investigation into the source of the\ndata breach, which was traced to its Processing Department. By way of\nbackground, the Organisation’s Processing Department is in charge of,\namongst other things, preparing follow-up letters that need to be sent to\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s\n\npolicyholders.\n\nThis\n\nis\n\ndone\n\nwhenever\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation requires further administrative details or personal\nparticulars from the policyholders as part of administering its insurance\npolicies. In the event that there are any additional documents to be sent\nto a specific policyholder, e.g. application forms or product summaries,\nstaff (the “processing staff”) in the Processing Department would\nenclose the additional documents with the follow-up letter and place\nthese in the same envelope. For each day of operation, there would be\na total of four processing staff handling approximately 16 follow-up\nletters together with the enclosed additional documents.\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s investigations revealed that the Incident\n\noccurred when one of the processing staff erroneously enclosed the\nSecond Policyholder’s documents to follow-up letters addressed to the\nFirst Policyholder. This led to the First Policyholder receiving two\nenvelopes from the Organisation. The first envelope (“Envelope 1”)\ncontained three documents; two documents were correctly addressed to\nthe First Policyholder, but the third document was meant for the Second\nPolicyholder. The second envelope (“Envelope 2”) contained two\ndocuments; the first document was correct but the second document\nwas an application form meant for the Second Policyholder.\n\n2\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n6\n\nThe table below lists the documents contained in Envelopes 1 and\n\n2 along with a description of the corresponding personal data (“Personal\nData”) that was disclosed without authorisation.\nType of Documents\nEnvelope 1.

In fact, the Organisation did not have in\nplace any checks on the enveloping work of the processing staff at any\ntime prior to the dispatch of the letters to policyholders.\n8\n\nFollowing its internal investigation, the Organisation revised its\n\nprocedures for the enveloping process to include random checks by the\nTeam Leader on any two of the envelopes processed during each day\nof operation.\nFindings and Assessment\nIssue for determination\n9\n\nThe issue to be determined is whether the Organisation had,\n\npursuant to section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”), put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the\nPersonal Data from unauthorised disclosure.\n10\n\nSection 24 requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n\n4\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA\nThe Personal Data was disclosed without authorisation\n11\n\nIt is not disputed that the information contained in Envelopes 1\n\nand 2, which included details such as full name, NRIC number/FIN, CPF\naccount number, nationality, contact number, date of birth, gender,\nmarital status, occupation and name of employer, falls within the\ndefinition of “personal data” under section 2 of the PDPA as it was\npossible to identify the two individuals (i.e. the Second Policyholder and\nthe Second Policyholder’s dependant) from that information alone.\n12\n\nIt is also not in dispute that the Personal Data of the Second\n\nPolicyholder and the Second Policyholder’s dependant contained in\nEnvelopes 1 and 2 was disclosed mistakenly; the disclosure was\ntherefore without authorisation. For completeness, the Commissioner\nnotes that there was no unauthorised disclosure of the First\nPolicyholder’s personal data in the present case.\n13\n\nBased on the investigations carried out by the office of the\n\nCommissioner, the Commissioner finds that the unauthorised disclosure\nof the Personal Data was a result of a breach of the Organisation’s\nobligation to make reasonable security arrangements for the protection\nof the Personal Data. The reasons for this finding are set out below.\nPersonal data of a sensitive nature should be safeguarded by a higher\nlevel of protection\n14\n\nThe Commissioner assessed that the Personal Data of the\n\nSecond Policyholder and the Second Policyholder’s dependant in\nEnvelopes 1 and 2 contained sensitive personal data. As detailed in the\n\n5\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\ntable at paragraph 6, the following sensitive personal data had been\ninadvertently disclosed: the Second Policyholder’s insurance details,\nNRIC number, CPF account number, and the name and FIN of the\nSecond Policyholder’s dependant.\n15\n\nFurthermore, investigations found that Sections G (Underwriting\n\nOptions) and H (Full Medical Underwriting Only) of the Second\nPolicyholder’s MyShield Application Form could have included sensitive\nmedical information provided by the applicant. According to the\nOrganisation, its usual practice was to have the MyShield Application\nForm filled up, including Sections G and H. However, in the present\ncase, these sections were left blank as the Organisation had not\nobtained the relevant information. Had Sections G and H been pre-filled,\nadditional sensitive medical information would have been disclosed to\nthe First Policyholder due to the Incident. This was fortuitous for the\nOrganisation\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nindividuals\n\nconcerned\n\n(i.e.\n\nthe\n\nSecond\n\nPolicyholder and the Second Policyholder’s dependant).\n16\n\nIn addition, Section E (Payment Details) of the Second\n\nPolicyholder’s MyShield Application Form was also left blank. If this\nsection had been pre-filled, further sensitive personal data such as the\nSecond Policyholder’s credit card details (credit card number and expiry\ndate) could have also been disclosed to the First Policyholder.\n17\n\nEven though there is no special category for sensitive personal\n\ndata in the PDPA, past decisions and advisory guidelines have\nhighlighted that certain types of personal data would typically be more\n\n6\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nsensitive in nature. These include: NRIC/Passport numbers;1 personal\ndata of a financial nature such as bank account details,2 Central\nDepository account details, securities holdings, transaction and payment\nsummaries;3 names of the policyholder’s dependants or beneficiaries,\nthe sum insured under the insurance policy, the premium amount and\ntype of coverage;4 an individual’s personal history involving drug use and\ninfidelity;5 sensitive medical conditions;6 and personal data of minors.7\n18\n\nThe Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA states\n\nthat an organisation should “implement robust policies and procedures\nfor ensuring appropriate levels of security for personal data of varying\nlevels of sensitivity”.8 This means that a higher standard of protection is\nrequired for more sensitive personal data. More sensitive personal data,\nsuch as insurance, medical and financial data, should be accorded a\ncommensurate level of protection. In addition, the Guide to Preventing\nAccidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending Personal Data\nexpressly states that documents that contain sensitive personal data\n\n1\n\nRe JP Pepperdine Group Pte.

The personal data leaked included:\nthe individual’s name; address; date of birth; height and weight; salary;\nsignature; life insurance amounts (current coverage and requested\ncoverage); medical information (including the information declared on a\nparamedical exam and the results of a medical test); and an\nunderwriter’s notes and decision on the application.\n\n9\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and\nSending Personal Data at [2.2], first bullet point, p. 5.\n\n10\n\nPIPEDA Report of Findings #2014-003: Insurance company overhauls its\nsecurity safeguards following privacy breach <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opcactions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-intobusinesses/2014/pipeda-2014-003/>, first and second bullet points in the\n“Lessons Learned” section at p. 2.\n\n8\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nThe unauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data was the result of the\nOrganisation’s failure to make reasonable security arrangements\n20\n\nThe Organisation represented that the enveloping error\n\ncommitted by its processing staff was an “isolated incident due to\ngenuine oversight”. However, upon a review of the Organisation’s\npolicies and processes, it was discovered that the Incident occurred due\nto the Organisation’s lack of security arrangements in relation to the\nmailing of follow-up letters to its policyholders. In particular, the\nOrganisation’s processing Standard Operating Procedures (“SOPs”)\nwere ineffective as a safeguard to protect the Personal Data; this was a\nsystemic problem.\ni.\n\nThe Organisation’s processing SOPs were ineffective as a\n\nsafeguard\n21\n\nThe Commissioner finds that the Organisation’s enveloping\n\nprocess as disclosed in the processing SOPs at the time of the Incident\ndid not incorporate reasonable security arrangements for the following\nreasons.\n22\n\nAt the time of the Incident, each processing staff handling\n\nenveloping would check that he/she has enclosed the correct documents\nto the follow-up letters. No other staff would be responsible for further\nchecks or ensuring that the correct documents had been enclosed with\nsuch letters before the envelopes were sealed and mailed out. When\nmade aware of any errors by a staff member, the Team Leader would\nconduct a complete audit on the enveloping output of the staff in question\nfor a period of one week.\n\n9\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n23\n\nThe Organisation’s processing SOPs at the time of the Incident\n\ndid not include any second-level checks by the Team Leader on any of\nthe follow-up letters that were prepared by the processing staff. This\nmeant that there was no oversight of the enveloping process nor any\nsupervision of the actions of each processing staff. As a matter of fact,\nthe processing staff in charge of preparing and printing the follow-up\nletters and enclosing the additional documents was the only person\nchecking the contents of the envelopes before they were mailed out to\nthe policyholders.\n24\n\nThis failure by the Organisation to put in place effective SOPs for\n\nthe enveloping process was specifically highlighted in the Guide to\nPreventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and Sending\nPersonal Data as follows:11\n“Organisations that process and send documents or\ncommunications containing personal data should ensure\nthat they have policies and procedures in place to prevent\nthe sending of the documents or communications to the\nwrong recipients.\nFor example, organisations that prepare account\nstatements (e.g. bank or insurance statements) to be\nmailed to individuals should take steps to ensure that the\nstatements or the envelopes they are placed in, or the\nemails they are attached in, are not sent to the wrong\nrecipients by using incorrect postal or email addresses; or\nenclosing the statement of another individual.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n11\n\nPDPC, Guide to Preventing Accidental Disclosure When Processing and\nSending Personal Data at [1.1]-[1.2].\n\n10\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n25\n\nThe same guide recommended the establishment of procedures\n\nfor an organisation’s staff to perform, as a best practice, “additional\nchecks” following the processing, printing and sorting of documents to\nensure that the destination information matches that of the intended\nrecipient prior to mailing,12 and that the right document containing the\npersonal data is sent.13 To be clear, the Commissioner is not setting\ndown any rule that mandates organisations to establish procedures to\nperform “additional checks” in all cases. While it is recommended as a\nbest practice, organisations should determine and adopt the most\nreasonable and appropriate policies and procedures given their specific\ncircumstances.\n26\n\nIn this case, the Commissioner finds that the absence of a second\n\nlayer of basic checks to ensure that the letters and the enclosed\ndocuments were correctly addressed and mailed to the right policyholder\npointed to a systemic weakness in the Organisation’s processing SOPs\nand constituted a failure on the part of the Organisation to put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data.\n27\n\nThe processing SOPs were designed in such a way that the\n\nOrganisation was entirely reliant on its processing staff to check that the\nfollow-up letters had the correct documents enclosed. Although the\nOrganisation claimed that it provided the necessary training and\ncoaching to its processing staff to ensure their proficiency in performing\ntheir duties, the high risk of sensitive personal data being disclosed\n\n12\n\nIbid. at [2.1], second bullet point, p. 4.\n\n13\n\nIbid. at [2.1], fifth bullet point, p. 4.\n\n11\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nwithout authorisation was wholly unmitigated and dependent on the\ninfallibility and consistency of the processing staff performing the\nenveloping work. The fact that the Organisation considered this to be an\nadequate form of protection is of concern, given that the Organisation is\na well-established multinational organisation in the insurance business\nwhich handles large amounts of sensitive client personal data on a daily\nbasis.\n28\n\nThe Commissioner finds that it is insufficient for the Organisation\n\nto solely depend on its employees to carry out their duties diligently as a\ntype of safeguard against an unauthorised disclosure of personal data.\nAs observed in Re Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [21], it is “not\nenough for the Organisation to simply rely on its staff and employees to\ncarry out their duties correctly for the protection of personal data”. In that\ncase, the organisation had represented that if its employees had carried\nout their job functions properly, by printing and sending the correct\ninvoice to the correct recipient, there would not have been any data\nprotection issue in the first place.14 Such an argument was soundly\nrejected.\n29\n\nIn the present case, investigations found that the processing staff\n\nin question had ten years of experience in enveloping work. The fact that\nthis error was made by a highly experienced staff is telling. If a highly\nexperienced staff made such a mistake, the probability of a less\nexperienced staff committing a similar error is much higher. This adds\nfurther weight to the position that any SOPs or work process which solely\n\n14\n\nRe Furnituremart.sg [2017] SGPDPC 7 at [20].\n\n12\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nrelies on individual staff being infallible cannot constitute a reasonable\nsecurity arrangement for the protection of personal data.\n30\n\nAs such, the Commissioner is of the view that the Organisation\n\nfailed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal\nData having relied solely on the processing staff to diligently perform\nhis/her functions to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the Personal\nData.\nii.\n\nThe Organisation’s data protection policy provided inadequate\n\nprotection\n31\n\nFor completeness, the Commissioner notes that at the material\n\ntime, the Organisation had in place a general data protection policy\n(“PDPA Compliance Policy”). This was a high-level policy which listed\nout the nine data protection obligations in the PDPA and the\nresponsibilities of employees. However, the PDPA Compliance Policy\nmerely sets out some dos and don’ts concerning the protection\nobligation, examples of which follow:\n“Do continue to comply with the various information\nsecurity policies and standards issued by Aviva.\n…\nDo not share / disclose individual’s personal data to\nanyone, including other staff, unless it is relevant and\nnecessary for their performance of the duties.”\nThese dos and don’ts did not provide sufficient instructions or guidance\nfor the processing staff concerning their specific duties.\n\n13\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n32\n\nSecurity arrangements may take various forms. Data protection\n\npolicies and practices developed and implemented by an organisation in\naccordance with its obligations under section 12 of the PDPA are\ngenerally meant to increase awareness and ensure accountability of the\norganisation’s obligations under the PDPA. However, in some cases,\nsuch policies may also serve as an administrative security measure to\nprotect personal data.\n33\n\nWhere a data protection policy is meant to serve as an\n\nadministrative security measure to protect personal data, organisations\nshould note the importance of providing employees with specific\npractical guidance on handling personal data in the course of their\nemployment as set out in Re Hazel Florist & Gifts Pte Ltd [2017]\nSGPDPC 9 at [18]:\n“The Commission notes that the Organisation has in place\na Data Protection Policy. The Data Protection Policy\nmerely restates the Organisation’s data protection\nobligations in very general terms. The Organisation’s Data\nProtection Policy does not provide the Organisation’s\nemployees with specific practical guidance on how to\nhandle personal data in their day-to-day work or how to\ncomply with section 24 of the PDPA. The Commission is,\ntherefore, of the view that the Organisation’s Data\nProtection Policy does not constitute a “security\narrangement” under section 24 of the PDPA…”\n34\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation’s PDPA Compliance Policy\n\ndid not contain any mention of the preparation of the envelopes for the\nsending of follow-up letters to the Organisation’s policyholders, nor any\nreference to the checking or verification of the enclosed documents.\nWhilst there was some attempt to elaborate on the protection obligation\nthrough the provision of basic dos and don’ts, the PDPA Compliance\n\n14\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nPolicy did not go further to provide practical guidance on how an\nemployee could comply with section 24 of the PDPA in the course of\nhis/her daily work. Due to this lack of specificity and detail, the\nCommissioner is not satisfied that the PDPA Compliance Policy\nconstituted a reasonable security arrangement under section 24 of the\nPDPA.\nConclusion of the Commissioner’s Findings\n35\n\nConsidering the level of sensitivity of the personal data that the\n\nOrganisation handled on a daily basis with regard to follow-up letters and\nthe enclosed documents, the Organisation did not put in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Personal Data. The\nabsence of any second-level checks in the Organisation’s processing\nSOPs at the material time and the lack of any other form of security\narrangement to prevent the erroneous mailing of one policyholder’s\ndocuments to another amounted to extremely weak internal work\nprocess controls and fell far short of the standard of protection required\nfor such sensitive personal data.\n36\n\nIn consideration of the above, the Commissioner is not satisfied\n\nwith the Organisation’s claim that the unauthorised disclosure was\ncaused by an isolated, one-off case of human error. The Commissioner\nfinds that the Organisation failed to make reasonable security\narrangements to protect the Personal Data in its possession or under its\ncontrol, in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n15\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\nRemediation Actions Taken by the Organisation\n37\n\nThe Commissioner notes that after the data breach incident, the\n\nOrganisation counselled the staff in question, carried out an audit on the\nstaff’s enveloping output for one week, and revised its SOPs to add an\nadditional layer of checks by the Team Leader of the enveloping\nprocess. Pursuant to the revised SOPs, the Team Leader would, on\neach day of operation, randomly check two envelopes whenever there\nare documents to be enclosed to the follow-up letters to ensure that the\npersonal data of its Policyholders and their dependants are not\nmistakenly sent to others. Also, the week-long audit by the Team Leader\non the processing staff who makes a mistake has now been\noperationalised as part of the SOPs. The relevant portions from the\nrevised SOPs (which took effect from 3 December 2016) are reproduced\nbelow for reference:\n“7. Verification of Data Creation and Processing\nCases created in AS400 will be checked randomly by the\nrespective team leaders.\nEach team leader will check 5 cases of data creation per\nday. The team leader will ensure that he/she checks at\nleast a case for each team member. The cases checked\nwill be updated in an excel spreadsheet in our common\ndrive.\nShould there be new team member, his /her mentor will\ncheck his/her work thoroughly until he/she is able to deliver\nthe work accurately. This process is independent from the\nexisting staff verification.\nEach team leader will check 2 cases of enveloping\nrandomly per day. If error is detected, the team leader will\nconduct 100% audit on the erred staff enveloping output\nfor a period of one week. The cases checked will be\nupdated in the excel spreadsheet in our common drive.”\n[Emphasis added]\n16\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n38\n\nGiven the estimated average work load of 16 follow-up letters per\n\nday, a random check of 2 envelopes amounts to a sample size of about\n10%.\n39\n\nThe Commissioner has not reviewed the Organisation’s\n\nconsiderations in deciding on the sample size and is not making any\nopinion on the revised SOPs as it is unnecessary to do so for the\npurposes of making a breach finding against the Organisation.\n40\n\nAs a general observation, the Commissioner highlights that\n\norganisations should take into account all relevant circumstances and\nconsiderations when devising and implementing fresh or enhanced\nsecurity arrangements in relation to the enveloping process to ensure\ncompliance with section 24 of the PDPA. Such circumstances and\nconsiderations include the likelihood of unauthorised access, collection,\nuse, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal of the Personal Data\nand similar risks in relation to the enveloping process; the sensitivity of\nthe Personal Data and the impact to the individual if an unauthorised\nperson obtained, modified or disposed of the Personal Data; the size of\nthe organisation; and the amount of Personal Data that it is subject to\nthe enveloping process.\n41\n\nThe Organisation may also wish to consider a graduated\n\napproach to sample checking. For example, the enveloping work of new\nmembers of staff and members of staff who have recently made\nmistakes may be subject to stringent checks while the work of senior\nmembers of staff with relatively few records of such mistakes may be\nsubject to more moderate checks. It is not automatous checks that are\nof utmost importance but the efforts that an organisation puts into the\n\n17\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\ndevelopment of considered SOPs which focus on the protection of\npersonal data, which in turn contributes to the development of a positive\ndata protection culture amongst its staff.\n42\n\nWith this in mind, it is advisable for the Organisation to monitor\n\nthe effectiveness of its revised SOPs and to make further revisions as\nnecessary.\n43\n\nFor completeness, the Commissioner notes that the Organisation\n\nalso sent an apology letter to the First Policyholder and retrieved the\nwrongly delivered documents. As for the Second Policyholder, the\nOrganisation sent an apology letter along with shopping vouchers worth\nS$100.\nDirections\n44\n\nThe Commissioner is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA\n\nto give the Organisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure the\nOrganisation’s compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing\nthe Organisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding\nS$1 million as the Commissioner thinks fit.\n45\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be\n\nimposed on the Organisation in this case, the Commissioner took into\naccount the following aggravating and mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Personal Data disclosed, especially the Second\n\nPolicyholder’s NRIC number; CPF account number; and the full\nname and FIN of the Second Policyholder’s dependant, was\nsensitive in nature;\n\n18\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation is in the business of handling large\n\nvolumes of personal data, the disclosure of which may cause\nexceptional damage, injury or hardship to the affected individuals;\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation had cooperated fully with investigations\n\nand was forthcoming in admitting its mistake;\n(d)\n\nthe Organisation had notified the affected victim, i.e. the\n\nSecond Policyholder, of the data breach incident, and offered an\napology\n\nand\n\nshopping\n\nvouchers,\n\nand\n\nhad\n\nalso\n\nmade\n\narrangements to retrieve the wrongly delivered documents from\nthe First Policyholder;\n(e)\n\nthe unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data was limited\n\nto possibly three individuals, comprising of the First Policyholder\nand the First Policyholder’s nuclear family; and\n(f)\n\nthere was no evidence to suggest that there had been any\n\nactual loss or damage resulting from the unauthorised disclosure.\n46\n\nPursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and the investigation and\n\nassessment of this matter having been completed, the Commissioner is\nsatisfied that the Organisation did not make reasonable security\narrangements and is in breach of section 24 of the PDPA. Having\ncarefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\nCommissioner hereby directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty\nof S$6,000 within 30 days from the date of the directions, failing which\ninterest shall be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty.\n\n19\n\n\fAviva Ltd\n\n47\n\nThe Commissioner urges organisations to take the necessary\n\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA.\nAppropriate enforcement action against non-compliant organisation(s)\nwill be taken.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n20\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $1,000 was imposed on a former financial consultant, for failing to take reasonable security measures to protect the personal data of his clients when disposing of their insurance policy related douments.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance","Agent"],"date":"2017-08-14","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---ang-rui-song-140817-edit.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by a Former Financial Consultant","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/08/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-a-former-financial-consultant","timestamp":"2017-08-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\nCase No DP-1610-B0257\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nAng Rui Song\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fEditorial note: This decision contains editorial correction(s), as indicated\nby the markups below.\n\nAng Rui Song\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\nTan Kiat How, Commissioner — Case No DP-1610-B0257\n14 August 2017.\nBackground\n1\n\nThis is a case of a Financial Consultant (an “Organisation” under the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012, and hereinafter, the “Respondent”) who\n\nimproperly disposed of his clients’ insurance policy related documents, which\ncontained sensitive personal data (“Prudential folders”). The documents were\ndiscovered by the Complainant at a rubbish bin of a residential estate.\n2\n\nFollowing an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner found that\n\nthe Financial Consultant is in breach of Section 24 of the Personal Data\n\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). The Commissioner’s findings of this matter are\nset out below.\n\nMaterial Facts and Documents\n3\n\nThe Respondent was a Financial Consultant with Prudential Assurance\n\nCompany (Pte) Ltd (“Prudential”). The terms of his engagement as a Financial\n\nConsultant was such that the Respondent was an independent contractor and not\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nan employee of Prudential. During his engagement as a Financial Consultant,\nthe Respondent came into possession of his clients’ Prudential folders.\n\nHowever, at the time that the Respondent disposed of these documents, he was\nno longer with the organisation.\n4\n\nOn 10 October 2016, the Commissioner was informed by the\n\nComplainant that the Prudential folders had been disposed of by leaving beside\nthe rubbish bin at level 2 of the multi-storey car-park at Blk 821A Jurong West\n\nStreet 81. Upon further inspection, the Complainant found that the Prudential\nfolders contained 13 Certificates of Life Assurance issued by the\n\nOrganisationPrudential, and bore the names of 12 individuals, in addition to 2\nletters addressed to 2 of the aforementioned individuals.\n5\n\nThe folders contained information on 12 of the OrganisationPrudential’s\n\npolicy-holders. Taken collectively, the information identified the individual\npolicy-holders, which included the following pieces of personal data:\n(a)\n\nName of policy holder;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC Number;\n\n(c)\n\nBenefits;\n\n(d)\n\nSum assured;\n\n(e)\n\nCover Start Date;\n\n(f)\n\nCover Expiry Date; and\n\n(g)\n\nPremium.\n\n2\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nThe full list of information is set out in the Schedule of this Grounds of\nDecision.\n6\n\nThe 2 letters were addressed to 2 of the 12 policy-holders mentioned\n\nabove, and contained the following personal data:\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nName of Policy Owner;\n\n(b)\n\nAddress;\n\n(c)\n\nPolicy Number; and\n\n(d)\n\nName of Life Assured (same as the Policy Owner).\n\nDuring investigations, the Respondent confirmed that he had disposed\n\nof the folders containing the abovementioned personal data at the location where\n\nthey were found by the Complainant. The disposal was made under the\n\ninstructions of the Complainant’s clients. However, he claimed that he had\ndisposed of them in the bin, and not by leaving them beside the rubbish bin. The\nComplainant also claimed that he had placed the documents in a plastic bag\nbefore disposal.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Findings and Basis for Determination\nThe Respondent’s obligation to protect personal data under Section 24 of\nthe PDPA\n8\n\nAs a preliminary issue, the Commissioner had considered the following\n\nquestion: was the Respondent acting as an “organisation” for the purposes of\n\nthe PDPA in respect of the personal data contained in the Prudential folders? If\n\nso, then, as an “organisation”, he has an obligation to protect the personal data\nunder Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n3\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\n9\n\nThe definition of “organisation” under the PDPA expressly includes\n\n10\n\nAt the time the Respondent joined Prudential, he was, according to his\n\n“any individual” and would apply to an individual such as the Respondent.\n\ncontract, acting as an independent contractor of Prudential, and not as an\nemployee. In dealing with his clients’ personal data, he had control and\nautonomy over the management of the personal data. For example, he had\n\ncontrol over how the policy folders were stored and kept in his care, and the\nprovision and receipt of the policy documents from his clients. Accordingly, the\n\nRespondent was an “organisation” under the PDPA, and had an obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA to protect the personal data he had collected.\n11\n\nThis obligation stayed with the Respondent (as an “organisation”)\n\nthroughout the time that he was with Prudential, and even after he had left his\nengagement with Prudential. This is in line with the principles in Re Chua Yong\nBoon Justin [2016] SGPDPC 13, where the Respondent was a registered\n\nsalesperson who obtained personal data of the Complainant and his wife in the\ncourse of his real estate agency work and hence in the course of carrying on his\n\nbusiness. Having obtained such personal data in a capacity that is not “personal\nor domestic”, the Personal Data Protection Commission held that the\nRespondent was not allowed to claim that the subsequent disclosure of the\npersonal data was made in a “personal or domestic capacity”, which would have\n\nallowed him to dispense with the need to obtain consent under Section 4(1)(a)\nof the PDPA. In Re Chua Yong Boon Justin [2016] SGPDPC 13, the Personal\n\nData Protection Commission held that the Respondent continued to hold such\npersonal data in the course of his business, and needed to comply with his\nConsent Obligation when disclosing the personal data. Similarly, in the present\n\ncase, the Respondent had obtained the personal data during the course of his\n\nwork as a Financial Consultant and an “organisation” under the PDPA – viz not\n4\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nin a personal or domestic capacity. He therefore had a duty to protect the\n\npersonal data throughout – whilst with Prudential and after he left Prudential.\n\nThe Respondent cannot unilaterally change the capacity in which he possesses\nthe personal data, even after he ceased being a financial consultant with\n\nPrudential. The Respondent remained obliged to comply with Section 24 of the\nPDPA at all material times.\n12\n\nIn respect of the role of Prudential, the Commissioner found Prudential\n\nnot to be responsible (or liable) for the proper disposal of the policy documents,\n\nor the data breach incident that has occurred. Prudential had reasonable policies\n\nin place which dealt with proper and secure disposal of clients’ policy\ndocuments. The pertinent policies required financial advisors to return client\ndata to Prudential when they ceased being financial advisors, or (alternatively)\n\nto dispose of personal data properly and securely – for example, by shredding.\n\nPrudential had communicated these policies through appropriate channels.\nIndeed, in accepting the Respondent’s resignation, Prudential had issued a letter\n\nspecifically referring to the need to “return all monies, documents and other\n\neffects and property belonging to [Prudential] including such property\ncontaining customer information…” (emphasis added).\n13\n\nIn the Commissioner’s view, therefore, it was the Respondent who had\n\nfull responsibility in the protection and proper disposal of the personal data\n\nfound in the Prudential folders. We now turn to the analysis of whether the\nRespondent has complied with this obligation.\n\nWhether the Respondent’s manner of disposal of Prudential folders was a\nbreach of Section 24 of the PDPA\n14\n\nWhen it comes to the disposal of documents containing personal data,\n\nthere is a need to ensure that the disposal is carried out properly and in a secure\n5\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nmanner in order to meet the requirements of Section 24. Section 24 requires an\n\norganisation to “make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\n\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks”. In this case, a reasonable security arrangement meant proper and secure\n\ndisposal of the Prudential folders, which would prevent any of the risks\nmentioned.\n15\n\nThe PDPC’s Guide to Disposal of Personal Data on Physical Medium\n\n(“PDPC’s Guide to Disposal”) sets out some useful principles undergirding\n\nthe proper disposal of documents containing personal data in this regard. Some\nof these principles are relevant to the present case and are set out below. As\n\nmentioned in the PDPC’s Guide to Disposal, in order to comply with Section\n24 of the PDPA, it may not be enough for an organisation to simply discard\n\ndocuments containing personal data in the physical trash bin. This may lead to\n\nan incomplete or improper disposal of personal data, which opens up to potential\ndata breaches:\n(a)\n\nDeleted electronic files or improperly shredded paper may be\n\n(b)\n\nUncontrolled disposal of paper without destruction may lead to\n\nrestored (in full or partially); and\n\nrecovery of documents through ‘dumpster diving’ (eg sifting through\n\nphysical waste or recycling containers for items that have been\ndiscarded, but are still of value or covered by regulation).\n16\n\nInstead, for personal data stored on physical media and in paper form,\n\nthe PDPC’s Advisory Guidelines on the Key Concepts in the PDPAGuide to\n\nDisposal, advises organisations to ensure proper disposal of the documents that\nare no longer needed, through shredding or other appropriate means. This\nincludes one or more of the following processes:\n6\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\n(a)\n\nIncineration (or burning): reduces paper to ashes;\n\n(b)\n\nShredding: cuts paper in a way that makes it reasonably difficult,\n\nor even impossible to reassemble the pieces in order to reconstruct (a\n\nsubstantial part of) the information, but allows for the paper to be\nrecycled as long as the pieces are not too small; or\n(c)\n\nPulping: paper is mixed with water and chemicals to break down\n\nthe paper fibres before it is processed into recycled paper.\n17\n\nThe PDPC’s Guide to Disposal also cautions that leaving documents\n\ncontaining personal data unattended while they await being discarded or\n\ndestroyed may provide opportunities for a third party to gain access to the\n\ninformation, eg leaving them at the rear entrance of the office, or at the bottom\n\nof the building, for collection by the paper disposal vendor. Generally, if the\nunauthorised disclosure of the information contained on the paper document\ncould result in significant impact to an individual, organisations should consider\n\nshredding the document to cut the paper into separate small pieces, which make\n\nit more difficult to reassemble. The more sensitive the information, the higher\nthe level of shredding that needs to be done.\n18\n\nIn this case, the Respondent’s mode of disposal is wholly inadequate,\n\nespecially given the type and sensitivity of the personal data found in the\nPrudential folders, and based on the circumstances. There are several reasons\nfor the Commissioner’s finding in this regard.\n19\n\nBased on the Respondent’s representations, the documents were simply\n\nput in a plastic bag, tied up and placed inside the trash bin. The documents (and\n\ntheir contents) were left in their original readable form, and anyone easily open\nthe plastic bag to access the contents of the documents, especially the sensitive\n7\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\npersonal data of clients. It is foreseeable that random members of the public\n\nmay dive into rubbish bins to retrieve disposed items that are recyclable, which\nis likely to include paper waste.\n20\n\nAdditionally, with regards to the use of the plastic bag, this did not\n\nactually have the effect of securing the documents – just a mere concealment of\n\nthe documents. While the mere concealment of documents may, in certain\ncontexts, be enough when disposing of documents that contain little or no\npersonal data of individuals, this was not appropriate in the present case.\n21\n\nThe manner of disposal was inappropriate given the sensitivity of\n\ninformation found in the documents, such as the policy holder’s name, NRIC\n\nnumber, premium amounts, name of life assured, benefits and sums assured,\nand maturity date. Based on what was pronounced earlier at paragraphs 16 to\n\n18 above, the sensitivity of such personal data warrants there to be a greater\n\nform of protection in the disposal of these documents. In the Commissioner’s\nview, this can only be achieved by shredding the documents. As to the level of\n\nshredding, this should be guided by the level of sensitivity of the personal data\n\ncontained in the document.1 In the present case, the Respondent failed to carry\nout such shredding of the documents when disposing of these documents.\n22\n\nAdditionally, Prudential had provided its agents and financial\n\nconsultants designated “locked console boxes” for the secure shredding of\nunwanted documents. Prudential had informed its agents and financial\n\nconsultants of this service and encouraging them to use it by way of a circular\nthat was sent out on 12 January 2016.\n\n1\n\nSee Paragraphs 7.3 to 7.5 of the PDPC’s Guide to Disposal\n\n8\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n23\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nThe Respondent did not use this service for disposing of the policy\n\ndocuments at any point in time. Before leaving Prudential, Prudential had, as\npart of its standard practice, informed the Respondent to return the documents\n\ncontaining customer data to them, but the Respondent did not do so. When asked\n\nwhy he had not used the locked console boxes provided by Prudential, the\nRespondent mentioned that the locked console boxes were found in the main\n\noffice of Prudential, and he was working at the branch office of Prudential. In\nother words, his excuse was that he seldom went over to the main office and\nthus it was inconvenient for him to make use of the locked console boxes. The\n\nCommissioner does not find this excuse to be acceptable, particularly since this\ncould have been done as part of his end-of-contract administration.\n24\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent had available the means of securely\n\ndisposing of the documents, ie by way of the locked console boxes, shredding\n\nor similar means, but he chose not to use such methods of disposal. Instead, he\nhad carried out the disposal in an unsecured manner described above. It would\n\nappear that his choice not to use the locked console boxes as provided by\n\nPrudential was borne out of convenience. The fact that Prudential had provided\nsuch means of disposing of the documents should have given the Respondent\n\nan indication that such documents ought to at least be securely disposed by\nshredding. However, the Respondent did not adhere to such a standard of\ndisposal of documents.\n25\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commissioner finds that the Respondent\n\nfailed to take reasonable security measures to protect the personal data in his\n\npossession and/or under his control and is in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n9\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nEnforcement Action by the Commissioner\n26\n\nIn exercise of the power conferred upon the Commissioner pursuant to\n\nSection 29 of the PDPA, the Commissioner directs that a financial penalty of\nS$1,000 be imposed on the Organisation.\n27\n\nIn assessing the breach and the directions to be imposed, the\n\nCommissioner took into account the following factors:\n(a)\n\nthe type of personal data contained in the 13 insurance\n\n(b)\n\nthe documents were not disposed of in a high traffic area such as\n\ncertificates and 2 letters was sensitive data; and\na busy street or a shopping mall.\n28\n\nThe Commissioner wishes to emphasise that organisations should take\n\na very serious view of any instance of non-compliance under the PDPA, and the\nCommissioner urges organisations to take the necessary action to ensure that\n\nthey comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The Commissioner will not\nhesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against the organisation(s)\naccordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n10\n\n\fAng Rui Song\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 13\n\nSCHEDULE 1\nFULL LIST OF PERSONAL DATA IN THE PRUDENTIAL FOLDERS\n1.\n\nName of policy-holder;\n\n2.\n\nClient Number;\n\n3.\n\nNRIC Number;\n\n4.\n\nAge;\n\n5.\n\nDate of Certificate;\n\n6.\n\nPolicy Number\n\n7.\n\nCover Start Date;\n\n8.\n\nMaturity Date;\n\n9.\n\nFirst Premium Due Date;\n\n10.\n\nPremium Amount Payable;\n\n11.\n\nName of Life Assured (all the 13 certificates listed the names of\nrespective policy-holders as the life assured);\n\n12.\n\nBenefits\n\n13.\n\nSum assured;\n\n14.\n\nCover Start Date;\n\n15.\n\nCover Expiry Date;\n\n16.\n\nPremium;\n\n17.\n\nLast Premium Due.\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $15,000 was imposed on Orchard Turn Developments for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data of its members that was stored on its server.

Ltd.\n... Organisation\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 12\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n6 July 2017\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nIn this case, the Complainant received two unauthorised emails, purportedly\nsent by the Organisation promoting “free” ION+ Reward points. Investigations\ndiscovered that an unknown perpetrator had gained unauthorised access to a\nserver that held personal data of the Organisation’s members. The perpetrator\nthen used an application on the compromised server to send the unauthorised\nemails to the Organisation’s members using their personal data that was held\nin the server. This data breach incident raised the question of whether the\nOrganisation had met its Protection Obligation under the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to make reasonable security arrangements to\nsufficiently protect personal data held on the server.\n\n2.\n\nThe following sets out the Commission’s findings following its investigations into\nthe matter.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation is the property manager of ION Orchard, a retail mall in\nSingapore. The Organisation runs the ION+ Rewards Loyalty Programme\n(“ION’s Loyalty Programme”), which awards its members points based on\ntheir purchases made at the mall. Super e-Management Limited (“Super-E”), a\n\nPage 1 of 11\n\n\fHong Kong-based Information Technology (“IT”) service provider, manages the\nIT system for ION’s Loyalty Programme.\nThe System Setup\n4.\n\nION’s Loyalty Programme runs on the Loyalty Management System (“LMS”)\nwhich comprises several interconnected servers. Only two servers are relevant\nto the Commission’s investigation: the (i) Web and Electronic Direct Mailer\nserver (“EDM server”) and (ii) LMS & Reporting Server (“LMS server”). The\nLMS server was used to store the database of members’ personal data, while\nthe EDM server was used to send out emails to members of ION’s Loyalty\nProgramme who had subscribed to receive updates from ION Orchard.\n\n5.\n\nFor the purpose of sending these email updates to its subscribers, the\nOrganisation would transfer a subscriber list containing personal data of the\nOrganisation’s subscribers on the LMS server to the EDM server every day.\nThis transfer of the subscriber list from the LMS server to the EDM server was\nan automated process. The Organisation would then send these emails through\na web application hosted on the EDM server (“EDM Application”), which was\nconfigured to allow access to users with an administrative account (“admin\naccount”). After the Organisation had sent out the emails, the personal data of\nthe subscribers were not purged but were instead retained on the EDM server.\nThe personal data set that was stored on the EDM server comprised a\nsubscriber’s name, email address, birthdate, and membership registration date.\n\nThe Data Breach Incident\n6.\n\nOn 26 December 2015, an unknown perpetrator gained unauthorised access\nto the EDM Application using valid admin account credentials to access the\nsubscriber list. The perpetrator then crafted unauthorised emails, which looked\nlike they were genuine emails from the Organisation, promoting “free” ION+\nReward points (the “Phishing Emails”) to the subscribers; before proceeding\nto send these Phising Emails out to 24,913 subscribers.\n\n7.\n\nThe Phishing Emails contained a link ( h t t p : / / f a s t l n k s . c o m / 7LI W) which\ndirected a subscriber to an online advertisement website. The subscriber would\nbe prompted to select one of the options on the website to obtain the bogus\nION+ Reward points. If the subscriber selected any of the options, the\nsubscriber would be directed to more advertisement pages which may request\nfor the subscriber’s personal data, such as the subscriber’s mobile phone\nnumber or email address.\n\n8.\n\nSubsequently, Super-E received an alert from the EDM server and discovered\nthat an Internet Protocol address (IP address) from Egypt had successfully\n\n.\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\flogged into the system, and had sent out the Phishing Emails to the\nOrganisation’s subscribers. After discovery of the data breach, Super-E\ndisabled the EDM server to prevent further dispatches of Phishing Emails to the\nOrganisation’s subscribers. On 27 and 29 December 2015, the Organisation\nsent emails to the affected subscribers informing them of the Phishing Emails\nthat had been sent.\nThe KPMG Reports\n9.\n\nThe Organisation engaged KPMG Services Pte. Ltd. (“KPMG”) to conduct an\ninvestigation into the data breach incident. KPMG found that the cause of the\nincident appeared to be “an unauthorised access using ‘admin’ credentials via\nthe EDM application”.\n\n10.\n\nIn addition, KPMG found several issues with the security posture of the EDM\nserver. For example, KPMG found that the operating system of the EDM server\nwas not patched or hardened, thus exposing the EDM server to potential\nexploitation. Additionally, KPMG conducted a vulnerability check which\nrevealed that the EDM Application had 24 known vulnerabilities that could be\nexploited.\n\nThe Commission’s Investigations into Super-E\n11.\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigations into the matter, the Commission\nunderstands that Super-E was involved in the management of the IT systems\nfor the ION Loyalty Programme at the time of the data breach incident, and may\ntherefore share some responsibility with ION for the protection of the personal\ndata of the Organisation’s subscribers. As Super-E is located in Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, the\nCommission would pursue available options for assistance in this aspect of the\ninvestigations with the relevant foreign data protection authority.\n\n12.\n\nIn the meantime, the Commission has concluded its investigations into the\nOrganisation’s compliance with the PDPA, and has therefore proceeded to\nissue its grounds of decision focusing only on the Organisation’s compliance\nwith the PDPA.\n\nC.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\nIssue for Determination\n13.\n\nThe relevant issue for determination is whether the Organisation had put in\nplace reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data set in its\npossession or in its control, as required under section 24 of the PDPA.\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fWhether the Organisation was in breach of section 24 of the PDPA\nIncreased Risk Due to the Organisation’s System Setup\n14.\n\nAs described above in paragraphs 4 to 5, the Organisation did not purge the\npersonal data from the EDM server that were being transferred every day from\nthe LMS server to the EDM server. After the emails had been sent out, the\npersonal data of the subscribers were not deleted from the EDM server. The\neffect of this practice was that some of the personal data of the Organisation’s\nmembers could be found in two different places – the LMS server and EDM\nserver.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, this retention of personal data on the EDM server was unnecessary.\nThe LMS setup was designed in such a way that the primary database of\ncustomer data was stored on the LMS server, which had no direct connection\nto the Internet. The EDM server, on the other hand, was a separate server that\nhad access to the Internet. Given that a subset of members’ personal data was\nautomatically transferred from the LMS server to the EDM server every day,\nonly this subset of personal data was accessible from the Internet. Once the\nsubscribers’ personal data has been transferred to the EDM server, the process\nfor each email blast was as follows: load the subset of personal data of\nsubscribers, run the EDM Application, and use the EDM Application to blast the\nemails to the subscribers. There was no need to retain the personal data in the\nEDM server beyond this. The daily automatic transfer of data from the LMS\nserver to the EDM server coupled with the retention of personal data on the\nEDM server created significant risks to the security of the personal data.\n\n16.\n\nFirst, the daily automatic transfer effectively created a permanent store of\npersonal data on the EDM server. This de facto permanent store of personal\ndata had the effect of storing a duplicate or additional set of personal data on\nthe EDM server (in addition to the LMS server). The EDM server was accessible\nfrom the Internet and its online accessibility made it more susceptible to online\nattacks and external threats, and it was therefore more likely to be\ncompromised. By keeping a duplicate or additional set of personal data on the\nEDM server, the Organisation was placing unnecessary risks on the security of\nthe personal data, should the EDM server be the subject of an attack or security\ncompromise.\n\n17.\n\nSecond, the longer the personal data set was left on the EDM server, the more\nexposed it was to online attacks and external threats. If personal data is loaded\nonto the EDM server whenever there is – and only for the duration of – a\nscheduled email blast, and then promptly deleted, there would not have been\na de facto permanent store of personal data on the EDM server. Prompt\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\fdeletion after each email blast would significantly narrow the window period for\nwhich the personal data on the EDM server is at risk of unauthorised access in\nthe event that the EDM server is compromised. During investigations, the\nCommission discovered that the email blast is scheduled to take place\napproximately once a month. Further, in any given month, another email blast\nwould also be made on an ad-hoc basis to certain categories of\nIONPRIVI members (a subset of all subscribers). The aforesaid email blast would\ntherefore, be likely sent out via the EDM server more than once a month. It\ncannot be gainsaid that the risk had been significantly enlarged by keeping a\nde facto permanent store of personal data on the EDM server.\n18.\n\nThird, the frequency of such transfers brings about an increased risk that\npersonal data may be intercepted during transmission. In this regard, the daily\nautomatic transfer of personal data from the LMS server to the EDM server,\nwhen compared with the much less frequent email blasts to subscribers\n(approximately on a monthly basis), exposes the personal data in transit to an\nunnecessarily enlarged risk of interception.\n\n19.\n\nAdditionally, by effectively establishing a permanent store of personal data on\nthe EDM server (albeit a subset of subscribers who wished to received EDM\nemails), and given the attendant risks attached to it, there was a need for the\nOrganisation to ensure that the extent of hardening the EDM server and\nsecurity of the transmission route to the EDM server can meet the level of\nprotection expected in order to comply with the PDPA. Once a server is known\nto hold or process personal data, the organisation has obligations to protect the\npersonal data by ensuring that the personal data in transit to and from the\nserver, and the personal data held in the server, are adequately protected.\n\n20.\n\nIn the final analysis, it was not prudent for the Organisation to keep a duplicate\nor additional set of personal data on the EDM server for a period longer than\nnecessary. Accordingly, the Organisation’s setup of the LMS in combination\nwith its practice of retaining the personal data set on the EDM server was not\nin keeping with the reasonable security arrangements to be put in place.\n\n21.\n\nIn addressing the issues highlighted above, the Organisation may seek to\ninclude the standards for compliance with the Protection Obligation as part of\nits design specifications of the LMS. By adopting a data protection-by-design\napproach towards the enhancements to the LMS, it is conceivable that no more\nthan modest enhancements may be necessary in order to meet the standards\nexpected for compliance with the PDPA.\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fAbsence of Proper Policies or Practices to Safeguard Passwords\n22.\n\nThe Commission also identified other issues concerning the security of the\nmembers’ personal data. Foremost of them is the absence of policies or\npractices to safeguard the admin account passwords.\n\n23.\n\nAlthough the Organisation was unable to establish the root cause of the data\nbreach incident, what the Organisation, KPMG, and Super-E had found was\nthat the perpetrator had gained unauthorised access to the EDM server in a\nsingle attempt. There was no evidence of hacking or that the perpetrator had\ndeployed any brute force attacks. This suggests that it was likely that the\nperpetrator had managed to get hold of the valid admin account credentials to\ngain access to the EDM system.\n\n24.\n\nIn the course of investigations, the issue of whether the Organisation had put\nin place proper password management practices and policies came to the fore.\nThe Commission found that the Organisation did not have any formal policy or\npractice for the management of the admin account passwords to the EDM\nserver. In particular, the Organisation failed to implement any policy to prohibit\nthe sharing of admin account credentials or to enforce periodic expiry and\nrenewal of the same. In the following sections, we will look at the various\nauthorities highlighting the importance of having proper password management\npolicies and practices, and examine the organisation’s failure to put proper\npassword management policies and practices in this respect.\n\n(i)\n\nForeign authorities highlight the importance of Password Management\nPolicies\n\n25.\n\nThe need for proper password management policies was highlighted in the\nreport Joint Investigation of Ashley Madison by the Privacy Commissioner of\nCanada and the Australian Privacy Commissioner/Acting Australian\nInformation Commissioner (“Joint Investigation”).1 In that case, Avid Life\nMedia Inc (“ALM”), a company incorporated in Canada that operates a number\nof dating websites including Ashley Madison, was the subject of a data breach\nincident in 2015. The hackers gained access to the details of 36 million ALM\nuser accounts, which included personal information, and published the data\nonline.\n\n1 Joint investigation of Ashley Madison by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada and the Australian\n\nPrivacy Commissioner/Acting Australian Information Commissioner (22 August 2016), PIPEDA Report\nof\nFindings\n#2016-005,\nonline:\nOPC\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-anddecisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2016/pipeda-2016-005/>.\n\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\f26.\n\nIn their joint report, the commissioners found that ALM had poor key and\npassword management practices, given that it had made available on ALM’s\nGoogle drive, the “shared secret” to its Virtual Private Network (“VPN”). This\nmeant that “anyone with access to any ALM employee’s drive on any computer,\nanywhere, could have potentially discovered the shared secret”. The\ncommissioners concluded that such practices constituted “failures to take\nreasonable steps to implement appropriate security safeguards in the specific\ncircumstances, given the volume and nature of the personal information held\nby ALM”.\n\n27.\n\nThat the need for proper password management policies forms an important\ncomponent of the security arrangements to protect personal data is also found\nin the case of Twitter, Inc.2\n\n28.\n\nIn that case, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) found that Twitter, a social\nnetworking website, had failed to, amongst other things, enforce periodic\nchanges of admin account passwords, e.g. by setting passwords to expire\nevery 90 days. Additionally, Twitter also failed to establish or enforce policies\nsufficient to make admin account passwords hard to guess. Accordingly, Twitter\nwas found to have failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security\nmeasures to protect personal data.\n\n(ii)\n\nForeign authorities highlight the importance of regular Changing of Passwords\nand Prohibition Against Sharing of Credentials\n\n29.\n\nData protection authorities are also of the view that good password\nmanagement policies encompass the regular changing of admin account\npasswords and the prohibition against sharing admin account credentials\namongst multiple users.\n\n30.\n\nThe abovementioned case of Twitter, Inc. also stands for the point that there\nneeds to be periodic changes to the admin account passwords. The effect of\nimplementing periodic changes is that there will be a shorter window period,\nand thus fewer opportunities, for someone to try to crack the admin account\npasswords of the system.\n\n31.\n\nAdditionally, there should not be a sharing of credentials amongst users. When\ncredentials are shared among multiple users, it is difficult to ensure\naccountability as it is difficult to track the activity of each individual using the\ncommon set of credentials.\n\n2 In the Matter of Twitter, Inc., a corporation (2 March 2011), FTC 092-3093 (No. C-4316), online: FTC\n\n<https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/092-3093/twitter-inc-corporation>.\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\f32.\n\nIn the case of Reed Elsevier Inc. and Seisint, Inc.,3 the Organisations had\ncollected and stored in their databases non-public and highly sensitive personal\ninformation about millions of consumers, including consumer identification\ninformation obtained from credit reporting agencies. Attackers exploited the\nOrganisations’ poor security practices to obtain the user credentials of\nlegitimate consumers, and used these credentials to make thousands of\nunauthorised searches for consumer information in the Organisations’\ndatabases. The FTC found that the Organisations had failed to adequately\nprotect personal data because it had, amongst other things, a practice of\npermitting the sharing of user credentials among a customer’s multiple users.\nAccording to the FTC, this had the effect of reducing the likely detection of, and\naccountability for, unauthorised access to the databases.\n\n33.\n\nIn this regard, the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) in the UK has\nadvised organisations to “issue all staff with unique usernames and passwords\nfor the network and systems containing personal data”, and “do not allow users\nto share passwords with their colleagues”.4 Likewise, the Office of the Data\nProtection Commissioner of Ireland has expressly stated in its Data Security\nGuidance that “[s]hared credentials should never be permitted” and that data\ncontrollers should “ensure that users are made aware that their password /\npassphrase is unique to them and must not be disclosed to anyone else”.5\n\n34.\n\nIn sum, the data protection authorities have taken the position that password\nmanagement policies, especially the regular changing of passwords and\nprohibition against the sharing of credentials, are an important and integral part\nof IT security arrangements.\n\n(iii)\n\nThe Organisation Failed to Implement Proper Password Management Policies\nRequired\n\n35.\n\nOn the facts, the Organisation failed to put in place any formal policy or practice\nfor the management of the admin account passwords to the EDM server.\nAdditionally, in terms of the Organisation’s handling of the admin account\ncredentials, the Commission identified two main areas of concern as follows:\n\n3 In the Matter of Reed Elsevier Inc. and Seisint, Inc., corporations (1 August 2008), FTC 0523094 (No.\n\nC-4226), online: FTC <https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/052-3094/reed-elsevierinc-seisint-inc-matter>.\n4 U.K., Information Commissioner’s Office, Findings from ICO advisory visits to residential sales and\nlettings organisations (2016), online: ICO <https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/audits-andadvisory-visits/1560562/outcomes-report-residential-sales-and-lettings.pdf> at page 7.\n5 Republic of Ireland, Office of the Data Protection Commissioner of Ireland, Data Security Guidance,\nonline: DPC <https://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/Data-security-guidance/1091.htm>.\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\f36.\n\n(a)\n\nfirst, the Organisation only created a single admin account, of which the\nadmin account credentials were shared among four authorised users. All\nthese four users were sent the same admin account credentials in a\nsingle email from Super-E dated 28 January 2015. This ‘sharing’ of the\nadmin account credentials multiplied the risks of a data breach by\nmaking it more difficult to pinpoint which user had been the source of the\nlikely leak of credentials that enabled the unauthorised access to take\nplace. At the same time, the EDM server would not have been able to\nascertain (and account for) which of the users (whether authorised or\nnot) had accessed the system, since the username and password was\nthe same for all; and\n\n(b)\n\nsecond, the password of the admin account to access the EDM\nApplication had not been changed since the roll out of the EDM\nApplication, i.e. from November 2014 until the time of the data breach\nincident in December 2015. The implementation of an effective\npassword expiry mechanism would have reduced the potential adverse\nimpact of an unauthorised use of the admin account password.\n\nAccordingly, given the lack of proper password management policies and\npractices, the Commission was of the view that the Organisation had failed to\nput in reasonable security arrangements to protect the members’ personal data.\n\nOther Issues with the Organisation’s Security Arrangements\n37.\n\nApart from the issues with the password management policies of the EDM\nserver, the Commission also found other notable issues as follows.\n\n38.\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to ensure regular patching of the EDM Application\nsince its roll out in November 2014. The KPMG Reports highlighted that the\nEDM Application was exposed to 24 known vulnerabilities because it did not\nfollow a regular patching cycle. The KPMG also noted that the EDM server\nappeared to have been patched in an ad-hoc manner once every two to four\nmonths. Patching is one of the common tasks that all system owners have to\nperform in order to keep its security measures current against external threats.\nThe failure to patch the EDM Application regularly was a failure to protect the\nEDM Application against known system vulnerabilities.\n\n39.\n\nSecond, the Organisation did not conduct any vulnerability assessment to\ndetect if there were any vulnerabilities in the system prior to its roll out. As\nexplained in The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive Works Pte Ltd\n[2016] SGPDPC 22, this meant that there was no systematic way of identifying\nvulnerabilities, and addressing those vulnerabilities. This posed as a limitation\nto the Organisation’s ability to determine the technical measures that were\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\frequired to ensure that the personal data of its members were adequately\nprotected.\n40.\n\nThe Commission understands that after the data breach incident, the\nOrganisation purged all the personal data residing on the EDM server and\nsubsequently put in place a purge policy where the personal data set on the\nEDM server will be removed after a standard period of 14 days.\n\n41.\n\nIn view of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Commission finds that\nOrganisation has not made reasonable security arrangements to protect\npersonal data and is in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nD.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n\n42.\n\nGiven that the Commission has found the Organisation to be in breach of\nsection 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered under section 29 of the\nPDPA to give the Organisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure the\nOrganisation’s compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nmillion as the Commission thinks fit.\n\n43.\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed to the\nOrganisation in this case, the Commission took into account the following\nfactors:\n(a)\n\na large number of individuals (a total of 24,913 subscribers out of a\npotential 47,635 subscribers that could have been impacted by the data\nbreach incident) had the unauthorised Phishing Emails sent to them;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Phishing Emails had exposed the recipients to further risks and other\nexploits, ie through the pop-up windows that were intended to induce the\nrecipients to provide their personal data;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation did not make reasonable efforts to put in place proper\npassword management policies, and to ensure the security of the\npersonal data set by reasonably anticipating, identifying and rectifying\nthe technical security vulnerabilities (as mentioned at paragraphs 38 and\n39 above) at an earlier stage;\n\n(d)\n\nthe Organisation was generally cooperative and forthcoming in providing\ntimely responses to the Commission during the investigation; and\n\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f(e)\n\n44.\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial action after being alerted to the\ndata breach incident, as well as other corrective measures to improve its\nIT security.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\nCommission hereby directs the Organisation to do the following:\n(a)\n\nwithin 60 days from the date of the Commission’s direction to:\n(i)\n\npatch all the system vulnerabilities identified by KPMG Reports\ndated 8 March 2016 and 19 April 2016;\n\n(ii)\n\nconduct a penetration test on the Internet-facing portion of the\nLoyalty Management System and rectify weaknesses that have\nbeen identified; and\n\n(iii)\n\nimplement a password management policy and conduct training\nfor staff on password management best practices;\n\n(b)\n\nby no later than 14 days after the above action at paragraph 444(a) has\nbeen carried out, the Organisation shall, in addition, submit to the\nCommission a written update providing details on (i) the results of the\npenetration test; (ii) the measures that were taken by the Organisation\nto patch all system vulnerabilities; and (iii) the password management\npolicy and the training; and\n\n(c)\n\npay a financial penalty of S$15,000 within 30 days from the date of the\nCommission’s direction, failing which, interest at the rate of 6% per\nannum shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of the\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Eagle Eye Security Management Services and MCST 3696 of Prive EC for failing to put in place any reasonable measures to prevent unauthorised access to a visitor logbook containing personal data.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Others","MCST"],"date":"2017-06-29","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---eagle-eye---290617.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Eagle Eye Security Management Services","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/06/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-eagle-eye-security-management-services","timestamp":"2017-06-29","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1610-B0275\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n(1)\n\nTHE MANAGEMENT CORPORATION STRATA TITLE\nPLAN NO. 3696\n\n(2)\n\nEAGLE EYE SECURITY MANAGEMENT SERVICES PTE\nLTD (UEN No. 198600160K)\n... Organisations\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 11\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n\n29 June 2017\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nSometime in December 2015, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) had investigated into a complaint in relation to the failure by a\nsecurity company to safeguard the visitor logbook of Prive Executive\nCondominium (the “Condominium”), which contained personal data of the\nvisitors. The security company was found in breach of Section 24 of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) for leaving the logbook unattended and failing\nto protect the logbook from prying eyes. The case is published as Spear Security\nForce Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 12.\n\n2.\n\nA similar breach has again taken place at this Condominium. This time round,\nthe breach took place under another security company, the 2nd Respondent\n(“Eagle Eye”), which was engaged by the 1st Respondent (“MCST 3696”), the\nManagement Corporation Strata Title (“MCST”) of the Condominium, for its\nsecurity services.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing a complaint made to the Commission, the Commission proceeded to\ninvestigate into the matter. The Commission found both the 1st and 2nd\nPage 1 of 7\n\n\fRespondents in breach of their respective obligations under Section 24 of the\nPDPA. The Commission now sets out its grounds of decision of the matter.\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS\n\n4.\n\nThe data breach incident took place in the evening of 16 October 2016. The\nComplainant had observed that a logbook that was placed on a table next to the\ngantry into the Condominium was left unattended. The Complainant\nsubsequently took photographs to show that the logbook was left open on the\ntable and unattended by the security guards. These photographs were sent to\nthe Commission for its investigation.\n\n5.\n\nThe gantry was about 30 to 50 metres away from the guardhouse, and led\ndirectly to the swimming pool of the Condominium. The logbook was used to\nrecord the attendance and details of the coaches who conduct swimming lessons\nat the Condominium. The logbook would therefore contain the dates and times\nof entry into the Condominium and the NRIC numbers of the coaches.\n\n6.\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigation, the Commission found that there was\nno security guard attending to the logbook from the hours of 8 pm to 10.30 pm.\nThere was supposed to be a night-shift security guard to be stationed at the table\nwhere the logbook was located. However, the night-shift guard had reported that\nhe was ill that evening, and his replacement had only arrived for duty at 10.30\npm. Accordingly, the only security guards that were in the vicinity from 8 pm to\n10.30 pm were the security guards that were stationed at the guardhouse, away\nfrom the gantry.\n\n7.\n\nAlthough the security guards were stationed at the guardhouse, Eagle Eye\nclaimed that they were within close proximity of the logbook, and keeping an eye\nwhilst in the guardhouse.\n\n8.\n\nThe MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye also claimed that the security guards had\npreviously been specifically instructed to close the logbook when not in use and\nto keep the book in the guardhouse if no security guard was stationed at the\ntable. Additionally, they claimed that these security guards were reminded to\nexercise due care and diligence to safeguard personal data; were advised on the\nPDPA; and warned about severity of penalty for disclosure of personal data.\n\n9.\n\nFollowing the data breach incident, the MCST 3696 and Eagle eye had removed\nthe table at the Condominium gantry so that all visitor registrations would only be\ndone at the guardhouse. This was to ensure that the logbook was kept in the\nguardhouse at all times.\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\fC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS\n\n10. The information that was contained in the logbook, namely, the NRIC number\nand the dates and times of the entry and departure from the Condominium, would\nconstitute “personal data” under Section 2 of the PDPA of the coaches who came\nto the Condominium. The information allows for the identification of the individual,\nand the date and timings in which the individual had entered and left the\npremises. In particular, the NRIC numbers of the coaches are generally\nconsidered to be of a sensitive nature, as it is widely used for business purposes\nand transactions with the government,1 and could be used to cause harm should\nsuch information fall into the wrong hands.\n11. Accordingly, since the logbook contains personal data of the individual coaches,\nit must be protected under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n12. The issues that arise from this case are as follow:\ni.\n\nWhat was the relationship between MCST 3696 and Eagle, and what were\ntheir respective obligations under the PDPA;\n\nii.\n\nWhether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye complied with their respective\nobligations under the PDPA.\n\nRelationship between MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye and their respective obligations\n13. The MCST 3696 had engaged Eagle Eye to provide security guard services\npursuant to an agreement on 15 August 2016.\n14. As part of the security services, Eagle Eye was to record the movement of\npersons entering or leaving the premises of the Condominium. This included the\nmaintaining a logbook of coaches who were entering or leaving the premises of\nthe Condominium.\n15. The recording and safekeeping of the logbook were activities that fall under the\ndefinition of “processing” of personal data under Section 2(1) of the PDPA. Given\nthat MCST 3696 had engaged Eagle Eye to carry out such services (as part of\nthe overall security services), Eagle Eye was a data intermediary to MCST 3696\n(the organisation) in relation to the handling and safekeeping of the logbook.\n\n1\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on NRIC numbers.\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\f16. As an organisation, MCST 3696 has the primary role and duty to protect personal\ndata in its possession or control under Section 24 of the PDPA. The organisation\nheld the primary role and duty to protect personal data, even though it had\nengaged a data intermediary to protect the personal data as well. This principle\nhas been elucidated in the case of The Cellar Door Pte Ltd and Global Interactive\nWorks Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 22. As for Eagle Eye, although it has fewer\nobligations to meet under the PDPA (pursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA), it\nstill needs to protect personal data in its possession under Section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n17. We now turn to examine whether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye have complied with\ntheir respective obligations to protect the logbook under Section 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether MCST 3696 and Eagle Eye have complied with their respective obligations\nto protect personal data under Section 24 of the PDPA\n18. In relation to Eagle Eye, the Commission has found Eagle Eye to be in breach of\nits obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n19. First, whilst Eagle Eye claims that it had informed the security guard to keep the\nlogbook closed when not in use and to keep the book in the guardhouse if no\nsecurity guard was stationed at the table, the instructions were clearly ineffective,\nas none of the security guards had carried out those instructions. As the\nComplainant had found on 16 October 2016, the logbook was left unattended\nand open on the table. Further, the instructions themselves were bare and\nincomplete, as they do not, for example, inform the security guards how to\norganise themselves to ensure that the logbook is closed at all times when not\nin use, or who was responsible to carry out the task. The failure by Eagle Eye to\nprovide proper instructions to its security guards was a dereliction of its duty to\nensure that there were reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal\ndata in the logbook.\n20. Moreover, it was not enough for the organisation to simply provide instructions\nto the security guards to safekeep the logbook without doing more – ie putting in\nplace actual processes or practices to protect the logbook. Without having actual\nprocesses or practices in place to protect personal data, Eagle Eye’s instructions\nwere but empty instructions with little effect. This can be seen in the manner in\nwhich the security of the logbook appears to have been carried: on an ad-hoc\nbasis, where there is no coordinated and comprehensive effort to ensure that the\nlogbook was safeguard or safekept with the security guards at all times. And\nindeed, this has been laid bare by the Complainant being able to take\nphotographs of the logbook without the security guards noticing.\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f21. Additionally, the alleged instructions were not documented. This makes it hard to\ndisseminate the message to all the security guards, especially to the new\nemployees joining the organisation. As discussed in in Furnituremart.sg [2017]\nSGPDPC 7, without having written policies or practices, it would be difficult to\npromulgate the policies or practices effectively to the employees and staff of the\norganisation.\n22. Second, while Eagle Eye had a data protection policy in place, the policy was\nspartan in terms of the policies that govern the protection of the logbook. The\nonly reference to the protection of personal data was a line which mentioned:\n“To ensure that personal rights to confidentiality are respected in compliance\nwith the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 and no disclosure of personal data\nof resident, visitor, contractor, vendor, delivery and etc”.\nThe policy does not elaborate further on how these may be translated into actual\npractices or processes to protect the logbook. As mentioned in Tiger Airways\nSingapore Pte Ltd, SATS Ltd and Asia-Pacific Star Limited [2017] SGPDPC 6, it\nis important for an organisation to ensure that its policies are contextualised to\nits operations, so that they are pertinent and relevant to the organisation’s work\nor operations on the ground, and meaningful and useful to employees in the\ncontext of their work or responsibilities A simple or bare statement in a policy\ntelling employees to comply with the PDPA (for example) would not actually\ninform them how to protect personal data in the context of what they are doing.\n23. Third, Eagle Eye did not seem to have a contingency plan for the safekeeping of\nthe logbook when the security guard fell sick and had to be replaced by another\nsecurity guard. When the replacement guard came late, that had apparently led\nto the shortage of a security guard to be stationed at the table to look after the\nlogbook. Rather than returning the logbook to the guardhouse, the logbook was\nsimply left on the table unattended. In the Commission’s view, there ought to\nhave been some form of system or process to ensure that when the security\nguards are unavailable to be stationed at the table, the logbook would, by default,\nbe returned back to the guardhouse for safekeeping. Again, this accentuates the\npoint that there was no system in place to ensure the proper safekeeping of the\nlogbook.\n24. Eagle Eye claimed that their security guards were in close proximity of the\nlogbook, since they were stationed at the guardhouse, and had kept an eye on\nthe logbook. However, this was not the same as safeguarding the logbook itself.\nThe fact the Complainant was easily able to take photographs of the contents of\nthe logbook and the surroundings, without any of the security guards noticing, is\ntestament to the need for having close supervision of the logbook, which may\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fonly be achieved in this case by keeping the logbook with the security guards.\nBy being stationed at the guardhouse, this made supervision and monitoring of\nthe logbook difficult, and increases the risk of the security guards being blindsided to any unauthorised access of the logbook that was left at the table. The\ndifficulty of supervision and monitoring was exacerbated by the fact that the\nsecurity guards’ attention would have been diverted (at times) to the activities at\nthe guardhouse, and away from the logbook.\n25. With regards to MCST 3696, it had the primary and shared responsibility with\nEagle Eye to protect personal data.\n26. The need to meet this primary responsibility ought to have been drawn into sharp\nfocus for MCST 3696, as this was not the first time that the hired security guards\nof the Condominium had left the logbook unattended. As mentioned above, the\nCommission had found the previous security guard company to be in breach of\nPDPA for a similar incident, and had been issued a warning for it. Given that the\nprevious security company was issued such a warning, the MCST 3696 ought to\nhave exercised closer supervision over the implementation and adoption of the\npolicies and practices to protect the personal data collected by the Condominium.\nFor example, by engaging with Eagle Eye in the planning and development of\npolicies and practices that would be appropriate in the Condominium’s setting to\nprotect personal data, or by having general oversight over the security of the\npersonal data. After all, having gone through the previous experience of the data\nbreach incident, there would have been lessons learnt and improvements to be\nmade, which the MCST 3696 can impart or share with the incoming security\nguard company, Eagle Eye, for developing its policies and practices to protect\npersonal data at the Condominium.\n27. However, the MCST 3696 had failed to meet this primary responsibility to protect\npersonal data. As mentioned above, the Commission has found a lack of\nadequate policies and processes that were in place to protect personal data. This\nis evident, given there was only one line in Eagle Eye’s policy on personal data\nprotection. Next, it was already established above that there was no system in\nplace at the Condominium for the safekeeping of the logbook at all times – and\nindeed, the logbook was found to be left open on the table in this case.\nAdditionally, from the responses provided to the Commission, it would appear\nthat the only thing that the MCST 3696 did was to remind the security guards at\nthe meeting to secure the logbook, which fell far short of providing that\nsupervision and oversight (described above) for the protection of personal data.\n28. Given the MCST 3696’s failure to provide that supervision and oversight to\nensure the security of the personal data in the logbook, the Commission has\nfound the MCST 3696 to also be in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\fD.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n29. For the reasons above, the Commission has found that both Eagle Eye and\nMCST 3696 are in breach of their respective obligations under Section 24 of the\nPDPA. In this regard the Commission is empowered under Section 29 of the\nPDPA to give Eagle Eye and MCST 3696 such directions as it deems fit to ensure\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Respondent to pay a\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million as the Commission\nthinks fit.\n30. However, in view that Eagle Eye and MCST 3696 have taken reasonably\nadequate steps to remedy the lapses, as set out above at paragraph 10, during\nthe course of the investigations, the Commission has decided not to impose any\ndirections against them. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning against Eagle\nEye and MCST 3696 for the breach of their respective obligations under Section\n24 of the PDPA.\n31. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The\nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against\nthe organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on DataPost, as a data intermediary, for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of two customers of a bank.

One customer (“the\nrecipient”), however, discovered that she had received two additional\nSRS statements belonging to two other OCBC customers, in addition to\nher own SRS statement. The following information was disclosed in the\nSRS statements:\na.\n\nName;\n\nb.\n\nAddress;\n\nc.\n\nCash balance; and\n\nd.\n\nTypes, quantity, and valuation of asset holdings.\n\nOCBC alerted the Commission to the incident, and informed the\nCommission that the recipient had received the additional SRS\nstatements on or about 17 June 2016. The Commission has conducted\nan investigation into the matter and now sets out its findings.\n\nPage 1 of 7\n\n\fA.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nDPL’s procedure for printing and mailing of the SRS statements was as\nfollows:\na.\n\nThe SRS statements are printed on A3 sheets in the format\nshown below. A sheet may contain either two different statements\nor two pages of the same statement. In the incident in question,\nthe first sheet, Sheet 1, contained the statements of two different\nindividuals. Sheet 2 also contained the statements of two different\nindividuals.\nA3 size Sheet 1\nStatement of\nStatement of\nIndividual 1\nIndividual 2\n\nA3 size Sheet 2\nStatement of\nStatement of\nIndividual 3\nIndividual 4\n\nb.\n\nAn enveloping machine was used to cut the statements and to\ninsert the individual statements into their respective mailer\nenvelopes. For the purpose of this decision, there are two relevant\nsub-components of the enveloping machine which operations\naffect the eventual output of the enveloping machine. These are\nthe cutter, which cuts the sheets of paper into A4 pages; and the\nOptical Mark Recognition (“OMR”) reader that reads OMR\nmarkings (which are lines resembling barcodes) that are printed\non each customer’s statements. The OMR reader guides the\nenveloping machine to insert each customer’s statements into the\nmailer envelope intended for that customer.\n\nc.\n\nThe enveloping machine was operated by a single operator. The\noperator would start each printing run with a test run. If the test\n\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\frun was successful, the operator would proceed with the printing\nand enveloping of the entire batch of statements.\nd.\n\nThe design of the machine was such that the first sheet, Sheet 1,\nhad to be loaded directly into the cutter. However, the cutter was\nlocated further along in the machine than the OMR reader.\nTherefore, the first two statements cut from Sheet 1 would always\nbe placed by the machine in the same envelope as the first\nstatement of Sheet 2.\n\ne.\n\nAs a result of this operational peculiarity, the machine was set to\nautomatically send the first envelope into the reject bin for manual\nintervention. The operator was supposed to sort out the individual\nstatements in the reject bin by hand and put them into separate\nenvelopes. He was then supposed to leave the sorted statements\nand envelopes in the reject bin for a quality control (“QC”) check\nby a second level checker.\n\nf.\n\nHaving passed the second level check, a third check for QC was\nto be conducted by a supervisor. All three levels of checks were\nsupposed to be recorded in a QC form.\n\ng.\n\nCorrectly filled envelopes were supposed to be deposited by the\nmachine in the main bin. There is a digital counter in the main bin\nthat records the number of envelopes deposited into it. The\noperator was supposed to record this number in the QC form\ntogether with the number of rejected envelopes. The number of\n“successful” and rejected envelopes, when added up, was\nsupposed to tally with the total expected number of envelopes\nfrom the run.\n\n4.\n\nThe cause of the data breach in this case, according to DPL’s internal\ninvestigations, was human error by the operator on duty on 4 May 2016.\nDPL’s findings were that the operator manually checked the first\nenvelope generated by the test run, but mistakenly concluded that the\nthree statements contained therein all belonged to the same person. In\nfact, the statements belonged to three separate individuals, and had\nbeen placed in the same envelope due to the operating peculiarity\ndescribed above.\n\n5.\n\nThe operator, in the mistaken belief that the three statements belonged\nto the same individual, removed the envelope from the reject bin and\nmoved it to the main bin. Further, the operator completed the QC form\nin a way that showed that the number of “successful” and rejected\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\fenvelopes tallied with the expected total from the run. As the envelope\nwas no longer in the reject bin, the second and third layers of checks\nwere by-passed, and the envelope was sent out without anyone realising\nthat it contained two extra statements. The manual completion of the QC\nform by the operator to show that the number of successful and rejected\nenvelopes tallied allowed this to go undetected.\nB.\n\nCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n\n(i)\n\nThere was an unauthorised disclosure of personal data\n\n6.\n\nThe information disclosed in the two SRS statements is personal data\nwithin the meaning of section 2 of the PDPA. First, the names and\naddresses of the intended recipients of those two statements were\nincluded on the statements themselves. Hence, those individuals could\nbe identified solely from the information disclosed by the statements.\nFurther, the SRS financial information contained therein was clearly their\npersonal data.\n\n7.\n\nGiven that the disclosure of such information contained was made\nwithout the consent of the intended recipients (i.e. the data subjects),\nand without any authority under the PDPA (or other written law), it was\nan unauthorised disclosure of personal data for the purposes of the\nPDPA.\n\n(ii)\n\nDPL was a data intermediary and had the obligation to protect personal\ndata under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n8.\n\nIn relation to the printing and mailing of the statements containing\npersonal data, DPL was “processing” personal data under section 2 of\nthe PDPA. As DPL was processing the personal data on behalf of OCBC,\npursuant to their service agreement, DPL is a data intermediary within\nthe meaning of section 2 of the PDPA: see also, Central Depository (Pte)\nLimited and Toh-Shi Printing Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC11 and\nAviva Ltd and Toh-Shi printing Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 15.\n\n9.\n\nHence, as provided under section 4(2) of the PDPA, DPL was under an\nobligation to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the\nunauthorised disclosure of personal data under section 24 of the PDPA\nin respect of the personal data that DPL was processing for OCBC.\n\n(iii)\n\nThe unauthorised disclosure was the result of a breach of DPL’s\nobligation to make reasonable arrangements for the protection of\npersonal data\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f10.\n\nDPL claims that the unauthorised disclosure was the result of a single\ninstance of human error. DPL provided a written data protection policy\nto the Commission. This policy states that envelopes in the reject bin\nshould be treated with extra care, and that it was mandatory for such\nrejected envelopes to be subjected to second and third level checks.\nTaken together with the steps outlined above, DPL did have in place\ndata protection policies and processes.\n\n11.\n\nHowever, the Commission is of the view that the processes that DPL put\nin place did not meet the reasonable standards expected of it. There\nwere two main issues in DPL’s processes:\na. It created a significant risk of the first envelope containing the\nstatements of more than one individual (which may subsequently\nlead to an unauthorised disclosure of personal data); and\nb. It placed too much reliance on the operator to ensure that the first\nbatch of statements were correctly sorted out and separated into\nthe different envelopes, before sending out. Pertinently, DPL’s\nQC checks were over-reliant on the operator strictly adhering to\nDPL’s procedures, and correctly performing each of his functions,\nin order for such checks to be triggered. A single failure by the\noperator to comply with the procedure, such as incorrectly filling\nup the QC form, could lead to the QC checks being by-passed.\n\n12.\n\nGiven that the first three statements of the print cycle would always be\nplaced in a single envelope by the machine, there was a significant risk\nof every first envelope containing the statements of two or more\nindividuals. This, in turn, created a risk of the individual’s statement being\ndisclosed to another individual. The design and operation of the\nenveloping machine ensured that this risk arose with each print cycle. In\nthe Commission’s view, such risks could be avoided, for example, simply\nby having Sheet 1 print out blank pages by default, instead of statements\ncontaining information of actual customers. That way, the two other\nstatements (of the three statements) in the 1st envelope would be blank\nstatements, and there would be a lower chance of an unauthorised\ndisclosure of a statement to the wrong recipient.\n\n13.\n\nIt was because of such risks that there needed to be a proper way of\nchecking and ensuring that any additional statements were removed\nfrom the envelope. This again was where DPL failed: DPL relied entirely\non a single operator for the correction to be made, and it did not have a\nproper system of checks and supervision over the operator’s actions.\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\f14.\n\nFirst, DPL’s system of QC checks was inadequate. The operator was\nable to by-pass both the second or third level checks, since the persons\ncarrying out these checks were only checking envelopes found in the\nreject bin. The operator was able to remove the envelope from the reject\nbin and place it in the main bin. This resulted in there being no second\nor third level checks being carried out on the envelope in this case.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, there was no independent verification of the accuracy of the QC\nform filled in by the operator, which meant that the second and third level\ncheckers would not have been aware of the fact that the operator had\nincorrectly moved an envelope from the reject bin to the main bin, as the\nnumbers in the QC form appeared to tally with the expected total from\nthe run. The second and third level checkers were essentially relying on\nthe numbers provided by the operator in the QC form in order to\nascertain whether an error or failure had occurred. Since there was no\nindependent verification, the second and third level checkers could not\nascertain if those numbers provided by the operator were actually correct.\nAccordingly, depending on how the QC form was filled up, the second\nand third level checks could easily be by-passed just by the QC form\nshowing, on the face of it, that the numbers in the reject bin and main\nbin had tallied with the expected total from the run. The lack of an\nindependent verification of the QC form, and the manner in which the\nsecond and third level checkers could be circumvented from the\nincorrect filling up of the QC form, was a systemic weakness in DPL’s\nQC process, and a failure to put in place adequate security\narrangements to protect personal data.\n\n16.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the personal data involved (financial statements),\nit was incumbent on DPL to ensure that its QC measures could not be\nso easily bypassed. The data breach could have been avoided if DPL\nhad taken some simple additional precautions, for example:\na. The second and third level checkers could have been obliged to\ncheck the digital counter, to ensure that the QC form filled in by\nthe operator was accurate; and\nb. The operator could have been obliged to always return the first\nenvelope filled by the machine to the reject bin which will ensure\nthat it will be inspected by the second and third level checkers.\n\n17.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission finds that DPL had not put in\nadequate security arrangements to protect personal data. Accordingly,\nthe Commission finds DPL in breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\fC.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE COMMISSION\n\n18.\n\nGiven that DPL breached its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA,\nthe Commission is empowered under section 29(1) of the PDPA to issue\nsuch directions as it thinks fit in the circumstances.\n\n19.\n\nThe Commission finds that the personal data disclosed, being financial\ninformation, was sensitive in nature. This is a significant aggravating\nfactor, warranting a financial penalty as a matter of general deterrence.\n\n20.\n\nHowever, the Commission also notes the following mitigating factors:\na. The scale of the breach was small. Only personal data belonging\nto two individuals was disclosed to a single recipient;\nb. There was no evidence to suggest that the data breach caused\nand actual loss or damage to any person.\n\n21.\n\nThe Commission has therefore decided to impose a financial penalty of\nS$3,000/- on DPL.\n\n22.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also directs DPL to:\na.\n\nConduct a review of its internal working procedure relating to data\nprinting and enveloping operations, in particular to tighten the\napplication of quality control checks;\n\nb.\n\nImprove the training of all operators and quality checkers involved\nin its printing and enveloping operations; and\n\nc.\n\nReview its personal data protection policy to determine if it needs\nto be updated to suit its current operations.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Hazel Florist & Gifts for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of customers' personal data.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"2017-06-20","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---hazel-florist-gift---200617.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Hazel Florist & Gifts","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/06/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-hazel-florist-and-gifts","timestamp":"2017-06-20","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1609-B0194\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nHAZEL FLORIST & GIFTS PTE LTD\n\n... Organisation\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 9\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 June 2017\n1.\n\nThe Organisation is incorporated in Singapore and is in the business of, amongst\nother things, selling and delivering gift hampers. Sometime in August 2016, the\nOrganisation delivered a gift hamper to the Complainant. The Complainant on\nunwrapping the gift hamper discovered that order forms (the “Order Forms”)\nwere used as fillers to cover the bottom of the hamper he received (this\n“Incident”). The personal data of other individuals were clearly visible on these\nOrder Forms. The Complainant complained (the “Complaint”) of this disclosure\nof personal data by the Organisation to the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) on 5 September 2016.\n\n2.\n\nBased on the complaint that was made, the Commission proceeded to\ninvestigate if there was a breach of the Organisation’s obligations under the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) by the disclosure to the\nComplainant. The following sets out the Commission’s findings following its\ninvestigations into the matter.\n\nA.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS\nThe Gift Hamper Packing Process – Order Forms were not designated as “fillers”\n\n3.\n\nEmployees in the Organisation’s Production Department (“Production\nEmployees”) are responsible for packing the gift hampers. The Production\nPage 1 of 7\n\n\fEmployees cover the bottom of the hampers with “fillers”. The materials used as\nfillers (“Designated Filler Material”), which include loose paper strips and\nshredded newspapers, outdated brochures and flyers, are kept in an allocated\narea near the Production Employees. The Designated Filler Material is\nreplenished by the employees according to a roster. Order Forms were not\nDesignated Filler Material.\nProduction Employee uses Order Forms meant for disposal as she runs out of\nthe Designated Filler Material\n4. Employee Y, a recent hire who was only on the job for about a month, was\ntasked to pack the Complainant’s gift hamper. The Designated Filler Material\nkept at the allocated area had run out while Y was wrapping the Complainant’s\ngift hamper. Y took the Order Forms which were placed in a box within the\nProduction Department’s workspace and used them as fillers for the\nComplainant’s gift hamper instead. The Order Forms in this box relate to orders\nfor gift hampers or floral bouquets that the Production Department had already\npacked or arranged; these Order Forms were meant to be disposed. The box\ncontaining these Order Forms were easily accessible by any of the\nOrganisation’s employees.\nThe Complainant’s Gift Hamper passes the quality control check and is delivered\n5.\n\nOnce Y finished packing the Complainant’s gift hamper, another employee\ntasked to perform quality control checks (“the QA Employee”) ensured that the\nhamper contained the items ordered by visually comparing the items in the\nComplainant’s gift hamper against the relevant order form in accordance with the\nusual process. These quality control checks are to ensure that the items packed\nin the gift hampers match the items stated in the relevant Order Forms and not\nfor checking what filler material was used. In any event, it would have been\nimpossible for the QA Employee to check what filler material was used for the\nComplainant’s gift hamper as the filler material was covered with an opaque\nsheet.\n\n6.\n\nThe gift hamper was delivered to the Complainant and as a result personal data\nof approximately 24 unique individuals written or printed on the Order Forms\nwere disclosed to the Complainant.\n\n7.\n\nThe personal data (the “Personal Data”) visible in the Order Forms were the\nnames, delivery addresses, and telephone numbers of the recipients and the\nreasons the gift hampers were ordered for the recipients (e.g. birth of a child or\nas wishes for a speedy recovery). In one instance, the National Registration\nIdentity Card number of a recipient was shown on one of the disclosed Order\nForms.\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\fB.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\nElements of Section 24 obligation under the PDPA\n\n8.\n\nBased on its investigations, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA as it:\na. is an organisation within the meaning of the PDPA;\nb. is in possession or control of the Personal Data; and\nc.\n\n9.\n\ndid not make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the unauthorised\ndisclosure of the Personal Data.\n\nThe first 2 elements are preconditions to the application of section 24 of the\nPDPA; the obligation to make reasonable security arrangements does not attach\nunless elements (a) and (b) are present. It is clear from the facts that the\npreconditions are met and that section 24 of the PDPA applies to the\nOrganisation. The Organisation does not dispute that section 24 of the PDPA\napplies in this matter. This Grounds of Decision, therefore, only sets out the\nCommission’s findings on the 3rd element (whether reasonable security\narrangements were made). The Commission’s reasons for finding that the\nOrganisation did not make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the\nunauthorised disclosure of the Personal Data are set out below.\nThe Organisation did not implement any measures to ensure that its employees\nonly used the Designated Filler Material\n\n10. The Organisation did not anticipate the unauthorised disclosures in this Incident\nas it believed that its employees would not use materials other than the\nDesignated Filler Material to pack gift hampers. This is clear from the\nOrganisation’s response to the Commission’s request for an account of the\nIncident. In its official response, the Organisation states that:\n“In hazel, we have a clear procedure on what materials that has to be used for\nthe packaging, and basing from what had transpired, the staff has clearly\nbroken our guidelines that resulted to this unacceptable error, we have to point\nout that it should have been impossible for any our staff to use any of\nthose documents because its not even considered a packaging\nmaterial…” (emphasis added)\n\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\f11. The procedure referred to in the Organisation’s response above is that\nProduction Employees were instructed to use the Designated Filler Material\nfound in the allocated area for packing gift hampers.\n12. However, the Organisation’s instruction to its employees to use the Designated\nFiller Material for packing gift hampers is not in itself a reasonable security\narrangement. The protection obligation in section 24 of the PDPA obliged the\nOrganisation to implement reasonable security arrangements that protected the\npersonal data found in the Order Forms from unauthorised disclosure through\nY’s use of Order Forms as fillers. The Organisation’s instruction to its employees\nwithout any accompanying measures reasonably ensuring that the instruction\nwas carried out by its employees does not satisfy the protection obligation.\nY did not receive any data protection training\n13. It is possible, depending on the specific circumstances, that data protection\ntraining may serve as a security arrangement. Any such data protection training\nshould be designed to provide an employee with an awareness of the\norganisation’s data protection obligations and specific guidance on the proper\nhandling of personal data relevant to the employees’ day-to-day tasks.\n14. In this instance, however, the Organisation did not provide any such data\nprotection training. The Organisation communicated its instruction on the use of\nDesignated Filler Material to its employees through on-the-job training. This\ntraining involved members of the Production Department guiding Y on how to\npack the gift hamper. It was not designed to include training on data protection.\nMerely training an employee on her role does not constitute a security\narrangement.\n15. This lack of training showed in Y’s clear lack of awareness on the importance of\ndata protection; anyone with a basic idea of the importance of protecting personal\ndata would not have used the Order Forms as packing material.\nY was not properly supervised in her work\n16. Further, the Organisation acknowledged that, after a time, Y was not receptive\nto the training and guidance provided by her colleagues. Y brushed off her\ncolleagues’ attempts to train and guide her through the procedure for packing gift\nhampers and did not follow instructions. The Organisation failed to address Y’s\nlack of receptiveness to the training.\n17. Without the guidance of her team members and the lack of intervention by the\nOrganisation, Y was effectively working unsupervised. Given the Organisation’s\npractices, this lack of supervision meant that the Organisation was practically\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\funable to ensure that Y followed the Organisation’s instruction to use the\nDesignated Filler Material.\nThe Organisation’s Data Protection Policy and Employee Handbook did not\nprovide specific practical guidance on the proper handling of personal data\n18. The Commission notes that the Organisation has in place a Data Protection\nPolicy. The Data Protection Policy merely restates the Organisation’s data\nprotection obligations in very general terms. The Organisation’s Data Protection\nPolicy does not provide the Organisation’s employees with specific practical\nguidance on how to handle personal data in their day-to-day work or how to\ncomply with section 24 of the PDPA. The Commission is, therefore, of the view\nthat the Organisation’s Data Protection Policy does not constitute a “security\narrangement” under section 24 of the PDPA. In this regard, the Commission\nrepeats its advice in its Decision in The National University of Singapore [2017]\nSGPDPC 5:\n“Proper guidance is not easily substitutable or replaceable by general\nguidelines that an organisation may set.”\n19. Further, the Organisation merely expects new staff to read the Data Protection\nPolicy on the first few days after commencing employment. The Organisation\ndoes not ensure that the Data Protection Policy has been explained to the\nemployees or that the employees understand what is required of them under the\nPolicy. Such Policies and practices do not constitute a “reasonable security\narrangement” under section 24 of the PDPA.\n20. The Commission notes that the extract of the Organisation’s Employee\nHandbook provided to the Commission and titled “Professional Handling of Hazel\nFlorist Confidential Information” does not even address Personal Data and\ninstead addresses the handling of information that the company holds out to be\nconfidential. The section generally provides that Employees are not to “divulge,\nshare any trade and/or sensitive information regarding the business of the\ncompany in whatever form or media to unauthorized party or parties”.\nThe Commission’s Decision: The Organisation is in breach of section 24 of the\nPDPA\n21. Viewing the circumstances as a whole, the Commission finds the Organisation\nin breach of section 24 of the PDPA. The Organisation failed to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the Personal Data as:\n\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fa. the Organisation did not implement any measures to reasonably ensure that\nits instruction to its employees to use the Designated Filler Material to pack\ngift hampers was carried out by its employees;\nb. the Organisation did not provide Y with any Data Protection training;\nc.\n\nthe Organisation failed to ensure that Y was properly supervised in her work;\n\nd. the Organisation’s Data Protection Policy and Employee Handbook did not\nprovide specific practical guidance on handling personal data or complying\nwith section 24 of the PDPA; and\ne. there was no other form of security arrangement in place to protect the\nPersonal Data.\n22. This Incident should not have come as a surprise to the Organisation. Given the\nabove, an incident such as this was waiting to happen.\nC.\n\nREMEDIAL ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE ORGANISATION\n\n23. The Organisation has taken the following remedial actions to help prevent the\ndisclosure of personal data found in Order Forms in the future:\na. Reminders not to use documents containing personal data of customers as\npackaging materials and to only use designated packaging materials have\nbeen posted at all employee workspaces;\nb. Meetings and group discussions were held with employees to emphasise the\nabove reminders;\nc.\n\nLimiting access to the box containing Order Forms meant for disposal to only\nauthorised employees by securing it with a lock; and\n\nd. The Organisation is revising its Order Forms so that the forms will only state\nthe delivery address, the date and time of delivery, and the product code.\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE COMMISSION\n\n24. The Commission is empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the\nOrganisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the Commission\nthinks fit.\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\f25. In determining the directions to be imposed on the Organisation, the Commission\ntook into account the following factors:\na. The personal data was disclosed to only 1 person;\nb. Save for the disclosure of one individual’s NRIC number, the breach\ninvolved personal data of limited sensitivity;\nc. The Organisation has taken remedial actions to help prevent the\ndisclosure of the Personal Data in the future; and\nd. The Organisation has been fully cooperative in the investigation.\n26.

The nature of the complaints was that the disclosures made of\nthese personal data was an infringement of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) commenced\ninvestigations into the matter, and provides its decision below.\n\n3.\n\nAlthough the three cases involve different residents and managing agents of\ncondominiums, the facts of the three cases are substantially similar and the\nlegal issues involved are identical. Therefore, this consolidated decision is\nissued for the three cases.\n\n1\n\n\fB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n4.\n\nBetween 29 June and 27 July 2016, the Commission received complaints from\nseveral residents of three condominiums (namely, (1) Prive, (2) The\nMornington, and (3) Seletaris) against the condominiums’ respective MCST or\nmanaging agents, namely, (1) Exceltec Property Management Pte Ltd\n(“Exceltec”), (2) Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2956 (“MCST\n2956”), and (3) Strata Land Property Consultants Pte Ltd (“Strata Land”)\nrespectively:\n\n5.\n\na.\n\nIn the first case, three residents (“1st Complainants”), complained that\nExceltec had posted copies of the voter list containing the names, unit\nnumbers, and voting shares of residents, and the draft minutes of the 1st\ncouncil meeting on 12 July 2016 (containing the names and unit\nnumbers of residents) on notice boards of the Prive condominium and\nPrive EC web portal without providing prior notification and obtaining\ntheir consent.\n\nb.\n\nIn the second case, a resident (“2nd Complainant”), complained that\nMCST 2956 had left the voter list, containing the names and unit\nnumbers of residents, on a publicly accessible notice board for longer\nthan necessary after the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting.\nAccording to the 2nd Complainant, the voter list was left on the board for\nroughly 2 months after the council meeting was held.\n\nc.\n\nIn the third case, a resident (“3rd Complainant”), complained that Strata\nLand had posted a voter list containing the names, unit numbers, and\nvoting shares of residents, on at least two notice boards at different\nblocks of the Seletaris condominium. The 3rd Complainant alleged that\nthere was no need to have posted the voter list on multiple notice boards,\nand further, that the voter lists had been displayed for an unnecessarily\nlong period of time (ie 2 days after the council meeting).\n\nFor ease of reference, we set out in a table below a summary of the types of\npersonal data that were disclosed by the Organisations and the nature of the\ncomplaints that were made by the various complainants.\n\nNo. Relevant parties\n1.\n\n1st Complainants\nExceltec\n\nDocuments\nInvolved\n(1) Draft\nminutes of\nmeeting\n\nPersonal Data\nInvolved\n(1) Names and\nunit numbers\n\n2\n\nNature of\nComplaint\nDisclosure of\npersonal data\nwithout notification\nor consent.\n\n\f2.\n\n2nd Complainant\n\n(2) Voter list\n\n(2) Names and\nunit numbers,\nand voting\nshares\n\nVoter list\n\nNames and unit\nnumbers\n\nDuration of the\ndisclosure of\npersonal data was\nfor longer than\nnecessary.\n\nVoter list\n\nNames, unit\nnumbers, and\nvoting shares\n\n- Disclosure of\npersonal data\nwithout\nnotification or\nconsent.\n\nMCST 2956\n\n3.\n\n3rd Complainant\nStrata Land\n\n- Duration of the\ndisclosure of\npersonal data\nwas for longer\nthan necessary.\n- Disclosure of\npersonal data\nought not to be\nmade on multiple\nnotice boards.\n\nC.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n\nApplicability of the PDPA\n6.\n\nThe posting of the voter lists and minutes of meeting by the Organisations on\nnotice boards located within the compound of the condominiums amounted to\na “disclosure” under the PDPA of the information in the voter list and minutes\nof meeting.\n\n7.\n\nAs seen in the table above, the information that was disclosed in the voter lists\nand minutes of meeting included the names, unit numbers, and voting shares\nof the residents. This information constitutes “personal data” under section 2(1)\nof the PDPA because the residents could be identified from such information.\n3\n\n\fFor example, the 2nd Complainant could be identified from the voter list that\nMCST 2956 had disclosed on The Mornington’s notice board, which included\nthe name, unit number and voting shares of the 2nd Complainant.\n8.\n\nGiven that the disclosed information constitutes personal data, the\nOrganisations are therefore subject to the data protection provisions in Parts III\nto IV of the PDPA in relation to the disclosure of that personal data.\n\nIssues to be Determined\n9.\n\nThere are two data protection obligations under the PDPA that are relevant to\nthe disclosures that were made by the Organisations – the Consent Obligation1\nand Notification Obligation.2\na.\n\nThe Consent Obligation generally requires organisations to obtain\nconsent from an individual for the collection, use or disclosure of his or\nher personal data.\n\nb.\n\nThe Notification Obligation generally requires that notice of the purposes\nfor which organisations collect, use or disclose personal data be given\nto the individual beforehand.\n\n10.\n\nBoth the Consent and Notification Obligations are subject to various exceptions\nunder the PDPA, including the exceptions found in Schedules 2 to 4 of the\nPDPA. Additionally, section 4(6) of the PDPA allows the provisions of other\nwritten law to prevail over data protection obligations where they are\ninconsistent with the provisions of that other written law (“the subordination\nprovision”).\n\n11.\n\nThe first issue is therefore whether the Organisations have complied with the\nConsent and Notification Obligations, or whether they can avail themselves of\nany exceptions under the PDPA.\n\n12.\n\nFor this issue, we will examine what the Commission considers is the crux of\nthe matter: (a) whether, by reason of the subordination provision, the\nrequirements for Organisations to notify and obtain consent to disclose the voter\nlists and minutes of meeting containing personal data is superseded by the\nBuilding Maintenance and Strata Management Act (Cap. 30C) (Rev. Ed. 2008)\n\n1 Pursuant to Sections 13 to 15 and 17 of the PDPA.\n2 Pursuant to Section 20 of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\f(“BMSMA”) requirements for such voter lists and minutes of meeting to be\ndisclosed; and/or (b) whether the public availability exception applies.\n13.\n\nThe second issue is whether, even if the disclosure was permissible in respect\nof the first issue above, the Organisations had disclosed more personal data\nthan what was permitted in the voter lists and minutes of meeting.\n\n14.\n\nThe final two issues are: (i) whether MCST 2956 and Strata Land had disclosed\nthe personal data for a longer duration than necessary, and (ii) whether Strata\nLand was permitted to disclose the voter lists on multiple notice boards located\nin the condominium.\n\nIssue (a): Whether the Organisations had obtained consent or provided\nnotification when they disclosed the personal data of the residents\n15.\n\nAs part of the Consent Obligation, section 13 of the PDPA requires that prior\nconsent be obtained by an organisation in order to collect, use or disclose\npersonal data about an individual.\n\n16.\n\nThis is concomitant with the Notification Obligation, which requires, under\nsection 20 of the PDPA, that notification be provided to the individual of the\npurposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data before consent\nis obtained. However, the need to obtain consent or to provide the related\nnotification is dispensed with where an exception to section 13 of the PDPA (ie\nthe Consent Obligation) applies.\n\n17.\n\nBased on the Organisations’ representations to the Commission, none of the\nOrganisations had notified their respective residents of the purpose of the\ndisclosure of the voter lists or minutes of meeting, nor did any Organisation\nobtain the residents’ consent to disclose their personal data.\n\n18.\n\nAccordingly, the next question is whether the Organisations could avail\nthemselves of an exception to section 13 of the PDPA (ie the Consent\nObligation).\n\nIssue (b): Whether the disclosure may be made without consent\nSub-issue (1): Whether the disclosure was required or authorised under other written\nlaw\n19.\n\nSection 13(b) of the PDPA provides for an exception to the need for consent to\nbe obtained – it states that an organisation shall not disclose personal data\nunless the disclosure without the consent of the individual is required or\nauthorised under the PDPA or any other written law. Simply put, insofar as there\n5\n\n\fis another written law which requires or authorises the disclosure of personal\ndata, an organisation which does so pursuant to that law will be able to avail\nitself of the exception under section 13(b) of the PDPA. In the present case, the\nother written law in question is the BMSMA.\n20.\n\nUnder Paragraph 7 of the First Schedule to the BMSMA, management\ncorporations are statutorily required to display a list of voters entitled to vote at\nthe general meeting on the notice board maintained on the common property.\nParagraph 7 of the First Schedule to the BMSMA reads as follows:\n“List of names of persons entitled to vote\n7. The secretary of the management corporation or (as the case may be)\nsubsidiary management corporation shall put up a list of the names of the\npersons who are entitled to vote at a general meeting on the notice board\nmaintained on the common property at least 48 hours before the general\nmeeting.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n21.\n\nThe BMSMA therefore requires that the names of the persons entitled to vote\nat the general meeting to be put up on the notice board. It does not, however,\nstate that other information, namely, the unit numbers or voting shares, may\nalso be disclosed in the voter list. This would be an issue which we will address\nfurther below at paragraphs 30 to 39.\n\n22.\n\nSimilarly, management corporations are required under Paragraph 3 of the\nSecond Schedule to the BMSMA to keep the minutes of any meeting of the\ncouncil or executive committee of the management corporation, and display\nthose minutes on the notice board. Paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to the\nBMSMA reads as follows:\n“Keeping of records\n3.—(1) The council or executive committee shall keep minutes of its\nproceedings and shall cause minutes of general meetings to be kept.\n(2) If the management corporation or subsidiary management corporation\nis required by its by-laws to maintain a notice board, its council or executive\ncommittee, as the case may be, shall —\n(a) cause a copy of the minutes of a meeting of the council or executive\ncommittee, as the case may be, to be displayed on the notice board\nwithin 7 days after the meeting; and\n(b) cause a copy of a minute of any resolution thereof, or of the\nmanagement corporation or subsidiary management corporation, as the\n6\n\n\fcase may be, passed in accordance with this Act to be displayed on the\nnotice board after it is passed.\n(3) A copy of any minutes referred to in sub-paragraph (2) shall be kept\ndisplayed on the notice board for a period of not less than 14 days.\n(4) If there is no notice board, the council or executive committee\nconcerned shall give each resident a copy of the minutes referred to in subparagraph (2)(a) or (b) within the period specified in that sub-paragraph.\n(5) The council or executive committee shall —\n(a) cause proper books of account to be kept in respect of all sums of\nmoney received and expended by it, specifying the matters in relation to\nwhich the receipts and expenditure take place; and\n(b) on the application of a resident or mortgagee of a lot (or any person\nauthorised in writing by him), make the books of account available for\ninspection at all reasonable times.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n23.\n\nWhile Paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to the BMSMA does not expressly\nstate the information that ought to be included (or omitted) in the minutes of\nmeeting that is displayed on the notice board, in the Commission’s view, the\nfunction and purpose of minutes of meetings, at least in the context of the\nBMSMA, is to fully and accurately record what was discussed and what\nhappened at the meeting. This includes recording the declarations made under\nsection 60(7) of the BMSMA3, and the resolutions and/or motions that were\npassed. Such minutes serve a variety of purposes including being record of\ndiscussions for future reference, or to capture the rationale behind the decisions\nbeing made. It is therefore implicit in the definition and understanding of\n“minutes of meetings” that it can contain the personal data of individuals, as\npart of this full and accurate recording of the meeting: eg attendance,\nparticipation in discussions and views expressed, as the subject of matters\ndiscussed in the meeting agenda.\n\n24.\n\nIn this regard, the Commission agrees with the position taken by the Office of\nthe Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia (“OIPC”):4\n\n3 Section 60(7) of the BMSMA states: “The secretary of the council shall record every declaration under\n\nthis section in the minutes of the meeting at which it was made.”\n4 Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Privacy Guidelines for Strata\nCorporations and Strata Agents (June 2015), online: OIPC <https://www.oipc.bc.ca/guidancedocuments/1455> at page 19.\n\n7\n\n\f“[A] strata council should ensure that every statement in the strata council\nminutes is accurate, objective and verifiable and that the minutes contain\nthe minimum amount of personal information necessary.”\n25.\n\nThe OIPC also provided some guidance on the personal information that may\nbe recorded in the strata council minutes:5\n“If a strata council member or a guest attends a strata council meeting, they\nhave provided implied consent to have their name recorded in the strata\ncouncil minutes.\nSimilarly, the names of any authorised people in attendance at the meeting,\nsuch as the strata manager, can be noted in the minutes. The name, strata\nlot number and/or unit number of each strata council member, who is not\nattending the meeting, should also be recorded.\n…\nMinutes of strata council meetings should record all decisions made by the\nstrata council, but need not include the exact discussions leading up to any\nvotes. It is important that the strata council minutes clearly document how\nresolutions are amended and what outcome of any votes were.\nStrata councils should ensure that only the minimal amount of personal\ninformation required to provide an accurate and objective account of its\ndecisions is recorded in the meeting minutes.”\n\n26.\n\nIn the Exceltec case, the draft minutes if the 1st council meeting disclosed the\nnames and unit numbers of the residents. In the Commission’s view, the names\nof the residents would reasonably form part of the minutes of the council\nmeeting as there is a need to identify and record the persons in attendance (or\nabsence), including the council office bearers and the residents who are sitting\nin the meeting as observers. Given that Paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule\nto the BMSMA provides for an organisation (specifically, the MCST or managing\nagent) to disclose the full and accurate minutes of the council meeting on the\nnotice board, it must be taken that the personal data (ie the names) are to be\ndisclosed as part of the overall publication of the minutes of meetings. When\nread together with section 13(b) of the PDPA, Exceltec is allowed to disclose\nthe names and of the residents in the minutes of meeting without obtaining the\nresidents’ consent.\n\n5 Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Privacy Guidelines for Strata\n\nCorporations and Strata Agents (June 2015), online: OIPC <https://www.oipc.bc.ca/guidancedocuments/1455> at page 17.\n\n8\n\n\f27.\n\nIn respect of the unit numbers found in the minutes of meeting, it should first be\nnoted that a unit number in and of itself is not personal data. The association of\nthe unit number with the person attending the meeting renders the pair personal\ndata. Having considered the matter, the Commission is of the view that if the\npurpose of including the name of the person attending the council meeting is to\nidentify him, then the inclusion of the unit in the minutes of meeting is\nreasonable because it serves to establish the basis for his attendance (ie he is\nthe subsidiary proprietor or represents the subsidiary proprietor of that unit). In\nany event, as will be dealt with below, the publicly available exception would\napply to the disclosure of such personal data.\n\n28.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission makes the following findings:\n\n29.\n\na.\n\nIn respect of the disclosures that were made by the Organisations of the\nresidents’ names in the voter lists, these were in compliance with the\nConsent Obligation and Notification Obligation, pursuant to Paragraph 7\nof the First Schedule of the BMSMA read with section 13(b) of the PDPA.\n\nb.\n\nIn respect of the disclosures of the residents’ (i) names and (ii) unit\nnumbers that were made by Exceltec of the minutes of meetings, these\nwere in compliance with the Consent Obligation and Notification\nObligation, pursuant to Paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule of the\nBMSMA read with section 13(b) of the PDPA.\n\nThis leaves open the question of whether or not the disclosures of (i) unit\nnumbers and (ii) voting shares of residents in the voters list are also permitted\nto be disclosed under the PDPA. These two issues will now be addressed in\nthe paragraphs below.\n\nSub-issue (2): Whether the disclosure fell under the public availability exception\n30.\n\nThe Commission also found that the public availability exception6 is applicable\nin this case. Public availability (of the personal data) is an exception to the\nConsent Obligation and Notification Obligation, and allows for personal data to\nbe disclosed without obtaining consent, as provided for in section 17(3) of the\nPDPA read with Paragraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA.\n\n31.\n\nPublic availability, in relation to personal data about an individual, is defined in\nsection 2(1) of the PDPA to be personal data that is generally available to the\npublic, and includes personal data which can be observed by reasonably\nexpected means at a location or event (a) at which the individual appears, and\n(b) that is open to the public.\n\n6 Paragraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA.\n\n9\n\n\f32.\n\nIn its Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA, the Commission has\nstated at paragraph 12.58 that personal data will be generally available to be\npublic as long as “any member of the public could obtain or access the data\nwith few or no restrictions” (emphasis added).\n\n33.\n\nIn the present case, the disclosures that were made by the Organisations, on\nthe whole, were the (i) names, (ii) unit numbers and, in the cases of Exceltec\nand Strata Land, (iii) the voting shares of residents. The Commission is of the\nview that all these three types of personal data were generally available to the\npublic for the following reasons.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, the information can be found in the strata roll, which is generally available\nto the public. Under section 47(1)(b) of the BMSMA, any resident or mortgagee,\nprospective purchaser or mortgagee, or even a person authorised in writing by\nthe resident or mortgagee, may make an application to the managing\ncorporation for the property’s strata roll. All management corporations are\nrequired to prepare and maintain a strata roll which contains, among other\nthings, the (i) names and (ii) addresses (including the apartment unit number)\nof residents and mortgagees of the lots, and the (iii) respective share value of\nthe lots.7 Since access to these strata rolls extends to “prospective” purchasers\nor mortgagees as well, in practical terms, this allows almost any member of\npublic who claims to be a “prospective” purchaser to gain access the\ninformation in the strata roll.\n\n35.\n\nSecond, there are few restrictions under the BMSMA for a person to gain\naccess to the strata roll. In order for a person to inspect the strata roll (amongst\nother information that the MCST has to make available under Section 47(1)(b)\nBMSMA, ie minutes of general meetings of MCST and council, or any other\nrecord in the custody or control of the MCST), the person only needs to do two\nthings: (a) make an application to the MCST and (b) pay the prescribed fee in\norder to obtain the strata roll. There are generally no other pre-requisites or\nqualifications needed to fulfil in order to obtain the strata roll. Even though\nsection 47 of the BMSMA states that the strata roll shall only be made available\nto a defined group (ie residents, mortgagees or purchasers), “prospective”\nmortgagees or purchasers as well as such persons authorised by residents or\nmortgagees are included in the group. The expansion of the defined group\nrenders it very difficult to enforce checks to ensure that the applicant for the\ninformation falls within the class. The practical reality is that there is a very low\nbarrier to cross for a person to access the strata roll, besides just simply making\nthe online application and paying the prescribed fee.\n\n7 Pursuant to Section 46 of the BMSMA.\n\n10\n\n\f36.\n\nThird, some of this information may already be found on the Singapore Land\nAuthority Registry (“SLA”), which the public would generally have access to. In\nthis regard, anyone can purchase property title information, property ownership\ninformation and land information, which include name, unit number and share\nvalue of the lot, for a prescribed fee. Similar to the strata roll, SLA imposes no\nor few restrictions on the purchase.\n\n37.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission takes the view that the names, unit numbers, and\nvoting shares of the residents (which are, for all intents and purposes, the same\nas the share value of the apartment) are publicly available information under\nthe PDPA.\n\n38.\n\nAs the information was publicly available, therefore, pursuant to section 17(3)\nof the PDPA and Paragraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA, there\nwas no need for the Organisations to obtain consent from the residents or\nprovide prior notification to the residents before the Organisations disclosed the\nnames, unit numbers, and voting shares of the residents found in the strata\nrolls.\n\n39.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission is of the view that the above exceptions\nare applicable, and that the Organisations are neither in breach of the Consent\nObligation or Notification Obligation in respect of the residents’ personal data.\n\nIssue (c): Whether the Organisations had disclosed more personal data than\nnecessary in the voter lists and minutes of meeting\n40.\n\nIn consideration of the applicability of the exceptions to the PDPA, the\nCommission also looked at whether the Organisations had disclosed more\npersonal data than they were required or authorised to in the voter lists and\nminutes of meeting.\n(i) Voter lists\n\n41.\n\nIt was already determined above that the Organisations are permitted to\ndisclose the names of residents for the voter list on the notice board, without\nobtaining consent or providing notification, pursuant to Paragraph 7 of the First\nSchedule of the BMSMA and section 13(b) of the PDPA.\n\n42.\n\nHowever, based on the express wording of Paragraph 7 of the First Schedule\nto the BMSMA, this does not appear to extend to the disclosure of unit numbers\nand voting shares of the residents. The exception under section 13(b) of the\nPDPA therefore does not apply to the disclosure of such personal data on the\nnotice board.\n\n11\n\n\f43.\n\nNonetheless, as mentioned above, the residents’ unit numbers and voting\nshares were publicly available information, and therefore could be disclosed\nwithout notifying the residents of the purpose for disclosure or obtaining prior\nconsent from them before disclosure.\n(ii) Minutes of meeting\n\n44.\n\nTurning to the minutes of meeting, the Commission also considered whether\nExceltec was specifically required to record the personal data of the residents,\nie their names and unit numbers, in the draft minutes of the 1st council meeting.\n\n45.\n\nIt has already been mentioned above at paragraphs 26 to 28 that personal data\nfound in the minutes of meetings may be disclosed pursuant to Paragraph 7 of\nthe First Schedule of the BMSMA read with section 13(b) of the PDPA.\n\n46.\n\nHowever, this position should not be construed to mean that MCSTs and\nmanaging agents may include personal data of their residents without any\nrestriction. The Commission cautions that any personal data recorded in the\nminutes should be relevant to the proceedings and necessary to ensure a full\nand accurate record of the conduct of the meeting. In a case where personal\ndata is disclosed without being in any way relevant to the agenda of the\nmeeting, the Commission may take the appropriate enforcement action.\n\nIssue (d): Whether the Organisations had disclosed personal data for longer\nthan necessary\n47.\n\nKeeping the voter lists posted on the notice boards for a period of time may be\nseen as a continuous disclosure of the personal data in the voter lists. In the\ncase of Strata Land, the disclosure was for approximately a 2-month period,\nwhereas in the case of MCST 2956, the disclosure was for a 2-day period.\n\n48.\n\nThe Commission is of the view that MCSTs and managing agents should\ngenerally only keep the voter list and minutes of meetings that contain personal\ndata on the notice board for only a reasonable period of time. Good data\nprotection practices dictate that the period of exposure of personal data and the\nlength of such exposure should be minimised as far as possible, even if the\ndisclosure is, in and of itself, permitted under the PDPA. By keeping personal\ndata longer than necessary, an organisation runs the risk of falling afoul of the\nRetention Obligation under section 25 of the PDPA.\n\n49.\n\nIn the case of MCST 2956, displaying the voter list on the notice board for 2\ndays cannot be said to be unduly protracted. In the case of Strata Land, the\nperiod was 2 months. Considering that the voter list is intended to establish both\nthe persons who are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting and also the\n12\n\n\fshare value or voting rights of each of such persons, it stands to reason that\nthe voter list may be displayed on the notice board for as long a duration as the\nminutes of meeting. This provides the conscientious reader of the minutes of\nmeeting the means by which to verify the accuracy of the minutes of meeting,\ninsofar as it concerns the identity of the voters and the calculation of votes. The\nCommission bore in mind that the minutes of meeting must be displayed for at\nleast 14 days: see Paragraph 3 of the Second Schedule to the BMSMA,\nreproduced in paragraph 22 above.\n50.\n\nTaking this minimum period of displaying as the basis for comparison, it is the\nCommission’s view that keeping the voter list posted on the notice board for 2\nmonths is not an unduly protracted period. Admittedly, assessments of\ndiscretions are not an exact science and there can be a range of validly held\nviews as to what a reasonable period ought to be. In cases such as these where\nthe reasonableness of a course of action is called to question, the Commission\nrestricts its role to determining when the action is so clearly unreasonable such\nthat sanctions under the PDPA are warranted. For the present case, it is not\nnecessary to express any view as to when a period crosses the threshold and\nbecomes unreasonably protracted. It sufficient for this decision that a period of\n2 months is not so unreasonably long that it ought to attract a sanction under\nthe PDPA.\n\n51.\n\nIn this case, for the reasons above, the Commission finds that MCST 2956 and\nStrata Land are not in breach of the PDPA in respect of the duration of the\ndisclosures that were made.\n\nIssue (e): Whether the disclosure of personal data may be made on multiple\nnotice boards\n52.\n\nThe last issue, raised by the 3rd Complainant, is whether there was a\nrequirement that the disclosure of the voter lists had to be made on all the notice\nboards of the condominium unit, or whether it was only necessary for the\ndisclosure to be made on one.\n\n53.\n\nSince the disclosure of personal data in the voter list is permissible under the\nPDPA for the reasons above, there are no restrictions to the voter list being\ndisclosed on multiple notice boards under the PDPA. Moreover, the BMSMA\ndoes not make a distinction whether or not the disclosure is to be made on one\nnotice board or multiple notice boards.\n\n54.\n\nAccordingly, Strata Land is not in breach of the PDPA for disclosing the voter\nlist on multiple notice boards.\n\n13\n\n\fD.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n55.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Commission therefore concludes that the\nOrganisations have not breached the Consent and Notification Obligations\nunder the PDPA in relation to the disclosure of personal data in the voter lists\nand minutes of meeting, and has decided to take no further action in respect of\nthe complaints made.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Asia-Pacific Star, as a data intermediary, for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the disclosure of the personal data of Tiger Airways Singapore's passengers.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Others"],"date":"2017-05-31","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---tigerair-sats-aps-310517.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Asia-Pacific Star","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/05/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-asia-pacific-star","timestamp":"2017-05-31","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1607-B0129\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012\nAnd\n(1)\n\nTiger Airways Singapore Pte Ltd (UEN No.\n200312665W)\n\n(2)\n\nSATS Ltd (UEN No. 197201770G)\n\n(3)\n\nAsia-Pacific Star Private Limited (UEN No.\n199705514Z)\n… Organisations\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 6\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n\n31 May 2017\n\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nOn 27 July 2016, the Personal Data Protection Commission received a\ncomplaint that the passenger name list for Tiger Airways Singapore Pte\nLtd (“Tigerair”) flight TR2466 (“Flight Manifest”) had been improperly\ndisposed in a rubbish bin in the gate hold room at Changi Airport. The\ncomplainant alleged that the Flight Manifest could have been retrieved\nby anyone in the vicinity.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission undertook an investigation into the matter and sets out\nits findings and grounds of decision below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS\n\n3.\n\nTigerair is a low cost carrier. SATS Ltd (“SATS”) is an aviation ground\nhandling service provider. SATS was engaged by Tigerair to provide\nground handling services. In accordance with the terms of the ground\nhandling services contract between SATS and Tigerair (“Ground\nHandling Services Contract”), SATS was responsible for the provision\nof the services by its subsidiaries as if it had been provided by SATS\nitself.\n\nPage 1 of 8\n\n\f4.\n\nAsia-Pacific Star Private Limited (“APS”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of\nSATS. SATS sub-contracted the provision of ground handling services\nfor Tigerair to APS pursuant to a Services Agreement dated 11 June\n2014 (“Services Agreement”).\n\n5.\n\nUnder the Services Agreement, APS was responsible for managing the\nboarding process, reconciling passenger numbers and verifying travel\ndocuments at the boarding gate. Among other things, APS was required\nto print a copy of the Flight Manifest at the boarding gate for the cabin\ncrew to take on board the flight and submit to the immigration authority\nat the arrival destination.\n\n6.\n\nOn 26 July 2016, an APS employee who was on gate duty for flight\nTR2466 ran out of paper while printing a copy of the Flight Manifest. The\nAPS employee disposed of the partially-printed Flight Manifest in the\nrubbish bin in the gate hold room for flight TR2466 and reprinted the\nFlight Manifest in full (“Data Breach Incident”). The gate hold room\nwhere the partially-printed Flight Manifest was discarded was only\naccessible to passengers and airport staff.\n\n7.\n\nNone of the Organisations (nor the complainant) could verify the exact\nnumber of passengers whose personal data was disclosed in the\npartially-printed Flight Manifest.\n\n8.\n\nThe partially-printed Flight Manifest contained passenger personal data\nsuch as the passenger’s name, booking reference number (also known\nas PNR), fare class, sequence number of check-in, date of booking, seat\nnumber, destination and flight number.\n\n9.\n\nOther personal data such as the passenger’s full name, passport number,\nhome address, phone number, email address and last four digits of the\ncredit card used to pay for the plane ticket could have been retrieved by\nentering the passenger’s name and the PNR into Tigerair’s “Manage My\nBooking” portal. Special features or add-ons to the passenger’s flight(s)\nand travels, such as hotel bookings and airport transfers or cars rentals\nwould also have been reflected on the “Manage My Booking” portal. This\ninformation was only accessible up to the last travelling date of the\npassenger’s itinerary.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n10.\n\nAt the outset, the Commission finds that the partially-printed Flight\nManifest constitutes personal data as defined in section 2(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). The Flight Manifest\ncontained data about the passengers who could be identified either from\nthat data alone or from that data and the data on Tigerair’s “Manage My\nBooking” portal.\n\nPage 2 of 8\n\n\fIssues for determination\n11.\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commission are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhether SATS and APS were acting as data intermediaries for\nTigerair in relation to the Tigerair passengers’ personal data; and\n\n(b)\n\nwhether each of the Organisations complied with its obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Data Breach\nIncident.\n\nIssue (a): Whether SATS and APS were acting as data intermediaries for\nTigerair in relation to the Tigerair passengers’ personal data\n12.\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 3 above, SATS was engaged by Tigerair to\nprovide services such as managing the boarding process, reconciliation\nof passenger numbers and verification of travel documents at the\nboarding gate. These are activities of “processing” personal data on\nbehalf of Tigerair as defined in section 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n13.\n\nSATS had sub-contracted the provision of the services to APS but\nremained responsible for the provision of ground handling services as if\nthey were performed by SATS itself. APS was granted access to\nTigerair’s “Departure Control System” which contained all the\ninformation related to a passenger’s booking to carry out activities of\n“processing” on behalf of Tigerair. Accordingly, the Commission is\nsatisfied that SATS and APS were both acting as data intermediaries of\nTigerair.\n\n14.\n\nA data intermediary has a duty to comply with the Protection Obligation\nunder section 4(2) of the PDPA. An organisation has the same obligation\nin respect of personal data processed by a data intermediary on its\nbehalf and for its purposes as if the personal data were processed by\nthe organisation itself under section 4(3) of the PDPA. Accordingly,\nTigerair, SATS and APS each have an obligation to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data of Tigerair\npassengers in their possession and/or under their control.\n\nIssue (b): Whether each of the Organisations complied with its obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Data Breach Incident\n15.\n\nIt was not disputed that the partially-printed Flight Manifest was\nimproperly disposed of by the APS employee at the gate hold room.\nHowever, the Organisations represented that they had adequate policies\nand processes regarding the protection of personal data. The Data\nBreach Incident was simply an isolated incident that occurred due to the\noversight of the APS employee.\n\n16.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA places a positive obligation on an organisation\nto make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data\nPage 3 of 8\n\n\fin its possession or under its control and to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar\nrisks.\n17.\n\nIn accordance with section 11(1) of the PDPA, the reasonableness of\nsecurity arrangements made is objectively determined, having regard to\nwhat a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the\ncircumstances. In the context of section 24, this means that an\norganisation is not required to provide an absolute guarantee for the\nprotection of personal data in its possession, but that it must make such\nsecurity arrangements as a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate, given the nature of the personal data involved and the\nparticular circumstances of that organisation.\n\n18.\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of security arrangements, the\nCommission will also take into consideration the factors set out in the\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA:\n(a)\n\nthe nature of the personal data;\n\n(b)\n\nthe form in which the personal data has been collected (e.g.\nphysical or electronic); and\n\n(c)\n\nthe possible impact to the individual concerned if an unauthorised\nperson obtained, modified or disposed of the personal data.\n\nTigerair\n19.\n\nAs an organisation under the PDPA, Tigerair has the primary\nresponsibility of ensuring that there are reasonable security\narrangements in place to protect the personal data in its possession or\nunder its control. Tigerair remains ultimately responsible even though it\nhad engaged a data intermediary to provide ground handling services\nand process personal data on its behalf.\n\n20.\n\nUnder the Ground Handling Services Contract, Tigerair required SATS\nto establish and maintain local procedures to comply with the PDPA in\nits provision of services to Tigerair.\n\n21.\n\nSATS was also required to carry out all services in accordance with\nTigerair’s ground services manual (“Ground Services Manual”). The\nGround Services Manual specifically provided that ground handlers were\nto adhere to the requirements of the PDPA, including the obligations to\nuse personal data only for the purposes for which consent had been\nobtained, protect personal data in its custody, and prevent disclosure to\nunauthorised persons.\n\n22.\n\nIn the present context, the ground handling services fell under the\nresponsibility of SATS and APS, both of whom had the responsibility of\nensuring that in the provision of these services, personal data was\nPage 4 of 8\n\n\fadequately protected. In this regard, having imposed a contractual\nobligation on SATS to establish and maintain local procedures to comply\nwith the PDPA, the Commission finds it reasonable for Tigerair to have\nexpected SATS to carry out its obligations in accordance with the\ncontract and the relevant sections of the Ground Services Manual.\n23.\n\nFurther, given that SATS was contractually accountable for APS’\nprovision of services, it was reasonable for Tigerair to have expected\nSATS to ensure that APS would implement reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data that it processed on behalf of\nTigerair. This is especially since Tigerair did not have oversight over the\nactions of APS’ employees.\n\n24.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds that Tigerair had complied with its\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nSATS\n25.\n\nSATS had, in its Service Agreement with APS for the sub-contracting of\nground handling services for Tigerair, expressly required APS to comply\nwith and ensure that the ground handling services were provided and\nperformed in a manner which did not infringe any applicable laws,\nregulations and directions, including the PDPA.\n\n26.\n\nIn addition, SATS implemented the SATS Group Code of Conduct\n(“Group Code of Conduct”), which required all employees who may\nhandle, receive, collect, use, disclose or transfer any personal data to\ncomply with the PDPA and the Personal Data Protection Policy (“Group\nData Protection Policy”).\n\n27.\n\nThe Group Data Protection Policy sets out guidelines on the physical\nmeasures that should be undertaken to protect personal data.\nSpecifically, the guidelines recommended that there should be proper\nand secure disposal of documents containing personal data, such as\nrequiring such documents to be shredded. APS was required to comply\nwith both the Group Code of Conduct and the Group Data Protection\nPolicy as it was a member of the SATS Group.\n\n28.\n\nSATS also sent periodic updates and reminders to the SATS Group\nmanagement and staff (including those from APS) to remind them about\ntheir data protection obligations under the Group Code of Conduct and\nthe Group Data Protection Policy. Pertinently, SATS conducted annual\n“Control Self-Assessment” exercises as part of its enterprise risk\nmanagement and required the General Manager of APS to confirm APS’\ncompliance with the Group Data Protection Policy.\n\n29.\n\nIn view of the above, the Commission finds that SATS made reasonable\nsecurity arrangements and fulfilled its Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nPage 5 of 8\n\n\fAPS\n30.\n\nAPS represented that it had put in place security arrangements and the\nData Breach Incident was an isolated incident that occurred as a result\nof a lapse by an APS employee. Pursuant to section 53(1) of the PDPA,\nany act done or conduct engaged in by an employee in the course of his\nemployment shall be treated as done or engaged in by his employer as\nwell as by him, regardless of whether it was done or engaged in with the\nemployer’s knowledge or approval. Accordingly, APS remains\nresponsible for its employee’s conduct.\n\n31.\n\nAlthough the Commission finds that APS did have some security\narrangements in place, the Commission is not satisfied that APS fulfilled\nits Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n32.\n\nAs mentioned at paragraph 27 above, APS is part of the SATS Group,\nall APS employees are required to comply with the Group Code of\nConduct and the Group Data Protection Policy. The Group Code of\nConduct was annexed to APS employees’ letters of employment and all\nnew APS employees received a briefing on the requirement to comply\nwith the PDPA during their employee induction programme.\n\n33.\n\nHowever, APS relied solely on the administrative safeguards\nimplemented by SATS, which applied to the organisations within the\nSATS Group. There was no evidence that APS provided additional\ninformation or implemented additional safeguards in order to\ncontextualise the group level policies to its ground operations. In line with\nthe Commission’s observation In the Matter of National University of\nSingapore that general guidelines did not necessarily translate into the\nkind of practices that were actually needed on the ground to protect\npersonal data1, it is likewise important here for organisations to ensure\nthat an organisation’s policies and training have to be contextualised to\nits operational setting. In this case, there was no evidence that APS had\nany procedure or policy of its own apart from the SATS Group Data\nProtection Policy.\n\n34.\n\nCrucially, given that the personal data found in the Flight Manifest\nprovided further access to personal information of an even more\nsensitive nature found on the “Manage My Bookings” portal, the impact\nto the passengers from the improper disposal was higher. Given the\npotential adverse consequences of unauthorised access to that personal\ndata (from the initial and secondary exposure), APS should have\nafforded a high level of protection to such personal data, with greater\nattention given to the proper disposal of documents containing such\npersonal data. The specific scenarios (like the present) where there are\nrisks of data leaks through inappropriate handling or disposal of Flight\nManifests that are likely to arise in ground operations (eg staff handling\nFlight Manifests at the gates) ought to have been part of the effort to\n\n1 [2017] SGPDPC 5, at [32].\n\nPage 6 of 8\n\n\ftranslate and contextualise the group level policies for APS’s specific\ncircumstances.\n35.\n\nAdditionally, as the Commission observed In the Matter of National\nUniversity of Singapore2, security policies and procedures are essential\nbut they are only effective when properly and consistently implemented\nand followed by employees. Ongoing training on the organisation’s data\nprotection obligations and the organisation’s data protection policies and\nprocedures is key to fostering and maintaining a high organisational\nawareness of data protection concerns and to ensure that the data\nprotection obligations under the PDPA are consistently understood and\nacted upon by employees. This was also observed by the Commission\nIn the Matter of National University of Singapore3. Yet, as set out in\nparagraph 32 above, the only training that APS employees appeared to\nhave received was a general data protection briefing during the\nemployee induction programme for new employees.\n\n36.\n\nAPS should have provided customised training and regular refresher\ntraining for APS employees who routinely handled passengers’ personal\ndata. APS processes the personal data of a large number of individuals,\nincluding passenger identification information such as the Flight Manifest,\non a regular basis in the course of its duties.\n\n37.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings on the lack of administrative and\nphysical safeguards in place, the Commission finds that APS did not\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data it\nprocessed on behalf of Tigerair.\n\nD.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n\n38.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Commission has determined that\nAPS did not comply with its Protection Obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA. In exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission\npursuant to section 29(1) of the PDPA, the Commission directs APS to:\n\n39.\n\n(a)\n\nconduct a review of its procedure for proper disposal of personal\ndata in its possession and/or control;\n\n(b)\n\nintroduce data protection policies that are contextualised and\npertinent to the services provided by APS and functions\nperformed by its staff; and\n\n(c)\n\ninclude a programme for initial and refresher training on its\nimplementation by the APS staff in the course of its operations.\n\nIn assessing the breach and remedial directions to be imposed (including\nnot imposing a financial penalty on APS in this case), the Commission\n\n2 [2017] SGPDPC 5, at [25].\n3 [2017] SGPDPC 5, at [20] – [28].\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\n\fconsidered various factors relating to the case, including the mitigating\nfactors set out below:\n\n40.\n\n(a)\n\nthe gate hold room where the Flight Manifest was disposed was\naccessible only by passengers and airport staff;\n\n(b)\n\nthe bin where the Flight Manifest was disposed could reasonably\nbe expected to be emptied regularly as part of routine\nmaintenance;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Flight Manifest held data that served as login credentials to\nindividual passengers’ personal data on the “Manage My\nBookings” portal. However, the information on the page was only\naccessible for a limited time until the last traveling date on the\npassenger’s itinerary;\n\n(d)\n\nthere were no complaints of any actual unauthorised access to\nthe manage my bookings page of any passenger.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any\ninstance of non-compliance under the PDPA. Organisations should take\nthe necessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations\nunder the PDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the\nappropriate enforcement action against the organisations accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Furnituremart for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent the disclosure of the personal data of a customer.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"2017-05-31","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---furnituremart-(310517).pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Furnituremart","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/05/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-furnituremart","timestamp":"2017-05-31","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1611-B0319\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n\nFurnituremart.sg (UEN 53169430E)\n… Organisation\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 7\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n31 May 2017\n1.\n\nThis is a case involving an organisation which had issued to its customer\n(the Complainant) an invoice which had a separate invoice (“second\ninvoice”) containing personal data of another customer printed on the\nreverse side. In this regard, the other customer’s personal data was\ndisclosed to the Complainant, comprising of the following information of\nthe other customer:\na. Customer’s surname;\nb. Home address;\nc. Delivery address;\nd. Telephone number; and\ne. E-mail address.\n\n2.\n\nThe Complainant made a complaint to the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) on 7 November 2016 of the disclosure\nthat was made, and the Commission conducted an investigation into the\nmatter. It now sets out its findings of its investigations below.\n\nA.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of trading furniture, bedding, and\nother domestic products.\n\nPage 1 of 7\n\n\f4.\n\nWhenever it issues its invoices, the Organisation’s procedure is to make\nthree copies of every invoice: The first for the Organisation’s filing, the\nsecond for the customer, and the third for the customer to sign and return\nto the Organisation on delivery of the goods.\n\n5.\n\nAccording to the Organisation, all signed copies of invoices are\nsupposed to be returned to its office, and subsequently destroyed by its\nstaff on a daily basis.\n\n6.\n\nIn this case, however, the returned invoice was put in a printer feed tray,\nand re-used as printing paper for the complainant’s invoice.\n\n7.\n\nIn support of the foregoing, the Organisation provided the Commission\nwith a document entitled, “Policies and internal guideline [sic] for the\nprotection of personal data of customers as at November 2016”. The\ndocument provided for, amongst other things, (a) all invoices to be\nprinted on new paper (b) the supervisor to check that the invoices are\nprinted on new paper instead of reused paper containing customer’s\ninformation (c) the delivery man to check the invoices to ensure that the\nback of the invoices do not contain other customers' information (d) the\nacknowledgment copy of the invoices be destroyed after delivery man\nreturns the copy to the Organisation (e) the Organisation’s customer\ninformation to be kept safe. The Organisation claimed that some of the\npolicies set out in the document had already been implemented prior to\nNovember 2016.\n\n8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that none of its staff had undergone any\ntraining in respect of the Organisation’s obligations under the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Further, no training was conducted\nto explain the Organisation’s own internal policies and guidelines to its\nstaff. However, the Organisation claimed that management had briefed\nstaff on the internal policies and guidelines at an unspecified meeting.\n\nB.\n\nCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n\n(i)\n\nThere was an unauthorised disclosure of personal data\n\n9.\n\nThe information disclosed by the second invoice is personal data within\nthe meaning of section 2 of the PDPA, which requires that the individual\nmay be identified from the data. Given that the surname of the customer\nwas provided, along with the customer’s address, e-mail address, and\ntelephone number, it was possible to identify that customer solely from\nthe information disclosed by the second invoice.\n\n10.\n\nGiven that the disclosure of such information contained in the second\ninvoice was made without consent or authority under the PDPA (or other\nwritten laws), it was an unauthorised disclosure of personal data under\nthe PDPA.\n\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\f(ii)\n\nThe unauthorised disclosure was the result of a breach of the\nOrganisation’s obligation to make reasonable arrangements for the\nprotection of personal data\n\n11.\n\nThe Organisation claims that the unauthorised disclosure was an\nisolated incident that occurred due to the negligence of its staff.\nSpecifically, that someone accidentally placed the second invoice in the\nprinting tray instead of destroying it. In this regard, it could be argued\nthat the unauthorised disclosure was simply caused by a one-off mistake\nby the Organisation’s staff, and not due to any lack or failure to put in\nplace “reasonable security arrangements” under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n12.\n\nFrom the Commission’s investigations, though, there were more deeprooted problems with the Organisation’s processes, and it lacked the\nnecessary policies and practices to protect personal data. These failures\nand omissions by the Organisation are detailed below.\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation effectively did not have any policy in place to\nprotect personal data\n\n13.\n\nThe Organisation had produced to the Commission a copy of its data\nprotection policy which it says was put in place in November 2016. This\nis the same month in which the data breach had taken place. Prior to\nthis, the Organisation claims it did not have a written policy on the\nprotection of personal data.\n\n14.\n\nThe lack of a written policy is a big drawback to the protection of personal\ndata. Without having a policy in writing, employees and staff would not\nhave a reference for the Organisation’s policies and practices which they\nare to follow in order to protect personal data. Such policies and\npractices would be ineffective if passed on by word of mouth, and indeed,\nthe Organisation may run the risk of the policies and practices being\npassed on incorrectly. Having a written policy is conducive to the conduct\nof internal training, which is a necessary component of an internal data\nprotection programme.\n\n15.\n\nIn relation to the Organisation’s data protection policy itself, it consisted\nof a mere six bullet points. At least three of the six points in the policy\nrelates coincidentally to the data breach incident – for example, it\nprovides that the supervisor has to check that the invoices are printed\non new paper instead of reused paper containing customer’s information.\nAdditionally, the policy was put in place the same period of time as the\ndata breach incident. The combination of the timing and content of the\npolicy raises suspicion, and the Commission cannot rule out the\npossibility, that it was created subsequent to the breach to address that\nparticular incident.\n\n16.\n\nAdditionally, investigations did not reveal any evidence to show that\nsteps were taken to implement the data protection policy that the\nOrganisation had put in place. Some of the evidence that ought ordinarily\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\fto have presented would be internal communications of the data\nprotection policy to staff, internal briefings conducted to raise staff\nawareness and training events and collateral to educate staff. During the\ninvestigation, the Commission specifically asked the Organisation what\nother arrangements, apart from the policy documents that they had\nalready produced, the Organisation had in place to mitigate the risk of\nan unauthorised disclosure of personal data on the printed invoices. The\nCommission also asked for documentary evidence of such\narrangements. The Organisation replied that it had assigned “a\nsupervisor” to ensure that signed invoices were destroyed at the end of\neach business day, and even suggested that the supervisor was there\nto check that “invoices were not printed on the reverse side of invoice\npaper”. However, there were several issues which cast doubt on the\nOrganisation’s response:\na.\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nThe Organisation did not produce any documentary or other proof\nof its processes and workflow to show the supervisor’s place and\nrole in the relevant process or workflow;\nLikewise, there was no indication of the actions or tasks that the\nsupervisor was supposed to perform as part of the supervisory\nchecks in the overall invoice process; and\nThere was no explanation why the supervisor did not pick up on\nthe erroneous invoices (when that was the precise risk that the\nsupervisor was tasked to spot).\n\nIn the premises, the Commission assessed the Organisation’s claim that\nit had an effective supervisory check put in place as no more than a bare\nassertion that was not adequately supported by facts disclosed during\ninvestigations. In the final analysis, the Commission is not satisfied by\nthe Organisation’s response that the Organisation had translated its\npolicies (if any) to effective practices to protect personal data.\n17.\n\nFrom the above, given the shortcomings in the Organisation’s data\nprotection policy, and the absence of evidence in its implementation, the\nCommission is not satisfied that the Organisation had an effective data\nprotection policy at the time of the data breach incident to protect\npersonal data.\n\n18.\n\nNext, the Organisation admitted that it did not provide any data\nprotection training whatsoever to its employees. Again, staff training\nforms part of the effective measures to protect personal data. The\nCommission has emphasised the importance of training in its Advisory\nGuidelines1, and also in its decision In the Matter of National University\nof Singapore2. The Commission agrees with the view expressed by the\nOffice of the Australian Information Commissioner:\n\n1 PDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 15 July 2016)\n\n<https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/legislation-and-guidelines/advisory-guidelines/main-advisoryguidelines#AG1> at [17.5].\n2 [2017] SGPDPC 5 at [21] to [28].\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f“Regular staff training, and a culture of privacy awareness are\nessential to ensure compliance.”3\n19.\n\nOverall, it is clear that the Organisation did not make reasonable security\narrangements for the protection of personal data:\na. The Organisation’s data protection policy was formalised during\nthe month that the data breach occurred and could have been\nformalised after the unauthorised disclosure took place;\nb. There was no evidence to show that steps had actually been\ntaken to implement such policy prior to the breach; and\nc. Further, the Organisation admitted that its staff had no training\nwhatsoever regarding their data protection obligations.\n\n(b)\n\nAt a more basic level, the Organisation did not seem to engage in\nthe issue of what it should do to protect personal data. It had\nsimply relied on its employees carrying out their jobs correctly.\n\n20.\n\nA further point must be made. Based on the Organisation’s\nrepresentations, it would appear that the Organisation is essentially\nrelying on its employees and staff carrying out their job functions\ncorrectly to say that this is a form of data protection measure in and of\nitself. If the employees and staff had printed and sent the correct invoice\nto the correct recipient, there would not be any data protection issue to\nbegin with.\n\n21.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, it is not enough for the Organisation to simply\nrely on its staff and employees to carry out their duties correctly for the\nprotection of personal data. An organisation has certain obligations with\nrespect to personal data that it has collected and which is holds or has\ncontrol over. One such obligation is to put in place policies and measures\nto protect the personal data and to prevent unauthorised use, disclosure\nor alteration. Policies pertinent and adapted to the Organisation’s\nbusiness and processes ought to be crafted and disseminated to staff.\nIndeed, section 12(c) of the PDPA imposes an obligation for such\npolicies and practices to be communicated to staff. An effective mode of\ncommunication is to provide training to staff, whether in traditional\nclassroom settings or through other means such as online training.\n\n22.\n\nCrucially, it is important for the management of a company to “buy-in” to\nadopting good data protection practices for the company. It is from this\nstarting point – the management level – that the company’s policies and\n\n3 Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, Introduction to the APPs and OAIC’s\n\nRegulatory Approach (May 2005) <https://www.oaic.gov.au/agencies-andorganisations/training-resources/introduction-to-the-apps-and-the-oaic-s-regulatoryapproach> at p 24.\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fpractices be formulated with data protection in mind. From there, such\ngood data protection policies and practices can permeate down to and\nbe adopted at the staff level of the company. The Commission agrees\nwith the observation made by the Australian Information Commissioner\nand Privacy Commissioner of Canada in the joint investigation into\nAshley Madison:\n“Having documented security policies and procedures is a basic\norganizational security safeguard, particularly for an organization\nholding significant amounts of personal information. Making\ninformational policies and practices explicit provides clarity about\nexpectations to facilitate consistency, and helps to avoid gaps in\nsecurity coverage. It also sends key signals to employees about\nthe importance placed on information security. Furthermore, such\nsecurity policies and processes need to be updated and reviewed\nbased on the evolving threat landscape, which would be very\nchallenging if they are not formalized in some manner.”4\n23.\n\nThe above position also stresses the importance of having documented\npolicies, as mentioned at paragraph 14 above.\n\n24.\n\nIt is also important that management actively supervises employees and\ntakes responsibility for creating a culture of security-awareness. As\nobserved by the Hong Kong Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data:\n“With sound security policies and procedures in place, there is no\nguarantee that they will be followed. In this regard, supervision\nand monitoring of the implementation of the procedures are\nimportant.”5\n\n25.\n\nSimilarly, in its investigation into Monarch Beauty Supply, the Office of\nthe Alberta Privacy Commissioner found that the Store Manager and\nDistrict Manager of the organisation had not been diligent, as they had\nsimply assumed that employees would shred documents containing\ncustomers’ credit and debit card information, in line with the\norganisation’s policies. However, as management had not provided\nsufficient instruction on the care and disposal of sensitive documents,\nthe employees in fact threw the documents into the dumpster, which\nresulted in customers’ personal data falling into the hands of criminal\nsuspects 6 . Monarch Beauty Supply is an example of what could go\nwrong and the harm that results from disclosure of personal data due to\n\n4 PIPEDA Report of Findings #2016-005: Joint investigation of Ashley Madison by the Privacy\n\nCommissioner of Canada and the Australian Privacy Commissioner/Acting Australian\nInformation Commissioner <https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-anddecisions/investigations/investigations-into-businesses/2016/pipeda-2016-005/> at [65].\n5 Investigation Report: Hong Kong Police Force’s Repeated Loss of Documents Containing\nPersonal Data (R13 – 0407)\n<https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/enforcement/commissioners_findings/investigation_reports/\nfiles/R13_0407_e.pdf> at [38].\n6 Order P2006-IR-003: Monarch Beauty Supply [a division of Beauty Systems Group\n(Canada) Inc.] <https://www.oipc.ab.ca/media/127842/P2006-003IR.pdf> at [40(2)].\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\finsufficient follow through on the part of management.

To review its policy for the protection of personal data in relation\nto its order fulfilment process;\nb. To develop procedures to ensure effective implementation of its\ndata protection policy; and\nc. To conduct training to ensure that its staff are aware of, and will\ncomply with, the requirements of the PDPA when handling\npersonal data.\n\n29.\n\nThe following mitigating factors were taken in account in arriving at this\ndecision:\na. The unauthorised disclosure was made to a single person only;\nb. The personal data disclosed was not sensitive; and\nc.

Organisation\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 5\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n26 April 2017\n1.\n\nA student of the Organisation had complained to the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) that a URL link that was being circulated for\nthe Organisation’s orientation camp had disclosed (without authorisation) the\npersonal data of student volunteers from the College of Alice and Peter Tan\n(“CAPT”). CAPT is a residential college of the Organisation.\n\n2.\n\nIt was found that by following the URL link, one could access an online Excel\nspreadsheet containing the full names, mobile numbers, matriculation\nnumbers, shirt sizes, dietary preferences, dates of birth, dormitory room\nnumbers, and email addresses (the “personal data set”) of approximately 143\nstudent volunteers. The student matriculation number is a unique student\nidentification number issued by the Organisation. The matriculation number to\na student is, in a limited sense, like an NRIC number to a Singapore citizen and\npermanent resident, in that it is required for various school activities, such as\naccessing online library resources, or for the submission of examination scripts.\n\n3.\n\nBased on the complaint that was made, the Commission proceeded to\ninvestigate into an alleged breach by the Organisation of the protection\nobligation under Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\nThe following sets out the Commission’s findings following its investigations into\nthe matter.\n\nPage 1 of 10\n\n\fA.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n4.\n\nThe CAPT Freshman Orientation Camp (“FOC”) is an annual event organised\nby student volunteers from CAPT for the freshmen matriculating into the\nOrganisation. The FOC in the present case was for the year 2016.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation had designated several student leaders to take the\nresponsibility for organising the FOC. As part of the process of organising the\nFOC, these student leaders would recruit other student volunteers to participate\nas counsellors and assist in the running of the FOC.\n\n6.\n\nTo get themselves organised, the student leaders created an online form using\nGoogle Forms1 for the student volunteers to fill in their personal particulars. The\nparticulars that were entered into the Google Forms were stored in a Google\nSheets2 spreadsheet (the “Spreadsheet”), which compiled all the particulars of\nthe various student volunteers in a single spreadsheet.\n\n7.\n\nThe Spreadsheet was meant to be shared amongst the student leaders only,\nand not to the student volunteers, or anyone else. For the purpose of sharing\naccess to the Spreadsheet, a URL link to the Spreadsheet was generated\nthrough Google Sheets by selecting the “Share with specific people” function,\nand this URL link was then shared amongst the student leaders. Only specified\npersons could access the Spreadsheet as the URL link to the Spreadsheet\nrequired a user to first log in with his or her Google account.\n\n8.\n\nWhile the Spreadsheet was initially circulated to specified people (i.e. the\nstudent leaders), at some point in May 2016, the Spreadsheet came to be\ncirculated beyond the originally intended group. An unknown party, whether\nintentionally or otherwise, changed the setting on the Spreadsheet from “Share\nwith specific people” to “Share using a link”. As a result, any user who\npossessed the URL link could access the Spreadsheet, and all the personal\ndata set of the student volunteers contained within.\n\n9.\n\nConsequently, the personal data set was now exposed to those who had\naccess to the URL link, which may have extended to persons beyond the\nOrganisation itself.\n\n1 Google Forms – An online form creation application by Google.

However, the fact that\nthe data breach occurred is not necessarily indicative of a contravention of the\nPDPA. Rather, it is necessary to consider whether the Organisation’s\nsafeguards that were in place at the material time were adequate having regard\nto the volume and type of personal data in question, and whether the\nsafeguards were reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nThe Organisation’s security arrangements at the material time\n14.\n\nSecurity arrangements to protect personal data may take various forms,\nincluding administrative, physical, technical measures or a combination of\nthese. According to the Organisation, it had, at the material time, implemented\nadministrative safeguards, in the form of data protection training and guidelines,\nto adequately protect the personal data set in its possession and under its\ncontrol:\n(a)\n\nData protection training: The Organisation conducted classroom training\nin or around 2014 on the relevant data protection obligations that apply\nto the collection, use and disclosure of personal data for selected\nstudents who were likely to hold leadership roles. However, it would\nappear that the classroom training did not carry over to 2015. In 2015,\nthe Organisation had instead provided all its students with access to etraining on the PDPA. This e-training appeared on the list of trainings\navailable on the Integrated Virtual Learning Environment (“IVLE”) portal\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\fsuch that when students logged into the system, the e-training option\nwould be visible to them.\n(b)\n\nData protection guidelines: The Organisation issued guidelines for the\nstudents organising various events in the name of the Organisation to\nensure that all student activities complied with the Organisation’s\nregulations. These guidelines were adapted to become the CAPT Event\nPlanning Guidelines for Student Groups (“CAPT Guidelines”). The\nCAPT Guidelines contained a section titled “Responsible Usage and\nAccess of Personal Data”. Students in charge of planning activities in the\nname of the Organisation who collected personal data, such as “name,\nMatric No., email address, HP number”, were reminded to “observe\nproper use and access to prevent potential data leakage and\nunauthorized/accidental access.”\n\nThe Organisation did not provide adequate training for the student leaders\n15.\n\nAlthough the Organisation had in place general policies and guidelines for the\nprotection of personal data, when it came to the security arrangements on the\nground, the Organisation did not have any formalised data protection training\nin place to train and equip its students with the mind-set, knowledge, skills and\ntools to protect personal data.\n\n16.\n\nWhile the Organisation had made the e-training programme available on IVLE,\nthe Organisation did not make it compulsory for all the student leaders of the\nFOC to undergo the e-training. In any case, the Organisation confirmed that\nnone of the student leaders had undergone the e-training prior to the\ncommencement of the FOC in 2016, even though the student leaders were\ninvolved in the handling of the personal data of other students.\n\n17.\n\nWith regard to classroom training, it appeared to have been held only once in\n2014, and was only for the benefit of selected students. Although the\nOrganisation claimed that it had plans to make this classroom training an\nannual event, no such plans had materialised by the time of the FOC in 2016.\n\n18.\n\nIn this regard, there was effectively no data protection training provided to the\nstudent leaders of the FOC in 2016.\n\n19.\n\nBy the Organisation’s failure to provide adequate training for the student\nleaders before they handled personal data, this increased the risk of a data\nbreach occurrence. Even if a student leader had some knowledge of the PDPA,\nhow that translated into the actual practice of protecting personal data was\nsomething that the Organisation would not be able to ensure.\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\f20.\n\nWe pause to set out how training falls as a consideration for ensuring adequate\nprotection of personal data under the PDPA.\n\nTraining as a type of security arrangement\n21.\n\nData protection training may fall under two separate data protection obligations\n– the openness obligation (Sections 11 and 12, PDPA) and the protection\nobligation (Section 24, PDPA). An organisation that is subject to the openness\nobligation is required to communicate to its staff information about its policies\nand practices, pursuant to section 12(c) of the PDPA. This communication of\nthe data protection policies may necessarily involve some form of staff training.\n\n22.\n\nWhile the openness obligation may not extend to student leaders who are not\nmembers of staff, data protection training may also be seen as an\nadministrative security measure that is necessary for compliance with the\nprotection obligation. In its advisory guidelines, the Commission provided\nexamples of administrative security measures such as the conducting of\n“regular training sessions for staff to impart good practices in handling personal\ndata and strengthen awareness of threats to security of personal data”.3\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n23.\n\nIn the UK, administrative or organisational security measures may encompass\nrelevant and appropriate training of staff on the data protection obligations of\nthe organisation, especially for employees that collect, use or disclose personal\ndata.4 In describing the management and organisational measures that an\norganisation should put in place, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office\nhighlighted the importance of staff training and stated that:\n“[i]t is vital that your staff understand the importance of protecting\npersonal data; that they are familiar with your organisation’s security\npolicy; and that they put its security procedures into practice. So you\nmust provide appropriate initial and refresher training…”5\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n24.\n\nSimilarly, in Canada, the Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner for\nBritish Columbia expressly stated in the case of Park Royal Medical Clinic that\n\nPDPC, Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (revised 15 July 2016)\n<https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/legislation-and-guidelines/advisory-guidelines/main-advisoryguidelines#AG1> at [17.5].\n4 Peter Carey, Data Protection: A Practical Guide to UK and EU Law (OUP, 4th Ed, 2015) at p 126.\n5 Information Commissioner’s Office, Information security (Principle 7) (25 October 2016)\n<https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/principle-7-security/> at 4.\n3\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\f“administrative security, which encompass policies and training regarding\nprivacy is another important component” of the obligation to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements.6 In another case, the Office of the Privacy\nCommissioner of Canada (“OPC”) explained that whilst security policies and\nprocedures are essential, they are not in themselves sufficient to protect\npersonal information; the effectiveness of security safeguards depends on the\norganisation’s:\n“[d]iligent and consistent execution of security policies and procedures\n[which] depends to a large extent on ongoing privacy training of staff and\nmanagement, so as to foster and maintain a high organizational\nawareness of informational security concerns”.7\n25.\n\nIn a separate investigation, the OPC further clarified its position and stated that\nsecurity policies and practices are only effective when “properly and\nconsistently implemented and followed by employees”.8\n\n26.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data stated\nin its Code of Practice on Human Resource Management that employees “play\nthe principal role in implementing an employer’s policies on the security of\npersonal data”. Organisations should take reasonably practicable measures to\nensure that employees handling personal data are trained to observe the\npersonal data privacy policies, exercise due diligence in the application of those\npolicies, and are subject to procedures designed to ensure their compliance\nwith those policies.9 This statement is in line with Principle 4 of Hong Kong’s\nPersonal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, i.e. security of personal data.10\n\n27.\n\nOverall, the foreign data protection authorities all seem to agree that the data\nprotection training provided by an organisation may constitute a type of\nadministrative or organisation security measure, and that this training has an\nimpact on the proper implementation of that organisation’s data protection\npolicies and practices.\n\n6 Order P15-01: Park Royal Medical Clinic 2015 BCIPC 20 <https://www.oipc.bc.ca/orders/1783> at\n\n[58].\n7 PIPEDA Case Summary #2008-395: Commissioner initiates safeguards complaint against CIBC\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigations-intobusinesses/2008/pipeda-2008-395/>, second bullet point in the “Lessons Learned” section at p 1.\n8 PIPEDA Report of Findings #2016-005: Joint investigation of Ashley Madison by the Privacy\nCommissioner of Canada and the Australian Privacy Commissioner/Acting Australian Information\nCommissioner\n<https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-actions-and-decisions/investigations/investigationsinto-businesses/2016/pipeda-2016-005/> at [74].\n9 Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong, Code of Practice on Human\nResource\nManagement\n(April\n2016)\n(First\nRevision)\n<https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/data_privacy_law/code_of_practices/files/PCPD_HR_Booklet_Eng_\nAW07_Web.pdf> at [1.4.1].\n10 Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Chapter 486) (Hong Kong) Schedule 1, Principle 4.\n\nPage 6 of 10\n\n\f28.\n\nThe above positions are useful in our case here. In the Commission’s view, a\nformalised data protection training for the student leaders for the FOC would be\nbeneficial in several aspects. Not only would it inform the student leaders of the\nPDPA, but it would also sensitise them to their personal data protection\nobligations. Further, it also trains the students on the practices to be adopted,\nand not just pay lip service to the PDPA obligations, or to the Organisation’s\npolicies. Additionally, it may provide some guidance for students to go about\ntheir tasks when it comes to handling personal data.\n\nOrganisation’s breach of Section 24 of the PDPA\n29.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Organisation did not have in place any formalised\ntraining for the student leaders, even though it was reasonably foreseeable that\nthey would be handling personal data in the course of organising the FOC.\n\n30.\n\nThe FOC was an event that involved many students, and would potentially\ninvolve the handling of many students’ personal data. The Organisation ought\nto have at least ensured that the student leaders organising and running the\nFOC had the proper training to deal with and protect the personal data that they\nwill handle. Moreover, since the FOC was an event that takes place annually,\nthe Organisation could have anticipated and planned for some form of training\nto be provided to the student leaders that were handling the personal data.\n\n31.\n\nSince the FOC was an annual event, the training that can be provided can also\nbe customised to the FOC and the data processing activities that will\nforeseeably be carried out. Such customisation could be based on\nconsiderations such as (a) to whom the training should apply (i.e. confined to\njust the student leaders or extending also to student volunteers); (b) the most\neffective way of disseminating best practices to all who may come into contact\nwith personal data; and (c) the frequency and timing of such training. To be\nclear, the Commission is not setting down any rule that mandates formalised\nclassroom training. The Organisation should adopt a mode of training that it\nconsiders to be effective and expedient, having regard to these factors.\n\n32.\n\nIn this case, it was not enough for the Organisation to rely solely on the CAPT\nGuidelines in order to protect personal data. Apart from the fact that it was\nunclear whether the student leaders were fully apprised of the CAPT\nGuidelines, the CAPT Guidelines did not necessarily translate into actual\nprocesses that would enable the student leaders to comply with the data\nprotection obligations in practice. Proper guidance is not easily substitutable or\nreplaceable by general guidelines that an organisation may set.\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\n\f33.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Organisation did not put in place adequate training\nfor the student leaders, the Commission finds that the Organisation failed to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its\npossession and/or under its control and is in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nC.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n\n34.\n\nThe Commission is empowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to give the\nOrganisation such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Organisation to pay\na financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the\nCommission thinks fit.\n\n35.\n\nIn assessing the breach and determining the directions to be imposed to the\nOrganisation in this case, the Commission took into account the following\nfactors:\n(a)\n\na significant number of individuals (approximately 143 students) were\naffected by the data breach incident;\n\n(b)\n\nthe potential adverse consequences from a misuse of the student\nmatriculation number by other persons. For example, passing off as a\nstudent to carry out identity theft, or even carrying out pranks or\nnuisances in the student’s name. It was however noted that the student\nmatriculation number is used as an identifier for the duration of the\nstudent’s undergraduate or postgraduate course and not for an extended\nperiod of time; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission and forthcoming\nin its responses during the Commission’s investigation.\n\n36.\n\nPursuant to Section 29(2) of the PDPA, and having completed its investigation\nand assessment of this matter, the Commission is satisfied that the\nOrganisation was in breach of the protection obligation under Section 24 of the\nPDPA. The Commission has decided to issue directions to the Organisation,\npursuant to Section 29 of the PDPA, in respect of the Organisation’s breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\n\n37.\n\nThe Commission had provided its preliminary grounds of decision and\ndirections to the Organisation directing the Organisation to essentially (a)\nimplement mandatory training for its student volunteers within 60 days and (b)\nprovide an update to the Commission of the training arrangements it had put in\nplace.\n\nPage 8 of 10\n\n\f38.\n\nThe Organisation’s Data Protection Office accepted the Commission’s findings\nbut made representations in respect of the preliminary directions, requesting:\n(a)\n\nfor a longer duration of 120 days for the Organisation to fully implement\nthe necessary training modules for its student leaders, which will apply\nto not just future freshman activities, but for other activities sanctioned\nby the Organisation; and\n\n(b)\n\nthat the direction for mandatory training should refer to “student leaders”,\nwhich should take the following suggested meaning: “any undergraduate\nor post graduate student of [NUS] who has been appointed or is part of\nany committee tasked to organize any event/activity officially approved\nor sanctioned by [NUS]”.\n\n39.\n\nThe Commission has considered and accedes to the representations. While the\nCommission generally has the power to impose such directions as it deems fit\nin the circumstances, the Commission is prepared to consider representations\nfrom organisations on the grounds of decision and the form of directions to be\nissued, especially since directions ought to be adapted or customised to their\noperations or practices to be effective in addressing the particular shortcomings\nthat had been identified during investigations. In the present case, the\nCommission accepts the representations since they do not detract from the key\nprinciples, functions and purposes of the Commission’s grounds of decision and\ndirections.\n\n40.\n\nHowever, the Commission clarifies that its directions are tailored to enable the\nOrganisation to effectively address the shortcomings that had been identified\nduring investigations. In this regard, while the Organisation has been directed\nto put in place mandatory training for student leaders of officially approved or\nsanctioned activities, that does not mean that for other types of activities, there\nis no need for the Organisation to put in place policies, create awareness or\nprovide voluntary training. The PDPA imposes a free standing and continuing\nobligation on the Organisation to ensure that its policies are effective in\nimplementing the requisite standard of personal data protection. It behoves the\nOrganisation to consider whether, beyond the directions issued in this case,\nany further arrangements are necessary.\n\n41.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\nCommission hereby directs that:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation to, within 120 days from the date of the Commission’s\ndirections:\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\n\f(b)\n\n(i)\n\ndesign training (including online training and dissemination of\ntraining materials) that would address personal data protection in\nthe context of the collection and processing of personal data for\nstudent events and of the resulting interaction;\n\n(ii)\n\nmake arrangements for such training to be mandatory for any\nstudent leader. For the avoidance of doubt, a student leader is\ndefined as any undergraduate or post graduate student of the\nOrganisation who has been appointed or is part of any committee\ntasked to organize any event or activity officially approved or\nsanctioned by the Organisation;\n\n(iii)\n\nmake other arrangements as would be reasonably required to\nmeet the objectives in 41(a)(i) and 41(a)(ii); and\n\nby no later than 14 days after the above action has been carried out, the\nOrganisation shall, in addition, submit to the Commission a written\nupdate providing details on the arrangements for the training for student\nleaders managing personal data for student events officially approved or\nsanctioned by the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on Tech Mahindra (Singapore), as a data intermediary, for failing to make reasonable security arrangement to prevent unauthorised access and unauthorised modification of Singapore Telecommunications Limited customers' personal data via MyBill (mybill.singtel.com) and MyAccount (myaccount.singtel.com) webpages.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Information and Communications"],"date":"2017-04-06","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---tech-mahindra---060417.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Tech Mahindra (Singapore)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/04/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-tech-mahindra-(singapore)","timestamp":"2017-04-06","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP- 1603-A652\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\n(1)\n\nSingapore Telecommunications Limited (UEN No.\n199201624D)\n\n(2)\n\nTech Mahindra\n200203658M)\n\n(Singapore)\n\nPte\n\nLtd\n\n(UEN\n\nNo.\n\n...

This service is known as ONEPASS. Singtel\nhad engaged Tech Mahindra, an Information Technology (“IT”) vendor, to\nprovide application development, maintenance and support services for\nONEPASS (“ADMS Services”). This includes updating customer profiles in the\nONEPASS database.\n4.\n\nThe genesis of this matter can be traced to when Singtel and Tech Mahindra\nhad sought to rectify an issue with the Affected Customer’s ONEPASS account.\nOn 26 February 2016, the Affected Customer had informed Singtel about the\nlogin difficulties with his ONEPASS account. Following this, Singtel escalated\nthe Affected Customer’s issue to Tech Mahindra. Tech Mahindra subsequently\ndetermined that an update was needed to the Affected Customer’s profile on\nthe ONEPASS database, and executed a database script to update the profile.\n\n5.\n\nOn 29 February 2016, Singtel received several reports from ONEPASS users.\nThese affected different systems in different ways. Some customers reported\nthat their MySingtel Application profile had been modified to reflect the Affected\nCustomer’s account number, billing address and services. A number of Singtel\ncustomers also reported that the NRIC field in their ONEPASS profiles on the\nMyBill and MyAccount portals had been modified to reflect the Affected\nCustomer’s NRIC number. Apart from these, all other personal details of the\nuser, such as the user’s name and address, remained unaffected.\n\n6.\n\nA total of 2.78 million ONEPASS users’ accounts were affected, out of which\n2,518 users had viewed the Affected Customer’s NRIC number through the\nMySingtel Application before Singtel disabled access to the MySingtel\nApplication.\n\n7.\n\nShortly after receiving reports of the incident, Singtel shut down the MySingtel\nApplication and disabled access to the ONEPASS profile webpages on the\nMyBill and MyAccount portals. Singtel also notified the Affected Customer of\nthe incident.\n\n8.\n\nSingtel’s investigations disclosed that the incident was caused by a coding\nissue in the database script that was executed by Tech Mahindra. The Tech\nMahindra employee who prepared the database script had omitted a “where”\nclause in the script, which was required to limit the application of the changes\nto the Affected Customer’s profile. This was in breach of standard operating\nprocedures that were in place at that time.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\fB.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\nIssues for determination\n9.\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commission are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhether Tech Mahindra was acting as a data intermediary for Singtel in\nrelation to the ONEPASS users’ personal data; and\n\n(b)\n\nwhether each of the Organisations complied with its obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Data Breach Incident.\n\nIssue (a): Whether Tech Mahindra was acting as a data intermediary for Singtel in\nrelation to the ONEPASS users’ personal data?\n10.\n\nTech Mahindra was engaged by Singtel to provide ADMS Services, which\ncovered a range of support activities such as troubleshooting, incident\nmanagement, and application maintenance services, including ONEPASS and\nsingle sign on services. Crucially, Tech Mahindra was also granted access to\nSingtel’s database to maintain customer profiles on the ONEPASS database.\nThe maintenance of customer profiles amounts to “processing” personal data\non behalf of Singtel. Accordingly, it was acting as a data intermediary (as\ndefined in Section 2(1) of the PDPA) of Singtel.\n\n11.\n\nA data intermediary has a duty to comply with the Protection Obligation under\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA. At the same time, the organisation has the same\nobligation in respect of personal data processed by a data intermediary on its\nbehalf and for its purposes as if the personal data were processed by the\norganisation itself under Section 4(3) of the PDPA.\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with Sections 4(2) and (3) of the PDPA, both Singtel and Tech\nMahindra have concurrent obligations to make reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data of Singtel customers that are in their\npossession and/or under their control.\n\nIssue (b): Whether each of the Organisations complied with its obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Data Breach Incident?\nSingtel\n13.\n\nIn this case, the Commission finds Singtel to have complied with its obligation\nunder Section 24 of the PDPA to put in place reasonable security arrangements\nto protect personal data.\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\f14.\n\nFirst, Singtel had put in place a contract requiring Tech Mahindra to comply with\nthe PDPA, adhere to all of Singtel’s access and security policies, processes\nand directions, and to ensure that its employees are trained to comply with all\ndata protection laws and security measures before it is given control and access\nto the personal data in Singtel’s systems. Having a contract that sets down the\nobligations and responsibilities of a data intermediary to protect personal data\nis a prudent first-step for organisations to take. One of the key benefits of having\nsuch a contract is that it would make clear the parties’ respective roles,\nobligations and responsibilities to protect the personal data.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, Singtel had also followed through with operational procedures and\nchecks to ensure that Tech Mahindra carried out its functions to protect\npersonal data. Singtel and Tech Mahindra had a standard operating procedure\n(“SOP”) governing the management of the ONEPASS database. If a database\nscript change was required, the employee making the change was required to\nrun the database script in the development environment before running the\ndatabase script in the actual production environment. In this way, any errors or\nissues arising from the database script are contained in the test-bedding\nenvironment without impacting on or affecting the live system. This enables an\norganisation to detect and rectify any issues or errors in the script before the\nactual implementation.\n\n16.\n\nSingtel had also given Tech Mahindra specific instructions for the updating of\nthe Affected Customer’s profile on the ONEPASS database. In an email on 2\nApril 2015, Singtel made specific reference to the “where” clause in the\ndatabase script and gave specific instructions that the “where” clause of each\ndatabase update script had to be a primary key, i.e. it could not be left blank.\nThe function of the “where” clause is to introduce a restrictive parameter on the\noperation of the programmatic instructions to specific records, columns or\ntables in the database. In this case, by specifying the Affected Customer’s\nrecord in the “where” clause, the database script would have selected only his\nrecord for the operation.\n\n17.\n\nThird, Singtel conducted annual on-site security reviews of Tech Mahindra’s offsite premises as part of its governance process and required Tech Mahindra to\nconfirm its compliance with various security protocols. Singtel also conducted\npenetration tests on the MySingtel Application, the MyAccount and MyBill\nportals as well as the ONEPASS system and fixed the vulnerabilities, which\nwere unrelated to the data breach incident, found during the penetration tests.\n\n18.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that Singtel made reasonable\nsecurity arrangements in compliance with the Protection Obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\fTech Mahindra\n19.\n\nThe Commission, however, finds Tech Mahindra to be in breach of its\nobligation, as a data intermediary, under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n20.\n\nThe Commission finds that even though there were in place internal SOPs and\npolicies regarding the modification or processing of personal data in the\nONEPASS database by Tech Mahindra, it failed to comply with them during the\nactual handling and management of the personal data.\n\n21.\n\nFirst, notwithstanding Singtel’s email instructions to include the “where” clause\nin the database script, Tech Mahindra failed to comply with the instructions, and\nleft it out from the database script.\n\n22.\n\nSecond, Tech Mahindra did not comply with Singtel’s SOP highlighted at\nparagraph 15 above. Tech Mahindra did not check that the database script was\nfunctioning properly in a test-bedding environment before execution in the\nproduction environment. Consequently, the personal data of 2.78 million\nONEPASS users’ personal data was modified and replaced by personal data\nfrom the Affected Customer when Tech Mahindra executed the database script\ncontaining the erroneous code.\n\n23.\n\nThird, although Tech Mahindra implemented internal security arrangements, it\ndid not adhere to its own SOPs. Tech Mahindra had a practice (which was not\ndocumented) for the database update script to be reviewed by a more senior\nmember of the support team before execution. Additionally, employees were\nalso expected to verify that an update was correct after the execution of the\ndatabase update script. However, in this case, both these layers of checks were\nomitted.\n\n24.\n\nIn the Commission’s assessment, given the above failures and missteps, Tech\nMahindra failed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data of Singtel customers that it processed on behalf of Singtel.\nAccordingly, Tech Mahindra is in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nC.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n\n25.\n\nIn exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Section\n29 of the PDPA, the Commission directs that Tech Mahindra pay a financial\npenalty of S$10,000 within thirty days from the date of the Commission’s\ndirection.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\f26.\n\n27.\n\nIn assessing the breach and remedial directions to be imposed, the\nCommission considered various factors relating to the case, including the\nmitigating and aggravating factors set out below:\n(a)\n\nthe personal data disclosed in the data breach incident, particularly the\nAffected Customer’s NRIC number, is of a sensitive nature;\n\n(b)\n\nnot only was the Affected Customer’s NRIC number disclosed without\nauthorisation, there was also an unauthorised modification of the\npersonal data of 2.78 million ONEPASS users;\n\n(c)\n\nthe data breach incident could have been avoided if Tech Mahindra had\nfollowed Singtel and Tech Mahindra’s SOPs;\n\n(d)\n\nof the 2.78 million ONEPASS users whose accounts had been modified,\nonly 2,518 users had viewed the Affected Customer’s NRIC number;\n\n(e)\n\nTech Mahindra and Singtel had jointly notified the Commission of the\ndata breach incident, and was cooperative in the course of the\ninvestigation; and\n\n(f)\n\nSingtel and Tech Mahindra took prompt remedial and preventative\nactions.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance under the PDPA. Organisations should take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The\nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against\nthe organisations accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Executive Coach International for failing to notify and obtain consent from an ex-employee for the disclosure of her personal data.","tags":["Consent","Notification","Warning","Education"],"date":"2017-03-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---executive-coach-international---210317.pdf","nature":"Consent, Notification","title":"Breach of Consent and Notification Obligations by Executive Coach International","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/03/breach-of-consent-and-notification-obligations-by-executive-coach-international","timestamp":"2017-03-21","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1504-A426\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”)\nAnd\nExecutive Coach International Pte. Ltd. [UEN 200414184R]\n... Organisation\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 3\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n21 March 2017\nBACKGROUND\n1.\n\nOn 20 April 2015, the Complainant, complained to the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) that the Organisation had\ndisclosed her past personal history in a WhatsApp group chat comprising the\nComplainant and the Organisation’s other staff and volunteer trainees\n(“WhatsApp Group”) without her consent and without notifying her of the\npurposes for the disclosure.\n\n2.\n\nOn account of the complaint made, the Commission commenced an\ninvestigation under Section 50 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the\n“PDPA”) to ascertain whether the Organisation had breached its obligations\nunder the PDPA. The material facts of the case are as follows.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n3.\n\nThe Organisation is an organisation which provides life and executive\ncoaching services to individual and corporate clients. The Complainant is a\nformer employee of the Organisation. She was the personal assistant to\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Mr L), a director of the Organisation. The\nComplainant has since left the employment of the Organisation on unamicable\nterms.\n\n4.\n\nThe WhatsApp Group, comprising of the Organisation’s employees and\nvolunteers, was created on 22 August 2013. The Complainant and Mr L were\n\n- 1 -\n\n\fboth participants in this WhatsApp Group. At the material time on 7 April 2015,\nthere were a number of other participants in this WhatsApp Group.1\n5.\n\nOn 7 April 2015, Mr L disclosed highly sensitive information of the\nComplainant’s personal history, namely her past drug problem and issue with\ninfidelity in her amorous relationship, (“Personal Data”) to the participants in\nthe WhatsApp Group. The Organisation has not disputed that the personal\nhistory of the Complainant is personal data. The disclosure of the Personal\nData was made by Mr L following allegations that she was undermining the\nOrganisation’s authority by persuading the employees and volunteers of the\nOrganisation to leave the Organisation.\n\n6.\n\nThe Complainant claims that the Personal Data was disclosed by her to Mr L\nin the context of Mr L being the Complainant’s employer, teacher and coach.\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, the Commission notified the Organisation of the complaint\nand requested the Organisation to cooperate and assist in investigations. In\nthe course of the investigations, the Organisation represented to the\nCommission that:\n(a)\n\nMr L disclosed the Personal Data in his personal capacity and not as\nan employee of the Organisation; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Personal Data was only known to Mr L and not the Organisation,\nand that the Organisation did not authorise Mr L to disclose the\nPersonal Data.\n\nCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\nIssues to be determined\n8.\n\nThe issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisation is responsible for Mr L’s disclosure of the\nPersonal Data.\n\n(b)\n\nIf the Organisation is liable for Mr L’s disclosure, whether the\nOrganisation is in breach of Sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA for the\nsaid disclosure.\n\n1 The Complainant and Organisation disagreed on the exact number of participants in the WhatsApp\n\nGroup on 7 April 2015. The Complainant claimed that the WhatsApp Group contained 117\nparticipants. The Organisation claimed that there were only 58 participants and that a group could\nonly accommodate a maximum of 100 participants. The Commission does not have sufficient\nevidence to decide on the exact number of participants. However, the exact number of participants is\nimmaterial in this case and the Commission will accept that there were at least 58 participants in the\nWhatsApp Ground on 7 April 2015.\n\n- 2 -\n\n\fWhether the Organisation is responsible for Mr L’s disclosure of the Personal Data\n9.\n\nThe Personal Data disclosed involved sensitive data of the Complainant’s\npersonal history, and in this instance, there is no question, and it is not\ndisputed, that such information falls within the definition of “personal data”\nunder the PDPA. The nature of the Personal Data, including the fact that the\nComplainant was identified in the WhatsApp Group, puts it beyond doubt that\nthe information was information “about an individual who can be identified\nfrom that data”.\n\n10.\n\nUnder Section 53(1) of the PDPA, any acts done or conduct engaged in by an\nemployee in the course of his employment shall be treated for the\npurposes of the PDPA as done or engaged in by his employer as well as him,\nwhether or not it was done or engaged in with the employer’s knowledge\nor approval.\n\n11.\n\nBased on the facts described in paragraphs 3 to 7 above, the Commission\nnotes that the disclosure of Personal Data was made in the context of an\nongoing dispute arising from the unamicable departure of the Complainant\nfrom the Organisation’s employment. The Organisation’s director, Mr L, had\nexpressed his disappointment and views with the Complainant in the\nWhatsApp Group chat following her resignation from the Organisation, and\nclaimed that the Complainant had subsequently sought to undermine his\nauthority, and to persuade the Organisation’s employees and volunteers to\nleave the organisation. The Complainant, on the other hand, had expressed\nher own disappointment with Mr L’s conduct (personally, and as an employer,\nteacher and coach) and raised issues that she had with the Organisation\nduring her time of employment. Against this background, the disclosure of\nPersonal Data in the WhatsApp Group was not made by parties in the\npersonal sense, but was made viz an ongoing dispute between an employer\nand its ex-employee, with the intent to discredit the ex-employee. Accordingly,\nthe Commission is of the view that Mr L was acting in the course of his\nemployment as a director of the Organisation when he disclosed the\nComplainant’s Personal Data in the WhatsApp Group chat, and was not, as\nthe Organisation claims, disclosed by Mr L acting in his individual capacity.\n\n12.\n\nThe Organisation claims that it did not know or approve of Mr L’s collection\nand disclosure of the Personal Data. Even if this is true, the Organisation’s\nknowledge or approval is immaterial under Section 53(1) of the PDPA. It is\nnoted that Mr L was at all material times a senior member of the Organisation.\n\n13.\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 53(1) of the PDPA, because Mr L’s\ndisclosure of the Personal Data was made in the course of employment, the\ndisclosure is treated as a disclosure by the Organisation, for which the\nOrganisation is responsible.\n\n- 3 -\n\n\fWhether the Organisation is in breach of Sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA for the\nsaid disclosure\n14.\n\n15.\n\nSection 13 of the PDPA prohibits organisations from collecting, using or\ndisclosing personal data about an individual unless:\n(a)\n\nthe individual gives, or is deemed to have given, consent under the\nPDPA to such collection, use or disclosure; or\n\n(b)\n\nthe collection, use or disclosure of the personal data without the\nindividual’s consent is required or authorised under the PDPA or any\nwritten law.\n\nSection 20 of the PDPA requires, amongst other things, that an organisation\ninforms an individual of:\n(a)\n\nthe purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data, on\nor before collecting the personal data; and\n\n(b)\n\nany other purpose of the use or disclosure of the personal data of which\nthe individual has not been informed under paragraph (a) above before\nthe use or disclosure of the personal data for that purpose.\n\n16.\n\nIn the present case, there is no dispute that neither Mr L nor the Organisation\nobtained the Complainant’s consent or informed the Complainant’s of the\npurposes of the disclosure, before disclosing the Personal Data. The\nOrganisation has not referred to any of the exceptions in the Fourth Schedule\nof the PDPA in its response and the Commission also takes the view that none\nof the exceptions apply in the present case.\n\n17.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of Sections 13\nand 20 of the PDPA.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n18.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of its\nobligations under Sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA, the Commission is\nempowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may\ninclude directing the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount\nnot exceeding S$1 million.\n\n19.\n\nThe Commission notes that the disclosure was deliberately made, and under\ncircumstances to discredit the Complainant. The personal data that was\ndisclosed was also highly sensitive. However, the Commission is also mindful\nof the fact that the disclosure was made in the context of a dispute between\nan employer and ex-employee, and made in what essentially was the\nOrganisation’s chat group for work (and not to the public at large). On balance,\ntherefore, even though the Commission has found the Organisation to be in\nbreach of Sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA, the Commission is of the view that\n\n- 4 -\n\n\fthe enforcement action to be taken in this case should be calibrated based on\nthe circumstances of the case.\n20.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission has decided not to issue any direction to the\nOrganisation to take remedial action or to pay a financial penalty. Instead, it\nhas decided to issue a Warning to the Organisation for the breach of its\nobligations under Sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n- 5 -\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on Propnex Realty for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access of individuals’ personal data stored online.

Following the\nComplainant’s complaint, the Commission undertook an investigation\ninto the matter. The Commission’s grounds of decision are set out below.\n\n2.\n\nThe Complainant alleged that she and her sisters had been receiving\nmarketing calls and messages from various telemarketers (including\nmoneylenders) on their mobile telephone numbers even though they had\nnot consented to being contacted.\n\n3.\n\nWhen the Complainant spoke to one of the telemarketers over the phone\nto ask where he had obtained her telephone number, she was informed\nthat her name and telephone number were available on the Internet. This\nprompted the Complainant to conduct a search on the Internet for her\nname. Among the search results was a URL link (“Link”) to the PropNex\nDNC List dated 29 July 2015 in PDF format.\n\n4.\n\nThe PropNex DNC List contained, amongst other things, the\nComplainant’s full name, mobile number and landline, residential\naddress and internal instructions to the Organisation agents regarding\nthe Complainant.\n\nPage 1 of 8\n\n\fB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation is a real estate agency. P&N Holdings Pte Ltd (“P&N\nHoldings”) is the parent company of the Organisation. Investigations\ndisclosed that P&N Holdings and the Organisation share a common IT\ninfrastructure. P&N Holdings maintains and operates the common IT\ninfrastructure and provides IT support to the Organisation.\n\n6.\n\nOn 28 December 2015, the Commission was informed that the personal\ndata of the 1,765 individuals contained in the PropNex DNC List was\naccessible to the public through the Link (the “Data Breach Incident”).\nPropNex DNC List was accessible to the public without authentication\neither through the Link or by performing an online search using search\nterms, for example, the Complainant’s name, “PropNex” or the phrase\n“user files do not call”. Investigations disclosed that the PropNex DNC\nList was disseminated internally as a PDF file that was uploaded onto\nthe Organisation Virtual Office System (“VO System”). For reasons\ndetailed below, this PDF file was searchable and accessible on the\nInternet.\n\n7.\n\nThe PropNex DNC List included the following personal data:\n(a)\n\nname;\n\n(b)\n\nmobile number and/or landline;\n\n(c)\n\nfull or partial residential address;\n\n(d)\n\ndate of complaint by a particular individual;\n\n(e)\n\nemail address; and\n\n(f)\n\ninternal instructions by the Organisation to its agents with regard\nto the individuals.\n\n8.\n\nThe Commission estimates that 96% or more of the records in the\nPropNex DNC List only contained a telephone number, residential\naddress or email address without any other identifying information.\n\n9.\n\nOn 31 December 2015, the Commission informed the Organisation’s\nData Protection Officer of the Data Breach Incident and requested that\nthe PropNex DNC List be taken down. The Organisation confirmed that\nthe PropNex DNC List belongs to the Organisation and that it had no\nknowledge of the Data Breach Incident until it was notified of the\ncomplaint. On 4 January 2016, the Organisation deleted the PropNex\nDNC List from its VO System and informed Google to exclude the Link\nfrom its search results. The Organisation also took steps to prevent a reoccurrence of the Data Breach Incident, by introducing a new way of\ndisseminating the DNC List internally through a secured database and\nwhich can be searched using an authenticated web form.\nPage 2 of 8\n\n\f10.\n\nInvestigations disclosed that in or around July 2015, the PropNex DNC\nList was in PDF format and placed in a shared folder for internal use on\nthe VO System which was accessible only by the Organisation agents\nand staff through authenticated login. Earlier versions of the PropNex\nDNC List had been placed in the same shared folder since the beginning\nof 2015.\n\n11.\n\nThe Organisation represented that it had put in place data protection\npolicies, which were made known to its employees through briefings and\naddendums to their employment agreements. The Organisation also\nsubmitted that it had carried out penetration tests for its IT systems, and\nperformed periodic searches on Google for possible leaked documents.\nIn addition, the Organisation conducted security testing for web\napplications such as the VO System whenever major changes were\nconducted, and used “/robots.txt” to hide documents from Google’s\nsearch engine crawler as well as to provide another layer of security for\ndocuments stored in the VO System.\n\n12.\n\nHowever, the Organisation admitted that there was no password security\nwhatsoever for the PropNex DNC List. The VO System’s authentication\nonly worked for web pages and not documents such as PDF files, which\nwas the intended design and limitation of the original system. In relation\nto the shared folder in the VO System, this was meant for forms and\ntemplates and not “sensitive documents”, but this policy was neither\nformally recorded nor communicated to users. Over time, therefore, this\ndesign limitation remained as a vulnerability but was overlooked.\n\n13.\n\nAccording to the joint investigation carried out by the Organisation and\nP&N Holding, the Data Breach Incident was found to have occurred\nbecause the PropNex DNC List was indexed by Google and was\ntherefore searchable and available on the Internet. This occurred despite\nthe fact that the PropNex DNC List was stored in a restricted web folder.\nThis case demonstrates the weakness of relying on “/robots.txt” to hide\nthe documents from the Google search engine crawler.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n\n14.\n\nAt the outset, the Commission considers that the PropNex DNC List,\ncontaining amongst other things, individuals’ names, contact numbers,\nresidential addresses and email addresses, does constitute personal\ndata as defined in Section 2(1) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”). In addition, the Commission notes that the PropNex DNC List\nwas an internal list maintained and stored on the Organisation’s VO\nSystem. The Organisation does not dispute that the personal data in the\nPropNex DNC List contained personal data under the control of the\nOrganisation at the material time.\n\n15.\n\nUnder Section 24 of the PDPA, an organisation is obliged to protect\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nPage 3 of 8\n\n\fsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (“Protection\nObligation”).\n16.\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to Section 24 of the PDPA, the Organisation is\nrequired to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks to or of the PropNex DNC List.\n\nRelationship between the Organisation and P&N Holdings and their obligations\nunder the PDPA\n17.\n\nInvestigations disclosed that even though P&N Holdings and the\nOrganisation shared a common IT infrastructure, with P&N Holdings\nmaintaining and operating the common IT infrastructure and providing IT\nsupport to the Organisation, there was no evidence to suggest that P&N\nHoldings processed any personal data on behalf of the Organisation.\nAccordingly, the Commission does not consider that P&N Holdings is a\ndata intermediary of the Organisation.\n\nAdequacy of Security Arrangements\n18.\n\nAfter carefully considering all the relevant facts and representations\nmade by the Organisation, the Commission is of the view that the\nOrganisation failed to take reasonable security measures to protect the\npersonal data in its possession and/or under its control. The\nCommission’s reasons are set out below.\n\n19.\n\nFirst, based on the Commission’s investigations into the matter, the\nCommission finds that the VO System contained a significant system\nweakness, namely, that user authentication was only applied to\nwebpages (e.g. aspx files) but was not in place for document files (e.g.\nPDF files). As a result of this weakness in the VO System, any user could\nhave direct access to document files on the VO System, including the\nPropNex DNC List, by typing the Link in an Internet browser or through\na Google search without having to go through any form of user\nauthentication.\n\n20.\n\nThe Organisation was aware of this system weakness and it recognised\nthat as a result of this system weakness, sensitive documents should not\nbe placed on the VO System. However, the Organisation did not\nimplement any security arrangements to militate against this known\nsystem weakness. For example, there was no policy to prohibit the\nsharing of sensitive documents on the VO System or to require that\nsensitive documents shared on the VO System be protected by a\npassword.\n\n21.\n\nConsequently, the PropNex DNC List was placed on the VO System as\na PDF file without any password security or authentication, which in turn\nallowed the Data Breach Incident to occur and allowed various\nPage 4 of 8\n\n\ftelemarketers to access and make use of the personal data in the\nPropNex DNC List.\n22.\n\nSecond, the Organisation’s approach towards protecting the documents\nin the VO System through the use of “/robots.txt” was not sufficient and\nevinced an incorrect or inadequate understanding of the security\nmeasure which they chose to implement. The Organisation used\n“/robots.txt” in an attempt to hide the documents from the Google search\nengine crawler. The Organisation intended for this to be another layer of\nsecurity for the documents stored in the VO System.\n\n23.\n\nHowever, there are recognised weaknesses and limitations to relying on\n“/robots.txt” to hide the documents from the Google search engine\ncrawler. For example, non-compliant (e.g. malicious) web crawlers might\nignore the instructions in a “/robots.txt” file. The Organisation claims that\nit had only discovered these weaknesses and limitations after the Data\nBreach Incident. Contrary to the Organisation’s claims, these\nweaknesses and limitations of “/robots.txt” are referred to in introductory\narticles such as the Google support article, “Block URLs with robots.txt;\nLearn about robots.txt files”, which is easily accessible. The Organisation\nreferred to this article in its representations, thereby showing that the\nOrganisation could have and should have been aware of these\nweaknesses and limitations when they made use of this security\nmeasure.\n\n24.\n\nThe “/robots.txt” script was implemented to hide the webpages in the VO\nSystem from search engine crawlers; however, it cannot restrict or\nprevent access by external parties. Simply hiding a link to a document\non the world wide web is not an effective way of ensuring that the\ndocument itself is protected from unauthorised access. The fact is that\nthe document is still available online, and can be accessed by anyone\nover the world wide web. If the intent was to ensure that the document\nwas for internal use, then appropriate restrictions and security measures\nshould be placed to limit access to only the authorised persons.\n\n25.\n\nEach organisation should adopt security arrangements that are\nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. If an organisation\ndecides to use a particular security measure, it should be responsible for\nunderstanding the weaknesses and limitations (if any) of such a measure\nand to design and shape its security arrangements in light of those\nweaknesses and limitations.\n\n26.\n\nIt remains for the Commission to observe that the Organisation had\nimplemented security arrangements and conducted periodic security\ntesting. However, the Commission is of the view that the security\narrangements and testing undertaken by the Organisation were\ninsufficient to militate against the weaknesses in the VO System and to\nprotect the personal data stored on the system. The technical limitations\ndiscussed above demonstrate this. Additionally, the Organisation had\nfailed to discover the breach for a period that could extend to five (5)\nPage 5 of 8\n\n\fmonths, from the time the PropNex DNC List was first placed in the VO\nSystem until a complaint was brought against it. This reinforces the\nCommission’s finding that the security arrangements that had been\nimplemented were insufficient to deter or to detect a data breach.\n27.\n\nThe Commission further finds that the corrective measures taken by the\nOrganisation after the Data Breach Incident are only sufficient as an\ninterim measure. Specifically, the Commission notes that following the\nData Breach Incident, the Organisation had removed the PropNex DNC\nList from the VO System, and shifted it to a database which was\naccessible only through a new web application which required user\nauthentication. However, the Organisation did not put in place any user\nauthentication for document files stored in the VO System. Consequently,\nthere is a risk that the Organisation’s agents could continue to place\nunprotected document files containing personal data in the VO System,\nwhich would expose such personal data to the same risks as those\narising from the Data Breach Incident, which could potentially result in\nother data breaches.\n\nExceptions under the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA\n28.\n\nIn its representations, the Organisation had indicated that it was relying\non exceptions in paragraphs 1(a) and (h) of the Fourth Schedule of the\nPDPA. However, the Organisation did not explain how the foregoing\nexceptions would apply in respect of the Protection Obligation.\nNonetheless, the Commission considered the potential application of\nthese exceptions. In its deliberations, it was not apparent how the\nOrganisation’s disclosure of the PropNex DNC List “is necessary for any\npurpose which is clearly in the interests of the individual, if consent for\nits disclosure cannot be obtained in a timely way”1 or “is necessary for\nevaluative purposes”.2 Accordingly, the Commission considers that the\nOrganisation’s reliance on the exceptions to the Consent Obligation in\nparagraphs 1(a) and (h) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA is irrelevant\nto this case, and without merit.\n\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE COMMISSION\n\n29.\n\nHaving completed its investigation and assessment of this matter, the\nCommission finds that in light of the weakness in the VO System and the\nfailure to implement security arrangements which would militate against\nthe known VO System weaknesses, the Organisation failed to take\nreasonable security measures to protect the personal data in its\npossession and/or under its control and is in breach of Section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n30.\n\nIn exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission pursuant to\nSection 29 of the PDPA, the Commission directs that a financial penalty\nof S$10,000 be imposed on the Organisation.\n\nPage 6 of 8\n\n\f31.\n\n32.\n\nDuring the course of investigations, the Organisation represented that\nthe VO System was not intended to be used for the storage or sharing\nof documents containing personal data. However, the Commission notes\nthat the VO System is a system that is meant for the online sharing of\ndocuments between the Organisation agents and/or employees through\nthe Internet. This being the case, it is foreseeable that some of the\ndocuments stored and/or shared on this system may contain personal\ndata. The Commission there additionally directs that the Organisation:\n(a)\n\nceases the storage and/or sharing of documents containing\npersonal data using the VO System until the design flaw of the\nVO System has been fixed; and\n\n(b)\n\nconducts a security scan on the VO System to identify and fix any\nadditional vulnerabilities before it is made accessible online.\n\nIn assessing the breach and the directions to be imposed, the\nCommission took into account the following factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Data Breach Incident involved 1,765 individuals and their\npersonal data was disclosed to the public;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Data Breach Incident was caused by a flaw in the\nOrganisation’s VO System;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation admitted to the Data Breach Incident in the first\ninstance;\n\n(d)\n\n96% or more of the records concerning the 1,756 individuals\ncontained either a telephone number, residential address or email\naddress without any other personal data;\n\n(e)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions to rectify and\nprevent the recurrence of the data breach;\n\n(f)\n\nThe Organisation had been cooperative and forthcoming during\nthe investigations;\n\n(g)\n\nThe Organisation did have in place a data protection policy which\nthey made known to their agents and staff; and\n\n(h)\n\nThe Organisation’s in-house compliance team (with the\nassistance of external consultants, where necessary) did conduct\nannual internal audits to assess:\n(i)\n\nsystem access risk;\n\n(ii)\n\ndata integrity risk; and\n\n(iii)\n\nrisk of configuration issues in production environment.\nPage 7 of 8\n\n\f33.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any\ninstance of non-compliance under the PDPA, and it urges organisations\nto take the necessary action to ensure that they comply with their\nobligations under the PDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take\nthe appropriate enforcement action against the organisation(s)\naccordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n1\n2\n\nParagraph 1(a) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA.\nParagraph 1(h) of Fourth Schedule of the PDPA.\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on JP Pepperdine for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access of individuals’ personal data through its membership portal.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Accommodation and F&B"],"date":"2017-01-25","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---jp-pepperdine---250117.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by JP Pepperdine","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2017/01/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-jp-pepperdine","timestamp":"2017-01-25","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: [DP-1510-A558]\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1)\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”)\nAnd\nJP Pepperdine Group Pte. Ltd. [UEN 198601026G]\n... Organisation\n\nDecision Citation: [2017] SGPDPC 2\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n25 January 2017\nBACKGROUND\n1.\n\n2.\n\nOn 25 October 2015, the Complainant informed the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) that any member of the public could readily\naccess the personal data of members that had joined the Organisation’s\nmembership programme by,\n(a)\n\nentering a randomly simulated membership number on a webpage\n(http://goo.gl/5BX9Rr, a Google URL Shortener that redirects to\nhttp://ascentis.com.sg/microcrm/JacksPlace_memberportal/searchprofil\ne.aspx) listed on the Organisation’s membership brochure (the\n“Webpage”); or\n\n(b)\n\nperforming a search (without inputting any search parameters) using the\nsearch functions available on the Webpage.\n\nOn account of the complaints made, the Commission commenced an\ninvestigation under Section 50 of the PDPA to ascertain whether the\nOrganisation had breached its obligations under the PDPA. The material facts\nof the case are as follows.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n3.\n\nThe Organisation operates a number of restaurants in Singapore under various\nbrands (e.g. Jack’s Place, Eatzi Gourmet). The Organisation has a membership\nprogramme for its customers. Participating in the membership programme\nentitles members to special promotions and discounts across the different\nrestaurants operated by the Organisation.\n\n1\n\n\f4.\n\nEach member would be assigned a 7-digit membership number by the\nOrganisation. Membership numbers run sequentially. At the time of the\ninvestigation (December 2015), the Organisation had approximately 30,000\nmembers.\n\n5.\n\nAs part of the investigation, the Commission verified that personal data of\nmembers of the Organisation’s membership programme was publicly\naccessible through the Webpage by:\n(a)\n\nentering a randomly simulated membership number in the search facility\non the Webpage, which would retrieve membership details associated\nwith that account; or\n\n(b)\n\nsimply clicking on the “Search” button in the search facility without any\nsearch parameters, i.e. the search fields were left blank, which would\nrandomly retrieve the details of a membership account.\n\n6.\n\nThe personal data that was publicly accessible through the Webpage included,\nnames of members, gender, marital status, nationality, race, NRIC/Passport\nnumber, date of birth, mobile phone number, home phone number, email\naddresses, residential addresses, and other membership account details.\n\n7.\n\nThe material facts from the Commission’s investigations are as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe Webpage was developed for the purposes of a one-off promotional\nevent held in the first half of 2013 to recruit new members and to\nencourage existing members to update their personal particulars. The\nWebpage was created by the Organisation’s vendor, Ascentis Pte Ltd\n(“Ascentis”). The Webpage contained a search facility that enabled\nsearches and retrieval of personal particulars of the members of the\nOrganisation’s membership programme.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation claims that the Webpage was intended for internal use,\nand for the Organisation’s staff to remotely search and access the\nOrganisation’s member database. Although the Webpage was not\nintended for public access, the Organisation did not put in place security\nmeasures (or require Ascentis to design any security measures), to\ncontrol access and ensure that the Webpage was inaccessible to the\npublic. The Webpage was not removed after the end of the promotional\nevent in 2013 and remained accessible to both staff and the public until\n29 October 2015.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation listed on its membership brochures hyperlink that was\ntruncated using a Google URL shortening service (“a Google URL\nShortener”) that redirected any person who accessed it to the Webpage.\nThese membership brochures, which contained the Google URL\nShortener and other information on the membership application process,\nwere disseminated by the Organisation to all the restaurants under its\ndifferent brands. The Organisation claims that the redirection to the\nWebpage was a mistake and that the public should have been redirected\nto the Organisation’s membership portal located at another URL. Yet, for\n2\n\n\fthe entire period the membership brochure was in circulation at the\nOrganisation’s restaurants (from as early as 2013), the URL listed in the\nbrochures had not been corrected.\n(d)\n\nThe Webpage had a security loophole, as described above at paragraph\n5(b), that caused the random retrieval of members’ account details\nwhenever the “Search” button was clicked with no search parameters.\nThe Organisation admitted that the loophole was caused by an\nunpatched bug in the original version of the Webpage. The Organisation\nwas not aware of the existence of the bug in the Webpage or the\nresulting security loophole until it was notified by the Commission.\n\n8.\n\nOn 29 October 2015, after receiving the Commission’s notification, the\nOrganisation introduced security features to the Webpage by incorporating a\npassword protection feature such that the Webpage was no longer publicly\naccessible and could only be accessed after authentication.\n\n9.\n\nSubsequently, the Organisation implemented further measures to address the\ncomplaint:\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation secured the Webpage with a landing page which was\npassword-protected. Access to the Webpage would only be granted\nthrough inputting user credentials known only to the Webpage’s\nadministrators; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation also took steps to ensure that all references to the\nGoogle URL Shortener listed in the Organisation’s membership\nbrochures that were still in available in the Organisation’s restaurants\nwere removed.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\nIssue to be determined\n10.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks.\n\n11.\n\nThe issue in the present case is whether the Organisation had breached\nSection 24 of the PDPA, when personal data (of members of the Organisation’s\nmembership programme) could be accessed on the Webpage (in the manner\ndescribed in paragraph 5 above).\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with Section 24\n12.\n\nThe data accessible on the Webpage included the names of members of the\nOrganisation’s membership programme, their contact information, addresses\nand identification numbers. These data fall within the definition of “personal\ndata” under the PDPA.\n3\n\n\f13.\n\nThe personal data accessible on the Webpage was also under the control of\nthe Organisation. The Organisation demonstrated this control when it was able\nto promptly effect changes to the Webpage to restrict public access to such\npersonal data when contacted by the Commission.\n\n14.\n\nIn the course of investigations, Ascentis confirmed that the Webpage was\ndesigned without any security measures as per the Organisation’s\nspecifications. The Organisation claims that it did not require security features\nto be incorporated because the Webpage was intended for (a) internal (and not\npublic) purposes; and (b) temporary use at the Organisation’s 2013 promotional\nevent.\n\n15.\n\nThis may be the state of the Organisation’s system in 2013; but when the PDPA\ncame into full effect on 2 July 2014, it was incumbent on the Organisation to\nensure that it had in place the necessary security arrangements to protect the\ndata. Steps must be taken to ensure that the security that would protect the\npersonal data under the Organisation’s possession or control was ready by the\ntime that the PDPA had come into full force. In the Commission’s view, one of\nthe first few steps that ought to have been taken was to determine if the system\nwas to continue to be made accessible via the Internet or to keep it wholly within\nits internal network. Thereafter, the Organisation ought to have conducted a\nreview of its system so as to determine the weakness and vulnerabilities of the\nsystem for the type of access and use that was intended. This would allow the\nOrganisation to know where the weaknesses and vulnerabilities are which\nneeded to be addressed.\n\n16.\n\nIn this case, the loophole in the Webpage was a significant gap in the protection\nof the system that allowed unauthorised access to personal data stored on the\nserver. The Organisation had not shown that it took any steps (as mentioned at\nparagraph 15 above) to detect and rectify this problem. No checks or tests were\ndone on the system. No steps were taken to ascertain and limit (or block) the\nentry points to the personal data stored on the server. Indeed, the Webpage\nproved to be one such entry point. The Organisation failed to have the Webpage\ntaken down, notwithstanding that the Organisation had, from the outset,\nintended to do so. In this regard, the Organisation did not ensure the security\nof the personal data it was obliged to protect.\n\n17.\n\nIt is clear that the Organisation’s system did not have any reasonable or\nadequate security arrangements to protect the personal data that was\naccessible through the Webpage:\n(a)\n\nthere were no security or access controls to the Webpage and any\nmember of the public could have accessed the personal data of the\nOrganisation’s members through the Webpage. Even if the Webpage\nwas intended by the Organisation to be for internal use, there would still\nbe an obligation on the Organisation make reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access to the personal data\nstored on the system. In the present case, knowing that the personal\ndata was stored online and could be accessed from the Webpage, the\nOrganisation should have at least implemented basic technical security\n4\n\n\fmeasures to ensure that the system, including the Webpage, was secure\nand not accessible by the public.\n(b)\n\nThe Webpage allowed the use of the membership number assigned to\neach member, to serve the functions of identification and authentication to\naccess personal data. In the Commission’s view, where a single string of\nnumbers is the only security arrangement serving both to identify and\nauthenticate access to personal data, such security arrangement could be\nconsidered reasonable only if (depending on the sensitivity of the personal\ndata being protected) this number was unique, unpredictable and\nreasonably well-protected. In this case, the membership numbers\nassigned by the Organisation to its members were issued in running\nsequence and easy to ascertain or deduce, and therefore, such a\nsecurity arrangement could not be considered reasonable.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Webpage contained a security loophole (described in paragraph 5(b)\nabove) which effectively allowed members of the public free and unfettered\naccess to personal data of random account holders through the Webpage.\n\n18.\n\nAdditionally, by including the Google URL Shortener in the brochure, which\nredirected a person to the Webpage, the Organisation was facilitating access\nto the Webpage, and the personal data held on the system. A user that followed\nthe link would, whether by accident or on purpose, be able to gain access to\nthe personal data of the Organisation’s customers. While the Organisation\nsubmits that the redirection of the link was wrong and unintended, the\nCommission does not find this to be excusable. A prudent organisation which\nwas promulgating a link to the public should at least check the link before\npublication. Had the Organisation done so, it would have noticed that there was\nsomething amiss, as the link would have brought up the Webpage, which was\nnot supposed to be in operation.\n\n19.\n\nIn view of the above, the Commission finds that the Organisation had failed to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control. As such, the Organisation was in breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\n\n20.\n\nThe Commission adds that although the Webpage was designed by Ascentis,\non the available facts, Ascentis was not a data intermediary for the\nOrganisation. There is no evidence that Ascentis processed any personal data\non behalf of the Organisation. Ascentis’s role was limited to designing the\nWebpage for the Organisation according to the instructions of the Organisation.\nAccordingly, the Commission makes no findings in respect of Ascentis.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n21.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Organisation is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Organisation such directions as it\ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nOrganisation to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nmillion.\n5\n\n\f22.\n\nIn determining the direction, if any, to be made, the Commission considered the\nfollowing factors related to the case, including the mitigating and aggravating\nfactors set out below:\n(a)\n\nA substantial amount of personal data of some 30,000 members of the\nOrganisation’s membership programme, was placed at risk. This risk has\nexacerbated by the Organisation’s publication of the Google URL\nShortener, which redirected individuals to the Webpage with the security\nloophole, on its membership brochures that were disseminated to all its\nrestaurants.\n\n(b)\n\nThe personal data at risk involved sensitive personal data such as the\nNRIC/Passport numbers of members of the Organisation’s membership\nprogramme.\n\n(c)\n\nThe data breach may have been avoided (or the impact of the breach\nreduced) if the Organisation had taken the following simple steps:\n\n(d)\n\n23.\n\n(i)\n\nreviewing the information in its own membership brochures, at\nwhich point it would have realised that members of public were\nbeing mistakenly redirected to the Webpage (intended for internal\nuse) instead of the Organisation’s membership portal; and/or\n\n(ii)\n\nensuring that the Webpage (intended for internal use) was\ninaccessible to the public right from the outset, or by promptly\nremoving the Webpage once the 2013 promotional event for which\nthe Webpage was created had concluded.\n\nThe Organisation took prompt action to remedy the breach when notified\nby the Commission.\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, pursuant to Section 29(2) of the PDPA, the\nCommission hereby directs that the Organisation pay a financial penalty of\nS$10,000 within 30 days of the Commission’s direction, failing which interest at\nthe rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Financial penalties of $5,000 and $3,000 were imposed on The Cellar Door and its data intermediary, Global Interactive Works, for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access of its customers’ personal data.

Respondents\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 22\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n23 December 2016\n\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nOn or around September 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission\n(“Commission”)\nfound\nunauthorised\npostings\non\na\nwebsite\n(http://pastebin.com/jiQw38nU) known as “Pastebin”, comprising of personal\ndata of customers and users (collectively, the “customers”) of The Cellar Door\nPte Ltd’s (“Cellar Door”) website of Cellar Door, which was made available\nonline.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission undertook an investigation into the matter and its findings and\ngrounds of decision are set out below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nCellar Door is in the business of selling food and wine products, and has a\nbusiness website with the address of http://www.thecellardoor.com.sg (the\n“Site”).\n\n4.\n\nThe Site was developed by a company known as Global Interactive Works Pte.\nLtd. (“GIW”), which specialises, amongst other things, in website design,\ndevelopment and hosting. GIW was engaged to design and develop the Site.\nThe Site and Cellar Door’s customer database were hosted on GIW’s server. As\npart of these services, GIW would also backup the Site and customer database.\nOnly GIW’s staff would have access to these backups.\n\n5.\n\nThe disclosure of personal data on Pastebin comprised of the full names, mobile\nand residential telephone numbers, residential addresses, email addresses and\npasswords of Cellar Door’s customers. The data that was disclosed on the\nPastebin website was a subset of Cellar Door’s entire customer database. Cellar\n\n\fDoor was not aware of the unauthorised disclosure on the Pastebin website prior\nto the Commission informing Cellar Door of the said disclosure.\n6.\n\nIn response to the Commission’s inquiry into the matter, GIW stated that its\nengineers were unable to determine the reasons for the disclosure of the\npersonal data of Cellar Door’s customers on the Pastebin website. GIW\ndeveloped the Site for Cellar Door in 2011. Subsequent to that, Cellar Door\nengaged GIW to host the Site and Cellar Door’s customer database, but it did\nnot sign up for a maintenance package to maintain its Site and customer\ndatabase.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\nIssues for determination\n7.\n\nThe issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:\n(a)\n\nWhether GIW was acting as a data intermediary for Cellar Door in\nrelation to the personal data hosted on GIW’s servers.\n\n(b)\n\nIf GIW is a data intermediary for Cellar Door, what were the respective\nobligations of GIW and Cellar Door under the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n(c)\n\nWhether Cellar Door and GIW had complied with their obligations under\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nRelevant Provisions\n8.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation is obliged to protect\npersonal data in its possession or control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n9.\n\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA confers an obligation on the data intermediary to\ncomply with the Protection Obligation and the obligation to cease to retain\npersonal data under Sections 24 and 25 of the PDPA respectively.\n\n10. Further, Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall have the\nsame obligation under the PDPA in respect of the personal data processed on\nits behalf and for its purposes by a data intermediary as if the personal data were\nprocessed by the organisation itself.\nIssue A: Whether GIW is a data intermediary for Cellar Door\n11. GIW was engaged by Cellar Door to host the Site and customer database on its\nservers. The set of operations that GIW would carry out in furtherance of this\nengagement, such as the storage or holding of personal data on GIW’s servers,\nor the organisation or management of personal data in the customer databases,\n\n\fwould fall squarely within the definition of “processing” under Section 2(1) of the\nPDPA. As such, GIW was processing the personal data of Cellar Door’s\ncustomers.\n12. As GIW carried out the abovementioned operations on behalf of Cellar Door and\nfor its business purposes, GIW comes under the definition of a “data\nintermediary” under the PDPA, and is therefore required to comply with the\nProtection Obligation.\nIssue B: Cellar Door and GIW respective obligations under the PDPA\n13. Having determined that GIW is a data intermediary for Cellar Door, it is\nappropriate for the Commission to elaborate on the respective obligations of\nCellar Door and its data intermediary, GIW, under Section 24 of the PDPA in\nrespect of the personal data in question.\n14. Pursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the PDPA, both Cellar Door and GIW are\nobliged under Section 24 of the PDPA to ensure that there are reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data of Cellar Door’s customers.\n15. In the Commission’s view, Cellar Door has the primary responsibility of ensuring\nthe overall protection of the personal data, and it was for Cellar Door to put in\nplace the necessary security measures to protect the personal data. Cellar Door\nis not discharged of its responsibility simply because it had engaged a data\nintermediary (ie GIW) to provide hosting and database services for Cellar Door.\nIt is incumbent on Cellar Door to take the necessary steps to ensure the overall\nprotection of data, even though it may have engaged GIW to assist with certain\ndata operations. For example, Cellar Door may put in place contractual\narrangements which clearly define the scope of GIW’s responsibilities, and follow\nthrough with operational procedures and checks to ensure that GIW carries out\nits functions.\n16. GIW, on the other hand, has the direct responsibility of ensuring the protection\nof the personal data, as it was hosting the personal data on its servers, and was\nthe site administrator for the Site and customer database. GIW would therefore\nalso need to ensure that reasonable security arrangements are put in place to\nprotect the personal data in its possession or under its control. The extent of\nGIW’s obligations are scoped in accordance with the contractual arrangement it\nhad with Cellar Door. In this case, it is the protection of customer database\nhosted by it.\n17. A secondary issue in this case would be the distinction between possession and\ncontrol of personal data. The Commission is of the view that it is possible for the\nsame dataset of personal data to be in the possession of one organisation, and\nunder the control of another. For example, in a situation where the organisation\ntransfers personal data to its data intermediary, the organisation could remain in\ncontrol of the personal data set while, simultaneously, the data intermediary may\nhave possession of the same personal data set.\n\n\f18. In the present case, the Commission finds that the personal data handled by GIW\nwas still under the control of Cellar Door, given that GIW was Cellar Door’s\nservice provider, and the personal data that GIW had processed (as defined in\nthe PDPA, and examined at paragraphs 11 and 12 above), were for Cellar Door’s\nbusiness purposes.\n19. Accordingly, even though Cellar Door was not in direct possession of the\npersonal data that was held in GIW’s servers, it was still obliged to protect the\ndata by operation of Section 4(2) of the PDPA (as mentioned at paragraph 14\nabove), and, additionally, by the fact that it had control over the personal data\n(as found at paragraph 18 above).\n20. The Commission now turns to its assessment of whether Cellar Door and GIW\nhave complied with their obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA respectively.\nIssue C: Whether Cellar Door and GIW have complied with their obligations under\nSection 24 of the PDPA\n21. From its investigations, the Commission has found that there was a lack of\nadequate security arrangements in place to protect the personal data in question\npursuant to Section 24 of the PDPA. Broadly, it was found that Cellar Door and\nGIW had (1) inadequate security policies and processes to protect the personal\ndata; and (2) failed to put in place an overall security to guard against intrusions,\nattacks or unauthorised access.\n(1)\n\nInadequate security policies and processes\n\n22. Having in place adequate security policies and processes is the cornerstone for\nprotecting personal data in the IT setting. In the Commission’s view, an adequate\nsecurity policy should be based on the organisation’s assessment of the risks,\nvulnerabilities and threats facing the IT system and its determination of what the\nsystem needs to address these risks, vulnerabilities and threats. In turn, the\nprocesses of the organisation can be built upon the security policy that the\norganisation had put in place. This ensures oversight; proper accountability of\nthe personal data; and control over the measures and processes protecting the\npersonal data.\n23. Without such a security policy in place, an organisation may not, amongst other\nthings, be able to detect that a data breach has happened; may not be able to\ndetermine what went wrong; and may not know what are the corrective measures\nto be taken. This was what has happened in this case.\n24. In the Commission’s view, the organisation, and not the data intermediary, has\nthe primary responsibility of putting in place adequate security policies and\nprocesses. In this case, the Commission found several key issues in the system’s\npolicies and processes.\n25. First, Cellar Door had not carried out and had no plan on carrying out (prior to\nthe data breach that has happened) penetration testing on the IT system, which\n\n\fmeant that there was no systematic way of identifying vulnerabilities. Further to\nwhat was mentioned above at paragraph 22, this posed a limitation to Cellar\nDoor’s ability to determine the technical measures that are required to ensure\nthat the personal data held by GIW is adequately protected.\n26. Second, Cellar Door did not have an ongoing maintenance process to maintain\nthe website and to regularly update or patch it against the latest risks and\nvulnerabilities. GIW had informed the Commission that Cellar Door did not sign\na maintenance contract with GIW for the maintenance and “upkeeping (sic) of\nthe website and scripts”. This was unacceptable as it left the system exposed to\nnew vulnerabilities that regular security patching could have addressed.\n27. Third, there was no incident-management policy or process that tracked\nidentification of the technical issues through to their resolution. GIW had\nessentially left it to its “offshore programmers” to assess how the breach has\nhappened, which came back inconclusive.\n28. In the Commission’s assessment, given these shortcomings in the policies and\nprocesses above, the Respondents, in particular, Cellar Door, did not provide the\nnecessary oversight, accountability, control for the proper protection of the\npersonal data of Cellar Door’s customers.\n(2)\n\nFailure to protect the system against intrusions or attacks\n\n29. Another important aspect of a “reasonable security arrangement” for IT systems\nis that it must be sufficiently robust and comprehensive to guard against a\npossible intrusion or attack. For example, it is not enough for an IT system to\nhave strong firewalls if there is a weak administrative password which an intruder\ncan “guess” to enter the system. The nature of such systems require there to be\nsufficient coverage and an adequate level of protection of the security measures\nthat are put in place, since a single point of entry is all an intruder needs to gain\naccess to the personal data held on a system. In other words, an organisation\nneeds to have an “all-round” security of its system. This is not to say that the\nsecurity measures or the coverage need to be “perfect”, but only requires that\nsuch arrangements be “reasonable” in the circumstances.\n30. In this case, the Respondents have failed to put such an all-round security in\nplace. The Commission has found several significant gaps in the security\nmeasures implemented as follow:\n(a)\n\nNo server firewall installed. While there was an alleged “software firewall\nconfiguration”, there was no firewall installed to protect GIW’s server itself\nat the material time. A firewall is fundamental to the security of the server\nto protect against an array of external cyber threats, and GIW has the\nresponsibility of ensuring that such a fundamental measure is in place for\nits server. In this case, a dedicated firewall (beyond the alleged software\nfirewall configuration) protecting the server itself was only installed after\nthe data breach incident had taken place.\n\n\f(b)\n\nUnused ports were not closed. The unused ports on the server were not\nclosed at the time of the data breach. Leaving unused ports on a server\nopen increases the risk of an external hacker exploiting the services\nrunning on these ports. According to Cellar Door, GIW has since then\nblocked all unnecessary ports on the server.\n\n(c)\n\nLogin credentials were transferred in clear and unencrypted text. With\nregard to the Site’s functionality, the Commission found that login\ncredentials (ie user logins and passwords) were being transferred in clear\nand unencrypted text, indicative of a poor level of security in the system\ndesign and implementation. This security vulnerability exposed the hosting\nenvironment to potential compromise should the credentials be\nintercepted. Cellar Door, as the organisation having the overall\nresponsibility and control over the design and functionalities of the Site,\nhas the obligation to ensure that, as part of the design and functionalities\nof the Site, provisions were made for the security of the transmission of\nthe login credentials. In its original design, the Site did not have such a\nsecurity feature to protect the transmission of the login credentials – but\nthis was prior to Section 24 of the PDPA coming into force on 2 July 2014.\nHowever, subsequently when the PDPA came into full effect on 2 July\n2014, Cellar Door had the obligation to review the design and\nfunctionalities of the Site, and put in place the necessary security\narrangements to comply with Section 24 of the PDPA. Yet, Cellar Door\nhad failed to do so, and the Site still lacked in the necessary measures to\nsecure the transmission of the login credentials.\n\n(d)\n\nWeak administration password. Another of the corrective actions that the\nRespondents undertook was to increase the “DB Admin Password”, which\nwas only six-characters at the material time. In general, a six-character\npassword is not a strong password. Given that the password was for the\nadmininistration account of a database with remote access capability, the\nRespondents’ password policy should minimally have required a\npassword with a longer length and a mix of alphanumeric and special\ncharacters. The need to have a strong password is fundamental to the\nsecurity of the database system. Weak passwords increase the chances\nof an intruder cracking the password and gaining full access to the\ndatabase system, and, more importantly, the personal data stored therein.\n\n31. The security gaps and issues mentioned above exposed the system to all sorts\nof risks and attacks, such as penetration attacks, cracking, hijacking, and so on\nand so forth. Ultimately, an intruder that was able to enter through the gaps in\nthe system and gain access to the system would have gained unauthorised\naccess to the personal data held on that system. In the Commission’s\nassessment, therefore, the lack of an all-round security in this case was a breach\nof Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n\fWhether GIW is in breach of Section 24\n32. GIW had the direct responsibility of ensuring the protection of the personal data\nthat were in its possession on its servers pursuant to Section 24 of the PDPA.\nYet, as set out in paragraphs 29 and 30 above, there were a number of issues\npointing towards the lack of protection of the personal data on GIW’s servers. In\nparticular, GIW did not put in place adequate security measures when it failed to\ninstall a server-side firewall, close unused ports, and implement stronger\nadministration passwords. Accordingly, GIW is in breach of its obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\nWhether Cellar Door is in breach of Section 24\n33. Given that GIW is a data intermediary of Cellar Door, it follows from Section 4(3)\nof the PDPA, as mentioned above, that Cellar Door is obliged to protect the\npersonal data processed by GIW as if Cellar Door had processed the personal\ndata itself. As such, the Commission’s findings regarding the failure by GIW to\nfulfil its responsibilities and obligations under the PDPA are equally relevant in\ndetermining whether there was a breach of the Protection Obligation by Cellar\nDoor. In particular, as mentioned above at paragraph 30(c), it was Cellar Door\nthat had the overall responsibility and control over the requirement of the Site,\nand it needed to ensure that necessary security measures were in-built in the\nrequirement of the Site, at least since the PDPA came into force.\n34. Additionally, Cellar Door had the primary responsibility of ensuring the overall\nprotection of the data under Section 24 of the PDPA, and to implement the overall\nmeasures to protect the data. However, as examined at paragraphs 22 to 28\nabove, Cellar Door failed to implement adequate policies or processes to protect\nthe personal data under its control. Instead, based on the evidence produced in\nthe matter, it was apparent to the Commission that Cellar Door had mainly relied\non its data intermediary, GIW, to run its IT and data management system.\n35. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Cellar Door had similarly breached its\nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA.\nD.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n\n36.\n\nIn assessing the breach and the remedial directions to be imposed, the\nCommission took into consideration various factors relating to the case, including\nthe mitigating and aggravating factors set out below.\n(a)\n\nthe security measures on the Site to protect the personal data fell below\nthe standard reasonably expected, as highlighted at paragraphs 22 to 31\nabove, Cellar Door and GIW had inadequate security policies and\nprocesses; they failed to protect the system against penetration attacks;\nand they had a poor admin password policy;\n\n(b)\n\nCellar Door and GIW had shown a lack of awareness or knowledge of\nrequired security measures expected over the personal data in the\n\n\fSite/their hosting environment. As highlighted at paragraphs 6, 24, 31 to\n34 above, Cellar Door and GIW were unable to show how the personal\ndata had been taken from the Site or hosting environment, and had not\nshown to the satisfaction of the Commission that there were sufficient\nsafeguards to prevent this from happening;\n(c)\n\nCellar Door and GIW had been neither cooperative nor forthcoming in its\nresponses to the NTPs issued by the Commission as part of its\ninvestigation. In this regard, the Commission notes that Cellar Door and\nGIW displayed a cavalier attitude by providing incomplete responses to\nthe NTPs issued by the Commission; and\n\n(d)\n\nalthough not all the personal data of the customers of Cellar Door had\nbeen disclosed on the Pastebin website, given the inadequacies of the\nRespondents’ security measures, the entire customer database was put\nat risk.\n\n37. Pursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and having completed its investigation\nand assessment of this matter, the Commission is satisfied that Cellar Door has\nbreached the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. Having\ncarefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commission hereby\ndirects Cellar Door to do the following:\na.\n\nb.\n\nc.\n\nCellar Door shall within 60 days from the date of the Commission’s\ndirection:\ni.\n\nconduct a vulnerability scan of the Site;\n\nii.\n\npatch all vulnerabilities identified by such scan;\n\nCellar Door shall, in addition, submit to the Commission by no later than 14\ndays after the conduct of the abovementioned vulnerability scan, a written\nupdate providing details on:\ni.\n\nthe results of the vulnerability scan;\n\nii.\n\nthe measures that were taken by Cellar Door to patch all\nvulnerabilities identified by the vulnerability scan; and\n\nCellar Door shall pay a financial penalty of S$5,000.00 within 30 days from\nthe date of the Commission’s direction, failing which interest, at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\n38. Pursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and having completed its investigations\nand assessment of this matter, the Commission is satisfied that GIW has\nbreached the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. Having\ncarefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commission hereby\ndirects GIW to:\n\n\fa.\n\nPay a financial penalty of S$3,000.00 within 30 days from the date of the\nCommission’s direction, failing which interest, at the rate specified in the\nRules of Court in respect of judgment debts, shall be payable on the\noutstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\n39. In this case, the Commission has awarded a higher penalty amount against\nCellar Door as, in the Commission’s view, Cellar Door retained the primary\nresponsibility and obligation to protect the personal data of its customers as the\ndata controller, as elaborated at paragraph 15 above.\n40. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance under the PDPA, and it urges parties to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Jump Rope (Singapore) for disclosing the personal data of two former employees without consent and notification.","tags":["Consent","Notification","Warning","Arts, Entertainment and Recreation"],"date":"2016-11-24","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---jump-rope---241116.pdf","nature":"Consent, Notification","title":"Breach of Consent and Notification Obligations by Jump Rope (Singapore)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/11/breach-of-consent-and-notification-obligations-by-jump-rope-(singapore)","timestamp":"2016-11-24","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1411-A265\nJUMP ROPE (SINGAPORE)\n(UEN No. T13SS0090E)\n… Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 21\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n24 November 2016\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission\n(“Commission”) received a complaint against Jump Rope (Singapore)\n(the “Respondent”) from a complainant (the “Complainant”) alleging\nthat his personal data had been disclosed in an email sent to various\nSingapore government schools.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission commenced an investigation under Section 50 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to ascertain whether there\nhad been a breach by the Respondent of its obligations under the PDPA.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is a non-profit society registered with the Registry of\nSocieties that promotes and manages the sport of rope skipping, and\nprovides training to students in Singapore schools. The Respondent was\nset up by the President of the Respondent, [redacted], who is also the\nowner and director of Emotion Learning Pte. Ltd. (“Emotion”) and\nEltitude Pte. Ltd. (“Eltitude”). Emotion and Eltitude are companies in the\nbusiness of providing enrichment and CCA education, and enrichment\nand sports coaching services to schools respectively.\n\n4.\n\nBased on the Respondent’s response to the Commission during the\ninvestigation, the Commission understands that the Complainant was a\nformer employee of Emotion and Eltitude, who held the designation of\nPart Time Instructor. The Complainant went through an in-house training\nprogram conducted by Emotion, and obtained a certificate in rope\nskipping coaching, which was issued by the Respondent.\n1\n\n\f5.\n\nThe Respondent alleged that the Complainant had breached his contract\nof employment with his employers and had engaged in some unethical\nactivities during the course of his employment. As a result, the\nRespondent blacklisted the Complainant and revoked his certification.\n\n6.\n\nThe President of the Respondent then decided to send an email to\nvarious government schools involved in the sport of jump rope to notify\nthem of the blacklisting of the Complainant and the revocation of his\ncertification. In this regard, an email dated 28 November 2014 originating\nfrom the email address admin@jumpropesingapore.com was sent to\naround 30 government schools (“Email”). The Email stated, among\nother things, that disciplinary action had been taken against the\nComplainant, and that he was on the Respondent’s blacklist. The Email\nset out the Complainant’s name and NRIC number (and the name and\nNRIC number of another individual), and stated that persons on the\nblacklist are not suitable for instructing and coaching duties in schools.\nThe Respondent advised all schools not to engage the named persons\nto avoid the teaching of wrong values to their pupils.\n\n7.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent stated that as a non-profit rope skipping\nsociety with the mission to monitor and protect the interest of the sport\nand the children, the Respondent considered it necessary to inform the\nschools involved in rope skipping, so that the schools could take\nprecautions. The Email was sent to around 30 government schools\ninvolved in rope skipping, and it was solely meant to inform the schools\nof the situation. The Respondent’s stated intentions in sending the Email\nwas to provide schools with information which may be important in their\ndecision when engaging rope skipping instructors, so that the schools\ncan better decide in engaging the appropriate people to teach, instruct\nand coach their students. The Respondent reiterated that the disclosure\nof the personal data of the Complainant was meant solely to help schools\nin decision making when engaging rope skipping instructors.\n\n8.\n\nHaving carefully considered the relevant facts and circumstances,\nincluding the statements and representations made by the Respondent,\nthe Commission has completed its investigation into the matter, and sets\nout its findings and assessment herein.\n\nC.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n\n9.\n\nThe nub of the Respondent’s claim is that it had good intentions when it\ninformed the various government schools involved in the sport of jump\nrope of the blacklisting of the Complainant and the revocation of his\ncertification. In particular, the following points were noted:\n2\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Respondent claimed that it had advised all schools not to\nengage the named persons so as to avoid the teaching of wrong\nvalues to their pupils; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent claimed that it had decided to send out the Email\nto the various government schools to notify them of the\nblacklisting of the Complainant and the revocation of his\ncertification so that the schools “can better decide on engaging\nthe right people to teach, instruct and coach [their students]”, and\nto take precautions against engaging the wrong rope skipping\ninstructors.\n\n10.\n\nIt is clear that consent for disclosure of the Complainant’s personal data\nin an email communicating that he had been blacklisted was not\nobtained. This is not a case where consent was obtained earlier in time\nwhen he was first employed; and there is no evidence to show that the\nComplainant was notified nor gave consent for disclosure, before or after\nthe Complainant had been disciplined and dismissed. In a suitable case,\nthere can be valid business or legal reasons for the blacklisting to be\ndisclosed in order to warn the Respondent’s clients, notwithstanding that\nit may contain some personal data about the Complainant. It may not be\ndesirable to expect organisations to obtain consent from the person(s)\nthat is the subject of the disciplinary action, dismissal and blacklisting,\nas consent is unlikely to be forthcoming in all cases. However, the\norganisation should still comply with the neighbouring obligations of\nconsent, namely, the notification obligation and the purpose limitation\nobligation. This means disclosing the blacklist containing the former\nemployee’s personal data only for purposes that a reasonable person\nwould consider appropriate in the circumstances, and notifying the\nformer employee about the disclosure to be made.\n\n11.\n\nIn a suitable case, disclosure of personal data that is relevant to the\nmatter, by an organisation without consent nor notification, may be made\nif it is reasonable to do so. This is because the standard of\n“reasonableness” underpins the PDPA, as specifically provided for\nunder Section 11(1) of the PDPA. Section 11(1) of the PDPA provides\nthat “[i]n meeting its responsibilities under this Act, an organisation shall\nconsider what a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the\ncircumstances”. In this regard, an organisation can inform its clients that\nPerson A (name and former designation) has left its employment on a\nspecific date. Further, the Commission considers that it is conceivable\nthat there can be circumstances where an organisation may be acting\nreasonably in disclosing personal data in respect of a blacklisting to warn\nothers, without consent, and apart from the scheduled exceptions; but\n3\n\n\fthese are limited, and very much depends on the context and\ncircumstances in which the disclosure was made. For example, if there\nwas credible evidence of fraudulent conduct that a former member of\nstaff is misrepresenting his status of employment and association with\nhis former employer, it may be reasonable for the former employer to\nwrite to existing customers informing them of the facts. The former\nemployer should, however, also inform the former member of staff of the\ncommunication to be made to the existing customers, so that the\ndisclosure of personal data is made transparent to the member of staff\nconcerned.\n12.\n\nIn this case, not only has the Respondent failed to obtain consent from\nthe Complainant for the disclosure made pursuant to Sections 13 to 15\nof the PDPA, the Respondent’s actions have gone beyond what is\nreasonable in the circumstances. The Commission has not found any\nbusiness or legal reasons that justifies the Respondent’s actions in\nwriting to its clients to inform them of the blacklisting. It is not uncommon\nfor employees to leave for various reasons, including for poor\nperformance and breaches of codes of conduct. In the absence of\nevidence that the Complainant’s post-employment conduct had put the\nRespondent’s trade reputation or potential clients at risk, the\nRespondent’s measure of writing to name and shame the Complainant\nis not an appropriate or reasonable step to take.\n\n13.\n\nGiven the potential adverse effect or consequence on the Complainant\nfrom the disclosure of such information to third parties, in particular, the\nimpact on future engagements of the Complainant’s services for jump\nrope activities, the Respondent ought to have taken the extra care and\nprecautions in relation to the protection and disclosure of personal data\nof the Complainant. But based on the assessment above, it did not\nappear to the Commission that the Respondent had afforded the\nappropriate care, protection and sensitivity to the data that it was\ndisclosing. The Respondent’s actions in the circumstances were\nunreasonable.\n\n14.\n\nFor completeness, the Commission considered whether Section 20(4)\nof the PDPA, which provides that an organisation must inform the\nindividual of the purpose of disclosure where the collection, use or\ndisclosure was made for the purpose of managing or terminating the\nemployment relationship between the organisation and the individual, is\napplicable in the present case. In the Commission’s view, Section 20(4)\nof the PDPA is not relevant as it deals with collection, use or disclosure\nfor the purpose of either managing an ongoing employment relationship\nor for the purpose of terminating an employment relationship. In the\n4\n\n\fpresent case, the employment relationship between the Complainant\nand the Respondent had already been terminated by the time the\ndisclosure through the Email took place.\n15.\n\nOn account of the above, the Respondent is in breach of Sections 11,\n13, and 20 of the PDPA.\n\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE COMMISSION\n\n16.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of\nSections 11, 13 and 20 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions\nas it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include\ndirecting the Respondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not\nexceeding $1 million as the Commission thinks fit.\n\n17.\n\nIn considering whether a direction should be given to the Respondent in\nthis case, the Commission considered the following:\n\n18.\n\n(a)\n\nthe disclosures were made to a limited number of government\nschools;\n\n(b)\n\nthe personal data that was disclosed was limited, and was in\nrelation to limited individuals; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe Respondent had been cooperative with the Commission and\nforthcoming in its responses to the Commission during the\nCommission’s investigation.\n\nIn view of the factors set out above, and having regard to the overall\ncircumstances of the matter, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a\nfinancial penalty. Instead, the Commission has decided to issue a\nWarning to the Respondent for breach of its obligations under Sections\n11, 13 and 20 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n5\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to My Digital Lock for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of a customer during its transfer.","tags":["Protection","Consent","Warning","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"2016-11-04","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/Grounds_of_Decision---My_Digital_Lock_Pte_Ltd-(201604).pdf","nature":"Protection, Consent","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by My Digital Lock","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/11/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-my-digital-lock","timestamp":"2016-11-04","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1601-A628\n\nMY DIGITAL LOCK PTE.

The material facts of the case are as follows.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is in the business of selling digital locks and doors. The\nComplainant had made a purchase of a gate from the Respondent for his\nhome.\n\n4.\n\nSubsequently, the Complainant and the Respondent became involved in a\ndispute concerning alleged defects in the gate. The parties were engaged in\nlegal proceedings in relation to certain remarks that were allegedly made by\nthe Complainant concerning the Respondent’s product, business and/or\nservice. On 4 January 2016, Mr A posted screenshots on his Facebook page\nof his previous WhatsApp messages (including photographs) that were\nexchanged between the Complainant and Mr A in connection with the dispute.\nIn posting the screenshots on Facebook, the screenshots were made publicly\nviewable. The screenshots contained the Complainant’s personal mobile\nphone number and his residential address (“Complainant’s Personal Data”).\nThe Complainant became aware of this and lodged his complaint.\n\n5.\n\nOn 1 March 2016, the Commission notified the Respondent of the complaint\nand sought assistance in investigations. In the course of the investigations,\nthe Respondent accepted that there was a public disclosure of the\n\n- 1 -\n\n\fComplainant’s Personal Data on Mr A’s Facebook page but represented to\nthe Commission that:\n\n6.\n\n(a)\n\nMr A had posted the screenshots containing the Complainant’s\nPersonal Data on Mr A’s Facebook page for the purposes of\ntransferring the screenshots from Mr A’s WhatsApp application to Mr\nA’s desktop computer;\n\n(b)\n\nThe transfer was to enable Mr A to send the screenshots to the\nRespondent’s solicitors in connection with the Court proceedings\nbetween the Respondent and the Complainant;\n\n(c)\n\nMr A removed the screenshots containing the Complainant’s Personal\nData from his Facebook page about an hour after they were posted,\nafter Mr A had transferred the screenshots to his desktop computer;\n\n(d)\n\nthe Complainant’s Personal Data was disclosed by Mr A in his personal\nor domestic capacity;\n\n(e)\n\nthe Complainant’s Personal Data disclosed was publicly available data;\nand\n\n(f)\n\nthe Complainant’s Personal Data was disclosed pursuant to\ninvestigations and proceedings, in particular the civil proceedings\nbetween the Complainant and the Respondent that was contemplated\nthen and which have since been commenced.\n\nIn support of the Respondent’s claim that the Complainant’s Personal Data\nwas publicly available information, the Respondent provided a screenshot of\na YouTube video and five images from online sites which purport to show that\nthe personal data of the Complainant was previously available online.\nAccording to the Respondent, the YouTube video is no longer accessible\nonline.\n\nCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\nIssues to be determined\n7.\n\nThe Respondent admits to the posting of the screenshots on Facebook by Mr\nA. As the posting of the screenshots was a deliberate act by Mr A, and it\ncaused the screenshots to be published on Facebook, this amounted to a\ndisclosure made by Mr A of the Complainant’s Personal Data.\n\n8.\n\nEven though Mr A claims that he did not intend to disclose the Complainant’s\nPersonal Data to third parties, the fact is that he had made the disclosure on\na social media and networking application, which has the function of\nbroadcasting and sharing text messages, pictures, etc, to the Facebook\ncommunity. The size of the Facebook community and thus the extent of\ndisclosure depends on the privacy policy settings on Mr A’s Facebook page.\nOn the evidence, this was set to allow friends of Mr A to view the page. Mr A’s\n\n- 2 -\n\n\fintentional act of uploading the screenshots on a medium used for\nbroadcasting or sharing of media was therefore, in the Commission’s view, an\nact of disclosure of the Complainant’s Personal Data. This is not a case where\nthe Respondent had uploaded the screenshots to a secured online file storage\nor repository platform that limits access to his solicitors, which may have\nsupported his defence that the disclosure was pursuant to an exception in the\nFourth Schedule of the PDPA.\n9.\n\nThe issues arising from the case are as follow:\n(a)\n\nwhether the disclosure of the Complainant’s Personal Data on\nFacebook without the Complainant’s prior consent was permitted under\nSections 13 and 17 of the PDPA (“Issue A”);1 and\n\n(b)\n\nwhether the Respondent had breached Section 24 of the PDPA2 in\nrelation to its use of Mr A’s Facebook page as a means of transferring\nthe Complainant’s Personal Data (“Issue B”).\n\n10.\n\nIt should also be noted that even though this was a case of a disclosure of the\nComplainant’s Personal Data, the protection obligation under Section 24 of\nthe PDPA is also relevant in this case, given the lackadaisical manner in which\nthe Complainant had sought to transfer the screenshots to his lawyers. The\nprotection obligation is a separate obligation which an organisation would\nneed to comply with on top of the other obligations under the PDPA. In a case\nwhere the security of the personal data features as an issue, the\nCommissioner will investigate into the protection obligation as well.\n\n11.\n\nBased on the two issues mentioned above, the Commission’s assessment on\nthese issues are set out below.\n\nIssue A: Whether Respondent has complied with its consent obligation in disclosing\nthe Complainant’s Personal Data on Facebook\nSub-issue I: Whether the Respondent is responsible for Mr A’s disclosure of the\nComplainant’s Personal Data\n12.\n\nA preliminary question is whether the Respondent is responsible for Mr A’s\ndisclosure of the Complainant’s Personal Data. Under Section 53(1) of the\nPDPA, any acts done or conduct engaged in by an employee in the course\nof his employment shall be treated for the purposes of the PDPA as done or\n\n1\n\nIn essence, under Sections 13 and 17 of the PDPA, an organisation is prohibited from disclosing\npersonal data about an individual without consent, or deemed consent, under the PDPA, unless an\nexception applies pursuant to Section 17 of the PDPA.\n2\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its possession or under\nits control by taking reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection,\nuse, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks\n\n- 3 -\n\n\fengaged in by his employer as well as him, whether or not it was done or\nengaged in with the employer’s knowledge or approval.\n13.\n\nBased on the facts described in paragraphs 3 to 5 above, the Commission is\nsatisfied that Mr A was acting in the course of his employment as a director of\nthe Respondent when transferring the Complainant’s Personal Data through\nhis Facebook page. The Commission disagrees with the Respondent’s claim\nthat Mr A was transferring the Complainant’s Personal Data in his personal or\ndomestic capacity. This is because the Respondent asserts that the transfer\nwas for the purposes of sending screenshots containing the Complainant’s\nPersonal Data to the Respondent’s solicitors, which was in connection with\nthe dispute between the Respondent and the Complainant. The Commission\nnotes that civil proceedings have since been commenced by the Respondent\nagainst the Complainant.\n\n14.\n\nAccordingly, Mr A’s disclosure of the Complainant’s Personal Data is treated\nas a disclosure by the Respondent since it was made in the course of\nemployment pursuant to Section 53(1) of the PDPA.\n\nSub-issue: II: Given that the disclosure was made without the Complainant’s consent,\nwhether Complainant’s Personal Data was publicly available data and disclosure\nnecessary for investigations and proceedings\n15.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Respondent did not have the consent of the\nComplainant when disclosing the Complainant’s Personal Data on Facebook.\nHowever, the Respondent claims that the Complainant’s Personal Data was,\nfirstly, publicly available data and, secondly, that the disclosure was necessary\nfor investigations and proceedings by the Respondent. If either exceptions are\nmet, the Respondent would be permitted to disclose the Complainant’s\nPersonal Data without having to obtain the Complainant’s consent.\n\n16.\n\nUpon an examination of the facts disclosed during investigations, the\nCommission finds that these two exceptions do not apply to this case for the\nfollowing reasons below.\n\nPublicly available data\n17.\n\nPursuant to Section 17 of the PDPA and Paragraph 1(d) of the Fourth\nSchedule of the PDPA, an organisation may disclose personal data of\nindividuals without consent, if the personal data is publicly available. As\nmentioned at paragraph 6 above, the Respondent had produced a screenshot\nand images of online sites to the Commission to show that the Complainant’s\ninformation was previously available to the public online.\n\n18.\n\nHaving perused these documents, the Commission finds that none of these\ndocuments contain the Complainant’s Personal Data. While these documents\nmay contain some other information, such as the front entrance of the\nComplainant’s apartment, or portions of the content from WhatsApp\nconversations between the Complainant and the Respondent, these are not\n\n- 4 -\n\n\frelevant to the assessment of whether the Complainant’s Personal Data were\nalso publicly available information.\n19.\n\nSince there was no further evidence that was proffered to show that the\nComplainant’s Personal Data was publicly available information, the\nCommission finds that the Respondent may not rely on Section 17 and\nParagraph 1(d) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA for disclosing the\nComplainant’s Personal Data without consent.\n\nDisclosure necessary for investigations and proceedings by the Respondent\n20.\n\nThe Respondent sought also to rely on the exceptions in Paragraphs 1(f) and\n1(j) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA, read with Section 17 of the PDPA.\nIn essence, these exceptions allow for disclosure of personal data to be made\nwithout consent where the disclosure was (a) necessary for any investigation\nor proceedings; or (b) necessary for the provision of legal services by the\norganisation to another person or for the organisation to obtain legal services.\n\n21.\n\nIn both these exceptions, there is a requirement to show that the disclosure to\nbe made was “necessary” for the purposes set out in Paragraphs 1(f) and 1(j)\nof the Fourth Schedule. Based on the facts of this case, the Respondent has\nfailed to show that he needed to make the disclosure (a) on Facebook; and/or\n(b) to Mr A’s contacts on Facebook, for the purposes set out in Paragraphs\n1(f) and 1(j) of the Fourth Schedule. All that appears to be needed, and all that\nhe claims he intended to do, was to transfer the files to his lawyers, which did\nnot require him disclosing the Complainant’s Personal Data to other third\nparties. As the Respondent itself admits, there were other ways by which Mr\nA could have sent the screenshots to his solicitors.\n\n22.\n\nIn the premises, the Commission finds that the exceptions under Paragraphs\n1(f) and 1(j) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA do not apply to the case.\n\n23.\n\nGiven that the disclosure was made without the consent of the Complainant,\nand that none of the exceptions raised by the Respondent above would apply,\nthe Respondent is in breach of Section 13 of the PDPA.\n\nIssue B: Whether Respondent had complied with Section 24\n24.\n\nThe Complainant’s Personal Data transferred by the Respondent included the\nComplainant’s mobile number and residential address. There is no doubt that\nthese data fall within the definition of “personal data” under the PDPA since\nthe Complainant may be identified from such data when the data is coupled\nwith other information which the Respondent has. There is also no dispute\nthat at the material time, the Complainant’s Personal Data was within the\npossession or control of the Respondent.\n\n25.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, the manner and mode by which the Complainant’s\nPersonal Data was transferred over Facebook was wholly inappropriate. Even\nif the period of the transfer is short, there exists a substantial risk of the\nComplainant’s Personal Data being viewed, observed or even collected by\n\n- 5 -\n\n\fpersons, with no necessity to do so. Reasonable or adequate security\narrangements when transferring personal data must at least involve a process\nwhere the personal data is reasonably protected from unauthorised access or\ninterference, until the personal data reaches its intended destination or\nrecipient where other security arrangements on storage would apply. For\nexample, the file could have been encrypted (or at least password protected)\nso that only authorised people can access its content. Alternatively, the\nphotographs could at least have been uploaded to a site which permits control\nof access to the files, instead of making it visible to a wider audience on an\nopen social media platform such as Facebook which dramatically increases\nthe risk of unauthorised access or collection, and subsequent misuse. Lastly,\nit is not clear why a transfer to over the open Internet was preferable, as Mr A\ncould have simply connected his phone to his PC and transferred the file\nwithout the need to make use of the open Internet.\n26.\n\nIn view of the above, the Commission finds that the Respondent had failed to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control when transferring the Complainant’s Personal\nData using Mr A’s Facebook page. As such, the Respondent is in breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n27.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Sections 13 and 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is\nempowered under Section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Respondent such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may\ninclude directing the Respondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount\nnot exceeding S$1 million.\n\n28.\n\nIn determining the direction, if any, to be made, the Commission considered\nthe following factors:\n(a)\n\nthe Complainant’s Personal Data was only exposed on Mr A’s\nFacebook page for a short period of time of about an hour;\n\n(b)\n\nthe breach involved personal data of limited sensitivity (ie the\nComplainant’s mobile number and residential address);\n\n(c)\n\nthe breach was not wilful or due to systemic failures of the\nRespondent’s policies or processes but was instead triggered by an\nerror of judgment of a single employee, ie Mr A; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe Respondent had been fully cooperative in the investigation.\n\n- 6 -\n\n\f29.\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial\npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning to the Respondent for the\nbreach of its obligations under Sections 13 and 24 of the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n- 7 -\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on Smiling Orchid for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access of its customers’ personal data on its website, whereby users could access other customers’ personal data by altering the URL of its order preview webpage.

The Commission has determined that there\nare four respondents in this matter, namely:\n\n3.\n\n(a)\n\nSmiling Orchid;\n\n(b)\n\nT2 Web Pte Ltd (“T2”);\n\n(c)\n\nCybersite Services Pte Ltd (“Cybersite”); and\n\n(d)\n\nEast Wind Solutions Pte Ltd (“East Wind”).\n\nThe Commission’s decision on the matter and grounds of decision are\nset out below.\n\nPage 1 of 11\n\n\fB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n4.\n\nSmiling Orchid is a food catering company.\n\n5.\n\nSmiling Orchid owns the rights to two different domains, namely,\nsmilingorchid.com and smilingorchid.com.sg. Customers can place\norders for Smiling Orchid’s bakery and catering services through its\nwebsite.\n\n6.\n\nT2 is a web design and development company. By way of a Project\nAgreement between T2 and Smiling Orchid dated 29 July 2008 (“Project\nAgreement”), T2 was engaged by Smiling Orchid to design the Smiling\nOrchid webpage and build a Content Management System (“CMS”) to\nmanage Smiling Orchid’s bakery and catering content on its website.\n\n7.\n\nT2 created the design and HTML code but outsourced the development\nof the entire CMS to a freelancer, who in turn subcontracted the actual\ndevelopment of the CMS to another entity that T2 has only identified as\n“developers based in China”. T2 represented that there are no records\navailable about (i) how the CMS was tested by the developer; or (ii)\nsystematic acceptance tests done by the respective contractor.\n\n8.\n\nCybersite was the domain and website hosting provider for Smiling\nOrchid from 3 April 2014 to 3 April 2016 and had, in its possession, the\npersonal data of Smiling Orchid’s customers stored in its servers in\nSingapore. Since 24 April 2015, Smiling Orchid has changed its hosting\nproviders and T2 has been hosting Smiling Orchid’s website via Pozhub\nSolutions Pte Ltd (“Pozhub Solutions”), but Cybersite continued to host\nthe domain name.\n\n9.\n\nEast Wind is the new IT service provider to Smiling Orchid that was\nengaged after the occurrence of the data breach complained of by the\nComplainant to help Smiling Orchid with ensuring basic security and\nprevention of its portal and infrastructure.\n\n10.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, the Complainant placed an order on Smiling Orchid’s\nwebsite for a workplace event on 28 August 2014 (“Order”).\n\n11.\n\nOn or around 10 November 2014, the Complainant did a random search\nof his full name on www.yahoo.com.sg. Among the search results was a\nURL link to a website containing details of the Complainant’s Order,\nincluding his full name, residential address, mobile number, workplace\naddress and workplace email address (the “Data Breach Incident”).\n\n12.\n\nOn 11 and 18 November 2014, the Complainant reported the Data\nBreach Incident to Smiling Orchid but did not receive any response.\nThereafter, the Complainant lodged a complaint with the Commission.\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\f13.\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigation into the matter, the\nCommission also found that as at 18 February 2015, the preview order\nfunction\nat\nthe\nURL\nhttp://www.smilingorchid.com/admin/orde/catering/cateringOrderDetail.\nphp?pkid=5893 displayed the order details of other Smiling Orchid\ncustomers and that by changing the numerals at the end of the URL, the\norder details of other customers could be accessed.\n\n14.\n\nIn November 2015, the Commission noted that the order information was\nagain accessible on Smiling Orchid’s website without authentication. In\nfact, not only could the direct link be used as before, the following\nalternative link yielded a whole list of orders, which could be accessed\nfrom\nthe\nhyperlinks\nwithin\nthat\nlist:\nhttp://www.smilingorchid.com/admin/order/catering/cateringOrderList.p\nhp.\n\n15.\n\nIt is not disputed that the details of the customers’ orders contained\npersonal data under the control of Smiling Orchid at the material time.\n\nHow the Data Breach Incident occurred\n16.\n\nIn its responses to the Commission during the investigation, Smiling\nOrchid represented that it was only made aware of the Data Breach\nIncident and the security vulnerability when the Commission informed it\nof the investigation arising from the Complainant’s complaint.\n\n17.\n\nSmiling Orchid represented that it had depended on T2 to be “in charge\nof the site” and had expected that T2 would highlight any security issues\nthat Smiling Orchid should have paid attention to. This was despite the\nfact that (i) the security of the site or the CMS system was not included\nunder T2’s scope of work under the Project Agreement; (ii) Smiling\nOrchid conceded that issues of security did not cross their mind and T2\nwas engaged mainly to enhance the design of their website; and (iii)\nSmiling Orchid did not recall discussing any aspects of website security\nwith T2.\n\n18.\n\nIn turn, T2 denied that it was responsible for Smiling Orchid’s website\nsecurity at the time of the Data Breach Incident and alleged that\nCybersite was the party in charge of Smiling Orchid’s website security.\n\n19.\n\nCybersite admitted that it was responsible for the security of the hosting\nsystem. Cybersite represented that it had employed a basic hosting\nmodel using shared services, provided regular security updates of basic\nhosting provisions such as firewall, anti-virus and anti-spam software\nand regularly changed the system password as part of its security\nprocess. However, Cybersite conceded that it did not conduct regular\nsecurity testing such as an intrusion test as part of its processes.\n\n20.\n\nT2 represented that upon being informed by Smiling Orchid in February\n2015 of the Data Breach Incident, T2 conducted investigations and\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fdiscovered that the code protecting the site content had been removed.\nAs a result, data which was supposed to be protected and accessible\nonly by users with administrator rights could be accessed by users\nwithout such administrator rights. In response, T2 changed the\nadministrator and server passwords and added back the lines of code\nprotecting the site content.\n21.\n\nT2 also represented that there may have been similar instances where\nthe administrator rights were removed but T2 was not able to provide\ndetails of when such incidents occurred. Whenever such an incident\noccurred, T2 would change the administrator and server passwords, and\ncheck and reinstate the codes to secure the website.\n\n22.\n\nT2 hypothesised that the Data Breach Incident may have been caused\nby the following: (i) that hackers compromised the security of the\nadministrator module notwithstanding the existence of the password\nprotection; or (ii) that Smiling Orchid’s employees had shared their\npasswords to the website.\n\n23.\n\nWith regard to T2’s first hypothesis, T2 represented that the CMS was\nassumed to be designed in such a way that normal usage of the CMS\nsystem by staff would not result in changes to the code. The code was\nintended to be static to such users. However, T2 conceded that as the\ndevelopment of the CMS was outsourced, no test records were available\nand it did not know how extensively this function had been tested by the\ndevelopers or contractors.\n\n24.\n\nInvestigations carried out by Cybersite and the new hosting provider,\nPozhub Solutions, disclosed no record of any cyber-attacks to its hosting\nsystem for Smiling Orchid between June 2014 and November 2014\nwhen the Data Breach Incident had occurred.\n\n25.\n\nIn relation to T2’s second hypothesis, T2 represented that the\nadministrator password was known to T2, one of the freelancers and to\na few people within Smiling Orchid, one of whom has since left Smiling\nOrchid. Any one of these persons could have created new administrator\naccounts and passwords. There were no logs that can conclusively rule\nout this possibility.\n\n26.\n\nT2 conceded that there was no known enforcement of password strength\nor password length within the system. In fact, T2 represented that the\npassword was “likely” part of the PHP framework configuration file and\nwas likely stored in clear text. If not, it would be part of the MySQL\ndatabase. T2 admitted that it had seen and removed some passwords\nwithin the MySQL database.\n\n27.\n\nTo date, the root cause of the recurring removal of the code which\nallowed access to the personal data on the database without the\nadministrator password has not been ascertained.\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\fC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n28.\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commission are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhat obligations did each of the Respondents owe under the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in respect of the\nComplainant’s personal data; and\n\n(b)\n\ndid each of the Respondents comply with its obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Data Breach Incident.\n\n29.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (“Protection\nObligation”).\n\n30.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines a “data intermediary” as an\norganisation which processes personal data on behalf of another\norganisation but does not include an employee of that organisation.\nProcessing personal data on behalf of another organisation refers to the\ncarrying out of any operation or set of operations in relation to the\npersonal data and includes, but is not limited to, the organisation,\nadaptation or alternation; retrieval; and transmission of the said personal\ndata.\n\n31.\n\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA confers an obligation on the data intermediary\nto comply with the Protection Obligation and the obligation to cease to\nretain personal data under Sections 24 and 25 of the PDPA respectively.\n\n32.\n\nIn addition, Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall\nhave the same obligation under the PDPA in respect of the personal data\nprocessed on its behalf and for its purposes by a data intermediary as if\nthe personal data were processed by the organisation itself.\n\nIssue (a): what obligations did each of the Respondents owe under the PDPA\nin respect of the Complainant’s personal data?\nSmiling Orchid\n33.\n\nIt is not disputed that Smiling Orchid, being an organisation which has\nits customers’ personal data in its possession and/or under its control, is\nrequired to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks, pursuant to section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n34.\n\nThis is so regardless of whether Smiling Orchid had appointed a data\nintermediary or data intermediaries to process customer personal data\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fon its behalf. As such, Smiling Orchid is required to comply with section\n24 of the PDPA and adopt or ensure the adoption of security\narrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.\nT2\n35.\n\nIn light of the facts and representations made by Smiling Orchid and T2,\nthe Commission understands that T2 had not been engaged by Smiling\nOrchid to carry out any processing activities with regard to personal data\non its behalf. Therefore, it cannot be said that T2 is a data intermediary\nprocessing personal data on behalf of Smiling Orchid.\n\n36.\n\nFirst, as noted at paragraph 17 above, the security of the site or the CMS\nsystem was not part of T2’s scope of work under the Project Agreement\nand Smiling Orchid conceded that T2 was engaged mainly to enhance\nthe design of its website.\n\n37.\n\nSecond, the Commission notes that T2 did not deal with any personal\ndata of Smiling Orchid’s customers. Accordingly, none of the\nComplainant’s personal data can be said to have been in T2’s\npossession or under T2’s control at the material time.\n\n38.\n\nHence, even though Smiling Orchid represented that it had depended\non T2 to be “in charge of the site” and T2 itself represented that it had\ninvestigated the cause of the Data Breach Incident and carried out\ncorrective measures upon being informed of the Data Breach Incident in\nFebruary 2015 and on other occasions, the Commission is satisfied that\nthere was no evidence that T2 was charged with the responsibility to\nsecure the personal data as a data intermediary.\n\n39.\n\nAccordingly, T2 did not have an obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA\nto protect the personal data on Smiling Orchid’s website.\n\nCybersite\n40.\n\nThe Commission considers that Cybersite was a data intermediary of\nSmiling Orchid for the purposes of the PDPA. Cybersite was the hosting\nservice provider for Smiling Orchid’s website at the material time and, as\nnoted at paragraph 8 above, it had in its possession the personal data\nof Smiling Orchid’s customers stored in its servers in Singapore.\n\n41.\n\nPursuant to Sections 4(2) and 4(3) of the PDPA, Cybersite had an\nobligation to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data of Smiling Orchid’s customers.\n\nEast Wind\n42.\n\nEast Wind is a data intermediary of Smiling Orchid for the purposes of\nthe PDPA as it is an IT service provider and processed personal data on\nbehalf of Smiling Orchid.\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\f43.\n\nSince East Wind was only appointed by Smiling Orchid after the Data\nBreach Incident and was not involved in any part of the site during the\nmaterial time, the Commission is of the view that East Wind’s role does\nnot factor into its considerations pertaining to the Data Breach Incident.\n\nIssue (b): did each of the Respondents comply with their obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Data Breach Incident?\nSmiling Orchid\n44.\n\nAfter carefully considering all the relevant facts and representations\nmade by the Respondents, the Commission is of the view that Smiling\nOrchid failed to take reasonable security measures to protect the\ncustomers’ personal data in its possession and/or under its control.\n\n45.\n\nFirst, the Commission found that there was no clear designation of\nsecurity responsibilities by Smiling Orchid. As noted at paragraphs 17\nand 18 above, Smiling Orchid represented that it had depended on T2\nto be “in charge of the site” but T2 denied that it was responsible for\nSmiling Orchid’s website security at the time of the Data Breach Incident.\n\n46.\n\nAs an organisation subject to the data protection provisions of the PDPA,\nSmiling Orchid is ultimately responsible for ensuring that there are\nreasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal data\nin its possession and/or under its control; further, that any data\nintermediary that processes personal data on its behalf complies with\nthe PDPA. In this case, it would appear that prior to the Commission’s\ninvestigation, Smiling Orchid had not even considered that it was\nrequired to implement reasonable security measures to ensure that the\npersonal data in its possession and/or under its control was adequately\nprotected in accordance with Section 24 of the PDPA. Smiling Orchid\nhad merely relied on T2 to be “in charge of the site” without properly\nengaging T2 to provide security oversight for the site. The omission to\ndo so discloses the lack of implementing security arrangements for the\nsite.\n\n47.\n\nSecond, the investigations undertaken by T2 were poorly conducted and\nthe corrective actions it performed by reinserting the line of code and\nchanging the administrator and server passwords were superficial and\ndid not address the root cause of the incident. Consequently, a breach\ncaused by the same the line of code being removed had occurred again\nin November 2015 and T2 had again performed the same ineffective\ncorrective actions. That the line of code had been removed on more than\none occasion showed that Smiling Orchid had failed to ensure that\nadequate corrective actions were performed to resolve the root cause of\nany unauthorised access and/or disclosure. It also demonstrated an\ninadequate understanding of IT security that fell below reasonably\nexpected standards.\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\f48.\n\nThird, even though the issue was made known to Smiling Orchid in\nNovember 2014, even as late as October 2015, Smiling Orchid had only\nundertaken corrective actions in one domain even though there were two\ndomains involved. The same security issue had also arisen again in\nNovember 2015 even after the whole system was ported to a new\nhosting environment. Furthermore, since T2 has yet to identify the actual\ncause of the code removal, Smiling Orchid is unable to say that the\ncorrective actions that T2 had undertaken would be enough to address\nthis problem.\n\n49.\n\nIn addition, as noted at paragraph 26 above, T2 admitted that the\nprotection of accounts and passwords were weak: i.e. CMS passwords,\nincluding the administrator user passwords were stored in plain text and\nwere unprotected, and there was a lack of a policy relating to password\nlength nor strength.\n\n50.\n\nNew administrator accounts and passwords in relation to the CMS could\nbe created by any existing administrator account holder and there was\nno indication of any policy or logs as to who maintains these accounts\nand removes unused accounts. While the absence of a policy for the\nprotection and accountability of the administrator user accounts is not\ndirectly related to the cause of the Data Breach Incident, the Commission\nis of the view that this demonstrates an overall lack of security\nawareness on the part of Smiling Orchid and a failure to make\nreasonable security arrangements.\n\n51.\n\nIt is unclear whether T2’s actions would have been different had it been\nengaged to do more than enhancing the design of the site. Data\ncontrollers that engaged outsourced service providers have to be clear\nabout the nature and extent of services that the service provider is to\nprovide. There must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that\nthe service provider has agreed to undertake, and this should be\nproperly documented. Data controllers should follow through with the\nprocedures to check that the outsourced provider is indeed delivering\nthe services. In the absence of such clarity of intent and procedures, it is\nrisky to hold that the outsourced service provider is a data intermediary.\nIn any case, the Commission has found that T2 is not a data intermediary\nfor the reasons set out at paragraphs 35 to 38 above.\n\n52.\n\nConsequently, in view of all the relevant facts and circumstances, the\nCommission is not satisfied that Smiling Orchid has made reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks in compliance\nwith the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nCybersite\n53.\n\nAs a data intermediary of Smiling Orchid, Cybersite has an obligation to\ncomply with the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\f54.\n\nIn this case, there was no evidence of Cybersite being in breach of its\nProtection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n55.\n\nFor the general security of its servers, Cybersite had put in place security\narrangements including regular changing of system passwords, and\nregular updates of its firewall(s), anti-virus software, anti-spam software.\nThere was no evidence that these security measures had been\ncompromised or of Cybersite’s servers being hacked at the material time.\n\n56.\n\nRelating to the data breach that had occurred in this case, the security\nissues that were identified were at the application-level (i.e. the CMS\nsystem). It was found that these issues did not pertain to the contracted\nresponsibilities of Cybersite, who was only hosting the site. Although T2\nhad hypothesised that the code was removed because someone had\nhacked into the system by gaining access to Cybersite’s servers where\nthe code is stored to remove the code, as mentioned above, there was\nno evidence of cyber-hacking into Cybersite’s servers at the material\ntime. In any event, the same issue occurred even after Smiling Orchid\nhad switched hosting service providers.\n\n57.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission does not find Cybersite to be in breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN AGAINST SMILING ORCHID\n\n58.\n\nHaving completed its investigation and assessment of this matter, the\nCommission finds that Smiling Orchid is in breach of Section 24 of the\nPDPA.\n\n59.\n\nIn exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission pursuant to\nSection 29 of the PDPA, the Commission directs that a financial penalty\nof S$3,000 be imposed on Smiling Orchid.\n\n60.\n\nThe Commission also directs that:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nSmiling Orchid shall, within 120 days from the date of the\nCommission’s direction:\n(i)\n\nput in place the security arrangements for the new website\nto protect the personal data that was collected, or may be\ncollected, by Smiling Orchid;\n\n(ii)\n\nconduct a web application vulnerability scan of the new\nwebsite;\n\n(iii)\n\npatch all vulnerabilities identified by such vulnerability scan;\nand\n\nby no later than 14 days after the above action has been carried\nout, Smiling Orchid shall, in addition, submit to the Commission a\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\fwritten update providing details on (i) the results of the\nvulnerability scan; and (ii) the measures that were taken by\nSmiling Orchid to patch all vulnerabilities identified by the\nvulnerability scan.\n61.\n\nThe Commission took into account the following factors in assessing the\nbreach and the directions to be imposed:\nSmiling Orchid\n(a)\n\nSmiling Orchid was not forthcoming nor cooperative in providing\nthe full details of what transpired and its IT outsourcing\nagreements during the Commission’s investigation. In fact,\ndespite the issuance of one Notice to Require Production of\nDocuments and Information to Smiling Orchid and several verbal\nclarifications over the phone, the Commission was still unable to\nestablish the pertinent facts on what caused the discourse and the\nspecific roles of the parties involved at the material time. As a\nresult, the Commission had to take statements from the relevant\nparties in order to gather and distil facts;\n\n(b)\n\nthere was a recurring breach of the exact same nature in\nNovember 2015, even after Smiling Orchid had been informed of\nthe Data Breach Incident by the Commission in February 2015.\nEvery time a data breach occurred, the same ineffective\ncorrective action would be taken by putting back the lines of codes\nprotecting the site content by the administrator password without\nascertaining the root cause of the repeated breaches;\n\n(c)\n\nSmiling Orchid’s entire database was potentially at risk of being\ndisclosed if someone possessed the know-how to change the\ndigits in the URL link;\n\n(d)\n\neven though Smiling Orchid is a small-medium enterprise without\ninternal IT knowledge and expertise, as an organisation under the\nPDPA, it is ultimately responsible for protecting the personal data\nin its possession and/or under its control pursuant to Section 24\nof the PDPA;\n\n(e)\n\nthe impact of the data breach appears to have been limited; and\n\n(f)\n\nSmiling Orchid has taken some steps to remedy the breach,\nincluding engaging a new IT vendor, East Wind, to revamp\nSmiling Orchid’s website.\n\nT2 and Cybersite\n62.\n\nThe Commission finds that T2 and Cybersite appeared to play a\nsignificant role in this matter. T2 was essentially Smiling Orchid’s main\nIT vendor and Smiling Orchid was heavily dependent on T2 in respect of\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\fits entire IT system. However, T2 had a superficial understanding of the\nIT system. Its repeated outsourcing of different tasks to different parties,\nwho in turn re-outsourced the tasks, also resulted in confusion as to\nwhich party was responsible for the defective line of code that eventually\nled to the Data Breach Incident. Notwithstanding, as T2 was only\nengaged to provide web designing services and not website security and\nit did not handle or process personal data at the material time of the Data\nBreach Incident, the Commission finds that T2 was not a data\nintermediary of Smiling Orchid and was not in breach of the Protection\nObligation under the PDPA.\n63.\n\nCybersite, which was the domain and hosting provider for Smiling Orchid,\nalso has an important role to protect the personal data of Cybersite’s\ncustomers that were held on its servers. Although the Commission has\nnot found Cybersite to be in breach of the Protection Obligation under\nSection 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is of the view that a timely\nreminder should be issued to the organisation on its obligation as a\ndomain and hosting provider in view of the data breach that had taken\nplace.\n\n64.\n\nThe Commission will be issuing advisory notices to T2 and Cybersite on\ntheir roles and obligations mentioned above.\nEast Wind\n\n65.\n\nThe Commission notes that East Wind was Smiling Orchid’s newlyappointed IT vendor that provided assistance and support in terms of\nsecurity know-how during the investigation and was not involved in any\nway at the material time.\n\n66.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any\ninstance of non-compliance under the PDPA, and it urges organisations\nto take the necessary action to ensure that they comply with their\nobligations under the PDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take\nthe appropriate enforcement action against the organisation(s)\naccordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on GMM Technoworld for failing to implement proper and adequate security measures on its official website, resulting in an unauthorised public disclosure of approximately 190 of its customers' personal data.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade","GMM","TECHNOWORLD"],"date":"2016-10-05","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---gmm-technoworld---300916.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by GMM Technoworld","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/10/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-gmm-technoworld","timestamp":"2016-10-05","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1603-A656\nGMM TECHNOWORLD PTE. LTD.\n(UEN. 201103748R)\n... Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 18\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n30 September 2016\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nGMM Technoworld Pte. Ltd. (the “Respondent”) is a small and medium\nenterprise (SME) retailing products such as waterproof gadgets and measuring\ninstruments. In particular, the Respondent is the sole distributor of DiCAPac, a\nbrand of waterproof cases for cameras and mobile phones.\n\n2.\n\nOn 3 March 2016, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a complaint from a member of public regarding the\nalleged disclosure of personal data on the Respondent’s corporate website at\nhttp://www.dicapac.com.sg/frm_display/product-warranty-registration/\n(the\n“Webpage”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Commission decided to carry out an investigation into the matter and its\nfindings are set out below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent created a corporate website (www.dicapac.com.sg) on a\nWordPress platform for the purpose of marketing its products. The website was\nhosted on a third party server and comprised several publicly accessible\nwebpages. In 2014, the Respondent added a product warranty registration\nfeature to the website at http://www.dicapac.com.sg/product-warrantyregistration-form/ (the “Warranty tab”).\n\n5.\n\nThe Warranty tab contained an online warranty registration form (the “Form”)\nfor customers who purchased a DiCAPac waterproof case to register for the\nproduct warranty. This Form was created using Formidable Forms, a third-party\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\fpaid plug-in for WordPress, which allowed for the capture of personal data on\nthe website (the “Plug-in”). The information to be provided in the Form included\nthe customers’ names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers and residential\naddresses.\n6.\n\nThe Plug-in had the function of dynamically listing and displaying on the\nWebpage the personal data that was collected on the website via the Plug-in.\nAccording to the Respondent, it was unaware of this function of the Plug-in, and\nhad thought that the personal data that was collected was only viewable by the\nadministrator of the website. As a result of the Respondent’s misunderstanding\nof the functionality of the Plug-in and the (incorrect) use of the Plug-in, the\npersonal data of approximately 190 individuals collected through the Plug-in\nwas displayed on the Webpage, which was publicly accessible on the Internet.\n\n7.\n\nAfter being notified of the breach, the Respondent undertook certain corrective\nactions to rectify the unauthorised disclosure.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\nRelevant issue in this case\n8.\n\nSection 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) states that an\norganisation is obliged to protect personal data in its possession or control by\nmaking reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure,\ndisposal, access, collection, use, or similar risks (amongst others).\n\n9.\n\nThe relevant issue in this case is whether the Respondent had in place\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession\nor in its control, as required under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nCommission’s findings on the relevant issue\n10.\n\nIn this case, the Commission found that the Respondent was ignorant of or\nunaware that one of the functions of the Plug-in was to display the personal\ndata collected on the website. Further, the Commission found no reasonable\nexcuse for the Respondent’s ignorance for the following reasons.\n\n11.\n\nFirst, the Plug-in was promoted on the Formidable Forms website with the\nfollowing description indicative of its functions “[d]on’t just collect information,\ndisplay it”.1 Second, the product documentation webpage contained the\n\n1 Excerpt from Formidable Forms website (https://formidablepro.com/).\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\ffollowing statement “[a]ny data entered into a Formidable Form can be\ndisplayed on your site using Views”.2 On the same webpage, one of the display\noptions under the heading “View Format” was “All Entries”, which was\ndescribed as an option that would “[l]ist all entries from the specified form”.3\nThird, the Formidable Forms website had a ‘demos’ webpage that allowed\nusers to try out or download a demonstration of how the information captured\nby the Plug-in would be displayed. In gist, a dominant feature of the Plug-in is\nthat it provided online form functionalities for the collection and display of\ninformation on the web site.\n12.\n\nIn this regard, the Formidable Forms website had webpages which provided\nadequate demonstrations, documentation and explanations of its products,\nincluding the Plug-in, accompanied by pictorial guides. In the Commission’s\nview, an organisation ought to have sufficient understanding and appreciation\nof a product before making use of it. In this case, had the organisation studied\nthese sources, it would have become aware that use of the Plug-in would result\nin the disclosure of the data collected on the website since the Plug-in was\ndesigned to ease the collection and display of information. For the\norganisation’s purpose of collecting but not displaying personal data, the default\nbehaviour of the out-of-the-box features of this Plug-in would not be\nappropriate. Alternatives could have been considered. If alternatives are not\nsuitable and the organisation decides to proceed with using the Plug-in, it\nshould be responsible for understanding the security features offered by the\nPlug-in and it would have to set the security features accordingly. It would not\nbe prudent for an organisation to use a plug-in without first being clear of the\ndefault behaviour of its functions in relation to the collection of personal data,\nand without ensuring that the plug-in (if properly configured) adequately\nprotects the organisation’s personal data.\n\n13.\n\nFor completeness, investigations revealed that the Respondent did not mention\ntaking any further steps to protect the personal data in its possession or under\nits control. Instead, the Respondent appears to have relied on the belief that\nthe paid Plug-in itself was sufficiently secure out-of-the-box.\n\n14.\n\nUltimately, the Respondent’s lack of awareness of the Plug-in’s actual\nfunctions, its wrong use of the Plug-in, and failure to take steps to configure it\nappropriately led to the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of\napproximately190 individuals. Accordingly, this was a breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA.\n\n2 Excerpt from Documentation of Formidable Forms “View Settings”\n\n(https://formidablepro.com/knowledgebase/display-your-form-data/).\n3 Excerpt from Documentation of Formidable Forms “View Settings”\n(https://formidablepro.com/knowledgebase/display-your-form-data/).\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\n\fD.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n\n15.\n\nThe Commission is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the\nRespondent such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Respondent’s\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Respondent to pay\na financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1 million as the\nCommission thinks fit.\n\n16.\n\nIn determining whether a direction should be given to the Respondent in this\ncase, the Commission has given due consideration to all the relevant factors,\nincluding the following:\n(a)\n\nthe Respondent was cooperative and provided its responses to the\nCommission on a timely basis; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Respondent took immediate steps to stop the further unauthorised\ndisclosure, and implemented corrective measures to protect its\ncustomers’ personal data.\n\n17.\n\nPursuant to section 29(2) of the PDPA, and having completed its investigation\nand assessment of this matter, the Commission is satisfied that the Respondent\nwas in breach of the protection obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n18.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\nCommission hereby directs the Respondent to pay a financial penalty of\nS$3,000 within 30 days from the date of the Commission’s direction, failing\nwhich interest shall be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial\npenalty.\n\n19.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the\nnecessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 4 of 4\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to ABR Holdings for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of personal data of members on Swensen’s Kids Club website.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Accommodation and F&B","ABR","SWENSENS"],"date":"2016-09-23","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---abr-holdings-pte-ltd---230916.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Data Protection Obligation by ABR Holdings","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/09/breach-of-data-protection-obligation-by-abr-holdings","timestamp":"2016-09-23","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1408-A030\n\nABR HOLDINGS LIMITED [UEN 197803023H]\n... Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 16\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n23 September 2016\nBACKGROUND\n1.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the Complainant informed the Personal Data Protection\nCommission (the “Commission”) that by entering either,\n(a)\n\na random 8-digit number as a simulated membership number; or\n\n(b)\n\na simulated Unique Identification Number (UIN) number (e.g. NRIC or\nBirth Certificate number with a valid check digit),\n\non\nthe\nRespondent’s\nSwensen’s\nKids\nClub\nwebsite,\nhttp://swensens.prism4u.com (the “Website”), one could access a Swensen’s\nKids Club member account associated with that membership or UIN number.\nOnce accessed, the member’s name and date of birth (“DOB”) would be shown.\n2.\n\nThe provisions in the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”) relating\nto the protection of personal data were not in force at the time of the complaint.\nThe Commission wrote to the Respondent on 2 April 2014 to notify the\nRespondent of the complaint and that the provisions relating to protection of\npersonal data would come into force on 2 July 2014.\n\n3.\n\nOn 15 July 2014, the Complainant submitted a further complaint claiming that\non that date, the Respondent’s Website still allowed access to a member’s\nname and DOB by entering either a simulated membership number or valid UIN\nnumber.\n\n4.\n\nOn account of the complaints made, the Commission commenced an\ninvestigation under Section 50 of the PDPA to ascertain whether the\nRespondent had breached its obligations under the PDPA. The material facts\nof the case are as follows.\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n5.\n\nThe Respondent has been operating the Swensen’s chain of restaurants since\n1978. The Swensen’s Kids’ Club is a membership programme which the\nRespondent runs for children between 4 and 12 years of age. By accumulating\na certain number of electronic “stamps”, Swensen’s Kids’ Club members may\nbe eligible for various promotional offers from the Swensen’s chain of\nrestaurants (eg a free Kids’ Club Sundae every month with dine-in food order).\nEach member would be assigned an 8-digit membership number by the\nRespondent. Membership numbers run sequentially.\n\n6.\n\nThe Website supports the Swensen’s Kids’ Club membership programme and\nallows a member to access information relating to his membership account.\nThe Website has been in operation since 2013 and is maintained and operated\nby the Respondent’s vendor, Prism4u (Singapore).\n\n7.\n\nAs part of the investigation, the Commission verified that access can be\nobtained to a member account on the Website by (a) entering a random number\nsequence simulating a valid membership number; or (b) entering a valid UIN\nnumber in the form of a birth certificate number. The Website did not require\nany password to be entered nor authentication in any other form before granting\naccess.\n\n8.\n\nThe following details about a member were made available through the\nWebsite:\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nDOB;\n\n(c)\n\nRedemption status of Kids’ Club Sundaes and “stamps”;\n\n(d)\n\nNumber of “stamps” accumulated; and\n\n(e)\n\nMembership expiry date.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent was notified of the further complaint by the Commission on 5\nAugust 2014.\n\n10.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent made changes to the Website to remove the\ndisplay of the member’s name and DOB. The effect of the changes was such\nthat when the account is accessed using either a valid membership number or\nvalid UIN number, the only details available would be information concerning\nredemption status, the number of “stamps” accumulated and the membership\nexpiry date.\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\fCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\nIssue to be determined\n11.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by taking reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks.\n\n12.\n\nThe issue in the present case is whether the Respondent had breached Section\n24 of the PDPA (during the period between 15 July 2014 and 5 Aug 2014),\nwhen personal data (of members of the Swensen’s Kids’ Club) could be\naccessed on the Website (in the manner described in paragraphs 7 and 8\nabove).\n\nWhether Respondent had complied with Section 24\n13.\n\nThe personal data accessible on the Website included the name and DOB of\nmembers of the Swensen’s Kids’ Club. The names of the members fall within\nthe definition of “personal data” under the PDPA.\n\n14.\n\nThe personal data accessible on the Website was also under the control of the\nRespondent. The Respondent demonstrated this control when it was able to\npromptly effect changes to the Website to block access to such personal data\nwhen contacted by the Commission.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent’s system allowed the use of either (a) the membership number\nassigned to each member, or (b) the UIN number of the member, to serve the\nseparate functions of identification of member and authentication to access\npersonal data. These numbers were therefore the only security arrangement\nput in place by the Respondent to protect personal data on the Website.\n\n16.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, where a single string of numbers is the only security\narrangement serving both to identify and authenticate access to personal data,\nthe numbers can possibly constitute reasonable security arrangements\ndepending on the sensitivity of the personal data being protected, and only if\nthis number was unique, unpredictable and reasonably well-protected.\n\n17.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent’s use of membership numbers or UIN numbers\ndid not constitute reasonable or adequate security arrangements for the\npersonal data in its possession or under its control because:\n(a)\n\nthe membership numbers assigned by the Respondent to its members\nwere issued in running sequence. The Complainant was able to easily\nascertain the number of characters required for a valid membership\nnumber and deduce another member’s membership number since they\nwere issued sequentially. Tools that are able to generate number\nsequences, which can be entered as membership numbers, are also\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\freadily available online making it relatively easy to simulate other\nmembership numbers;\n\n18.\n\n(b)\n\ntools are readily available online that can simulate or generate UIN\nnumbers (such as NRIC and birth certificate numbers); and\n\n(c)\n\nonce a generated membership or UIN number coincided with an\nassigned membership number or a member’s UIN number, unauthorised\naccess to the member’s account and his personal data was possible.\nUntil the system was altered to display only the accumulated “stamps”,\nexpiry date and redemption status, the child’s name and date of birth\nwere also displayed.\n\nIn view of the above, the Commission finds that the Respondent had failed to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control in the period between the commencement of\nthe PDPA on 2 July 2014, and 5 August 2014, when the Commission notified\nthe Respondent a second time regarding the same vulnerability. As such, the\nRespondent was in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n19.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered\nunder section 29 of the PDPA to issue the Respondent such directions as it\ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nRespondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding S$1\nMillion.\n\n20.\n\nIn determining the direction, if any, to be made, the Commission considered the\nfollowing factors:\n\n21.\n\n(a)\n\nthe Respondent was first notified of the vulnerability on 2 April 2014,\nbefore the PDPA came into force, thereby giving it ample time to take\ncorrective measures;\n\n(b)\n\nthis infraction took place during the first month that the PDPA took effect;\n\n(c)\n\nthe personal data that was disclosed was largely limited to members’\nnames and DOBs; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe Respondent took prompt action to remedy the breach within the\nsame day when notified by the Commission a second time on 5 August.\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial\npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning to the Respondent for the\nbreach of its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f22.\n\nThe Commission takes a very serious view of any instance of non-compliance\nwith the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary action to\nensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA.

Commencing some time in 2013,\nthe Respondents provided a mobile application (“the App”) that allowed\npassengers to make current or advanced bookings. The App is owned by the\n1st Respondent. Upon booking a taxi through the App, the mobile phone number\nof the taxi driver will be sent to the booking passenger’s mobile phone together\nwith a confirmation of the taxi booking.\n\n4.\n\nThe Complainants, in separate complaints alleged that their mobile numbers\nare their personal data, and the Respondents are obliged to protect such data\nin accordance with the PDPA. The First Complainant, in particular, asserted\nthat the 1st Respondent is not permitted to disclose his mobile number to the\nbooking customers without his consent. The First Complainant claimed that he\ndid not provide such consent to the 1st Respondent.\n\n\f5.\n\nThe Commission understands that the mobile phone numbers that were\ndisclosed were obtained from the Hirer Application form and/or New Relief\nApplication Form (collectively, the “Application Forms”) for the hire of a taxi\nsubmitted by new drivers. At the material time when the Respondents’ mobile\nphone numbers were collected from them, the App had not been introduced\nand there is therefore no question that consent to disclose their mobile phone\nnumbers through the App could have been obtained from them.\n\n6.\n\nThe practice of giving passengers the mobile phone number of drivers who\naccepted their advanced bookings started in September 2013 and was\nextended to current bookings in July 2014:\n(a) On 23 September 2013, the Respondents, in a joint circular, informed their\ntaxi drivers of the initiative to release to passengers the mobile phone numbers\nof drivers who have accepted their advanced bookings.\n(b) On 9 July 2014, the Respondents, again in another joint circular, informed\ntheir taxi drivers of the initiative to extend the release of the mobile phone\nnumbers of the driver to passengers who have made current bookings.\n\n7.\n\nFurther, when a driver’s bid for an advanced or current booking is successful,\nthe taxi’s in-vehicle mobile data terminals (“MDT”) would show a message\nprompt containing an “OK” button and a note at the bottom that the driver’s\npersonal mobile phone number will be released to the passenger for “ease of\ncommunication”.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n8.\n\nThe nature of the relationship between the Complainants and the Respondents\nis central to understanding how the mobile phone number ought to be treated.\nBased on the information and documents obtained in the investigation, the\nCommission concludes that the taxi drivers of the Respondents (which includes\nboth Complainants in this matter) were not employees of the Respondents, but\nwere independent hirers plying their trade as taxi drivers on their own account,\nfor the following reasons:\n(a) The business of a taxi driver falls under the definition of “business” under\nsection 2(1) of the Business Registration Act (Cap. 32) (“BRA”) read with the\nFirst Schedule of the BRA. This means the business of a taxi driver is\nrecognised as a business (as opposed to a form of employment), albeit it is a\nbusiness that is exempt from registration under the BRA;\n(b) The Taxi Hiring Agreement and the terms and conditions issued by the\nRespondents identify their taxi drivers as “hirers”. This evinces the intention that\n\n\fthe relationship that the Respondents intended to have with the Complainants\nwas that of a contract to lease a motor vehicle intended to be used by the\nComplainants to carry on their business as taxi drivers; and\n(c) Crucially, the taxi fare was not collected on behalf of nor paid to the\nRespondents, but paid to and kept by the Complainants in toto. The\nRespondents are paid, and only receive, the hiring charges of the taxis from the\nComplainants.\n9.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the taxi service\nprovided by the taxi drivers of the Respondents falls within the definition of a\n“business” under Section 2(1) of the PDPA. This means that the mobile phone\nnumbers that are used for, or relate to, the business can potentially fall within\nthe definition of “business contact information”, and hence be exempted from\nParts III to IV of the PDPA (ie the main data protection provisions).\n\n10.\n\nThe relevant provision exempting the application of Parts III to IV of the PDPA\nto “business contact information” is found at Section 4(5) of the PDPA.\n“Business contact information” has been defined in the PDPA to mean “an\nindividual’s name, position name or title, business telephone number, business\naddress, business electronic mail address or business fax number and any\nother similar information about the individual, not provided by the individual\nsolely for his personal purposes”.1 There is nothing in this definition that\nprevents a mobile phone number from use as a “business telephone number”,\nnor is it desirable to exclude mobile phone numbers from the scope of this term\nsince many businesses and individuals provide their mobile phone numbers in\nthe course of their trade or business.\n\n11.\n\nThe more fundamental question is whether the Complainants’ mobile phone\nnumbers can be business contact information when, at the time that they were\ncollected and used, there was no legal concept of “personal data” nor the\ndistinction between “personal data” and “business contact information”, since\nthe PDPA had not been enacted. The PDPA has retrospective effect pursuant\nto section 19 of the PDPA, which applies to personal data collected before its\nenactment and used for a consistent purpose after its entry into force. To give\nfull effect to the PDPA, particularly when it is applied to personal data collected\nbefore its entry into force and that continues to be used for a consistent purpose\nthereafter, it is necessary to adopt a sensible and pragmatic approach. If the\nconduct of the parties at all material times discloses an intention to treat the\ndisclosure and use of the Complainants’ mobile phone numbers as disclosure\nand use for the purpose of their business as taxi drivers, the conclusion must\nnaturally be that these were business telephone numbers within the meaning\nof business contact information; notwithstanding that the legal concept did not\nexist before the enactment of PDPA.\n\n\f12.\n\nHaving considered the facts of this case, the Commission concludes that the\nmobile phone numbers were, at the material time, disclosed and used as\nbusiness telephone numbers and accordingly, are the business contact\ninformation of the taxi drivers; thereby exempting the Respondents from\ncomplying with Parts III to IV of the PDPA in respect of the mobile phone\nnumbers. The reasons and considerations for this conclusion are summarised\nas follows:\n\n13.\n\nFirst, the mobile phone numbers of the Complainants were collected when they\napplied to hire a taxi from the Respondents. As discussed above, the nature of\nthe relationship between the Complainants and Respondents was commercial\nas between lessors of taxis and sole proprietors carrying on the business of taxi\ndriving.\n\n14.\n\nSecond, commencing September 2013, the mobile phone numbers were used\nby both parties for the purpose of the Complainants’ business as taxi drivers\nwhen the Respondents started to disclose the mobile phone numbers to\npassengers as a means of contacting the taxi driver for advanced bookings. In\nthis regard, it also bears noting the following facts, highlighted above:\n(a) The Complainants were specifically informed that the mobile numbers of the\ntaxi drivers would be disclosed to passengers who have accepted their\nadvanced bookings. Likewise, the taxi drivers would receive a prompt on the\nMDT informing taxi drivers that their mobile numbers would be released to\npassengers; and\n(b) None of the Complainants had challenged or objected to this practice or to\ntheir mobile numbers being disclosed to passengers who made the advanced\nbookings in that period of time.\n\n15.\n\nThird, the practice of disclosing the Complainants’ mobile phone numbers to\npassengers for advance bookings was extended to current bookings from July\n2014. The conduct of the Respondents was consistent as the extension was\nfor the same purpose as before, viz, to provide passengers a means of\ncontacting the taxi drivers. This provides passengers with a consistent level of\nservice for both advance and current bookings. It was a natural and foreseeable\nextension as the means of direct communications between taxi driver and\npassenger with a booking is necessary and desirable, whether the booking is\nmade in advance or otherwise.\n\n16.\n\nFourth, the provision of direct means of communications between taxi driver\nand passenger with a booking is consistent with the nature of the commercial\nrelationship between Complainants and Respondents. After taxi driver and\npassenger are matched through the booking service, the Respondents have no\n\n\fability to control the Complainants as they are not employees. Since each taxi\ndriver plies his trade on his own account, driver and passenger should therefore\ncommunicate directly for matters concerning the delivery of the taxi service, e.g.\nclarifying the precise location for embarkation, delays in pick up or arrival at\npick up location, cancellation of booking, etc.\n17.\n\nIt is therefore clear to the Commission that the mobile phone numbers were\nused as business telephone numbers and therefore are in the nature of\nbusiness contact information. Since the Complainants’ mobile phone numbers\nare business contact information for the purposes of the PDPA, the\nRespondents are not bound by the provisions in Parts III to VI of the PDPA in\nrespect of the disclosure of the taxi drivers’ mobile numbers to booking\ncustomers, in particular, the need to obtain the taxi drivers’ consent prior to\ndisclosing the mobile numbers under Sections 13, 14, 15 and 20 of the PDPA.\nIn the premises, the alleged acts or omissions complained of by the\nComplainants do not amount to breaches under the PDPA.\n\n18.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Commission found that the Respondents\nhave not contravened the PDPA, and decided to take no further action on the\ncomplaints made under the PDPA.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n1 Section 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 and $1,000 were imposed on Fu Kwee Kitchen Catering Services and its data intermediary, Pixart, respectively, for failing to implement proper and adequate protective measures to prevent unauthorised access of its customers’ personal data, whereby users could access other customers’ personal data by altering the URL of its order preview webpage.

(UEN No. 201011239D)\n…Respondents\n\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 14\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n21 September 2016\nBackground\n1.\n\nOn 30 September 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission\n(“Commission”) received a complaint against Fu Kwee Kitchen\nCatering Services (“Fu Kwee”) regarding an alleged data breach by Fu\nKwee involving unauthorised access of Fu Kwee’s customers’ personal\ndata.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission commenced an investigation under section 50 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to ascertain whether there\nhad been a breach by Fu Kwee and/or Pixart Pte. Ltd. (“Pixart”) (the\nRespondents in this investigation) of their respective obligations under\nthe PDPA.\n\nMaterial Facts and Documents\nFu Kwee’s relationship with Pixart\n3.\n\nFu Kwee provides food and beverage catering services in Singapore. It\nowned and managed the following website at the material time of the\ncomplaint: http://www.fukweecatering.sg, where different customer\norders could be viewed through at the following URLs\nhttp://www.fukweecatering.sg/fixmenu1preview.aspx?pid=[number].\n\n4.\n\nPixart is an IT vendor engaged by Fu Kwee in 2010 to (a) develop an\nonline ordering system for Fu Kwee and Fu Kwee’s corporate website,\nand (b) host, support and maintain the website. The PDPA came fully\nPage 1 of 10\n\n\finto force on 2 July 2014, and as the contract between Fu Kwee and\nPixart was only terminated sometime around April or May 2015, Pixart\nremained responsible for hosting, supporting and maintaining the\nwebsite at the time of the alleged data breach incident in September\n2014.\nData breach incident\n5.\n\nThe Complainant stated that she was a customer of Fu Kwee, and\nalleged that she could retrieve another customer’s order details and\npersonal data (specifically the customer’s name, postal address and\npersonal contact number) by changing the numerals at the end of the\nURL\nof\nFu\nKwee’s\norder\npreview\nwebpage\nat\nhttp://www.fukweecatering.sg/fixmenu1preview.aspx?pid=102\nfrom “102” to “97”1\n(i.e. http://www.fukweecatering.sa/fixmenu1preview.aspx?pid=97).\n\n6.\n\nAt the material time, on 17 September 2014, while Fu Kwee had a default\nanti-virus programme for its server, it did not implement any measures\nto protect its customers’ personal data from unauthorised access\nthrough the type of vulnerability discovered by the Complainant (ie that\nthe personal data of other customers could be viewed by altering the\nnumerals at the end of the URL for Fu Kwee’s order preview webpage).\n\n7.\n\nFu Kwee appeared to be unaware of this vulnerability until the\nCommission issued its first Notice to Require Production of Documents\nand Information on 12 December 2014 (“First NTP”). Fu Kwee then\ninstructed Pixart to address the vulnerability on 30 December 2014. No\nnotifications were sent by either Fu Kwee or Pixart to the customers\naffected by the data breach.\n\n8.\n\nPixart confirmed, from its checks on the system, that the URL of each\norder preview webpage that was generated after a customer’s order did\nnot expire. Pixart also confirmed that the URL of the order preview\nwebpage would include the customer’s order ID number, which was as\nshort as three digits and generated sequentially via Fu Kwee’s website.\nThis enabled anyone who had a pre-existing URL to access other\ncustomers’ orders and their personal data simply by altering the\nnumerals at the end of the URL of Fu Kwee’s order preview webpage.\n\n9.\n\nPixart implemented a “one-time URL” solution on 30 December 2014.\nThis technical solution incorporates a 20-minutes exposure security\nfeature that permits a customer to view his or her own order only once\nbefore the URL automatically expires after 20 minutes. The URL would\nPage 2 of 10\n\n\falso similarly expire if the webpage was closed or refreshed by the\ncustomer.\n10.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the scope of the contract between Fu Kwee\nand Pixart did not include the implementation of security measures on\nFu Kwee’s website to protect customers’ personal data. Pixart had also\nnot conducted any penetration tests on Fu Kwee’s website. Such\npenetration tests could have enabled Fu Kwee to discover the design\nflaw of its order preview webpages.\n\n11.\n\nAdditionally, in the course of the investigations, Fu Kwee was found not\nto have implemented any password policy to restrict or control staff\naccess to its database of customers’ personal data. Fu Kwee also\nneither implemented personal data protection policies for the collection,\nuse or disclosure of personal data nor appointed a data protection officer\nto safeguard its customers’ personal data (“DPO”).\n\n12.\n\nHaving carefully considered the relevant facts and circumstances,\nincluding the statements and representations made by Fu Kwee and\nPixart, the Commission sets out its findings and assessment herein.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\nIssues for determination\n13.\n\nThe issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:\n(a)\n\nWhether Fu Kwee had breached the obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA (the “Protection Obligation”);\n\n(b)\n\nWhether Fu Kwee had breached the obligation under sections 11\nand 12 of the PDPA (the “Openness Obligation”), specifically,\nsections 11(3) and 12(a), for failure to appoint a DPO and put in\nplace privacy policies and practices, in contravention of those\nsections of the PDPA;\n\n(c)\n\nWhether Pixart is a data intermediary of Fu Kwee; and\n\n(d)\n\nWhether Pixart had breached the Protection Obligation.\n\nPage 3 of 10\n\n\fIssue A: Whether Fu Kwee had breached the Protection Obligation\n14.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA states:\n“Protection of Personal Data\n24.\nAn organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or\nunder its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks.”\n\n15.\n\nPursuant to section 24 of the PDPA, Fu Kwee, being an organisation\nwhich had its customers’ personal data under its possession and/or\ncontrol, is required to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks. The Protection Obligation applies equally to all\npersonal data in the possession or under the control of the organisation,\nincluding personal data that the organisation may have collected before\n2 July 2014, when the data protection provisions under Parts III to VI of\nthe PDPA came into effect.\n\n16.\n\nFollowing a careful assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances,\nthe Commission is of the view that Fu Kwee had not reasonably\ndischarged its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA until the fixes\nintroduced on 30 December 2014. In particular, the Commission has\nidentified the following vulnerabilities in Fu Kwee’s security\narrangements, which illustrate how Fu Kwee failed to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect customers’ personal data:\n(a)\n\nFu Kwee’s website did not require password access, which could\nhave reasonably restricted unauthorised access to customers’\npersonal data using the website.\n\n(b)\n\nThe order preview URLs that were generated by Fu Kwee’s\nwebsite whenever a customer placed an order not only did not\nexpire, but were also predictable. This enabled any customer to\nsimply alter the last few digits of an order preview URL in order\nto access the order details and personal data of other customers.\n\n(c)\n\nFu Kwee acknowledged that it had not instructed Pixart to put in\nplace security measures to protect its customers’ personal data\neven after 2 July 2014, when the data protection obligations in\nthe PDPA came into force.\n\nPage 4 of 10\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe investigations also found that there were no access controls\nto Fu Kwee’s database of customers’ personal data. Accordingly,\nthough Fu Kwee had sought to protect its server containing the\ndatabase using a default Windows firewall, the database\nremained vulnerable to unauthorised access.\n\n17.\n\nThe vulnerabilities set out above demonstrate that Fu Kwee could have\ndone more to protect its customers’ personal data that was in its\npossession or under its control. When viewed in totality, the Commission\nis of the view that Fu Kwee had failed to make reasonable security\narrangements to protect its customers’ personal data because these\nvulnerabilities were preventable.\n\n18.\n\nAlthough Fu Kwee had outsourced the hosting, support and\nmaintenance of its online ordering system and corporate website to\nPixart (which the Commission has determined to be a data intermediary\nof Fu Kwee for the reasons set out below), Fu Kwee was ultimately\nresponsible for the security of the website and customers’ personal data\nas if the personal data was processed by Fu Kwee itself (per section 4(3)\nof the PDPA).\n\n19.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission finds that Fu Kwee had\nbreached the Protection Obligation at the material time.\n\nIssue B: Whether Fu Kwee had breached the Openness Obligation\n20.\n\nSections 11 and 12 of the PDPA together constitute the Openness\nObligation under the PDPA, which provides that an organisation must\nimplement the necessary policies and procedures in order to meet its\nobligations under the PDPA, and shall make information about its\npolicies and procedures publicly available. In particular, section 11(3) of\nthe PDPA provides that an organisation shall designate one or more\nindividuals as a DPO to be responsible for ensuring that the organisation\ncomplies with the PDPA. In the same vein, section 12(a) of the PDPA\nrequires organisations to develop and implement policies and practices\nthat are necessary for the organisation to meet the obligations of the\norganisations under the PDPA.\n\n21.\n\nFu Kwee confirmed that between 2 July 2014 and 12 December 2014,\nFu Kwee neither implemented any personal data protection policies for\nthe collection, use or disclosure of personal data, nor appointed a DPO.\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\n\f22.\n\nIn light of the foregoing lapses, the Commission finds that Fu Kwee had\nbreached the Openness Obligation.\n\nIssue C: Whether Pixart is a data intermediary of Fu Kwee\n23.\n\nUnder section 2(1) of the PDPA, a “data intermediary” is an organisation\nwhich processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but\ndoes not include an employee of that other organisation. The term\n“processing” in relation to personal data means the carrying out of any\noperation or set of operations in relation to the personal data and\nincludes, but is not limited to, any of the following: recording; holding;\norganisation, adaptation or alteration; retrieval; combination;\ntransmission; erasure or destruction. Section 4(2) of the PDPA imposes\non a data intermediary the obligation to protect personal data under\nsection 24 of the PDPA and the obligation to cease to retain personal\ndata under section 25 of the PDPA in respect of its processing of\npersonal data on behalf of and for the purposes of another organisation\npursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in writing. Save for\nthe aforementioned obligations, Parts III to VI of the PDPA do not impose\nany other obligations on the data intermediary, in respect of its\nprocessing of personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of another\norganisation pursuant to a contract which is evidenced and made in\nwriting.\n\n24.\n\nBased on the facts and representations by Fu Kwee and Pixart, the\nCommission notes that Pixart was contractually engaged by Fu Kwee in\n2010 to (a) develop an online ordering system for Fu Kwee and Fu\nKwee’s corporate website, and (b) host, support and maintain Fu Kwee’s\nwebsite. As the contract was only terminated sometime in April/May\n2015, Pixart was still responsible for hosting, supporting and maintaining\nFu Kwee’s corporate website and ordering system at the material time\nof the data breach incident in September 2014.\n\n25.\n\nThe Commission is of the view that Pixart had processed personal data\nof Fu Kwee’s customers, pursuant to the contract between Fu Kwee and\nPixart in relation to the hosting, support and maintenance of the online\nordering system and Fu Kwee’s corporate website, and Pixart had done\nso on behalf of and for the purposes of Fu Kwee.\n\n26.\n\nIn this regard, the Commission finds that Pixart was acting as a data\nintermediary of Fu Kwee with respect to the relevant websites at the\nURLs set out above in connection with the data breach incident, as Pixart\nessentially processed Fu Kwee’s customers’ personal data on behalf of\nPage 6 of 10\n\n\fand for the purposes of Fu Kwee in hosting, supporting and maintaining\nthe online ordering system and Fu Kwee’s website.\nIssue D: Whether Pixart had breached the Protection Obligation\n27.\n\nSection 24 read with section 4(2) of the PDPA imposes a Protection\nObligation on data intermediaries in that a data intermediary is obliged\nto make “reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks”. In view of the Commission’s finding that Pixart was a data\nintermediary of Fu Kwee at the material time of the data breach incident,\nPixart was required to comply with the Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA to protect the personal data it was processing\non behalf of and for the purposes of Fu Kwee.\n\n28.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, as a data intermediary, Pixart had an\nobligation to protect the personal data of Fu Kwee’s customers using the\nordering system on Fu Kwee’s website. Pixart has clearly not discharged\nthe Protection Obligation imposed on it under the PDPA, as it did not\nhave in place reasonable measures to protect the personal data that it\nwas processing for and on behalf of Fu Kwee when it developed, hosted,\nmaintained and provided support in relation to the online ordering\nsystem and Fu Kwee’s website.\n\n29.\n\nIn this connection, the Commission notes that if Pixart had advised Fu\nKwee on its obligations to protect personal data, but Fu Kwee had\nrejected Pixart’s advice, this could have been taken into account by the\nCommission as a mitigating factor. However, there is presently no\nevidence before the Commission suggesting that Pixart had actually\nadvised Fu Kwee on the need to have in place adequate security\nmeasures to protect the personal data of Fu Kwee’s customers in Fu\nKwee’s database.\n\n30.\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds that there had been a breach\nof the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA by Pixart.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n31.\n\nIn assessing the breach and the remedial directions to be imposed, the\nCommission took into consideration various factors relating to the case,\nincluding the mitigating and aggravating factors set out below.\n\nPage 7 of 10\n\n\fFu Kwee’s breach of the Protection Obligation and the Openness Obligation\n32.\n\nIn relation to Fu Kwee’s breach of the Protection Obligation and\nOpenness Obligation, the Commission took into account the following\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nAlthough Fu Kwee had ample opportunity to put in place\nreasonable security measures from 2 January 2013 to 2 July\n2014, or even after 2 July 2014, when the data protection\nprovisions of the PDPA came into force, it did not do so;\n\n(b)\n\nFu Kwee’s disregard for its obligations under the PDPA is also\napparent as it had failed to appoint a DPO or put in place policies\nand practices to comply with the PDPA as at June 2015 (when it\nappointed a new vendor), even after being notified about the data\nbreach incident in December 2014 by the Commission;\n\n(c)\n\nFu Kwee was not forthcoming in providing information during the\ninvestigation, and only provided bare facts in its responses during\nthe investigations; and\n\n(d)\n\nNotwithstanding that the Commission did not receive any other\ncomplaints regarding the relevant websites at the URLs described\nabove, the lapses by Fu Kwee meant that anyone who had the\nexact URL or who had correctly guessed the parameters could\npotentially access all the personal data of Fu Kwee’s customers\nwho had placed orders online at Fu Kwee’s website.\n\nPixart’s breach of the Protection Obligation\n33.\n\nIn relation to Pixart’s breach of the Protection Obligation, the following\nfactors were taken into consideration:\n(a)\n\nPixart was not forthcoming in providing information during the\ninvestigation, and did not respond to the Second Notice to\nRequire Production of Documents and Information dated 10\nMarch 2015, which was addressed to Pixart; and\n\n(b)\n\nPixart took active steps to fix the vulnerability in about two weeks\nafter the Commission informed Fu Kwee about the data breach.\nBased on the Commission’s assessment, the remedial actions\ntaken were acceptable.\n\nPage 8 of 10\n\n\f34.\n\n35.\n\nHaving completed its investigation and assessment of this matter, the\nCommission is satisfied that Fu Kwee had been in breach of the\nProtection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA, and the Openness\nObligation under sections 11(3) and 12(a) of the PDPA for the reasons\ncited above. Pursuant to section 29 of the PDPA, the Commission\nhereby directs Fu Kwee to do as follows:\n(a)\n\nPay a financial penalty of $3,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe Commission’s direction;\n\n(b)\n\nFor all employees of Fu Kwee handling personal data to attend a\ntraining course on the obligations under the PDPA and the\norganisation’s data protection policies and practices within 6\nmonths from the date of the Commission’s direction;\n\n(c)\n\nConduct\na\nsecurity\naudit\nof\nthe\nwebsite\nat\nhttp://fukweecatering.com.sg/ to be performed by duly qualified\ncompetent contractors or staff. Fu Kwee is to furnish to the\nCommission, within 30 days from the date the Commission’s\ndirection, a schedule stating the scope of the risks to be assessed\nand the time within which a full report of the audit can be provided\nto the Commission, and to confirm in the said report that Fu Kwee\nno longer stores any personal data of its customers on its website;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nTo take steps to appoint a DPO and to develop and implement\npolicies and practices that are necessary for Fu Kwee to comply\nfully with its obligations under the PDPA, and to provide the\nCommission with a compliance status update within 30 days from\nthe date of the Commission’s direction.\n\nThe Commission is also satisfied that Pixart has not complied with the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA for the reasons cited\nabove. Pursuant to Section 29(2) of the PDPA, the Commission hereby\ndirects that a financial penalty of S$1,000 be meted out against Pixart.\n\nPage 9 of 10\n\n\f36.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any\ninstance of non-compliance under the PDPA and with the Commission’s\ndirections. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate\nenforcement action against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n1\n\nThe URL had been taken down shortly after the data breach incident.\n\nPage 10 of 10\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $25,000 was imposed on Toh-Shi Printing Singapore for failing to implement proper and adequate procedural checks while processing personal data for Aviva, resulting in an unauthorised disclosure of personal data of more than 8,000 individuals.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Admin and Support Services","TOH-SHI","AVIVA"],"date":"2016-09-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision-aviva-ltd-and-toh-shi-printing-singapore-(210916).pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Toh-Shi Printing Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/09/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-toh-shi-printing-singapore-sep","timestamp":"2016-09-21","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1603-A661\nAVIVA LTD (UEN No. 196900499K)\n… 1st Respondent\nTOH-SHI PRINTING SINGAPORE PTE LTD (UEN No. 198704013N)\n… 2nd Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 15\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n21 September 2016\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nOn 9 March 2016, Aviva Ltd (“Aviva”) reported to the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (“Commission”) an incident involving the\ndisclosure of the personal data belonging to 7,794 Aviva policyholders\nunder the Aviva Public Officers Group Insurance Scheme (“POGIS”). It\nwas reported that erroneous annual premium statements for the year\n2015 had been sent out to the POGIS policyholders. The Monetary\nAuthority of Singapore was also notified of this incident by Aviva on 10\nMarch 2016.\n\n2.\n\nOn 10 June 2016, Aviva informed the Commission that while 7,794\nPOGIS policyholders received erroneous annual premium statements\nfor the year 2015, the personal data of a total of 8,022 individuals,\nincluding the POGIS policyholders’ dependants, were disclosed in the\ndata breach incident.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing the reporting of the incident, the Commission undertook an\ninvestigation into the matter. The Commission has determined that the\ntwo respondents in this matter are Aviva and Toh-Shi Printing Singapore\nPte Ltd (“Toh-Shi”). The Commission’s decision on the matter and\ngrounds of decision are set out below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n4.\n\nAviva is an insurance company and the appointed insurer for the POGIS.\nToh-Shi provides mail out services of all the correspondence for Aviva\nand data printing services for ad-hoc projects. The mail out and data\nprinting services provided by Toh-Shi to Aviva are governed by a Service\nAgreement dated 20 December 2012 as amended by a letter from Aviva\nto Toh-Shi dated 24 April 2014 and an Addendum to the Service\nPage 1 of 9\n\n\fAgreement dated 12 January 2016 (the “Addendum” and collectively,\nthe “Toh-Shi Service Agreement”).\n5.\n\nThe Toh-Shi Service Agreement provides that, among other things, TohShi shall (i) comply with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”)\nand all subsidiary legislation related thereto; and (ii) have in place an\nadequate security plan containing Toh-Shi’s security policies,\nprocedures and controls in respect of protecting the confidentiality and\nsecurity of Aviva’s information in connection with the provision of the\nServices.\n\n6.\n\nDuring investigations, Aviva represented to the Commission that it has\nput in place the following security arrangements:\n\n7.\n\n(a)\n\na Standard Operating Procedure (“SOP”) whereby Toh-Shi\nprovides sample cases to Aviva for verification and Aviva is\nrequired to sign-off on the sampled cases and give the go-ahead\nbefore Toh-Shi can commence printing the finalised documents;\n\n(b)\n\nannual inspections and review of Aviva’s arrangement with TohShi are conducted to ensure that Toh-Shi is adhering to its\nsecurity procedures in handling data, such as data encryption to\nprotect customer data, as well as conducting data sample checks\nto ensure data consistency and integrity; and\n\n(c)\n\nannual on-site inspections are conducted to verify Toh-Shi’s\ninformation technology security and business protection\nmeasures, and business continuity and disaster recovery\ncapabilities.\n\nSimilarly, Toh-Shi represented to the Commission that it has a Data\nProtection Notice (effective 2 July 2014), which sets out the various\nmethods that Toh-Shi has in place to safeguard personal data, and that\nit has implemented the following security measures and processes:\n(a)\n\nToh-Shi will send user acceptance testing (“UAT”) samples to\nAviva for Aviva’s verification and will only send the processed data\nfor printing after Aviva has verified and signed off on the Data\nContent Form;\n\n(b)\n\nToh-Shi has quality control (“QC”) processes in place and\nconducts sample checks (“QC Sample Checks”) to ensure the\naccuracy of the data printed and that the documents printed match\nthe approved UAT samples;\n\n(c)\n\nonce the documents are printed, a printout from the mailing\nmachine will record the actual number of letters inserted and this\nfigure will be tallied against the IT report that records the total\nnumber of letters computed from the database; and\nPage 2 of 9\n\n\f(d)\n\n8.\n\nprinting is done in a secured room, with 24/7 CCTV recording.\nToh-Shi’s data printing supervisor will also observe the operators\nand ensure that they do not spend more than the required quick\nglance which may constitute the detailed reading of the printed\ndata but rather, to ensure the correct positioning of the images\nand clarity.\n\nOn 8 March 2016, Toh-Shi sent out erroneous annual premium\nstatements (“Erroneous Statements”) to 7,794 of Aviva’s POGIS policy\nholders (“Affected POGIS Policyholders”). The Erroneous Statements\ncontained the following information of another POGIS policy holder (“2nd\nProducts”):\n(a)\n\nthe name(s) of the other policy holder’s dependant(s);\n\n(b)\n\nthe sum assured under the other policy holder’s policy;\n\n(c)\n\nthe premium amount under the other policy holder’s policy; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe type of coverage under the other policy holder’s policy.\n\n9.\n\nOn the same day, Aviva informed Toh-Shi that 3 POGIS policyholders\nhad received annual premium statements with 2nd Products that did not\nbelong to them.\n\n10.\n\nAfter the discovery of the data breach, on 10 March 2016, Aviva and\nToh-Shi held a recovery management meeting.\n\n11.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, Toh-Shi reprinted and sent out the 7,794 corrected\nstatements together with an apology letter prepared by Aviva and a S$50\nshopping voucher to the Affected POGIS Policyholders. Aviva also gave\nthe Affected POGIS Policyholders a waiver of 1 month’s insurance\npremium as a token for the inconvenience caused.\n\n12.\n\nAccording to the investigations carried out by Toh-Shi, it was found that\nthe data breach incident had occurred due to an error in the sorting\nprocess before the printing of the annual premium statements.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the usual practice, Aviva had sent the statement\ndetails in an Excel file to Toh-Shi for processing, which involved\npopulating the relevant fields in the appropriate document templates.\nThereafter, the UAT samples were provided to Aviva and Aviva verified\nand confirmed that the UAT samples were in order and Toh-Shi could\nproceed with the printing.\n\n14.\n\nHowever, rather than proceed with the printing of the annual premium\nstatements, Toh-Shi performed further processing by sorting the data\naccording to postal code, overseas address and non-deliverable mail\nbefore printing. It did so in order to enjoy postage savings. Toh-Shi did\nnot provide any UAT samples of the further sorted data to Aviva for its\nPage 3 of 9\n\n\fverification and confirmation before printing the annual premium\nstatements.\n15.\n\nToh-Shi’s investigations revealed that the error which resulted in the data\nbreach incident was caused by an incomplete selection of the\npolicyholders’ account information in the raw data when Toh-Shi sorted\nthe data further. The annual premium statement can list up to two\nproducts depending on the policy that each policyholder is insured.\nHowever, due to the incomplete selection of the policyholders’ account\ninformation by the individual(s) carrying out further sorting, information\non the 2nd products were excluded and not sorted with the rest of the\ninformation which resulted in the information on the 2nd products being\nmismatched.\n\n16.\n\nWhile Toh-Shi had conducted QC Sample Checks, Toh-Shi admitted\nthat the QC Sample Checks failed to spot the error as the QC Sample\nChecks were verified against the erroneously sorted file instead of the\nsource data from Aviva.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n17.\n\nThe issues to be determined by the Commission are as follows:\n(a)\n\nwhat obligations did Aviva and Toh-Shi each owe under the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in respect of the\npersonal data of the Affected POGIS Policyholders;\n\n(b)\n\ndid Aviva comply with its obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA\nin respect of the data breach incident that happened; and\n\n(c)\n\ndid Toh-Shi comply with its obligation under Section 24 of the\nPDPA in respect of the data breach incident that happened.\n\n18.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect\npersonal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the\n“Protection Obligation”).\n\n19.\n\nUnder Section 2(1) of the PDPA, a “data intermediary” is an organisation\nwhich processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but\ndoes not include an employee of that organisation. Processing personal\ndata on behalf of another organisation refers to the carrying out of any\noperation or set of operations in relation to the personal data and\nincludes, but is not limited to, the organisation, adaptation or alternation;\nretrieval; and transmission of the said personal data.\n\n20.\n\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA confers an obligation on the data intermediary\nto comply with the Protection Obligation and the obligation to cease to\nretain personal data under Sections 24 and 25 of the PDPA respectively.\nPage 4 of 9\n\n\f21.\n\nFurther, Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall\nhave the same obligation under the PDPA in respect of the personal data\nprocessed on its behalf and for its purposes by a data intermediary as if\nthe personal data were processed by the organisation itself.\n\nRelationship between Aviva and Toh-Shi and their obligations under the PDPA\n22.\n\nHaving considered the facts and representations made by Aviva and\nToh-Shi, the Commission is satisfied that Toh-Shi was engaged to carry\nout activities of “processing” personal data on behalf of Aviva as defined\nin Section 2(1) of the PDPA and was therefore acting as a data\nintermediary of Aviva.\n\n23.\n\nFirst, while Toh-Shi is not expressly identified as a data intermediary of\nAviva in the Toh-Shi Service Agreement, the following extracts from the\nToh-Shi Service Agreement show that Aviva had envisaged that Toh-Shi\nwould engage in the “processing” of Aviva policyholder’s personal data\non its behalf:\n(i)\n\n“[Toh-Shi] shall comply with the [PDPA] and all subsidiary\nlegislation related thereto … with regard to any and all personal\ndata (as defined in the PDPA) that it collects and discloses\nto and/or receives from Aviva” [Emphasis added.]: Clause 17.1\nof the Toh-Shi Service Agreement as amended by the Addendum;\nand\n\n(ii)\n\n“for any personal data that it collects for or receives from\nAviva, [Toh-Shi] shall only process/use such personal data\nsolely\nfor\nAviva\nand\nin\naccordance\nwith\nthe\ninstructions/purposes of Aviva or as is necessary for Aviva to fulfil\nits obligations under the Data Protection Legislation and not\ndisclose such personal data to any other party or insurer …”\n[Emphasis added.]: Clause 17.2(c) of the Toh-Shi Service\nAgreement as amended by the Addendum.\n\n24.\n\nSecond, as noted at paragraph 13 above, Toh-Shi is responsible for (i)\npopulating in the relevant fields in the appropriate document templates\nwith the raw data received from Aviva, and (ii) printing, enveloping and\ndispatching by post of the finalised annual premium statements on behalf\nof Aviva.\n\n25.\n\nTherefore, the Commission finds that Toh-Shi is a data intermediary of\nAviva for the purposes of the PDPA. Pursuant to Section 4(2) and\nSection 4(3) of the PDPA, both Aviva and Toh-Shi have an obligation to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of\nthe Aviva policyholders.\n\nPage 5 of 9\n\n\fWhether Aviva has complied with its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA\n26.\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigation into the matter, it is satisfied\nthat Aviva has met its Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the\nPDPA as it has made reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in its possession or under its control.\n\n27.\n\nAs noted at paragraphs 6 and 7 above, the Toh-Shi Service Agreement\nrequired Toh-Shi to put in place adequate security policies, procedures\nand controls to protect the confidentiality and security of the Aviva\npolicyholders. The Commission is also satisfied that Aviva has\ndemonstrated that it has undertaken an appropriate level of due diligence\nto assure itself that its data intermediary, Toh-Shi, is capable of\ncomplying with the PDPA. Having done so, it was reasonable for Aviva\nto have expected Toh-Shi to take the necessary actions to protect the\nAffected POGIS Policyholders’ personal data. Additionally, Aviva had no\ndirect part to play in the actual breach itself, given that the data breach\nwas mainly caused by Toh-Shi’s staff failing to comply with its own\nsecurity measures and procedures, as will be elaborated upon below.\n\n28.\n\nTherefore, the Commission does not find Aviva to be in breach of Section\n24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether Toh-Shi has complied with its obligations under Section 24 of the\nPDPA\n29.\n\nHaving considered the facts and representations made by Toh-Shi and\nAviva, the Commission is of the view that Toh-Shi had failed to make\nreasonable security measures to protect the personal data it processed\non behalf of Aviva.\n\n30.\n\nAs stated at paragraph 7 above, the Commission notes that Toh-Shi did\nhave in place some security arrangements and procedures to safeguard\nthe personal data that Toh-Shi processes on behalf of Aviva.\n\n31.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that Toh-Shi had implemented security\narrangements and procedures, Toh-Shi does not dispute that the data\nbreach incident occurred as a result of:\n(a)\n\nan error that occurred when Toh-Shi carried out further sorting of\nthe data that had already been verified and confirmed by Aviva\n(viz sorting by postal code, overseas address and non-deliverable\nmails);\n\n(b)\n\nToh-Shi’s deviation from the SOP when it did not provide the UAT\nsamples of the data that had undergone further sorting to Aviva\nfor verification and confirmation before printing the finalised\nannual premium statements; and\nPage 6 of 9\n\n\f(c)\n\n32.\n\nmistakes by the individual(s) conducting the QC Sample Checks\nin failing to verify the data that had undergone further sorting\nagainst the source data file provided by Aviva (but against the\nerroneously sorted file prepared by Toh-Shi).\n\nToh-Shi also represented that it has taken the following remedial steps\nfollowing the data breach incident:\n(a)\n\nremind and re-train its staff to be more vigilant in processing the\ncustomer’s data;\n\n(b)\n\nensure that Toh-Shi staff follow the customer’s SOPs including\nany new SOPs to enhance data processing and not deviate from\nit unless it has been approved by the customer; and\n\n(c)\n\nremind Toh-Shi staff that all final products must be approved by\nthe customer before mailing out and not to alter the data after TohShi has obtained the customer’s confirmation.\n\n33.\n\nNotwithstanding the security measures and procedures implemented by\nToh-Shi to protect the very sensitive financial data it processed on behalf\nof Aviva, the Commission notes that Toh-Shi itself admitted that the data\nbreach incident was caused by errors that occurred because its staff had\nfailed to comply with the company’s own security measures and\nprocedures.\n\n34.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, the error in the further sorting process could\nhave been avoided and the data breach incident could have been\nprevented if:\n(a)\n\nToh-Shi had provided samples to Aviva for further verification\nafter sorting; and\n\n(b)\n\nToh-Shi had conducted its QC Sample Checks on the further\nsorted data against the original source data from Aviva.\n\n35.\n\nAs such, in view of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\nCommission is not satisfied that Toh-Shi has made reasonable security\narrangements to prevent authorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks in compliance with the\nProtection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN AGAINST TOH-SHI\n\n36.\n\nHaving completed its investigation and assessment of this matter, the\nCommission finds that Aviva is not in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\nHowever, the Commission finds that Toh-Shi is in breach of Section 24\nof the PDPA.\n\nPage 7 of 9\n\n\f37.\n\nIn exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission pursuant to\nSection 29 of the PDPA, the Commission directs that a financial penalty\nof S$25,000 be imposed on Toh-Shi.\n\n38.\n\nIn assessing the breach and the directions to be imposed, the\nCommission took into account the following factors:\n(a)\n\na large number of individuals (totalling 8,022, including the\nAffected POGIS Policyholders’ dependants whose personal data\nwere disclosed in the data breach incident) were affected by the\ndata breach;\n\n(b)\n\nthe personal data disclosed in the data breach, namely, the\nnames of the policyholder’s dependants or beneficiaries, the sum\ninsured under the insurance policy, the premium amount and type\nof coverage, are of a sensitive nature, not merely from a financial\nperspective but can also be socially embarrassing;\n\n(c)\n\nthis is the second time in a short span of approximately one year\nthat Toh-Shi has committed a breach of Section 24 of the PDPA\nand both of the data breach incidents involve similar fact patterns\nand causes:\n(i)\n\nin Toh-Shi’s first breach of Section 24 of the PDPA1 in June\n2015, erroneous account statements were sent to 195\nCentral Depository (“CDP”) account holders (“First\nBreach”). The Commission found that the cause of the\nFirst Breach was due to errors made by Toh-Shi staff\nduring the printing process, such as a misalignment of the\npages during the sorting process which led to errors in the\ncompilation of multi-page CDP statement. A financial\npenalty of S$5,000 was imposed on Toh-Shi in the First\nBreach; and\n\n(ii)\n\ndespite the fact that Toh-Shi had taken steps to improve on\nthe security of its system following the First Breach, a\nsimilar error in the sorting process has recurred in the\npresent case within a year of the First Breach, which\nsuggests that there is still a weakness in Toh-Shi’s internal\nwork processes;\n\n(d)\n\nthe data breach could have been avoided if Toh-Shi had followed\nthe established SOP. Since Toh-Shi had performed additional\nsorting, the QC Sample Checks ought to have been carried out\nagain;\n\n(e)\n\nprompt notice was given to the Commission of the data breach\nincident; and\n\n1 The Commission’s decision against Central Depository (Pte) Limited and Toh-Shi Printing Singapore\n\nPte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 11.\n\nPage 8 of 9\n\n\f(f)\n\n39.\n\nToh-Shi was cooperative during the investigation and took prompt\nremedial and preventive actions.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any\ninstance of non-compliance under the PDPA, and it urges organisations\nto take the necessary action to ensure that they comply with their\nobligations under the PDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take\nthe appropriate enforcement action against the organisation(s)\naccordingly.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 9 of 9\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $500 was imposed on a registered salesperson of a property firm for disclosing personal data of two of his landlord’s tenants to a third party tenant without consent.","tags":["Consent","Financial Penalty","Others","ESTATE","Property","SALESPERSON"],"date":"2016-08-12","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---rsp-justin-chua-(120816).pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"Breach of Consent Obligation by a Registered Salesperson","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/08/breach-of-consent-obligation-by-a-registered-salesperson","timestamp":"2016-08-12","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1411-A247\n\nCHUA YONG BOON JUSTIN [NRIC NO. REDACTED]\n... Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 13\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n12 August 2016\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nOn 15 November 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received an email from [Redacted] (Replaced with Mr K) (the\n“Complainant”) regarding the unauthorised disclosure of personal data of his\nwife and himself by the property agent of his landlord following a dispute between\nthe Complainant, the Complainant’s wife, and another tenant, [Redacted]\n(Replaced with Ms C). The Commission proceeded to investigate into the alleged\nbreach of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Its findings into the\nmatter are set out below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n2.\n\nThe Complainant, his wife, and Ms C are tenants of a landed property. For the\npurposes of entering into the tenancy with the landlord, the Complainant and his\nwife had previously provided their names and NRIC numbers (amongst other\npersonal data) to the registered salesperson1 (commonly known as a “property\nagent”) of the landlord, Mr Chua Yong Boon Justin (the “Respondent”). The\nRespondent was registered as a salesperson with Global Property Strategic\nAlliance Pte Ltd (“GPS”). The Respondent’s engagement as a salesperson with\nGPS was governed by a “Salesperson Agreement” dated 31 October 2011.\n\n3.\n\nIn or around November 2014, a dispute arose between Ms C and the\nComplainant and his wife over the usage of common space within the rented\npremises, and an argument had apparently ensued between the parties. The\nRespondent was not present during the argument. However, Ms C had informed\nhim of the argument, and also requested the Respondent to provide her with the\n\n1 Under the Estate Agents Act (Cap. 95A) (“EAA”)\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fnames and NRIC numbers of the Complainant and his wife so as to hold the\nComplainant “responsible” in the event that the Complainant had publicised the\nphotos that were apparently taken in the course of the argument. The\nRespondent took this to mean that Ms C was prepared to lodge a police report\nover the matter.\n4.\n\nThe Respondent proceeded to provide Ms C with their full names and NRIC\nnumbers.\n\n5.\n\nAccording to the Complainant, the information was used to send an email to his\nemployer casting allegations against him. There was, however, no proof or\nevidence of the email that was sent or the impact that the email had on his\nemployment.\n\n6.\n\nIn response to the Commission’s queries on this matter, the Respondent referred\nto Sections 2 and 4(1) of the PDPA, and took the view that he was acting in a\n“personal or domestic capacity” in the matter, since his actions were unrelated to\nreal estate matters. He also took the view that his “intervention” in the matter was\njustified in the circumstances.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n7.\n\nThe main issues that have arisen in this case are as follow:\n(a)\n\nWas the Respondent acting in a personal or domestic capacity under\nSection 2 of the PDPA?\n\n(b)\n\nDid the Respondent comply with his obligations under the PDPA in respect\nof the disclosure that was made by obtaining consent from the Complainant\nand his wife for the disclosure?\n\n(c)\n\nIf not, are any of the exceptions to the PDPA applicable in respect of the\ndisclosure made by the Respondent?\n\nIssue (a): Was the Respondent acting in a personal or domestic capacity under\nSection 2 of the PDPA?\n8.\n\nSection 4(1)(a) of the PDPA carves out an exception in the PDPA for Parts III to\nVI of the PDPA (i.e. an exception to the consent obligation or the notification\nobligation or the purpose limitation obligation). Section 4(1)(a) provides that Parts\nIII to VI of the PDPA shall not impose any obligation on an individual acting in a\npersonal or domestic capacity. The word “domestic” is defined in the PDPA to\nmean “related to home or family”.\n\n9.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Respondent claimed that he was acting in a personal\nor domestic capacity when he disclosed the personal data of the Complainant\nand his wife. If that were the case, he would not need to comply with the relevant\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\fprovisions of the PDPA (especially the consent and notification provisions 2) in\nmaking the disclosure. It follows that he would not be liable under the PDPA for\nany omission to carry out any steps or take any action as provided for under\nParts III to VI of the PDPA, including, obtaining consent from the individual for\nthe disclosure. However, the Commission is of the position that the Respondent\ncannot rely on Section 4(1)(a) of the PDPA in this case.\n10. In considering the capacity of the Respondent when he disclosed the personal\ndata of the Complainant and his wife, it would be relevant to look at the nature of\nthe relationship between the Respondent, GPS and the landlord, and the context\nin which the Respondent had dealt with the personal data in question.\n11. Under the Salesperson Agreement, it was expressly provided that the\nRespondent was not a “servant, agent or employee” of GPS. As stated by GPS\nto the Commission, the Respondent was the one who “represented” the landlord\nin this case in respect of the transaction for the tenancy. In the Commission’s\nview, the Respondent was carrying out his real estate agency work as a business\nof his own. Therefore, in dealing with the personal data that the Respondent had\ncollected in the course of his real estate agency work, the Respondent was an\n“organisation” under the PDPA, separate from the company which had engaged\nhim (ie GPS).\n12. Since the personal data of the Complainant and his wife were collected by the\nRespondent in the course of his real estate agency work, it was for the\nRespondent’s “business”3 purposes, and not for his personal or domestic\npurposes. The Respondent therefore was obliged to comply with the provisions\nin the PDPA in respect of such personal data that was collected in the course of\nhis work.\n13. Accordingly, even if the Respondent had intended to act in a personal or\ndomestic capacity in relation to the dispute that took place between Ms C and\nthe Complainant and his wife, he remains obliged to comply with his obligations\nunder the PDPA. The Respondent cannot take personal data that he had been\nprovided with in his commercial capacity as a registered salesperson and\ndisclose it in a personal or domestic capacity. In other words, the Respondent\nwas not permitted to disclose the personal data as and when he chooses for the\nreason that he was doing it for “personal or domestic purposes”. He was, and\nremains, obliged to keep that personal data protected pursuant to the provisions\nof the PDPA.\n\n2\n\nUnder Sections 13, 14, 15 and 20 of the PDPA\n\n3 As defined in the PDPA\n\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\fIssues (b) and (c): Has the Respondent complied with the consent obligation under\nthe PDPA or does the disclosure fall under any exceptions under the PDPA?\n14. Given, as explained above, that the PDPA continues to apply to the personal\ndata of the Complainant and his wife which was collected by the Respondent,\nthe Respondent is obliged to obtain their consent in order to disclose the personal\ndata to a third party, under Section 13 of the PDPA, unless an exception applies\nunder the PDPA.\n15. Section 13 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall not, on or after the\nappointed day, collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual unless\n(a) the individual gives, or is deemed to have given, his consent under the PDPA\nto the collection, use or disclosure, as the case may be; or (b) the collection, use\nor disclosure, as the case may be, without the consent of the individual is\nrequired or authorised under the PDPA or any other written law. Relatedly,\nSection 14 provides that an individual has not given consent under the PDPA for\nthe collection, use or disclosure of personal data about the individual by an\norganisation for a purpose unless (a) the individual has been provided with the\ninformation required under Section 20 of the PDPA; and (b) the individual\nprovided his consent for that purpose in accordance with the PDPA.\n16. Based on the facts of this case, the Commission notes that the Respondent had\nnot obtained the consent of the Complainant and his wife for the disclosure of\ntheir personal data to Ms C. Accordingly, the Respondent is in breach of Section\n13 of the PDPA.\n17. Additionally, in the Commission’s assessment, none of the exceptions under the\nPDPA would apply to allow the Respondent to disclose the personal data of the\nComplainant and his wife without consent.\nD.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n18. Given the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 13 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered under\nSection 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it deems fit to\nensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Respondent\nto pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million as the\nCommission thinks fit.\n19. In this case, the Commission has considered the following pertinent factors:\n(a)\n\nRegistered salespersons (as defined under the EAA) are likely to collect,\nreceive, or obtain a considerable amount of personal data of various\nindividuals (including the personal data of the landlord and the tenants) in\nthe course of their work. It is imperative that these salespersons ensure that\nthe personal data in their possession or control are sufficiently protected,\nand that they keenly observe the provisions under the PDPA in dealing with\nthe personal data;\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn this case, the personal data of two persons were disclosed to a third party\nwithout consent or authority; and\n\n(c)\n\nIt would appear, in this case, that just by the Respondent hearing Ms C’s\nversion of events and the accusations made against the Complainant and\nhis wife, the Respondent had, without proper consideration for the personal\ndata which the Respondent was obliged to protect, released the personal\ndata to Ms C without consent. Given the circumstances in which the\npersonal data was disclosed, the Respondent must have known or would\nhave been aware that there would be repercussions that follow from the\ndisclosure, and that the Complainant and his wife would be affected from\nthe disclosure, now that they can be specifically identified from the\ninformation provided. However, the Respondent still proceeded to disclose\nthe personal data of the Complainant and his wife without obtaining\nconsent.\n\n20. Given the considerations set out above, the Commission has decided to impose\na financial penalty against the Respondent.\n21. On the quantum of the financial penalty, the Commission notes that the\nRespondent was carrying on his trade independently and, based on what was\nfound above, had failed to fulfil his responsibility of ensuring compliance of the\nPDPA. However, the Commission also considered that the amount should be set\nat the lower end of the spectrum given that:\n(a)\n\nThe disclosure had been made to a single individual and it appears to be\ndone on a one-off instance; and\n\n(b)\n\nThere was no proof of the impact on the Complainant’s employment or the\nrisk of damage or loss in relation to the personal data that was disclosed.\n\n22. In view of the above, a financial penalty of $500 is imposed on the Respondent.\n23. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The\nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against\nthe organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Spear Security Force for failing to put in place any arrangement to prevent unauthorised access to personal data in the visitor log book managed for a condominium.

Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 12\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n25 July 2016\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) had received a\ncomplaint from Mr L [Redacted] on 24 December 2015 in relation to the lapses\nby Respondent’s employees in safeguarding the visitor log book of Prive\nExecutive Condominium (the “Condominium”), which contained personal data\nof the visitors. In this regard, Mr L claimed that the Respondent was in breach of\nthe Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No. 26 of 2012) (“PDPA”).\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n2.\n\nThe Complainant was a resident of the Condominium. The Respondent was\nappointed by the MCST of the Condominium to provide security services.\n\n3.\n\nAccording to the Complainant, on several occasions between November 2015\nand December 2015, he had observed that the security guards under the\nRespondent’s supervision had left the log book open and unattended on a table\nnear the guard post at the Condominium’s entrance.\n\n4.\n\nThe Complainant further mentioned that he highlighted his concerns to both the\nCondominium’s Managing Agent and the Respondent but he had not received\nan adequate response.\n\n5.\n\nIn its response to the Commission’s investigations into the matter, the\nRespondent mentioned that it was aware that the visitor log book had been left\nunattended by its security guards on multiple occasions from the feedback it\nreceived, and had taken certain remedial actions since then. These are set out\nin paragraph 7 below.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent further mentioned that the contents of the log book included the\nvisitor’s name, mobile phone number, time of entry, the unit number visited and\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\fthe purpose of the visit. The purpose for the collection of the visitors’ details was\nto ensure that (i) there is no unauthorised entry or trespassing of the premises;\nand (ii) the security guards is able to contact a visitor in the event the visitor has\nparked in a car park lot that was not allocated to visitors.\n7.\n\nFollowing the complaint(s) that was made to the Respondent, the Commission\nunderstands that the Respondent had taken remedial actions as follows:\na.\n\nThe Respondent had briefed its security guards on the PDPA and put in\nplace certain protective measures such as keeping the log book in the\nguard post at all times and performing visitor registration there.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent had also instructed its security guards not to disclose the\nvisitor details to any third parties besides the Managing Agent and the\nOperations Manager of the Condominium.\n\nc.\n\nThe security guards were also required to surrender the log book before\ngoing for breaks; handing and taking over of the log book between the\nsecurity supervisors at shift changeovers; and keeping the log book within\nsight of the security camera.\n\nd.\n\nThe Respondent also required security supervisors on duty to remind the\nsecurity guards prior to every shift on the confidentiality of the visitors’\npersonal data in the log book.\n\ne.\n\nAction may also be taken against the security guards for non-compliance\nwith the Respondent’s instructions above – this ranges from progressive\nwarnings to the dismissal of employment.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n8.\n\nThere is no dispute that the log book contains personal data1 of the visitors who\nhad visited the Condominimum.\n\n9.\n\nUnder Section 24 of the PDPA, the Respondent is obliged to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, in respect of the\npersonal data contained in the Condominium log book.\n\n10. The Respondent’s past practice that was the subject of this complaint was the\nplacement of the visitor log book at a location that was not sufficiently\nsafeguarded from prying eyes nor subject to close supervision by the guards.\nDuring the Commission’s investigation, the Respondent has not shown that it\nhad put in place any arrangement, or taken any steps, to prevent unauthorised\naccess to the contents in the log book comprising of personal data. On the\ncontrary, given that the log book was left open and unattended on multiple\noccasions, this allowed for, and increased the opportunities for, unauthorised\naccess to the personal data contained within the log book. The Respondent had\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\fonly taken action to secure the log book only after it received complaint(s) and/or\nfeedback.\n11. Given the lack of any reasonable security arrangement that was in place to\nprevent the authorised access to the personal data in the log book, the\nCommission finds that the Respondent is in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA in\nrespect of the past practice.\nD.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n12. Given the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered under\nSection 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it deems fit to\nensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Respondent\nto pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million as the\nCommission thinks fit.\n13. In considering whether a direction should be made or given to the Respondent\nin this case, the Commission notes that: (a) while there was a risk of data\nleakage, there was no evidence suggesting that the visitors’ personal data had\nactually been exposed to unauthorised third parties due to the lapses by the\nRespondent; and (b) the Respondent had taken reasonably adequate steps to\nremedy the lapses, as set out above at paragraph 7, during the course of the\ninvestigations.\n14. In view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to impose a\nfinancial penalty against the Respondent. Instead, it has decided to issue a\nWarning against the Respondent for the breach of its obligations under Section\n24 of the PDPA.\n15. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA.

It was reported that six CDP\naccount holders had received CDP account (“CDP account”) statements for the\nmonth of May 2015 containing account information of other account holders. On\nthe same day, Singapore Exchange Limited (“SGX”) issued a news release to\ninform and apologise for the incident.\n\n2.\n\nFollowing the reporting of the incident, the Commission undertook an\ninvestigation into the matter. The Commission had determined that the two\nrespondents in the matter were CDP and Toh-Shi Printing Singapore Pte Ltd\n(“Toh-Shi”) respectively. The Commission’s decision on the matter and grounds\nof decision are set out below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nCDP is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SGX, and provides clearing, settlement and\ndepository facilities in the Singapore securities market. Toh-Shi is the external\nvendor of CDP in charge of printing the CDP account statements for CDP.\n\n4.\n\nThe printing services provided by Toh-Shi are governed by a contract between\nparties dated 1 March 2013 (the Document Management Service Agreement\n(“DMSA”)). The DMSA required, amongst other things, for Toh-Shi to protect the\nconfidentiality of the CDP account holders’ personal data and to put in place the\nnecessary measures to protect the data.\n\n\f5.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the data breach and Toh-Shi alerting the Commission\nof the breach, on 15 June 2015, CDP reissued the corrected CDP statements for\nthe month of May 2015 with an apology letter to the 195 affected account holders.\nOn 17 June 2015, SGX started to contact the affected account holders to assist\nwith any queries or concerns, and to give them an option to change their CDP\naccount numbers. From what the Commission understands, none of the account\nholders requested to change their account numbers.\n\n6.\n\nOn 26 June 2015, SGX conducted its own internal investigation into the incident\nand provided the SGX Regulatory Breach Report to the Commission.\n\n7.\n\nBased on the investigations that were carried out, SGX found that the data\nbreach incident occurred due to a misalignment of the pages during the sorting\nprocess which led to errors in the compilation of multi-page CDP statements such\nthat the first page of the statement of one account holder was compiled with the\nsecond and subsequent pages of another account holder. The erroneous pages\nwere initially spotted and marked out by Toh-Shi’s Print System Operator\n(“PSO”). He subsequently informed the Fan Fold Operator (“FFO”) of the\nmarkings; who was to discard the erroneous statements and to replace them with\nthe correct statements from the printed roll. However, the FFO had mistakenly\ndiscarded the correct statements and despatched the erroneous statements for\npostage instead. This led to the erroneous statements being mailed to the\naccount holders.\n\n8.\n\nAccording to SGX’s own internal investigation, 92 out of the 195 affected CDP\naccount holders had received the second page belonging to another account\nholder containing one or more of the following information:\n(a)\n\naccount information (i.e. name, address and account number);\n\n(b)\n\nsecurities holdings;\n\n(c)\n\ntransaction summary; and/or\n\n(d)\n\npayment summary.\n\n9.\n\nThe remaining 103 affected CDP account holders received the second page\ncontaining account information of another account holder and general CDP\ninformation, with no details on securities holdings, transactions or payments.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n10. The issues in this case to be determined are as follow:\n(a)\n\nWhat obligations did CDP and Toh-Shi each owe under the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in respect of the personal data of the CDP\naccount holders?\n\n\f(b)\n\nDid CDP comply with its obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA in respect\nof the data breach incident that happened?\n\n(c)\n\nDid Toh-Shi comply with its obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA in\nrespect of the data breach incident that happened?\n\nRelevant provisions under the PDPA\n11. Section 24 of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall protect personal data\nin its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n12. Section 4(2) of the PDPA provides that Parts III to VI (except for Section 24 of\nthe PDPA (protection of personal data) and Section 25 of the PDPA (retention of\npersonal data)) shall not impose any obligation on a data intermediary in respect\nof its processing of personal data on behalf of and for the purposes of another\norganisation pursuant to a contract which is evidenced or made in writing.\n13. Section 4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall have the same\nobligation under the PDPA in respect of the personal data processed on its behalf\nand for its purposes by a data intermediary as if the personal data were\nprocessed by the organisation itself.\nThe relationship between CDP and Toh-Shi and their respective obligations under the\nPDPA\n14. The Commission notes that Toh-Shi is responsible for printing the account\nstatements of CDP’s account holders (containing their personal data) for CDP.\nThis involves CDP providing to Toh-Shi personal particulars and stock holdings\nof account holders and statement document templates. Toh-Shi has to manage\nthe entire process of merging account statement data with the correct statement\ndocument template and printing the final account statement. In this regard, TohShi was carrying out activities of “processing” the personal data on behalf of\nCDP, as defined by the PDPA. Accordingly, the Commission finds that Toh-Shi\nwas acting as a data intermediary for CDP.\n15. Pursuant to Section 4(2) and 4(3) of the PDPA, both CDP and Toh-Shi are\nobliged under Section 24 of the PDPA to ensure that there are reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data of CDP’s account holders.\n16. The Commission now turns to its assessment of whether CDP and Toh-Shi have\ncomplied with their obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA respectively.\nWhether CDP has complied with its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA\n17. Based on the Commission’s investigation into the matter, it is satisfied that CDP\nhad complied with its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA. In particular, the\nCommission notes that CDP had in place an agreement obliging Toh-Shi to take\n\n\fthe necessary actions and precautionary measures to protect the CDP account\nholders’ personal data during the printing process. On CDP’s part, it was noted\nthat CDP had in place processes for the secure transfer of personal data between\nCDP and Toh-Shi: CDP ensured that the files containing the CDP account\nholders’ personal data were sent to Toh-Shi via a secured format, i.e. Secured\nFile Transfer Protocol.\n18. Accordingly, the Commission does not find CDP in breach of Section 24 of the\nPDPA.\nWhether Toh-Shi has complied with its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA\n19. The Commission notes that the cause of the breach in this case was due to\nerror(s) made by the staff of Toh-Shi during the printing process.\n20. In the Commission’s assessment, the breach occurred as a result of inadequate\noperational processes in place to ensure that the letters and personal data were\nsent to the correct recipient. The Commission notes that in this case the PSO\nhad manually checked that the correct CDP statements were printed and in the\nevent that there was any error, the PSO would mark out the erroneous ones and\nprovide the FFO with both the erroneous and correct CDP statements for sorting.\nAs only one person was involved in the sorting, it resulted in the FFO discarding\nthe correct CDP statements instead of the erroneous one. In the Commission’s\nview, the measures to sort manually by one person were insufficient given the\nnature of the personal data involved. The human error in this case could have\nbeen avoided by putting in place processes or technology solutions that can\nminimise human error.\n21. The Commission notes that following the data breach incident, Toh-Shi had\ntaken steps to improve on the security of the system by implementing (a)\nadditional layers of checks by a Supervisor, Quality Controller and the Manager;\n(b) barcode system; and (iii) a technology solution to automate the reconciliation\nof the printed statements to prevent repeat of the incident. In the Commission’s\nview, if there were a better system of checks in place, the data breach incident\ncould have been prevented.\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN AGAINST TOH-SHI\n\n22. Given the above, the Commission finds that CDP is not in breach of Section 24\nof the PDPA. However, the Commission finds that Toh-Shi is in breach of Section\n24 of the PDPA.\n23. In exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Section 29\nof the PDPA, the Commission directs that a financial penalty of $5,000 to be\nmeted out against Toh-Shi.\n24. In coming to the direction to be given, the Commission has taken into the overall\ncircumstances of the matter, namely:\n\n\f(a)\n\nA considerable number of individuals (totalling 195) were affected by the\ndata breach.\n\n(b)\n\nSensitive financial personal data was involved.\n\n(c)\n\nThe data breach incident could have been avoided if Toh-Shi had put a\nbetter system of checks in place.\n\n(d)\n\nPrompt notice was given to the Commission of the data breach incident and\nthat Toh-Shi was cooperative during investigation.\n\n(e)\n\nToh-Shi took prompt remedial and preventive actions following the data\nbreach incident.\n\n25. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance under the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the\nnecessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Not in Breach"},{"description":"A warning was issued to AIA Singapore for failing to ensure that its disclosure of personal data belonging to an insurance policy holder to a third-party was for a reasonable purpose.","tags":["Purpose Limitation","Warning","Finance and Insurance","AIA","Insurance"],"date":"2016-06-24","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---aia-singapore-(220616).pdf","nature":"Purpose Limitation","title":"Breach of Purpose Limitation Obligation by AIA Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/06/breach-of-purpose-limitation-obligation-by-aia-singapore","timestamp":"2016-06-24","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1509-A533\nAIA Singapore Private Limited (U.E.N. 201106386R)\n...

The Complainant holds an insurance\npolicy with the Respondent. Previously, in signing up for the insurance policy with\nthe Respondent, the Complainant provided information of himself in the\napplication form (“Application Form”), including, his name, address, NRIC\nnumber, contact details, occupation and various other personal particulars\n(“Personal Particulars”).\n\n4.\n\nIn the declaration portion of the Application Form, the Complainant agreed,\namongst other things, to the Respondent: (a) releasing to any medical source or\ninsurance office any relevant information concerning the Complainant at any\ntime; and (b) using and/or disclosing any information to independent third parties\nwith regard to any matters pertaining to the application/policy.\n\n5.\n\nOn 24 May 2015, the Complainant made a claim for insurance under the policy\nwith the Respondent. In raising the claim, the Complainant had to fill in an\nAccident & Hospitalisation Claim Form (“A&H Form”) to be submitted to the\nRespondent. In the A&H Form, the Complainant had to provide, amongst other\nPage 1 of 7\n\n\fthings, his policy details, his Personal Particulars, and his bank account\ninformation “for direct crediting of claims”. For the bank account information, the\nComplainant provided the name of the bank, branch of the bank, the bank\naccount number and the account holder’s name (“Bank Account Details”).\n6.\n\nIn the authorisation and declaration portion of the A&H Form, the Complainant\nhad agreed, amongst other things, to the Respondent disclosing the personal\ndata of the Complainant for purposes described in the “AIA Personal Data\nPolicy”.\n\n7.\n\nThe AIA Personal Data Policy (“Policy”) produced by the Respondent sets out\nthe following scope of consent:\n(a)\n\nThe persons who may be provided with the insured’s personal data.\nSpecifically, it states that the Respondent may disclose personal data to\n“medical sources and insurance organisations”.\n\n(b)\n\nThe types of personal data that may be collected, used or disclosed,\nincluding the insured’s “personal particulars such as NRIC numbers,\npassport numbers, contact details, addresses, date of birth, occupation,\nphotographs and marital status” or “your financial information such as\nincome, bank account numbers, CPF statements, bank statements…”.\n\n(c)\n\nThe purposes for which personal data may be collected, used or disclosed.\nIn particular, it lists the purpose to “assess, process, administer, implement\nand effect the requests or transactions” or “assessing, processing, settling,\nauthenticating and investigating claims”.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to the Complainant’s claim, the Respondent had communicated with\nthe Complainant’s chiropractor, CFG, to obtain further medical information about\nthe Complainant. In its communication, the Respondent disclosed pages 1 and\n3 of the A&H Form to CFG, which disclosed, amongst other things, the\nComplainant’s Bank Account Details.\n\n9.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there were a number of reasons why it was\npermitted or authorised to disclose the personal data of the Complainant to CFG.\nBriefly, the Respondent claimed that:\n(a)\n\nThe Complainant had provided consent for his personal data to be\ndisclosed to CFG, pursuant to, the A&H Form read with the AIA Personal\nData Policy.\n\n(b)\n\nThe disclosure was necessary to; (i) facilitate the speedy processing of the\nclaim; (ii) assure CFG that the Respondent’s request for disclosure is based\non a claim from CFG’s patient / the Respondent’s policy holder, and (iii)\nassure CFG that all required consents had been obtained to allow CFG to\nrespond to the Respondent’s requested information.\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\fC.\n\n(c)\n\nCFG would be obliged to handle the information that the Respondent had\nprovided in a manner that ensures its confidentiality.\n\n(d)\n\nThe disclosure was consistent with Section 20(2) of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) which states that an organisation, on or\nbefore disclosing personal data about an individual from another\norganisation without the consent of the individual, shall provide that other\norganisation with sufficient information regarding the purpose of the\ncollection to allow that other organisation to determine whether the\ndisclosure would be in accordance with the PDPA.\n\n(e)\n\nThe Complainant was, according to the Respondent, a former Financial\nServices Consultant “appointed by” the Respondent. He is therefore aware\nof the claims processing procedure, and would be, at the very least,\ndeemed to have consented to the Respondent’s collection, use and\ndisclosure of his personal data for claims processing by reason of his former\nappointment or engagement.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\n\n10. The issues in this case to be determined are as follow:\n(a)\n\nPursuant to Sections 13, 14, 15 and 20 of the PDPA, did the Respondent\nprovide the necessary notification and obtain the necessary consent from\nthe Complainant before disclosing pages 1 and 3 of the A&H Form to CFG,\nin particular the Complainant’s Bank Account Details?\n\n(b)\n\nIf not, is the Respondent able to rely on any of the exceptions under the\nPDPA for the disclosure?\n\n(c)\n\nFurther, can the disclosure of the Bank Account Details contained on page\n1 of the A&H Form to CFG be said to be “for purposes that a reasonable\nperson would consider appropriate in the circumstances” under Section\n18(a) of the PDPA?\n\nIssue a: Notifying the Complainant and obtaining consent for the disclosure of A&H\nForm\n11. The authorisation and declaration sections of the Application Form, A&H Form\nand the Policy are broadly worded and a plain reading leads to the conclusion\nthat the consent obtained by the Respondent under the Application Form, A&H\nForm and Policy is wide enough to cover the disclosure made by the Respondent\nof pages 1 and 3 of the A&H Form to CFG. On this assessment of the relevant\nclauses produced before the Commission, the Commission finds that\nRespondent had the Complainant’s consent, for the purposes of the PDPA, to\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\fdisclose the majority of personal data contained in pages 1 and 3 of the A&H\nForm to CFG, save for the Bank Account Details.\n12. With regards to the Bank Account Details, the section of the A&H Form in which\nthe Bank Account Details were to be entered expressly states that the Bank\nAccount Details was for “direct crediting of claims”. This purpose is at odds with\nand constrains the otherwise broad consent clauses in the Application Form,\nA&H Form and the Policy. Specific to this case, it does not extend to permitting\nthe Respondent to disclose the Bank Account Details for the purpose of obtaining\na medical report from third parties. This casts doubts as to whether the\nComplainant had in fact given his consent for such disclosure. On balance, the\nCommission is unable to draw a firm conclusion on whether the phrase “direct\ncrediting of claims” was intended to and did in fact constrain the broad consent\npreviously obtained by the Respondent or that the Complainant had effectively\ngiven his consent for the disclosure of his Bank Account Details for the purpose\nof obtaining a medical report. In the final analysis, the Commission thought it was\nprudent to decline making a finding of breach on the issue in the absence of clear\nsupporting evidence. Further, the Commission’s findings in respect of the issue\nof whether the disclosure of Bank Account Details accords with Section 18 of the\nPDPA, as will be examined below, makes it unnecessary to do so.\n13. With regard to whether the Respondent had given sufficient notification to the\nComplainant for disclosing the Complainant’s personal data for purposes of the\nComplainant’s claim, the Commission is of the view that the A&H Form (and\nPolicy) can possibly operate as prior notification for such a disclosure to be made.\n14. In the premises, the Commission finds that Respondent has complied with its\nobligations under Sections 13, 14, 15 and 20 of the PDPA to provide the\nnecessary notifications and obtain the necessary consent for the disclosure of in\nrespect of the personal data (save for the Bank Account Details) found at pages\n1 and 3 of the A&H Form to CFG. In relation to the Bank Account Details, on a\nbalance, the Commission finds that there is insufficient evidence to show that the\nRespondent had failed to comply with its obligations under Sections 13, 14, 15\nand 20 of the PDPA.\nIssue b: Applicable exceptions and Section 19 of the PDPA\n15. For completeness, the Commission also considered the applicability of Section\n19 of the PDPA. Section 19 of the PDPA provides that an organisation may use\npersonal data about an individual collected before the appointed day (ie 2 July\n2014) for the purposes for which the personal data was collected unless (a)\nconsent for such use is withdrawn in accordance with Section 16 of the PDPA;\nor (b) the individual, whether before, on or after the appointed day, has otherwise\nindicated to the organisation that he does not consent to the use of the personal\ndata.\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f16. In this case, the Complainant had provided Personal Particulars in the\nApplication Form to sign up for the insurance policy with the Respondent in 2011,\nand agreed to the terms set out in the Application Form, which provided for the\nRespondent to use the Complainant’s personal data for a variety of purposes\nmentioned at paragraph 4 above. Since the personal Particulars were provided\nbefore the Appointed Day, pursuant to Section 19 of the PDPA, the Respondent\nwas allowed to continue using them based on the terms of the Application Form,\nwhich includes disclosing the data to CFG for the purposes of obtaining a medical\nreport for the insurance claim.\n17. However, Section 19 of the PDPA does not apply to the Bank Account Details as\nthey were not collected through the Application Form but through the A&H Form\non 24 May 2015.\nIssue c: Disclosure of personal data was not for purposes reasonable or appropriate\nin the circumstances\n18. Section 18 of the PDPA provides, inter alia, that an organisation may collect, use\nor disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable\nperson would consider appropriate in the circumstances. It should be borne in\nmind that Section 18 of the PDPA is an independent obligation that organisations\nwould need to comply with even if it had obtained the consent from the relevant\nindividual for the collection, use or disclosure of his or her personal data. This is\nan important aspect of the PDPA as it is effective in addressing excesses in the\ncollection, use or disclosure of personal data under a broadly-worded consent\nclause, like in the present case.\n19. In this case, the Bank Account Details of the Complainant were found at page 1\nof the A&H Form that was disclosed to CFG. In the Commission’s view, the\ndisclosure of the Bank Account details by the Respondent was not for “a purpose\nthat a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances” under\nSection 18 of the PDPA. The disclosure of the Bank Account Details was not\nrelevant or necessary to the request for medical report from CFG. Of the reasons\nprovided by the Respondent (and set out in paragraph 9), the most pertinent one\nis that of facilitating speedy processing of the claim. It is not obvious how Bank\nAccount Details are relevant to CFG’s role in the claim process, nor is it obvious\nhow Bank Account Details will assist CFG in turning out its medical report sooner.\nIn any event, Bank Account Details are necessary for the purpose of effecting\npayment, which is a function that is logically not within CFG’s domain but which\nfalls on the Respondent. Ultimately, the Respondent has not provided any\nreasonable explanation for why the disclosure of the Bank Account Details\nneeded to be made in the circumstances. In the Commission’s view, it was\nunsatisfactory for the Respondent to disclose sensitive personal data of a\nfinancial nature to a third party without good reason or purpose.\n20. As discussed above, although the authorisation and declaration portion of the\nA&H Form provides for a broad-range of actions that may be taken in respect of\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fthe personal data provided, the section of the A&H Form in which the Bank\nAccount Details were to be entered states that the Bank Account Details were\nfor “direct crediting of claims”. The disclosure made therefore was for a purpose\nwholly different from this section of the form. Neither can it be said that the\npurpose of obtaining a medical report is one that is reasonably connected to this\nantecedent purpose. In the overall circumstances, it was not appropriate for the\nRespondent to be disclosing the Bank Account Details for a purpose that has no\nreasonable connection to that which was stated on the A&H Form.\n21. In the premises, the Commission finds that the Respondent was in breach of\nSection 18 of the PDPA for the disclosure of the Complainant’s Bank Account\nDetails to CFG.\n22. In respect of the other personal data that was provided in pages 1 and 3 of the\nA&H Form, the Commission is of the view that the disclosure was made\nreasonably under Section 18 of the PDPA as the Personal Particulars have clear\nrelevance to and will facilitate the process of preparing a medical report.\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n23. Given the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 18 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered under\nsection 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it deems fit to\nensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Respondent\nto pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million as the\nCommission thinks fit.\n24. On a balance, the Commission has decided not to impose a financial penalty on\nthe Respondent in view of the overall circumstances of the matter. Instead, the\nCommission has decided to issue a warning to the Respondent. In coming to this\ndecision, the Commission has taken into account the following considerations:\n(a)\n\nThe disclosure was limited to a single third party, CFG, and the personal\ndata, which the unauthorised disclosure was made, although of a sensitive\nfinancial nature, was limited to a single data set, ie the Bank Account\nDetails;\n\n(b)\n\nThe disclosure had been under circumstances in which CFG knew that the\npersonal data disclosed was to be treated confidentially;\n\n(c)\n\nThere was no evidence of actual loss or damage suffered by the\nComplainant from the disclosure made; and\n\n(d)\n\nThe Respondent had undertaken an immediate review of its processes in\nrelation to the disclosure of personal data to parties following the incident.\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\f25. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The\nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against\nthe organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Universal Travel Corporation for disclosing a passenger list, consisting of 37 customers' personal data, to four of its customers without consent.

Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 4\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\n\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”) received a\ncomplaint from a credible source concerning the alleged disclosure by the\nRespondent of personal data of 37 customers (the “passenger list”) in early\nMarch 2015 to certain individual(s) who participated in the 12 Days Legend of\nthe Balkans Tour from 17 February 2015 to 28 February 2015 (“Balkans Tour”).\n\n2.\n\nIn the premises, the Commission decided to carry out an investigation into the\nmatter. The Commission’s findings are set out below.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n3.\n\nSometime in or around late February 2015, four of the customers of the Balkans\nTour requested the Respondent to furnish formal documentation confirming the\ncancellation of their transit flight to Sofia on 18 February 2015 (TK1027/18FEB15\nISTANBUL-SOFIA) (“formal confirmation”) to process their insurance claims.\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent therefore requested from Turkish Airline written confirmation of\nthe flight cancellation and the affected passenger list.\n\n5.\n\nSometime in early March 2015, the Respondent sent the formal confirmation\ntogether with the letter from Turkish Airline and the passenger list by email to\nfour of the customers of the Balkans Tour. The passenger list that was sent\ncontained the name, nationality, date of birth, passport number, passport expiry\ndate and passenger name record (a record in the database of a computer\nreservation system (CRS) that contains the itinerary for a passenger, or a group\nof passengers travelling together) of all 37 of the passengers/customers that\nwere on the Balkans Tour. The passengers’ details were not masked or redacted\nwhen it was sent by the Respondent. It is not disputed that the passengers’\ndetails constituted personal data under the control of the Respondent at the\nmaterial time.\n\n\f6.\n\nIn the Respondent’s response to the Commission during the investigation, the\nRespondent confirmed to the Commission that it did not obtain consent from the\n37 passengers to disclose their personal data to other parties. It also mentioned\nthat none of the passengers had authorised the release of their personal data to\nthird parties. The Respondent confirmed to the Commission that it also did not\nhave any personal data policy in place at the material time.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n7.\n\nThe issues in this case to be determined are as follow:\ni.\n\nHas the Respondent complied with sections 131 and 202 of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in disclosing the personal data to the\ncustomers of the Balkans Tour?\n\nii.\n\nWas the disclosure of the personal data made in accordance with section\n18 of the PDPA,3 ie for purposes that a reasonable person would consider\nappropriate in the circumstances?\n\niii.\n\nHas the Respondent complied with section 12(a) of the PDPA4 in\ndeveloping and implementing policies and practices necessary to meet its\nobligations under the PDPA?\n\nContraventions by the Respondent under sections 13 and 20 of the PDPA\n8.\n\nThe Commission notes that the Respondent intentionally sent the passenger list\nto the four individuals who had requested for confirmation of the flight\ncancellation.\n\n9.\n\nHowever, the Respondent had not sought for or obtained any of the 37\npassengers’ consent in disclosing their information contained in the passenger\nlist to the other individual(s) who were requesting for the formal confirmation from\nthe Respondent. In this regard, the Respondent did not have the requisite\nconsent from the 37 passengers to disclose their personal data to other\nindividual(s) under section 14 of the PDPA.\n\n10. In relation to whether the 37 passengers could be deemed to have consented to\nthe disclosure of the personal data under section 15 of the PDPA, the\nCommission finds that no such deemed consent can be imputed on the facts.\nThe Commission notes that when the 37 passengers voluntarily provided their\npersonal data to the Respondent, the purposes for providing their personal data\ndid not include the purpose of allowing another passenger(s) to process his/her\ninsurance claim. This is fortified by the Respondent’s confirmation that none of\nthe passengers had agreed or authorised the release of their personal data to a\nthird party. The Commission notes that each individual only required his or her\nflight details and confirmation of the flight delay in order to process his or her\ninsurance claim.\n11. In its submissions to the Commission, the Respondent claimed that the exception\nprovided for in paragraph 1(a) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA (the\n\n\f“exception”) applied5 to the case and hence it was not required to seek the\nconsent of the individuals concerned for the disclosure of the 37 passengers’\npersonal data.\n12. Having considered the context and circumstances of the case, the Commission\nconcludes that the aforesaid exception does not apply for the following reasons:\ni.\n\n“Interests of the individual” under Paragraph 1(a) of the Fourth Schedule\nshould refer to the interests of the data subject. Disclosing the personal\ndata of other passengers to a fellow passenger for the purpose of\nenabling that passenger to make a claim against his travel insurance\npolicy for himself cannot be said to be in the interest of any one or all of\nthe other passengers.\n\nii.\n\nIt does not appear obvious to the Commission that in order to make an\ninsurance claim, details of all other affected passengers on the Balkans\nTour had to be disclosed. For one, the Respondent could have provided\nthe confirmation with only the details of the individual making the\ninsurance claim. Alternatively, the other passengers’ details could be\nremoved or redacted in the list when it was forwarded to the recipients.\nThere is no suggestion otherwise that these actions could not be carried\nout.\n\niii.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that consent for disclosure could not be\nsecured from the passengers in the list in a timely manner, or that there\nwas urgency in the matter which warranted the consent from the other\npassengers to be dispensed with.\n\n13. In the circumstances, by disclosing the passenger list containing the personal\ndata of the 37 passengers without obtaining their prior consent, the Respondent\nhad contravened section 13 of the PDPA. Additionally, since the Respondent had\nalso not informed of the purposes for which it was disclosing their personal data,\nit is also in breach of section 20 of the PDPA.\nDisclosure of personal data was not for purposes reasonable or appropriate in the\ncircumstances or for purposes that the individual has been informed of under section\n20\n14. In view that the disclosure of the entire passenger list goes beyond supporting\nan individual customer’s insurance claim (as set out in paragraphs 12i and 12ii\nabove), the disclosure could not be for purposes that a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances.\n15. In addition, since the Respondent had not been informed of the purposes for\nwhich it was disclosing the passengers’ personal data, it was also not in\ncompliance with section 20 of the PDPA.\n16. In this regard, the Respondent was also in breach of section 18 of the PDPA.\nFailure to develop and implement policies and practices necessary to meet obligations\nunder the PDPA\n\n\f17. Given that the Respondent had not put in place data protection policies to ensure\ncompliance with the PDPA at the material time when the data breach transpired,\nas confirmed by the Respondent in its response to the Commission’s request for\ninformation and documents on 13 August 2015, the Respondent was in breach\nof section 12(a) of the PDPA.\n18. The Commission notes from the Respondent’s response of 24 August 2015 that\nthe Respondent is taking steps to set up guidelines with regard to the use and\ndisclosure of customers’ personal data to comply with section 12(a) of the PDPA.\nD.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n19. Given the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under sections 12(a), 13, 18 and 20 of the PDPA, the Commission is\nempowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include\ndirecting the Respondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding\n$1 million as the Commission thinks fit.\n20. In exercise of the power conferred upon the Commission pursuant to section 29\nof the PDPA, the Commission directs the Respondent to take the following steps:\ni.\n\nTo put in place within 3 months a data protection policy and internal\nguidelines to comply with the provisions of the PDPA and, in particular,\nto prevent future recurrences of the breaches that has occurred in this\nmatter;\n\nii.\n\nTo inform within 2 weeks the individuals who received the passenger list\nnot to disclose the list to other third parties;\n\niii.\n\nFor all employees of the Respondent handling personal data to attend a\ntraining course on the obligations under the PDPA and the organisation’s\ndata protection policies within 6 months from the date of this decision;\nand\n\niv.\n\nTo inform the Commission of the completion of each of the above within\n1 week.\n\n21. On a balance, the Commission has decided not to impose a financial penalty on\nthe Respondent in view of the overall circumstances of the matter, namely:\ni.\n\nthat the disclosures were made to a limited number of persons and to their\npersonal email addresses;\n\nii.\n\nthat the personal data that was disclosed was in relation to limited\nindividuals;\n\niii.\n\nthat the disclosures were not due to a systemic issue that could result in\nfurther disclosures to be made or further harm to be caused;\n\n\fiv.\n\nthat the disclosures appear to be caused by the lack of awareness on the\nRespondent’s employees’ part of data protection obligations; and\n\nv.\n\nthat the disclosures were bona fide mistakes made by the Respondent’s\nemployees who were seeking to assist the passengers with their insurance\nclaims, and not one where there was a wilful disregard for the provisions in\nthe PDPA.\n\n22. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The\nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against\nthe organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n1 Section 13 of the PDPA prohibits an organisation from collecting, using or disclosing an individual’s personal data\n\nunless the individual gives, or is deemed to have given, his consent for the collection, use or disclosure of his\npersonal data. This provision is also to be read with Section 14, 15 and Section 20 of the PDPA.\n2 Section 20 of the PDPA requires, amongst other things, that an organisation informs an individual of (a) the\npurposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data, on or before collecting the personal data; and (b)\nany other purpose of the use or disclosure of the personal data of which the individual has not been informed under\nparagraph (a) above before the use or disclosure of the personal data for that purpose.\n3 Section 18 of the PDPA provides that an organisation may collect, use or disclose personal data about an\nindividual only for purposes (a) that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances; and (b)\nthat the individual has been informed of under section 20, if applicable.\n4 Section 12(a) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall develop and implement policies and practices that\nare necessary for the organisation to meet the obligations of the organisation.\n5 Paragraph 1(a) of the Fourth Schedule of the PDPA states that an organisation may disclose personal data about\nan individual without the consent of the individual if the disclosure is necessary for any purpose which is clearly in\nthe interests of the individual and if consent for its disclosure cannot be obtained in a timely way.\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to YesTuition Agency for disclosing tutors’ personal data on its website without consent.","tags":["Consent","Warning","Education","YESTUITION","Tuition"],"date":"2016-04-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---yestuition-agency-(210416).pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"Breach of Consent Obligation by YesTuition Agency","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/04/breach-of-consent-obligation-by-yestuition-agency","timestamp":"2016-04-21","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1407-A028\nYESTUITION AGENCY\n(UEN No. 53084839B)\n…Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 5\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nBACKGROUND\n1.\n\nOn 16 July 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”)\nreceived information that YESTUITION AGENCY (UEN 53084839B) (the\n“Respondent”) had disclosed on its website the NRIC numbers and images\nof certain individuals who had registered to be tutors with the Respondent and\nit was alleged that they had done so without the consent of the individuals\nconcerned.\n\n2.\n\nIn light of the information received, the Commission commenced an\ninvestigation under section 50 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No.\n26 of 2012) (the “PDPA”) to ascertain whether there had been a breach by the\nRespondent of its obligations under the PDPA. The Commission’s findings are\nset out below.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is a locally registered business providing home tuition\nmatching services to individuals seeking tutors for primary to A-levels\neducation. The Respondent renders its matching services via a website,\nwhich it operates at www.yestuition.sg (the “Site”).\n\n4.\n\nThe Site consists of various webpages that are accessible to the public and a\ntutors’ log-in portal which is accessible only by individuals who had registered\nwith the Respondent to be a tutor.\n\nDisclosure of NRIC numbers and images by the Respondent\n5.\n\nFrom the Commission’s examination of the Site, it was found that the\nRespondent had published images of its tutors on its Site. The tutors’ images\nwere stored in a JPEG file format and named using the tutors’ respective\nNRIC particulars, for example, as 1234567A.jpg. As such, the Respondent\nhad also disclosed the tutors’ respective NRIC numbers with the images.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\f6.\n\nThe NRIC numbers and images were at the material time made publicly\ndiscoverable and accessible via a directory listing on one of the Site’s pages.\nInvestigations by the Commission indicate that there were approximately thirty\n(30) individuals whose images and NRIC numbers were listed by the\nRespondent in the directory listing.\n\nThe Respondent’s responses to the Commission\n7.\n\nIn its responses to the Commission during the investigation, the Respondent\nrepresented that it had more than 10,000 tutors’ profiles on its Site. It asserted\nthat these profiles were not disclosed to members of the public.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent explained that individuals who wished to register with the\nRespondent as tutors were required to provide the following set of information\nto it by filling out a form made available on the Site (the “Form”):\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n\nFull names;\nNRIC numbers;\nResidential addresses;\nMobile numbers;\nEmail addresses;\nEducation backgrounds; and\nRelevant tutoring experiences.\n\n9.\n\nUsing the above information, the Respondent would then match the tutors to\nthe appropriate students, and in return, collect a fee for the matching service.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent also represented to the Commission that tutors who\nsubmitted their personal data via the Site would have provided either their\nexpress or deemed consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of their\npersonal data by the Respondent for the purposes of providing the tutors with\ntuition matching services. In this regard, the Commission notes that the Form\nexpressly notified tutors that:\n“By submitting this form, you hereby accept all terms & conditions as\nwell as consent to be included in the mailing list of Yes Tuition to\nreceive all information from us (Yes Tuition) electronically.\nPlease be assured that we do not sell your personal information to third\nparties, and we will abide by our Privacy Policy”.\n\n11.\n\nThe Commission also sets out below the more pertinent terms of The\nRespondent’s Privacy Policy, which was referred to in the Form and available\non The Respondent’s Site at the material time, as follows:\n“Tutor\nA tutor is a person who registers and maintains an account with Yes\nTuition.

With the exception of the tutors’ NRIC numbers and\nimages, it generally did not disclose these data to members of the public. The\nCommission notes that this is in line with the terms of the Respondent’s own\nPrivacy Policy.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, the Commission is of the view that the Respondent had not\nobtained its tutors’ consent for disclosure of their images and NRIC numbers,\nwhich had been published on one of the pages of the Site. In this regard, the\nCommission further notes that such disclosure ran counter to the terms of the\nRespondent’s own Privacy Policy.\n\n16.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that the Respondent\nhad disclosed the personal data of some of its tutors without their consent,\nand it is therefore in breach of section 13 of the PDPA.\n\nENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE COMMISSION\n17.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under section 13 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered\nunder section 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it\ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nRespondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1\nmillion as the Commission thinks fit.\n\n18.\n\nIn considering whether a direction should be given to the Respondent in this\ncase, the Commission notes the following:\n\n19.\n\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent took proactive steps to restrict access to the relevant\npage containing personal data on the Site once it was made aware of\nthe issue, and changed its practice of using its tutors’ NRIC numbers\nas the file names of their images; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent had been cooperative with the Commission and\nforthcoming in its responses to the Commission during the\nCommission’s investigation.\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial\npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning against the Respondent\nfor the breach of its obligations under section 13 of the PDPA.\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f20.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the\nnecessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Challenger Technologies and its data intermediary, Xirlynx Innovations, for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of Challenger members’ personal data while sending out emails to some 165,000 members.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Wholesale and Retail Trade","Others","CHALLENGER","XIRLYNX"],"date":"2016-04-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---challenger-technologies-(210416).pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Challenger Technologies and Xirlynx Innovations","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/04/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-challenger-technologies-and-xirlynx-innovations","timestamp":"2016-04-21","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1409-A103\n(1)\n(2)\n\nCHALLENGER TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (U.E.N.\n198400182K)\nXIRLYNX INNOVATIONS (U.E.N. 52942580K)\n…Respondents\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 6\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nBACKGROUND\n1.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received a\ncomplaint from a member of the public on 15 September 2014 concerning an\nalleged data breach by Challenger Technologies Limited (“Challenger”). In\nbrief, the complainant alleged that Challenger had sent email communications\nto members of its ValueClub programme, which contained the personal data\nof another ValueClub member.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission commenced an investigation under section 50 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to ascertain whether there had\nbeen a breach by Challenger of its obligations under the PDPA.\n\n3.\n\nIn the course of its investigation, the Commission found that the email\ncommunications in question (which were sent to Challenger’s ValueClub\nmembers) had been sent by Xirlynx Innovations (“Xirlynx”), a business\nengaged by Challenger to handle all its email communications to members of\nChallenger’s ValueClub programme. The Commission’s investigation\ntherefore also examined whether there had been a breach by Xirlynx of its\nobligations under the PDPA.\n\n4.\n\nThe Commission’s findings are set out below.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n5.\n\nChallenger is a retailer of information technology (“IT”) and other electronic\nproducts with several outlets around Singapore. As part of its customer\nrelations efforts, Challenger established a customer membership programme\nknown as ValueClub, which provides members with membership savings and\ndiscounts (amongst other benefits), and enables them to earn and accumulate\nValueClub programme points which may be redeemed to offset the cost of\npurchases made at Challenger outlets.\n\n1\n\n\f6.\n\nXirlynx is a third party IT vendor, which is registered and managed by its sole\nproprietor, [Redacted] (Replaced with Mr T).\n\n7.\n\nSome time in or around March 2010, Challenger engaged Xirlynx to manage\nand execute Challenger’s email campaigns under a contract for an “Email\nBlasting Package”. The services provided by Xirlynx to Challenger under the\ncontract included managing Challenger’s ValueClub membership database\nand sending Challenger’s weekly advertisements of promotions and monthly\nValueClub e-statements to ValueClub members.\n\n8.\n\nChallenger thereafter periodically renewed its “Email Blasting Package”\ncontractual engagement with Xirlynx for the latter to send email\ncommunications to ValueClub members, including the email communications\nwhich are the subject of the Commission’s present investigation.\n\n9.\n\nIn September 2014, Xirlynx sent the monthly ValueClub e-statements for that\nmonth to the ValueClub members by email (the “September Emails”).\nHowever, many of the September Emails contained personal data of another\nValueClub member, including their name, expiry date of their ValueClub\nmembership and total number of ValueClub programme points accumulated\nby the other member.\n\nHow the Data Breach Occurred\n10.\n\nIn Challenger’s responses to the Commission during the investigation,\nChallenger indicated that it had, upon being notified of the matter by the\nCommission, informed [Redacted] (Replaced with Mr T) of Xirlynx about the\nalleged breach because Xirlynx managed Challenger’s ValueClub\nmembership database and was the party responsible for sending out email\ncommunications to the ValueClub members. Challenger also conducted an\ninternal investigation to ascertain the cause of the data breach.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing its internal investigation, Challenger represented to the Commission\nthat the root cause of the data breach was a processing error by their vendor,\nXirlynx.\n\n12.\n\nChallenger also represented to the Commission that it had taken remedial\nactions to inform the affected ValueClub members regarding the data breach\nand to rectify the mistakes caused by Xirlynx’s error. In addition, Challenger\nrepresented that it had taken the extra precautionary step of terminating\nXirlynx’s services upon discovering the cause of the data breach, and it\nreviewed its ValueClub communication processes to prevent a reoccurrence\nof the data breach.\n\n13.\n\nSeparately, in Xirlynx’s responses to the Commission during the investigation,\nXirlynx explained that in September 2014, it had been instructed by\nChallenger to email that month’s ValueClub e-statements to ValueClub\nmembers. Xirlynx further explained that the following steps comprise its usual\nworkflow for sending the ValueClub e-statements to ValueClub members:\n\n2\n\n\f(a)\n\nXirlynx would receive a copy of the contents for the ValueClub estatements from Challenger one day before the intended email blast.\n\n(b)\n\nXirlynx would adapt the contents received from Challenger into a\nValueClub e-statement HTML template. At this point, variables such as\nmembers’ names, the expiry date of their ValueClub membership and\ntheir total number of existing ValueClub programme points, would have\nnot yet been inserted into the HTML template.\n\n(c)\n\nXirlynx would then send the adapted layout to Challenger for its\napproval. Upon approval, Challenger would send to Xirlynx its updated\nValueClub membership database with the latest ValueClub programme\npoints for each members, listed in a text file (.txt) format.\n\n(d)\n\nAs Challenger’s membership database contains duplicate email\naddresses, Xirlynx would import the database into an Excel worksheet\nand remove any duplicates using Excel’s “Remove Duplicates”\nfunction.\n\n(e)\n\nThe scrubbed database would then be imported into Xirlynx’s email\nblast system, and the ValueClub e-statements sent out to the\nValueClub members.\n\n14.\n\nFor the September 2014 ValueClub e-statements, Xirlynx explained that it had\ncarried out the usual steps listed above. However, while using the “Remove\nDuplicates” function in Excel to remove the email duplicates from Challenger’s\nmembership database, Xirlynx admitted that it had inadvertently also caused\nan Excel column in the worksheet containing a list of ValueClub members’\nnames, and an Excel column containing a list of the members’ email\naddresses, to be mismatched. This mix up resulted in some ValueClub\nmembers’ personal data, specifically, their names, ValueClub membership\nexpiry dates and ValueClub programme points being sent to other ValueClub\nmembers in the September Emails. In short, Xirlynx’s error in the processing\nof the membership database led to the occurrence of the data breach.\n\n15.\n\nXirlynx informed the Commission that ValueClub e-statements with personal\ndata of another ValueClub member had been sent to 165,306 ValueClub\nmembers. Xirlynx further represented that “only 34,230 recipients [of the\nSeptember Emails] that had opened the e-statements were affected”. The\nCommission understands that Xirlynx derived this smaller number from its\ndata on the number of ValueClub e-statements in the September Emails\nwhich were actually accessed by the ValueClub members. The Commission\nnotes that this does not take into account the possibility of additional members\naccessing the emails in the future. On balance, the Commission is of the view\nthat since the September Emails had been sent to 165,306 ValueClub\nmembers and would likely remain in their email account until accessed or\ndeleted by those members, it cannot be said that only 34,320 members were\naffected. The Commission therefore takes the view that 165,306 members’\npersonal data had been disclosed to other members.\n\n3\n\n\fCOMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\nIssues to be determined\n16.\n\nThe ValueClub e-statements sent in the September Emails each contained a\ndata set that identified another ValueClub member (who was an individual) by\nhis or her full name, and provided the details of the member’s accumulated\nValueClub programme points and the expiry date of the member’s ValueClub\nmembership. The contents of the e-statements therefore come within the\ndefinition of “personal data” in section 2(1) of the PDPA.1\n\n17.\n\nUnder section 24 of the PDPA, an organisation is required to protect personal\ndata in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.\n\n18.\n\nAccordingly, a key issue in this case is whether Xirlynx had breached its\nobligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n19.\n\nAlthough Xirlynx had sent the September Emails to ValueClub members, the\nCommission notes that Xirlynx was processing Challenger’s ValueClub\nmembers’ database and sending the September Emails to the ValueClub\nmembers for Challenger pursuant to their contract. Related to this, section\n4(3) of the PDPA provides that an organisation shall have the same obligation\nunder the PDPA in respect of personal data that is processed on its behalf\nand for its purposes by a data intermediary as if the personal data was\nprocessed by the organisation itself.\n\n20.\n\nAs such, two additional issues in this case are:\n(a)\n\nWhether Xirlynx was a data intermediary of Challenger in respect of the\nevents that caused the data breach; and\n\n(b)\n\nIf so, whether Challenger had breached its obligations under section 24\nof the PDPA.\n\nThe Commission’s Decision on the Issues\nWhether Xirlynx is a data intermediary of Challenger\n21.\n\nUnder section 2(1) of the PDPA, a “data intermediary” is an organisation\nwhich processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but does not\ninclude an employee of that other organisation.2\n\n22.\n\nSection 2(1) also defines the term “processing”, in relation to personal data, to\nmean the carrying out of any operation or set of operations in relation to the\npersonal data including, but not limited to, any of the following:\n(a)\n(b)\n\nRecording;\nHolding;\n4\n\n\f(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n\nOrganisation, adaptation or alteration;\nRetrieval;\nCombination;\nTransmission;\nErasure or destruction.3\n\n23.\n\nHaving reviewed the “invoice no. 2013-01549 from Xirlynx to Challenger\ndated 31 December 2013”, and a “non-disclosure agreement dated 24 April\n2014, entered into by [Redacted] (Replaced with Mr H) and [Redacted]\n(Replaced with Mr T)on behalf of Challenger and Xirlynx respectively” which\nwas provided by Xirlynx to the Commission, and based on the facts set out at\nparagraph 13, the Commission is of the view that Xirlynx had processed\npersonal data of Challenger’s ValueClub members pursuant to the\narrangement between Xirlynx and Challenger and they had done so on behalf\nof Challenger. Further, Challenger had clearly relied on Xirlynx to process its\nValueClub members’ personal data to send the email communications in\nquestion. Xirlynx was therefore a data intermediary of Challenger for the\npurposes of the PDPA.\n\n24.\n\nAs Xirlynx was a data intermediary of Challenger, Challenger has the same\nobligations under the PDPA in respect of Xirlynx’s processing of personal\ndata, as if the personal data had been processed by Challenger (per section\n4(3) of the PDPA).\n\n25.\n\nHowever, this does not affect Xirlynx’s obligations under section 24 of the\nPDPA as that section applies equally to data intermediaries who process\npersonal data on behalf of and for the purposes of another organisation\npursuant to a contract in writing. In this regard, section 4(2) of the PDPA\nexcludes the application of Parts III to VI of the PDPA, except for sections 24\nand 25, to such data intermediaries.\n\nWhether Xirlynx had breached section 24 of the PDPA\n26.\n\nThe fact that a data breach had occurred was undisputed by both Xirlynx and\nChallenger. The Commission therefore considered whether Xirlynx had made\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent the data breach from taking\nplace.\n\n27.\n\nFrom Xirlynx’s representations to the Commission, it was clear that it fell on\nXirlynx, as part of its email blasting services, to ensure that the correct\nindividualised ValueClub e-statement was sent to the correct intended\nrecipient. Xirlynx’s use of the Excel duplicate removal function while\nprocessing Challenger’s ValueClub members database was part of this\nservice.\n\n28.\n\nIt was therefore Xirlynx’s responsibility to ensure that processing of\nChallenger’s ValueClub members database was done in the correct manner\nso as to ensure that the correct set of personal data was sent by Xirlynx to\neach ValueClub member. The occurrence of the data breach is a prima facie\n\n5\n\n\findication that Xirlynx had not fulfilled its responsibilities in respect of\nprocessing and sending personal data.\n29.\n\nThe Commission further notes that Xirlynx’s error could have been caught if it\nhad proof read random samples of the ValueClub e-statements before the estatements were sent out to verify that the names of the individuals in the estatements matched the email addresses to which the e-statement was sent.\n\n30.\n\nSample proof-reading was a reasonable security arrangement that could have\nbeen conducted by Xirlynx given the nature of the services it provided, and\nwhich would likely have either averted the data leak or greatly reduced the\nnumber of individuals affected. The sample size should be appropriate relative\nto the total number of recipients.\n\n31.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission takes the view that by failing to ensure that the\ncorrect personal data was sent to ValueClub members via the September\nEmails, Xirlynx had breached its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nWhether Challenger had breached its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n32.\n\nIn light of the Commission’s above finding that Xirlynx is a data intermediary of\nChallenger, it follows from section 4(3) of the PDPA that Challenger is obliged\nto protect the personal data administered by Xirlynx as if Challenger had\nprocessed the personal data itself. Section 4(3) of the PDPA states:\n“An organisation shall have the same obligation under this Act in respect of\npersonal data processed on its behalf and for its purposes by a data\nintermediary as if the personal data were processed by the organisation\nitself.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n33.\n\nThe Commission’s findings regarding the failure by Xirlynx to fulfil its\nresponsibilities and obligations under the PDPA are therefore equally relevant\nin determining whether there was a breach of section 24 of the PDPA by\nChallenger.\n\n34.\n\nIn addition, the Commission notes that Challenger had heretofore neglected\nto exercise control over Xirlynx’s workflow in the processing of Challenger’s\nValueClub membership database and the sending of email communications to\nValueClub members. Challenger had left it to Xirlynx to implement measures\nrequired to protect the personal data Xirlynx processed and, until the data\nbreach occurred, had not considered what requirements it would want to\nimplement to ensure that the personal data was appropriately protected, in\naccordance with section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n35.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission is of the view that Challenger had similarly\nbreached its obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\fENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE COMMISSION\n36.\n\nGiven the Commission’s findings that both Challenger and Xirlynx were in\nbreach of their respective obligations under section 24 of the PDPA, the\nCommission is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to issue such\ndirections as it deems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may\ninclude directing either or both parties to pay a financial penalty of such\namount not exceeding $1 million as the Commission thinks fit.\n\n37.\n\nIn considering whether to give such a direction in this case, the Commission\nnotes the following:\n(a)\n\nThe personal data leaked was limited (comprising only ValueClub\nmembers’ names, their membership expiry dates, and accumulated\nValueClub programme points) and not of a sensitive nature;\n\n(b)\n\nThe personal data leaked could not be used by the individuals who had\nreceived them to profiteer or benefit from them, and was unlikely to lead\nto any harm or loss to the individuals concerned; and\n\n(c)\n\nBoth Xirlynx and Challenger had been cooperative with the Commission\nand forthcoming in their responses to the Commission during the\nCommission’s investigation.\n\n38.\n\nThe Commission also notes that Challenger had taken several proactive steps\nto remedy the breach, including engaging a new IT vendor and hiring the\nservices of a data protection consultant.\n\n39.\n\nIn view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to either Challenger or Xirlynx to take remedial action or to pay a\nfinancial penalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning to Challenger and\nXirlynx respectively for the breach of their respective obligations under section\n24 of the PDPA.\n\n40.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the\nnecessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n7\n\n\f1 See section 2(1) of the PDPA.\n2 See section 2(1) of the PDPA.\n3 See section 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Full House Communications for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure of personal data on its computers at a furniture fair, which collected the data for a lucky draw.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Admin and Support Services","FULL HOUSE"],"date":"2016-04-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---full-house-communications-(210416).pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Full House Communications","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/04/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-full-house-communications","timestamp":"2016-04-21","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase Number: DP-1503-A368\n\nFULL HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS PTE LTD [Reg. No. 199405394C]\n... Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 8\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nThe Complainant, [Redacted] (Replaced with Mr L), submitted a complaint to\nthe Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) on 4 March\n2015 in respect of the way that the Respondent had collected and protected1\npersonal data2 at a lucky draw redemption counter operated by the\nRespondent. The specific matters that were raised in his complaint were as\nfollows:\na.\n\nThe auto-fill function was enabled for the forms on the Respondent’s\nlaptops that a participant had to fill up to register for the lucky draw. This\nallowed a user to view from a drop-down box the historical entries\ncontaining the personal information of the previous registering\nparticipants.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent’s laptop screens were in plain view of customers waiting\nin line behind the Complainant, which allowed them to view the personal\ninformation that was being entered into the laptop.\n\nc.\n\nThe page containing the form was accessed through an unsecured\nMozilla Firefox browser at the site: http://localhost/coupon/finish.php.\n\nd.\n\nThe Respondent’s staff did not appear to be adequately trained to ensure\nthe protection of personal data collected at the redemption counter.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n2.\n\nThe lucky draw that the Respondent had organised was for a Furniture Fair that\ntook place from 28 February 2015 to 8 March 2015 at the Singapore Expo Hall\n7. On 1 March 2015, the Complainant and his mother had attended the\nFurniture Fair and had purchased items which entitled the Complainant to\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fparticipate in the Respondent’s lucky draw. To participate in the lucky draw, a\nparticipant was required to register his or her personal details in the laptops\nprovided by the Respondent at the redemption counter, including the\nindividual’s name, identity card number, occupation, contact number, email\naddress and residential address. The form would then be printed out and\ndropped into a box for the lucky draw.\n3.\n\nWhile entering the personal details of his mother in the computerised form, the\nComplainant had four (4) main concerns about the level of protection of the\npersonal data that was provided by the Respondent, as mentioned at\nparagraph 1 above.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing from the Commission’s investigation into the matter,\nRespondent’s responses to the Commission were, in essence, as follow:\n\n5.\n\nthe\n\na.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged that the auto-fill function had been\nenabled for all the fields in the form for the convenience of customers.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent maintained that the personal data entry into the laptops\nhad been in the presence of its staff, and they would watch the customers\nand ensure that no one would not be able to take photos of the personal\ninformation displayed on the laptops.\n\nc.\n\nThe forms were not accessible to the Internet.\n\nd.\n\nSubsequent to receiving the Commission’s notification of this matter, the\nRespondent had taken remedial actions during the ongoing Furniture Fair.\n\nThe Commission also understands that the Respondent had taken remedial\nactions as follow:\na.\n\nThe Respondent said it changed its practices by having the entries into\nthe forms in the laptops made by its staff instead of by the registering\nparticipants themselves.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent also said that it had re-configured the table\narrangements so that the screens of the laptops were aligned away from\nthe view of registering participants in queue at the redemption counter.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\n6.\n\nThe Commission’s findings on the four issues raised are as follows.\n\nIssues at pargraphs 1a and 1d: The Respondent’s failure to protect personal data by\nenabling the Auto-fill function and the failure of the Respondent’s staff to protect\npersonal data\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\f7.\n\nIn the Commission’s assessment, by enabling the auto-fill function, this\npermitted a user to have access to the personal data of other individual(s) that\nwas stored on the Respondent’s laptops.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent has pointed out that the information that a user would have\naccess to was confined to information found within that particular drop-down\nbox, and that the entries were not listed in chronological order of the time that\nthey were entered into the system. In this regard, it would be difficult to draw a\nconnection between the entries in the various drop-down boxes to link them to\na particular individual. It follows from this line of argument that the information\nthat a user would have access to would not be personal data, but simply\ngeneric information, and hence the Respondent was not in breach of Section\n24 of the PDPA.\n\n9.\n\nThe Commission disagrees with this line of argument. It was noted that the\ninformation that was displayed in the drop-down boxes included the individual’s\nname, identity card number, contact number, email address. Based on the\ndefinition of “personal data” under the PDPA, some of these information would,\nby themselves or collectively, amount to personal data. For example, by having\na person’s full name in the drop-down box alone, one would be able to identify\nthe person who had registered as a participant of the Furniture Fair. Therefore,\neven if a person had access to the information in a single drop-down box, that\nmay be sufficient in identifying an individual.\n\n10. The Commission also notes that there may be certain instances where a link\ncould be drawn between the information across fields – ie such as the instance\nwhere an email address containing part of the individual’s name could be linked\nto the full name of the individual, and hence, identify that individual.\n11. In the premises, the Commission finds that by enabling the auto-fill function for\nthe drop-down boxes, the Respondent had failed to make reasonable security\narrangements under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n12. While the Respondent claimed that its staff had been present to monitor\nunauthorised user access to data stored in the system, however, the\nCommission notes that the Respondent was providing the very function itself\n(by enabling the auto-fill function) that would allow a user access to personal\ndata of the other individuals. In this regard, the Commission is of the view that\nthe staff presence (if any) would not have made any difference in preventing\nany user from accessing the personal data stored on the system.\n13. Notwithstanding the Commission’s view about the presence of the staff at the\nredemption counter, the Commission makes no finding on the other allegation\nraised by the Complainant at paragraph 1d above (ie that the Respondent’s\nstaff could not ensure the protection of personal data), as there was no\nevidence of an actual failure by the Respondent’s staff to protect the personal\ndata collected by the laptops.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\fIssue at paragraph 1b: Laptop screens were in plain view of other customers\n14. In relation to the allegation that the Respondent’s laptop screens were in plain\nview of the other customers, the Commission notes that there is no evidence\nthat other customers could easily observe the information displayed on the\nlaptop screens. The Commission further notes the assurance given by the\nRespondent that its staff was on hand to watch over the laptops and, in\nparticular, to ensure that other individuals do not take photographs of the laptop\nscreens. The Commission therefore makes no finding in respect of this\nallegation.\nIssue at paragraph 1c: Computerised forms accessed through unsecured Mozilla\nFirefox browsers\n15. In respect of the allegation that the computerised forms were accessed through\nunsecured Mozilla Firefox browsers, the Commission notes that the forms and\nthe personal data were collected and stored on the local hard drives and were\nnot accessible on the internet. The Commission is of the view that of the risk of\nonline attacks or intrusion to these laptops where the personal data was held\ncould not be ascertained. The Commission therefore makes no finding in\nrespect of this allegation.\nD.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n16. Given the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it\ndeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nRespondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million\nas the Commission thinks fit.\n17. In considering whether a direction should be made or given to the Respondent\nin this case, the Commission notes that: (a) the impact of the breach is limited,\nsince, in the given circumstances, a user would have had limited time to\nobserve and collect personal data in the drop-down boxes; and (b) the\nRespondent took action shortly after the complaint was made to stop the use of\nthe drop-down boxes and to arrange for its staff to fill in the forms themselves.\n18. In view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial\npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning against the Respondent for\nthe breach of its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f19. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the\nnecessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n1\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA states that an organisation is obliged to protect personal data in its possession or\ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks.

LTD.\n(UEN No. 199800455H)\n…Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 3\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nBackground\n1.\n\nFei Fah Medical Manufacturing Pte. Ltd. (UEN 199800455H) (“Fei Fah\nMedical”) is a locally registered company specialising in the development and\nmanufacture of healthcare and beauty products.\n\nThe Ripple Website\n2.\n\nFei Fah Medical operates a website under the name Ripple Tea Company at\nwww.ripple.com.sg (“Site”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Site consists of both publicly accessible pages, and a members’ portal\n(which is accessible only by individuals who had signed up with Fei Fah\nMedical under a membership scheme called Ripple Club, upon logging into\nthe portal with their respective user identifications (“IDs”) and passwords).\n\nData Leak Incident\n4.\n\nOn 29 September 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission\n(“Commission”) was informed that information of users of the Site had been\nposted on http://pastebin.com (“Pastebin”), a website which allows members\nof the public to post and share text online publicly (the “Data Leak”).\n\n5.\n\nThe relevant information was ostensibly uploaded onto the Pastebin website\nby a Pastebin user with the username “KAMI_HAXOR”, in the form of a post\nin plain text that could be publicly viewed by any visitor to the Pastebin\nwebsite.\n\n6.\n\nThe post was undated and captioned “Ripple Tea Company Singapore 900+\nUsers emails+passes+Names+mobile Numbers With Subscribers Emails\nLeaked By KaMi HaXor”.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 1 of 7\n\n\f7.\n\n8.\n\nThe post contained a list of data, which were numbered from 1 to 2,981,\nostensibly to indicate that there were 2,981 entries in it. The data in the post\nappeared to be have been sorted into the following three categories:\n(a)\n\nEmail addresses – there were 1114 entries of email addresses. The\nemail addresses were unaccompanied by other data or identifiers. 219 of\nthe entries contained “.sg” domain names;\n\n(b)\n\nUser ID and encrypted passwords to Ripple Club accounts – there were\n876 entries of user IDs and passwords, which had been encrypted using\nan MD5 message-digest algorithm, a commonly used cryptographic hash\nfunction producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value; and\n\n(c)\n\nTelephone numbers – there were 836 entries of telephone numbers\ncontaining between seven and ten digits. It was unclear whether the\ntelephone numbers were Singapore or Hong Kong telephone numbers\nas the format of telephone numbers used by the countries is similar.\n\nIn light of the information received, the Commission commenced an\ninvestigation under section 50 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No.\n26 of 2012) (the “Act”) to ascertain whether there had been a breach by Fei\nFah Medical of its obligations under the Act.\n\nNature of the Data Leak Incident\n9.\n\nIn its responses to the Commission, Fei Fah Medical confirmed that the data\nin the list were those of prospective customers and general enquirers to its\nRipple brand products.\n\n10.\n\nFei Fah Medical further confirmed that the data was collected via its Site and\nstored in a database based in Hong Kong. Fei Fah Medical had outsourced all\nits web development and hosting functions to its Hong Kong-based data\nintermediary, IT Factory. IT Factory had in turn engaged HKNet Company\nLimited, also based in Hong Kong, to provide the actual hosting services for\nthe database.\n\n11.\n\nFei Fah Medical indicated that it had no knowledge of the Data Leak prior to\nreceiving the Commission’s Notice dated 1 October 2014. However, after\nbeing alerted to the Data Leak, it sent email notifications to all affected\nindividuals, informing them that there had been hacking activity on the Site\nand that their personal data may have been compromised.\n\n12.\n\nFei Fah Medical also took steps to instruct IT Factory to remove all data\ncollecting functions from its Site. However, as these instructions failed to be\ncarried out by IT Factory, new data continued to be collected via the Site till\n30 July 2015 (almost ten months after Fei Fah Medical was first notified about\nthe Data Leak), when the Commission alerted Fei Fah Medical to the fact that\nthe Site still retained its data collecting functions.\n\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\f13.\n\nFei Fah Medical was unable to ascertain how the Data Leak could have\noccurred and did not appear to be familiar with the security measures which\nwere used on the Site at the material time: In fact, in its responses to the\nCommission, Fei Fah Medical simply stated the cause of the Data Leak to be\n“unknown” and was unable to provide any logs or files capturing the intrusion\nto its data system.\n\n14.\n\nFei Fah Medical also appeared to be uncertain about which individuals or\norganisation had access to the leaked data. Although Fei Fah Medical initially\nstated that the leaked data was only accessible by “the actual host” HKNet\nCompany Limited, it later clarified that the data was also accessible at the\nmaterial time by its own backend administration staff (i.e. those who\nadministered the database), and by using the staff ID of one of its directors,\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Mr L). Additionally, it admitted that it would have\nbeen possible for a hacker to access the database to extract the data by\nseeding “some program in the server”.\n\n15.\n\nOverall, Fei Fah Medical was unable to explain how the Data Leak occurred.\nIt was also unable to explain or provide sufficient information on the security\nmeasures implemented on either the Site or database at the material time.\n\n16.\n\nIn relation to the number of individuals affected by the Data Leak, the\nCommission notes that the title of the post indicates that the data of\napproximately 900 users had been disclosed in the data list. Although Fei Fah\nMedical claimed that not all the information in the data list was accurate, it did\nnot dispute the number of users who were affected by the Data Leak.\n\n17.\n\nHaving reviewed the relevant facts and circumstances, including the written\nresponses to the NTPs1 submitted by Fei Fah Medical, the Commission sets\nout below its findings and assessment in relation to the Data Leak.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\nPersonal Data Leaked\n18.\n\nAs noted above, there were three categories of data found in the post at the\nPastebin website. Fei Fah Medical acknowledged in its representations to the\nCommission that the data in the post were those of prospective customers\nand general enquirers to its Ripple brand products. Fei Fah Medical also\nacknowledged that personal data of Ripple Club members was stored in its\ndatabase, which could be retrieved with the appropriate user ID and\npassword.\n\n19.\n\nAlthough the passwords were encoded, they had been encoded using an\nMD5 message-digest algorithm, a commonly used cryptographic hash\nfunction, which could be easily attacked with password tables by any\nmotivated individual.\n\n20.\n\nFurther, given that anyone who had obtained a valid user ID and password\ncombination would be able to log in to the Site to retrieve personal details\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\frelating to the respective Ripple Club member, it is apparent that a valid user\nID and password combination would be able to identify an individual Ripple\nClub member. Accordingly, the Commission is of the view that the user IDs\nand passwords that were leaked would fall within the definition of “personal\ndata” in the Act.2\n21.\n\nIn addition, several of the telephone numbers disclosed in the data list\nappeared to be personal mobile telephone numbers, which would, by\nthemselves, be able to lead to the identification of the individuals owning the\nnumbers. Similarly, several of the email addresses display, what seems to be,\nthe full names of the respective owners of the email addresses, and appear\ncapable of identifying them. Those telephone numbers and email addresses\nthereby constitute “personal data” under the Act.3\n\nPersonal Data under the Possession and Control of Fei Fah Medical\n22.\n\nFei Fah Medical confirmed the fact that the Site was fully owned and\nadministered by it at all material times. The personal data of Fei Fah Medical’s\nSingaporean users were also generally collected via the Site from Singapore.\n\n23.\n\nFor completeness, the Commission notes Fei Fah Medical’s statements that:\n(a)\n\nIT Factory, as Fei Fah Medical’s website vendor, was engaged to\nsupply and design the website and to provide maintenance upon\nrequest; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe contents collected via the Site were stored in a database hosted at\nthe premises of HKNet Company Limited, a data hosting service\nprovider, on a dedicated server.\n\n24.\n\nIt is apparent from the information provided by Fei Fah Medical that IT Factory\nand HKNet Company Limited, as Fei Fah Medical’s vendors, undertook these\nfunctions on behalf of Fei Fah Medical.\n\n25.\n\nAlthough Fei Fah Medical initially stated that the leaked data was only\naccessible by HKNet Company Limited, it subsequently clarified that the data\nwas also accessible at the material time by its backend administration staff\n(i.e. those who administered the database), and by one of its directors, Mr L.\nIn fact, Fei Fah Medical remained in control of the personal data stored in the\ndatabase hosted by HKNet Company Limited at all material times, as\nevidenced by Fei Fah Medical’s instructions to IT Factory to delete all the\npersonal data subsequent to the Data Leak.\n\n26.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission is satisfied that, at all material times, the\nrelevant personal data of users of the Site and whose security was\ncompromised as a result of the Data Leak, was in the possession and/or\nunder the control of Fei Fah Medical.\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\fAdequacy of Security Arrangements\n27.\n\nFei Fah Medical, being an organisation which had its Site users’ personal data\nunder its possession and/or control, is required to make reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).4\n\n28.\n\nHowever, Fei Fah Medical was unable to provide any information about the\nsecurity arrangements that it had put in place to protect either the Site or the\nserver where the database of personal data collected was hosted.\n\n29.\n\nAlthough Fei Fah Medical claimed that it had set up some firewalls within the\nadministration control panel, it was neither able to provide details as to the\nnature of these firewalls nor any evidence as to their existence in its\nresponses to the NTPs issued by the Commission.\n\n30.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, the facts demonstrate that, prior to the Data Leak,\nFei Fah Medical had made little effort to inquire into and/or ensure the security\nof personal data stored on the Site. Fei Fah Medical appeared to have little\nknowledge as to whether there were security measures implemented on its\nSite or the server where the database of personal data collected was hosted.\n\n31.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that Fei Fah Medical\nhas failed to make reasonable security arrangements in respect of personal\ndata relating to users of its Site, as required under the Protection Obligation.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n32.\n\nAt the time of this decision, the list of data appears to have been removed\nfrom the Pastebin website.\n\n33.\n\nIn determining the directions to be given to Fei Fah Medical, the Commission\nhas given due consideration to all the relevant factors, including the following:\n(a)\n\nFei Fah Medical had been neither cooperative nor forthcoming in its\nresponses to the NTPs issued by the Commission as part of its\ninvestigations. In this regard, the Commission notes that Fei Fah\nMedical had provided incomplete responses to the first and second\nNTPs issued by the Commission, and initially ignored the third NTP\nissued by the Commission. Fei Fah Medical also took between three\nweeks to a month to respond to each NTP and its responses were not\nforthcoming; and\n\n(b)\n\nalthough Fei Fah Medical took steps to instruct its Hong Kong-based\ndata intermediary IT Factory to implement remedial actions to address\nthe Data Leak following its discovery on 1 October 2014, it did not\nensure that its instructions were carried out by its data intermediary.\nThe data intermediary only implemented remedial actions to address\nthe Data Leak on 30 July 2015, more than ten months after Fei Fah\nMedical first discovered the Data Leak. This undue delay in\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fimplementing the remedial actions suggests a continuing insouciance\nby Fei Fah Medical with respect to its obligation to make reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to keep personal data in its possession or under\nits control protected.\n34.\n\nPursuant to section 29(2), and having completed its investigation and\nassessment of this matter, the Commission is satisfied that Fei Fah Medical\nhas been in breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA.5\n\n35.\n\nThe Commission notes from the representations submitted by Fei Fah\nMedical’s lawyers on its behalf to the Commission that it intends to shut down\nthe Site and replace it with a newly constructed website within 4 months.\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant factors of this case, the\nCommission hereby directs Fei Fah Medical to do the following:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n36.\n\nFei Fah Medical shall within 120 days from the date of the\nCommission’s direction:\n(i)\n\nimplement a new website to replace the Site;\n\n(ii)\n\nconduct a web application vulnerability scan of the new website;\nand\n\n(iii)\n\npatch all vulnerabilities identified by such scan;\n\nFei Fah Medical shall, in addition, submit to the Commission by no later\nthan 14 days after patching all vulnerabilities identified by the\nabovementioned vulnerability scan, a written update providing details\non:\n(i)\n\nthe results of the vulnerability scan; and\n\n(ii)\n\nthe measures that were taken by Fei Fah Medical to patch all\nvulnerabilities identified by the vulnerability scan; and\n\nFei Fah Medical shall pay a financial penalty of S$5,000.00 within 30\ndays from the date of the Commission’s direction, failing which interest,\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts,\nshall be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance under the PDPA and with the Commission’s directions.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\f1 Notice to Require Production of Documents and Information under the Ninth Schedule to the\n\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012.\n2 Section 2 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n3 Section 2 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n4 Section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n5 The Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Financial penalties of $50,000 and $10,000 were imposed on K Box Entertainment Group (K Box) and its data intermediary, Finantech Holdings, for failing to implement proper and adequate protective measures to secure its IT system, resulting in unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of 317,000 K Box members.

LTD.\nFINANTECH HOLDINGS PTE. LTD.\n…Respondents\n\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 1\n\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nBackground\n1.\n\nK Box Entertainment Group Pte. Ltd. (“K Box”) operates a chain of\nkaraoke outlets in Singapore. Finantech Holdings Pte. Ltd. (“Finantech”)\nis a third party IT vendor, which is owned and managed by its sole\ndirector, [Redacted] (Replaced with Mr G).\n\n2.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, the website “The Real Singapore” (“TRS”)\npublished a post which indicated that a list containing personal data of\nabout “317,000” K Box members (the “List”) had been disclosed online\nat http://pastebin.com/bnVhn3mp (“pastebin.com”).\n\n3.\n\nThe List contained personal data which all customers who sign up for a\nK Box membership, both before and after 2 July 2014, are required to\nprovide, namely:\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n(g)\n(h)\n(i)\n\n4.\n\nName (as per NRIC);\nNRIC / Passport / FIN number;\nMailing Address (Singapore only);\nContact number;\nEmail address;\nGender;\nNationality;\nProfession; and\nDate of birth.\n\nAfter receiving complaints from members of the public regarding the data\nbreach, the Commission commenced an investigation under section 50\nof the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to ascertain whether\n\n1\n\n\fthere had been a breach by K Box and/or Finantech of their respective\nobligations under the PDPA.\nMaterial Facts and Documents\nK Box’s relationship with Finantech\n5.\n\nAs at 16 September 2014, K Box had engaged Finantech through the\n“website revamp contract dated 2012” and the “webhosting and server\nmanagement contract dated 2009” to develop K Box’s Content\nManagement System (“CMS”) system from the ground up and to\nrevamp, manage and host its website. What the parties referred to as\n“contracts” were actually quotations sent by Finantech to K Box for their\nconfirmation and acceptance. K Box’s CMS stored and processed the\npersonal data of its members. The CMS system also utilised FCKEditor\n– a software library component which allowed the user to input formatted\ntext.\n\n6.\n\nMr G of Finantech was the only one who had direct and full access to all\nthe K Box members’ personal data as the sole administrator of K Box’s\nCMS system. In the past, a former project manager of Finantech,\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Mrs G], whose role was to help Mr G in\nmanaging K Box’s customer data, also had access through the\nadministrative account in the CMS system, i.e. the ‘admin’ account with\nthe password “admin”.1 Mrs G left Finantech on or around 2013. Apart\nfrom that, no one else, not even K Box’s IT manager [Redacted]\n(Replaced with Mr C) or K Box’s Chief Operation Officer, [Redacted]\n(Replaced with Ms N), had direct access to the database.\n\n7.\n\nK Box employees with the title “Captain” and above2 (of which there were\nabout 75 people with such a title) had restricted access to a function that\nallowed viewing of members’ personal data such as name, package,\nbooking date and time, contact number, members’ number and visit date\nand time to check and confirm members’ booking. However, they could\nonly view the details of each member one at a time, and not extract the\nentire members’ list. As such, whenever K Box required members’\npersonal data with selected criteria for marketing and promotional\npurposes, they would have to inform Mr G of the data required and he\nwould perform the relevant queries on the database, export the\ninformation to an MS Excel document and email the document\n(unencrypted) via Gmail to K Box’s IT manager, Mr C, who would in turn\nemail the document to K Box’s marketing department via Gmail. During\ninvestigations, it was discovered that Finantech had once sent K Box\nover 90,000 members’ personal data via unencrypted email via Gmail.\n2\n\n\fBy its own admission, K Box had never instructed Finantech to\npassword-protect or encrypt emails containing a large volume of\npersonal data prior to 16 September 2014.\nK Box’s Protection Measures\n8.\n\nAccording to K Box, measures that were reasonable and appropriate\ntaking into account “the nature of the K Box’s business (i.e. value for\nmoney, family-orientated, karaoke entertainment for everyone) and the\nfact that the data are non-financial in nature” were adopted with regard\nto the security of its members’ data.\n\n9.\n\nK Box represented that secure server practices such as access controls\nand data protection policies that were established and observed in the\norganisation whether before 2 July 2014 or between 2 July 2014 and 16\nSeptember 2014 had been put in place since the implementation of its\ncurrent website to protect individuals’ personal data. In addition, K Box\nrepresented that before 16 September 2014, employees were required\nto set alphanumeric passwords consisting of eight alphabets/numbers,\none capital and one special case in accordance with K Box’s password\npolicy. However, Mr C admitted that K Box did not “conduct audit on\nwhether the staff really use eight numbers/letters alphanumeric, one\ncapital and one special case password (sic.)” and Mr G had noted a\nreceptionist using a one-letter password in the past. A software system\n“to force employees to adopt passwords that adhered to the KBox’s\npassword policy (sic.)” was only implemented in November 2014.\n\n10.\n\nAlthough K Box had outsourced its website maintenance, which includes\nmaintenance of its backend CMS, and web hosting of its website to\nFinantech (“Services”), K Box represented that Finantech agreed and\nundertook that it would keep K Box’s data confidential as it was a term\nin their agreements. K Box had also held regular meetings with Mr\nG/Finantech on all aspects of the Services including any IT security\nconcerns and Finantech would not conduct any major works or\nmodification to the Services without first consulting K Box. K Box had “no\nreason to doubt” the competence or integrity of Finantech or that\nFinantech would not comply with the security measures and\nundertaking. However, by Finantech’s own admission, Finantech did not\ndo any system monitoring in terms of IT security, security testing or\nregular IT security audits at the time of the breach and prior to 17\nSeptember 2014.\n\n11.\n\nK Box had also represented that it did not have a Data Protection Officer\n(“DPO”) since 2 July 2014 to 20 April 2015 and conceded that its privacy\n\n3\n\n\fpolicy prior to 16 September 2014 was not comprehensive. While each\nemployee’s employment contract contains a term to keep all information\nrelating to the operations of K Box confidential, there was no policy and\nphysical or online security system in place to monitor whether a staff\nremoved personal data from its premises.\n12.\n\nIn this connection, the “contracts” between K Box and Finantech did not\ninclude any contractual clauses that required Finantech to comply with\na standard of protection in relation to the personal data transferred to it\nthat is at least comparable to industry standards. According to\nFinantech’s representations, K Box had also never emphasised the need\nfor data protection and their obligation towards K Box under the PDPA\nor informed Finantech of its data protection obligation after September\n2014. Mr G had also represented that while he was aware of the\nexistence of the PDPA, he was not aware of the specifics of it.\n\nThe List\n13.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, the same day that TRS published the post\nmentioned at paragraph 2 above, K Box’s management realised, via the\n“Social Media, employees and The Real Singapore website”, that K Box\nmembers’ personal data had been uploaded on pastebin.com. Mr C had\nalso received a call on his mobile phone from an unknown person to\ninform him that TRS had “posted information of K Box members” and to\nask him to verify whether the information belonged to its members. Mr\nG investigated the breach by matching the disclosed personal data in\nthe List with the information of K Box’s members from its database and\nconfirmed that the List matched the one in K Box’s database. Thereafter,\nK Box notified its members of the data breach by way of a letter dated\n16 September 2014 that was published online on the K Box homepage.\n\n14.\n\nThe next day, 17 September 2014, Mr C “deleted all the accounts of the\nstaff who left (sic.)” and the unauthorised ‘admin’ account with the weak\npassword “admin” was “deactivated”, “disabled” and the “password to\nthe account was changed”. The CMS user activity log showed that Mr C\nhad removed 36 accounts on 17 September 2014.\n\nNo Conclusive Evidence that Data Breach Occurred Before 2 July 2014\n15.\n\nAlthough the List was uploaded on pastebin.com on 16 September 2014,\nthe List only contained members’ data up to 23 April 2014. There is no\nevidence available to conclusively ascertain when the List was obtained.\n\n4\n\n\f16.\n\nBased on Finantech’s initial investigation on the day the List was\npublished, Finantech deduced that the List containing the personal data\nof K Box members could have been obtained by the cyber-attacker on\nor around 23 April 2014 for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe List stopped at the member record that was created on 23\nApril 2014 at 5.43am;\n\n(b)\n\nThe CMS’s “user activity 2014.csv” (“User Activity Log File”)\nrecorded that someone had logged in using the ‘admin’ account\non 23 April 2014 at 9.59am;\n\n(c)\n\nA new member record was created on 23 April 2014 at 12.17pm\nbut this was not included in the List; and\n\n(d)\n\nSubsequent member records created after 23 April 2014 were\nalso not included in the List.\n\n17.\n\nThe User Activity Log File recorded that the user of the ‘admin’ account\nhad logged in on 23 April 2014. The ‘admin’ user account was the\naccount used by Finantech’s former employee, Mrs G. However, given\nthat Mrs G had already left Finantech on or around 2013 and there was\nno evidence to suggest that she had been remotely accessing the\n‘admin’ account, any use of this account after Mrs G had left Finantech\nwould likely have been unauthorised and could be taken to be done by\nthe cyber-attacker.\n\n18.\n\nWhile it is possible that the data breach occurred on or around 23 April\n2014, as there was evidence of unauthorised access to K Box’s CMS\nsystem in April 2014 or even earlier in 2013, the Commission is of the\nview that further data breaches could also have occurred in the following\nmonths until the new CMS was put in place in November 2014 for the\nfollowing reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe message “Remote session from client name a exceeded the\nmaximum allowed failed logon attempts (sic.). The session was\nforcibly terminated”, indicating that more than 240 attempts were\nmade in a single day, appeared frequently in the operating system\nlog (“System Log”). The frequency of these messages may\nindicate unsuccessful attempts to hack into the operating system.\nThe messages started appearing as early as October 2012 and\ncontinued until the latest parts of the log file in September 2014;\nand\n\n5\n\n\f(b)\n\nFinantech itself noted that the System Log showed that the\n“[unauthorised user of the ‘admin’ account] was used to login a\nnumber of times after the breach. However, there was no\nindication that he had modified any user data.” The Commission\nhas reviewed the System Log and the unauthorised user of the\n‘admin’ account had performed about 83 logins in the period from\n25 February 2014 to 16 September 2014, and about 15 logins in\nthe entire calendar year 2013.\n\nProbable Cause of Breach\n19.\n\nWhile the List only contains members’ data up to 23 April 2014, given\nthe number of times the unauthorised user of the ‘admin’ account had\nlogged in to K Box’s CMS system, it is possible that the cyber-attacker\nhad accessed K Box’s CMS system after 2 July 2014 when the data\nprotection provisions in the PDPA came into effect, but chose to publish\nthe List reflecting the members’ list as at 23 April 2014.\n\n20.\n\nFinantech had hypothesised that someone hacked into K Box’s CMS\nusing the ‘admin’ user account with ‘admin’ password and planted a\nmalware control and command centre to retrieve and export the\nmembers’ data. K Box similarly represented that Mr G had informed Mr\nC that the breach occurred because “he suspected someone used\nadmin user account with the password also admin to login (sic.)” and\n“[Redacted] (Mr G) told me there was a Trojan in the hosting server and\nhe suspected that was how the leak occurred (sic.)”.\n\n21.\n\nWhile the System Log showed unauthorised usage of the ‘admin’ user\naccount in 2014 and files detected as malware were found in the CMS\nfolder, the Commission has not been able to conclusively verify\nFinantech’s hypothesis even after analysing the User Activity Log File\nand System Log. Nonetheless, the Commission considers that the\n‘admin’ user account, which had a weak password “admin” was one of\nthe possible ways that the data breach could have occurred.\n\n22.\n\nHaving reviewed the relevant facts and circumstances, including the\nstatements and representations made by K Box and Finantech, the\nCommission has completed its investigation into the matter, and sets out\nits findings and assessment herein.\n\n6\n\n\fTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\nIssues for Determination\n23.\n\nThe issues to be determined in the present case are as follows:\n(A)\n\nWhether K Box had breached its obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA (the “Protection Obligation”);\n\n(B)\n\nWhether K Box had breached its obligation under sections 11 and\n12 of the PDPA (the “Openness Obligation”), specifically,\nsections 11(3) and 12(a), for failure to appoint a DPO and put in\nplace privacy policies and practices in contravention of those\nsections of the PDPA;\n\n(C)\n\nWhether Finantech is a data intermediary of K Box; and\n\n(D)\n\nWhether Finantech had breached the Protection Obligation.\n\nIssue A: Whether K Box had breached the Protection Obligation\n24.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA states:\n“Protection of personal data\n24.\nAn organisation shall protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.”\n\n25.\n\nPursuant to section 24 of the PDPA, K Box, being an organisation which\nhad its members’ personal data under its possession and/or control, is\nrequired to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risk. The Protection Obligation applies equally to all\npersonal data in the possession or under the control of the organisation,\nincluding personal data that the organisation may have collected before\n2 July 2014, when the data protection provisions under Parts III to VI of\nthe PDPA came into effect.\n\n26.\n\nFollowing a careful assessment of the relevant facts and circumstances,\nthe Commission is of the view that K Box had not discharged the\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. There are sufficient\ngrounds (whether each on its own or altogether) to show that K Box\nfailed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal\n\n7\n\n\fdata in its possession or under its control from 2 July 2014 to November\n2014. In particular, the Commission has identified the following\nvulnerabilities in K Box’s security arrangements which show how K Box\nfailed to make reasonable security arrangements to protect the\nmembers’ personal data:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nK Box could have, but failed to enforce its password policy, at\nleast between 2 July 2014 and November 2014, thereby\npermitting the use of weak passwords:\n(i)\n\nAs noted at paragraph 9 above, K Box did not “conduct\naudit on whether the staff really use eight numbers/letters\nalphanumeric, one capital and one special case password\n(sic.)”; and\n\n(ii)\n\nEven though it is a common industry practice to implement\nan organisation’s password policy in its system, K Box had\nnot done so earlier and the feature where the system would\nenforce the password policy by rejecting passwords that\ndid not meet the password policy was only built into the\nCMS system in November 2014.\n\nK Box had weak control over unused accounts, specifically,\nunused accounts were not removed:\n(i)\n\nAs stated at paragraph 14 above, as many as 36 accounts\nwere removed from the CMS system on 17 September\n2014, which suggests that K Box may not have had the\npractice of deleting the accounts of staff that had left the\ncompany until it conducted the review on 17 September\n2014. This is despite the fact that K Box was able to\nremove the unused accounts within a day after the List had\nbeen disclosed online which shows that K Box could have\neasily removed the unused CMS accounts earlier but it had\nfailed to do so;\n\n(ii)\n\nAs a result of K Box and/or Finantech’s failure to promptly\nremove unused accounts from the CMS system, the\nunused administrative CMS account with the user name\n‘admin’ and a weak password of ‘admin’ remained in the\nCMS for about one year after Mrs G had left Finantech.\nThis had put the personal data of K Box’s members at risk\nbecause as noted at paragraph 20 above, Finantech itself\nhad hypothesised that someone could have hacked into K\n8\n\n\fBox’s CMS using this ‘admin’ user account and planted a\nmalware control and command centre to retrieve and\nexport the members’ data.; and\n(iii)\n\n(c)\n\n27.\n\nFurther, as noted at paragraph 18 above, there was\nevidence of multiple unauthorised accesses to the CMS\nsystem through this ‘admin’ user account in 2013 and\nbetween 25 February 2014 and 16 September 2014. As\nsuch, it is possible that K Box members’ personal data\ncould have been further compromised through this ‘admin’\nuser account between 2 July 2014 and 16 September 2014\nas a result of the failure to remove the unused\nadministrative account.\n\nK Box failed to utilise newer versions of the software library and/or\nto conduct audits of the security of its database and system:\n(i)\n\nK Box’s CMS system utilised an older version of the\nFCKEditor which according to security vulnerability website\nCVE, had at least 9 known vulnerabilities which would have\nallowed cyber-attackers to install remote shells and\nexecute malicious codes and to execute such codes to\nextract the full member list from the database. Even though\nthis vulnerability could have been prevented by utilising\nnewer versions of the software library or by patching,\nFinantech, whose role was to manage the CMS system,\nhad failed to do either; and\n\n(ii)\n\nK Box had also failed to conduct audits to supervise the\nsecurity of its database and system. As noted at paragraph\n10 above, Finantech admitted that it did not carry out any\nsystem monitoring in terms of IT security, security testing\nor regular IT security audits at the time of the breach and\nprior to 17 September 2014.\n\nK Box’s weak enforcement of their password policy and weak control of\nunused accounts and passwords alone could have enabled an attacker\nto gain access to substantial personal data simply through the CMS\nsystem. Furthermore, K Box’s use of vulnerable software could have\nallowed the attacker to gain access to the system beyond the CMS\nlimitations and to perform direct access to all data from K Box’s database\nand potentially misuse the personal data.\n\n9\n\n\f28.\n\nThe vulnerabilities set out above demonstrate that K Box could have\ndone more to protect the members’ personal data that was in its\npossession or under its control. When viewed in totality, the Commission\nis of the view that K Box had failed to make reasonable security\narrangements to protect the members’ personal data because these\nvulnerabilities were preventable and were likely the main reasons for the\ndata breach and subsequent disclosure of the List on 16 September\n2014. In this regard, while K Box had outsourced the developing, hosting\nand managing of its CMS system to Finantech, it was still the data\ncontroller and was ultimately responsible for the security of the CMS\nsystem.\n\n29.\n\nApart from the system-related shortcomings highlighted above,\ninvestigations disclosed that there was also poor practises.\n(a)\n\nEmails containing large volume of personal data were sent via\nGmail without any password-protection or encryption:\n(i)\n\n(b)\n\nEven though the unauthorised access to the personal data\nof about “317,000” K Box members was not caused by a\nbreach that was the result of the use of unencrypted\nemails, as noted at paragraph 7 above, Finantech had\npreviously sent K Box over 90,000 members’ personal data\nvia unencrypted email via Gmail. The practice of sending\nlarge volumes of members’ personal data via unencrypted\nemail is a vulnerability and an example of how K Box had\nnot sufficiently protected the members’ personal data. The\nbetter practice would have been for Finantech to encrypt or\nto ensure that the MS Excel document containing the list of\nmembers’ personal data was password protected before\nsending it to K Box.3\n\nK Box failed to effectively manage its vendor (Finantech) to\nensure that they undertook adequate measures to protect\nmembers’ personal data:\n(i)\n\nFor the reasons stated at paragraphs 33 and 34 below, the\nCommission finds that Finantech is a data intermediary of\nK Box and pursuant to section 4(3) of the PDPA, K Box has\nthe same obligations in respect of the personal data\nprocessed on its behalf and for its purpose by Finantech as\nif the personal data were processed by K Box itself. As\nhighlighted in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on\n\n10\n\n\fKey Concepts in the PDPA issued on 23 September 2013\n(at paragraph 6.21) that:\n“… it is very important that an organisation is clear\nas to its rights and obligations when dealing with\nanother organisation and, where appropriate,\ninclude provisions in their written contracts to\nclearly set out each organisation’s responsibilities\nand liabilities in relation to the personal data in\nquestion including whether one organisation is to\nprocess personal data on behalf of and for the purposes\nof the other organisation.”\n[Emphasis added.]; and\n(ii)\n\n30.\n\nHowever, as noted at paragraph 12 above, K Box failed to\nensure that its data intermediary, Finantech, complied with\na standard of protection in relation to the personal data\ntransferred to it that is at least comparable to industry\nstandards through its agreements and in its interactions\nwith Finantech.\n\nOn the facts of the case and the assessment conducted, the\nCommission finds that both K Box and Finantech did not put in place\nadequate IT security arrangements between 2 July 2014 and November\n2014, prior to the implementation of the new CMS system in November\n2014.\n\nIssue B: Whether K Box had breached the Openness Obligation\n31.\n\nSections 11 and 12 of the PDPA together constitute the Openness\nObligation under the PDPA, which provides that an organisation must\nimplement the necessary policies and procedures in order to meet its\nobligations under the PDPA and shall make information about its policies\nand procedures publicly available. In particular, section 11(3) of the\nPDPA provides that an organisation shall designate one or more\nindividuals, a DPO, to be responsible for ensuring that the organisation\ncomplies with the PDPA. In the same vein, section 12(a) of the PDPA\nrequires organisations to develop and implement policies and practices\nthat are necessary for the organisation to meet the obligations of the\norganisations under the PDPA.\n\n32.\n\nBased on investigations and representations made by K Box, the\nCommission is not satisfied that K Box has complied with the Openness\n\n11\n\n\fObligation under sections 11(3) and 12(a) of the PDPA. To begin with,\nas noted at paragraph 11 above, K Box conceded in its representations\nthat it did not have a comprehensive privacy policy prior to 16 September\n2014. By K Box’s own admission, as there was no policy and physical or\nonline security system in place to monitor whether a staff removed\npersonal data from its premises, a K Box staff could have simply copied\nthe member’s list it received from Finantech and abused that list. In\naddition, K Box had also represented that it did not have a DPO. In fact,\nto date, it is unclear whether K Box has appointed a DPO because Mr C\nrepresented that K Box was in the midst of appointing a DPO even as\nlate as 20 April 2015 when he gave his statement to the Commission. In\nlight of the foregoing lapses, the Commission finds that K Box has been\nin breach of the Openness Obligation.\nIssue C: Whether Finantech is a data intermediary of K Box\n33.\n\nUnder section 2(1) of the PDPA, a “data intermediary” is an organisation\nwhich processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but\ndoes not include an employee of that other organisation. The term\n“processing” in relation to personal data means the carrying out of any\noperation or set of operations in relation to the personal data and\nincludes, but is not limited to, any of the following: recording; holding;\norganisation, adaptation or alteration; retrieval; combination;\ntransmission; erasure or destruction.4 Section 4(2) of the PDPA confers\non a data intermediary the obligation to protect personal data under\nsection 24 of the PDPA and the obligation to cease to retain personal\ndata under section 25 of the PDPA. Save for the aforementioned\nobligations, Parts III to VI of the PDPA do not impose any other\nobligations on the data intermediary.\n\n34.\n\nHaving considered the facts and the representations made by K Box and\nFinantech, the Commission is satisfied that Finantech is a data\nintermediary of K Box. The fact that (i) K Box employees, including K\nBox’s IT manager and the Chief Operating Officer, only had restricted\naccess to the information of members, and (ii) K Box relied on Mr G to\nextract and send them members’ personal data with selected criteria\nfrom the database clearly shows that in practice, Finantech processed\n(by having access to, storing and retrieving) all personal data of K Box’s\ncustomers pursuant to the arrangement between Finantech and K Box.\n\n35.\n\nNotwithstanding that the “contracts”, which were in fact quotations sent\nby Finantech to K Box for their confirmation and acceptance, pre-date\nthe commencement of the data protection provisions of the PDPA and\ndo not identify Finantech as a data intermediary of K Box, in light of the\n\n12\n\n\fabove practices which continued after the commencement of the data\nprotection provisions, the Commission finds that Finantech is a data\nintermediary of K Box for the purposes of the PDPA.\nIssue D: Whether Finantech had breached the Protection Obligation\n36.\n\nSection 24 read with section 4(2) of the PDPA confers an obligation on\nthe data intermediary to “[make] reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification, disposal or similar risks”. In view of the Commission’s\nfinding that Finantech is a data intermediary of K Box, Finantech is\nrequired to comply with the obligation under section 24 of the PDPA to\nprotect the personal data that it was processing on behalf of K Box.\n\n37.\n\nIn this regard, on the facts and circumstances, the Commission is of the\nview that Finantech had failed to put in place the required security\nmeasures that K Box needed in order to provide adequate protection for\nthe personal data in K Box’s database and system. In particular, the\nCommission notes that Finantech had been involved in the setting up\nand day-to-day processing of K Box’s personal databases from 2007. By\ndint of its role and function, Finantech is expected to up hold a certain\nbasic professional standard and the vulnerabilities identified at\nparagraphs 26 to 29 above show that Finantech had not undertaken due\ndiligence in executing its role. Finantech’s failures had led to multiple\nunauthorised accesses and Finantech had put the personal data of K\nBox’s members at risk.\n\n38.\n\nIf Finantech had advised K Box on its obligations but K Box had rejected\ntheir advice, the Commission could have taken this into account in its\nassessment of Finantech’s culpability. However, investigations did not\ndisclose any evidence to suggest that Finantech had actually advised K\nBox of the need to have in place adequate security measures to protect\nthe personal data in K Box’s database. In fact, as stated at paragraph\n12 above, Mr G admitted that he was only aware of the existence of the\nPDPA but not the specifics.\n\n39.\n\nIn view of all the relevant facts and circumstances, the Commission is\nnot satisfied that Finantech has complied with the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n40.\n\nUnder section 29(1) of the PDPA, the Commission may, “if it is satisfied\nthat an organisation is not complying with any provision in Parts III to VI\n\n13\n\n\fof the Act, give the organisation such directions as the Commission\nthinks fit in the circumstances to ensure compliance with that provision.”\nSection 29(2) of the PDPA also empowers the Commission to make all\nor any of the following directions:\n(a)\n\nTo stop collecting, using or disclosing personal data in\ncontravention of this Act;\n\n(b)\n\nTo destroy personal data collected in contravention of this Act;\n\n(c)\n\nTo comply with any direction of the Commission under section\n28(2) of the Act; and\n\n(d)\n\nTo pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1\nmillion as the Commission thinks fit.\n\nOther Factors Considered\n41.\n\nIn assessing the breach and the remedial directions to be imposed, the\nCommission took into consideration various factors relating to the case,\nincluding the mitigating and aggravating factors set out below.\n\nK Box’s Breach of the Protection Obligation and the Openness Obligation\n42.\n\nIn relation to K Box’s breach of the Protection Obligation and the\nOpenness Obligation, the Commission took into account the following\nfactors:\n(a)\n\nThe remedial actions undertaken by K Box were fair and prompt\nwhen they discovered the data breach in September 2014;\n\n(b)\n\nMost of the remedial actions were taken either in September or\nNovember 2014;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Commission found no evidence to suggest that the data\nbreach was due to actions taken by K Box staff, through the CMS\nsystem;\n\n(d)\n\nA fairly large amount of personal data (approximately “317,000” K\nBox members or more) had been disclosed as a result of the lack\nof security. The personal data comprising their full names, contact\nnumbers, email addresses, residential addresses, contact\nnumbers, gender, profession, date of birth, and member number\nwere sensitive data because it could have led to identify theft;\n\n14\n\n\f(e)\n\nK Box (as the primary data owner) had disregarded its obligations\nunder the PDPA. K Box had ample opportunities to put in place\nreasonable security measures from 2 January 2013 to 2 July 2014\nbut it did not do so. K Box had also failed to appoint a DPO or put\nin place privacy policies or practices as late as April 2015. K Box\nhad also failed to put in place data protection terms and conditions\nin its contract with Finantech, and instructed it (as the main data\nprocessor of K Box members’ personal data) to protect personal\ndata; and\n\n(f)\n\nK Box was not forthcoming in providing information during the\ninvestigation. They had only provided bare facts in their\nresponses during the investigations, which did not facilitate the\nCommission’s investigations.\n\nFinantech’s breach of the Protection Obligation\n43.\n\nIn relation to Finantech’s breach of the Protection Obligation, the\nfollowing factors were taken into consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe remedial actions undertaken by Finantech were fair and\nprompt when they discovered the data breach in September 2014;\n\n(b)\n\nMost of the remedial actions were taken either in September or\nNovember 2014;\n\n(c)\n\nA fairly large amount of personal data (approximately “317,000” K\nBox members or more) had been put at risk as a result of the lack\nof security. The personal data comprising their full names, contact\nnumbers, email addresses, residential addresses, contact\nnumbers, gender, profession, date of birth, and member number\nwere sensitive data because it could have led to identify theft;\n\n(d)\n\nFinantech as the data intermediary had disregarded its\nobligations under the PDPA. Finantech had ample opportunities\nto put in place reasonable security measures from 2 January 2013\nto 2 July 2014 but it did not. There was no evidence to show that\nFinantech had advised K Box on the reasonable security\nmeasures that the owner of an online system ought to implement\nin order to protect personal data held by the system; and\n\n(e)\n\nFinantech appeared not to be forthcoming in providing information\nduring the investigation. Although the Notices to Require\nProduction of Documents and Information under the Ninth\n\n15\n\n\fSchedule of the PDPA (“NTPs”) were sent to Finantech as early\nas October 2014, Finantech’s responses to these NTPs were only\nprovided in April 2015 – almost seven months after the NTPs were\nfirst issued. This delayed the investigation process.\n44.\n\n45.\n\nHaving completed its investigation and assessment of this matter, the\nCommission is satisfied that K Box has been in breach of the Protection\nObligation under section 24 of the PDPA and the Openness Obligation\nunder sections 11(3) and 12(a) of the PDPA for the reasons cited in\nparagraphs 26 to 28 and paragraph 31 above. Pursuant to section 29(2)\nof the PDPA, the Commission hereby directs K Box to do as follows:\n(a)\n\nPay a financial penalty of $50,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe Commission’s direction, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nAppoint a DPO within 30 days from the date of the Commission’s\ndirection (if it has not already done so).\n\nThe Commission is also satisfied that Finantech has not complied with\nthe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the Act for the reasons\ncited in paragraphs 33, 34, 36 and 37 above. Pursuant to section 29(2)\nof the PDPA, the Commission hereby directs Finantech to do as follows:\n(a)\n\n46.\n\nPay a financial penalty of $10,000 within 30 days from the date of\nthe Commission’s direction, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any\ninstance of non-compliance under the PDPA and with the Commission’s\ndirections.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n16\n\n\f1 Mr G was the only employee at the material time of Finantech.

IES was formally established\non July 1966 as the national society of engineers in Singapore. Its functions\ninclude the accreditation of engineering academic programmes (through its\nEngineering Accreditation Board); the maintenance of professional registries;\nand the promotion of social, business, professional, and career development\namongst engineers in Singapore.\n\nThe IES Website\n2.\n\nIES operates a website at www.ies.org.sg (“Site”), which consists of both\npublicly-accessible pages, and a members’ portal, accessible only by\nmembers of IES, upon logging into the portal with their respective user\nidentifications (“IDs”) and passwords. The Site also allows members of the\npublic, who are non-IES members, to create an account on the Site in order to\nlogin to access and post on the Site’s forums.\n\n3.\n\nAccording to information provided by IES, the functions of the Site include:\n(a)\n\nenabling members to update their membership details such as\naddresses, emails and contact information;\n\n(b)\n\napplying for courses and events that are created by IES;\n\n(c)\n\napplying for email\nabc@ies.org.sg;\n\n(d)\n\npayment for membership and courses via PayPal;\n\n(e)\n\naccessing webmail;\n\n(f)\n\nallowing members to search for information about other members;\n\naddresses\n\nwith\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nies.org.sg\n\ndomain,\n\ne.g.,\n\nPage 1 of 9\n\n\f4.\n\n(g)\n\npublishing information on IES events, courses, seminars, job listings,\nand information on various registries (e.g., ABC Waters Professional\nRegistry and others);\n\n(h)\n\napplying for IES membership; and\n\n(i)\n\naccessing IES forums.\n\nMembers of IES who log in to the Site using their membership user IDs are\nable to access certain dedicated membership Site functions, including receipt\nof ad hoc AGM notices, quick poll functions, profile updates, and change of\npasswords.\n\nData Leak Incident\n5.\n\nOn 1 October 2014, the Personal Data Protection Commission\n(“Commission”) was informed that the information of users of the Site had\nbeen posted on http://pastebin.com (“Pastebin”), a website which allows\nmembers of the public to post and share information online (the “Data Leak”).\n\n6.\n\nThe relevant information was ostensibly uploaded onto the Pastebin website\nby a Pastebin user with the username “KAMI_HAXOR”, in the form of two\nposts in plain text that could be publicly viewed by any visitor to the Pastebin\nwebsite. The two posts were dated 30 September 2014 and were respectively\ncaptioned:\n(a)\n\n“IES.ORG.SG 6,000+ Usersnames + pass Leaked by KaMi HaX” (the\n“User ID List”); and\n\n(b)\n\n“Ies.org.sg 60,000+ Users Data Leaked by KaMi HaXor” (the\n“Additional List”).\n\n7.\n\nThe User ID List was titled “The Institution of Engineers Singapore 6000=\n[sic.] users , 90,000+ Mobiles leaked By KaMi HaXor… Target=\nhttp://www.ies.org.sg/”, and contained a list of characters separated with a\ncolon, in the format “XXXX:XXXX”, which was labelled “MemberId:Pass”.\n\n8.\n\nThe Additional List was titled “The Institution of Engineers Singapore 60,000+\nMobiles leaked By KaMi HaXor… Target= http://www.ies.org.sg/”, and\ncontained a list of eight-digit numbers that were consistent with the format of\nSingapore telephone numbers.\n\n9.\n\nIn light of the information received, the Commission commenced an\ninvestigation under section 50 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (No.\n26 of 2012) (the “Act”) to ascertain whether there had been a breach by IES\nof its obligations under the Act.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 2 of 9\n\n\fNature of the Data Leak Incident\n10.\n\nIES informed the Commission that the passwords and IDs in the User ID List\nwere those of IES members and that it was made aware of the Data Leak by\none Nicholas Lee, who had written to IES on 1 October 2014 at 10.13 am, to\ninform IES about the Data Leak.\n\n11.\n\nIES also provided the Commission with a copy of a Site audit report which\nwas conducted by its website vendor, Forecepts Pte. Ltd. (“Forecepts”),\nusing Acunetix software, in the aftermath of the Data Leak. The report, titled\n“Acutenix Website Audit Developer Report”, dated 3 November 2014 (“1st\nScan Report”) indicated a number of vulnerabilities with the Site, including 48\nhigh-severity vulnerabilities in the Site set out below:\nHigh-Severity Type Vulnerability Identified\nBlind SQL Injection\nCross site scripting\nCross site scripting (verified)\nCross site scripting [stored] (verified)\nFCKeditor spellchecker.php cross site scripting\nvulnerability\nHTML Form found in redirect page [high severity]\njQuery Cross Site Scripting\nPHP allow_url_fopen enabled\n\nVariation\n1\n8\n30\n1\n2\n4\n1\n1\n\n12.\n\nForecepts suspected that the attack on the Site was likely to have been\ncaused by cross-site scripting but was unable to confirm this. In any case, the\nCommission notes that cross-site scripting was identified in the 1st Scan\nReport as a high-severity vulnerability that existed in the Site.\n\n13.\n\nIn relation to the number of individuals affected by the Data Leak, the\nCommission notes that the titles of the User ID List and the Additional List\nrespectively indicate that the data of more than 6,000 users had been\ndisclosed in the User ID List, and that the data of more than 60,000 users had\nbeen disclosed in the Additional List. However, IES submitted that it was\nunable to identify the total number of IES members which were affected by\nthe Data Leak, as the “data published online are in random”.\n\n14.\n\nAt the time of this decision, both the User ID List and the Additional List\nappear to have been removed from the Pastebin website.\n\n15.\n\nHaving reviewed the relevant facts and circumstances, including the written\nresponses to the NTPs submitted by IES, the Commission sets out below its\nfindings and assessment in relation to the Data Leak.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 3 of 9\n\n\fTHE COMMISSION’S FINDINGS AND ASSESSMENT\nPersonal Data Leaked\n16.\n\n“Personal data” is defined under section 2 of the Act, as follows:\n“‘personal data’ means data, whether true or not, about an\nindividual who can be identified –\n(a)\n\nfrom that data; or\n\n(b)\n\nfrom that data and other information to which the\norganisation has or is likely to have access.”\n\n17.\n\nAs noted above, IES admitted that the passwords and IDs in the User ID List\nbelonged to its members. According to publicly-available information on the\nSite, IES’s membership comprises both individuals and organisations.\nOrganisation members may be represented in IES by up to two individuals\nfrom the organisation. Individuals who are not part of any organisation can\nalso join as members of IES with the relevant engineering qualifications.\n\n18.\n\nIES also acknowledged that the personal data of its members was stored in\nits web server and could be retrieved using the members’ respective user IDs\nand passwords. In particular, IES stated that “personal data such as Member\nID, Name, Contact, Email and Address were stored in the database in\nwww.ies.org.sg.”\n\n19.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, it is clear that the person or persons who had\nobtained and posted the User ID List on the Pastebin website in the first\nplace, as well as any member of the public who came across the User ID List\non the Pastebin website, could have used the IDs and passwords disclosed to\nlog in to the accounts of individual and organisation members (represented by\ntheir nominated employees) on the Site, and thereby access personal data\nrelating to these members that was stored on the Site.\n\n20.\n\nFurthermore, given that anyone who had obtained a valid user ID and\npassword combination would have been able to log in to the Site to retrieve\npersonal details relating to the respective IES member, the Commission is of\nthe view that anyone with a valid user ID and password combination would\neffectively be able to access the entire profile of an IES member and identify\nhim or her. Accordingly, the Commission is of the view that the user IDs and\npasswords that were leaked would fall within the definition of “personal data”\nunder the Act.\n\n21.\n\nThe Commission notes that IES had taken the view that the possibility of any\nindividual using the information in the User ID List to access the personal data\nin IES’s webserver was remote as the listing of user IDs and passwords were\n“random, unrelated and unlinked”. IES was also of the view that it was unlikely\nthat the person or persons who had obtained and posted the User ID List on\nthe Pastebin website had used the IDs and passwords displayed to log in to\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 4 of 9\n\n\fthe accounts of its members on the Site to access personal data stored on the\nSite “or he would have placed the relevant information in a different\n(database) format” (sic).\n22.\n\nThe Commission disagrees with the views expressed by IES. The risk of\naccess by any individual using the user IDs and passwords combination in the\nUser ID List is not remote. The User ID list is effectively a dictionary of valid\nuser IDs and passwords that can be used in a dictionary attack. With\nautomatic scripting, an individual can log in to any IES member’s account\nnotwithstanding that the manner in which the user IDs and passwords had\nbeen presented in the list appeared “random, unrelated and unlinked”. Indeed,\nthe Commission cannot exclude the possibility that the person or persons who\nhad obtained and posted the User ID List on the Pastebin website may have\nalready done so notwithstanding the lack of complaints of abuse of personal\ndata from IES members thus far.\n\n23.\n\nAccordingly, it is clear that, as a result of the Data Leak, the security of\npersonal data relating to IES members was compromised as such personal\ndata could have been accessed by one or more unauthorised persons with\nknowledge of the leaked user IDs and passwords.\n\nPersonal Data under the Possession and Control of IES\n24.\n\nThe Commission notes that, at all material times, the Site was fully owned and\nadministered by IES. For completeness, the Commission also notes that\nalthough IES had engaged two vendors for the Site, these vendors undertook\ntheir respective functions on behalf of IES and did not own or administer the\nSite:\n(a)\n\nForecepts, as IES’s website vendor, was engaged to supply and\ndesign the website design and Content Management System.\nForecepts was also engaged to provide maintenance to the Site, but\nonly upon request by IES; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe Site was hosted at the premises of ReadySpace (SG) Pte Ltd\n(“ReadySpace”), IES’s hosting service provider, on a dedicated server.\n\n25.\n\nFurther, the Commission’s investigations found that there were four\nindividuals within IES who could access the list of member IDs and passwords\nand personal data relating to IES members. These were IES’s IT manager, IT\nexecutive, membership manager, and membership executive.\n\n26.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission is satisfied that, at all material times, the\nrelevant personal data of IES members, which was stored on the Site and\nwhose security was compromised as a result of the Data Leak, was in the\npossession and/or under the control of IES.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 5 of 9\n\n\fAdequacy of Security Arrangements\n27.\n\nSection 24 of the Act states:\n“Protection of personal data\n24.\nAn organisation shall protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks.”\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to section 24 of the Act, IES, being an organisation which had its\nmembers’ personal data under its possession and/or control, is required to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the\n“Protection Obligation”).\n\n29.\n\nIES informed the Commission that it had put in place the following security\nmeasures at the material time:\n\n30.\n\n(a)\n\nthe Site’s server was hosted in a secure site and in a dedicated server,\nand protected by a firewall and anti-virus software (namely, Parallels\nPlesk Panel 11.0.9);\n\n(b)\n\nsoftware updates had been performed on the Parallels Plesk Panel\n11.0.9 firewall and anti-virus software; and\n\n(c)\n\na list of user IDs and passwords relating to the IES members could be\nextracted from the members’ portal and saved; however such a\nfunction could only be performed by the four individuals within IES who\ncould access the list of member IDs and passwords (namely, IES’s IT\nmanager, IT executive, membership manager, and member executive).\nForecepts was also authorised to access such a function for the\npurposes of maintaining, troubleshooting, and updating the Site.\n\nHowever, from the Commission’s investigations, it was also apparent that:\n(a)\n\nthe Site had not provided for the encrypted storage of member\npasswords;\n\n(b)\n\nprior to the Data Leak, no audit had been conducted on ReadySpace’s\nenterprise hosting services and/or the security of the Site;\n\n(c)\n\nIES had not conducted any penetration testing on the Site, and was not\naware of penetration testing software; and\n\n(d)\n\nwhile IES represented that it had made phone calls to its vendors\nReadySpace and Forecepts to inform them about the Act, there was no\nindication that IES had otherwise given instructions to its vendors to\nmake security arrangements so as to ensure that personal data stored\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 6 of 9\n\n\fin the Site would be protected in compliance with IES’s obligations\nunder the Act. Furthermore, the contractual terms between IES and its\nvendors, as submitted by IES, did not appear to contain any specific\nsecurity arrangements or requirements for its vendors to put in place\nsecurity measures to safeguard IES members’ personal data stored in\nthe Site.\n31.\n\nIn addition, as already mentioned earlier, the 1st Scan Report by Forecepts\nfollowing the Data Leak indicated that there existed a number of vulnerabilities\nwith the Site, including 48 high-severity vulnerabilities such as cross-site\nscripting and SQL injections.\n\n32.\n\nCross-site scripting is a common web vulnerability, which could have been\neasily detected by performing a vulnerability scan, such as the one performed\nby Forecepts after the Data Leak. Once identified, the vulnerabilities can be\npatched according to the many guides that are readily available on the\nInternet. The conduct of vulnerability scans using automated tools like\nAcunetix is considered industry best practice.\n\n33.\n\nIn this case, IES acknowledged that it had not undertaken any sort of audit to\ndetect security vulnerabilities on the Site. IES had also not demonstrated that\nit had made any effort to require its vendors to evaluate and/or ensure the\nsecurity of personal data stored on the Site.\n\n34.\n\nWhile the Site may have had a firewall and anti-virus software in place, these\nmeasures alone were clearly inadequate to reasonably ensure the security of\npersonal data stored in the Site, as the firewall and anti-virus software would\nnot protect against common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting. This\nwould have been apparent, and indeed was made apparent, by a vulnerability\nscan such as the one conducted by Forecepts after the Data Leak.\n\n35.\n\nFrom the above, it would appear that prior to the Data Leak, IES had made\ninsufficient effort to inquire into and/or ensure the security of personal data\nstored on the Site. As a result, numerous security vulnerabilities existed in the\nSite at the time of the Data Leak, which could have been reasonably detected\nand patched by available means.\n\n36.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Commission is of the view that IES has failed to\nmake reasonable security arrangements in respect of personal data relating to\nits members, as required under the Protection Obligation.\n\nTHE COMMISSION’S DIRECTIONS\n37.\n\nIn its representations to the Commission, IES took the position that it was a\nsmall organisation that had relied on external specialists for security related\nadvice and hence should not be heavily penalised for any breaches of the\ndata protection provisions. IES was of the view that its external specialists had\nnot advised any actions on possible areas of protection and/or detection until\nthe breach to the Site occurred.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 7 of 9\n\n\f38.\n\nHowever, the Commission notes that IES’ claims regarding its reliance on\nexternal specialists were not borne out by the investigations. Further, IES, as\nan organisation with several thousand members, cannot be described as “a\nsmall organisation”.\n\n39.\n\nIn determining the directions to be given to IES, the Commission has given\ndue consideration to all the relevant factors, including the following:\n(a)\n\nIES was cooperative and forthcoming throughout the Commission’s\ninvestigation;\n\n(b)\n\nfollowing its discovery of the Data Leak on 1 October 2014, IES\npromptly took the following measures to manage the effects of the Data\nLeak:\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(i)\n\ndisabling of the members’ portal on the Site;\n\n(ii)\n\nchanging of the passwords for all IES members’ accounts, and\nresetting of the passwords for its administrator accounts in the\nmembers’ portal;\n\n(iii)\n\non 2 October 2014, IES sent an email notification to all IES\nmembers, informing them of the “hacking activity” on the Site, as\nwell as the measures (listed in (i) and (ii) of this paragraph\n43(b)) IES had taken to minimise damage; and\n\n(iv)\n\nremoval of the telephone numbers and addresses of IES\nmembers previously stored on the database of the Site;\n\nfollowing the Data Leak, IES implemented the following additional\nsecurity measures:\n(i)\n\ninstructed Forecepts to conduct a security audit of the Site and\nto patch up any vulnerabilities detected pursuant to such audit,\nand to conduct a monthly audit on the Site upon completion of\nthe security hardening process;\n\n(ii)\n\ninstallation of a new intrusion detection system, along with\nendpoint protection in the Site’s server; and\n\n(iii)\n\ninstallation of Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) certification in the\nSite’s server; and\n\nthe high-severity vulnerabilities identified in the 1st Scan Report\npursuant to Forecepts’ audit of the Site appear, from the Acunetix\nWebsite Audit Developer Report dated 12 January 2015, which was\nprovided by IES to the Commission, (“2nd Scan Report”), to have been\npatched by Forecepts.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 8 of 9\n\n\f40.\n\nPursuant to section 29(2), and having completed its investigations and\nassessment of this matter, the Commission is satisfied that IES was in breach\nof the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA. Having carefully\nconsidered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commission hereby directs\nIES to do the following:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n41.\n\nIES shall within 60 days from the date of the Commission’s direction:\n(i)\n\nconduct a further vulnerability scan of the Site; and\n\n(ii)\n\npatch all vulnerabilities identified by such scan;\n\nIES shall, in addition, submit to the Commission by no later than 14\ndays after the conduct of the abovementioned vulnerability scan, a\nwritten update providing details on:\n(i)\n\nthe results of the vulnerability scan; and\n\n(ii)\n\nthe measures that were taken by IES to patch all vulnerabilities\nidentified by the vulnerability scan; and\n\nIES shall pay a financial penalty of S$10,000.00 within 30 days from\nthe date of the Commission’s direction, failing which interest shall be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty.\n\nThe Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance under the PDPA and with the Commission’s directions.\n\nLEONG KENG THAI\nCHAIRMAN\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 9 of 9\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Metro for failing to make reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access to personal data held in Metro’s IT systems.","tags":["Protection","Warning","Wholesale and Retail Trade","METRO"],"date":"2016-04-21","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Commissions-Decisions/grounds-of-decision---metro-(210416).pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of Protection Obligation by Metro","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2016/04/breach-of-protection-obligation-by-metro","timestamp":"2016-04-21","pdf-content":"DECISION OF THE PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCase Number: DP-1504-A421\nMETRO PTE LTD [Reg. No. 195700030E]\n... Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 7\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nBACKGROUND\n1.\n\nOn 21 April 2015, the Complainant, [Redacted] (Replaced with Ms C),\ncomplained to the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nthat she had been receiving calls from unknown numbers, and that when she\nconducted a search on Google, she discovered that her personal data and\nthose of her family members were posted online on http://siph0n.net (“Siph0n\nwebsite”). The Complainant had attributed the posting on the Siphon website\nto a data “leak” on the Respondent’s part.\n\nA.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n2.\n\nOn account of\nthe complaint made, the Commission undertook an\ninvestigation, and sought the Respondent’s response on the matter. The\nmaterial facts of the case are as follows.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent had acknowledged that the personal data that was posted on\nthe Siph0n website came from the database stored on its website, such data\ncomprising personal data of individuals.1\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent’s corporate website was developed and supported by Grey\nDigital Southeast Asia (also known as Yolk Pte Ltd) (“Grey Digital”). The\nwebsite was hosted by Limebox Hosting Solutions.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent’s corporate website (http://www.metro.com.sg) was hacked\ninto on 9 and 10 February 2014. Investigations were subsequently carried out\nby the Respondent’s IT (information technology) support partners, namely Grey\nDigital and Vodien Internet Solutions Pte Ltd (“Vodien”), into the hacking\nincidents. However, the investigations were unable to determine the cause of\nthe February 2014 hacking incidents or the person(s) that had carried out the\nhacking(s). The Respondent produced to the Commission a report from Grey\nDigital in respect of the two hacking incidents (“Grey Digital’s report”). The\nCommission understands that the Respondent had taken steps to improve on\nits web security following the hacking incidents in February 2014.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\f6.\n\nIn March 2015, it was discovered that the names, personal email addresses,\nNRIC numbers, personal mobile phone numbers, dates of birth and Facebook\nuser IDs of the Respondent’s customers were disclosed on the Siph0n website.\nThis included the personal data of the Complainant and her family, which forms\nthe subject of the complaint in this matter. The Respondent informed the\nCommission that the personal data that was posted on the Siph0n website was\nof 445 of its customers or users of the Respondent’s website.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing the March 2015 postings on the Siph0n website, the Respondent\ninstructed Grey Digital to remove any user information from the server of the\nhacked corporate website.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent also engaged KPMG Singapore to carry out an assessment\nand audit of the security of its internal as well as external i.e. internet-facing\nsystems. A copy of the report dated 19 May 2015 was produced to the\nCommission on 10 July 2015 (“KPMG report”).\n\n9.\n\nDuring its investigations, the Commission was informed by the Respondent that\nit had resolved several of the IT security issues raised in the KPMG report and\nthat it had intended to address / taken steps to address the remaining issues\nand to further improve on its website and server security.\n\nB.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\nRelevant issue in this case\n10. Arising from the posting of personal data on the Siph0n website found in March\n2015 and the IT security issues raised in the KPMG Report, the main issue in\nthis case is whether the Respondent had in place reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or control, as\nrequired under Section 24 of the PDPA, when it came into effect on 2 July\n2014.\n11. Section 24 of the PDPA states that an organisation is obliged to protect\npersonal data in its possession or control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure,\ncopying, modification, disposal or similar risks. Section 24 of the PDPA came\ninto effect on 2 July 2014.\nAssessment of whether Respondent had complied with Section 24 of the PDPA\n12. The Commission notes that the Respondent has attributed the postings that\nwere discovered in March 2015 to the two hacking incidents in February 2014.\nThe Respondent thus took the view that there was no further breach for the\ndisclosures on the Siph0n website made in March 2015 following the two\nincidents. The Commission, however, notes that the Respondent was under an\nobligation to ensure that reasonable security arrangements were put in place to\nprotect the personal data under Section 24 of the PDPA, when it came into\nforce on 2 July 2014.\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\f13. Despite the Respondent and/or Grey Digital apparently taking steps to improve\nthe security of the Respondent’s website and system following the two hacking\nincidents in February 2014, it was noted that the Respondent’s system still\ncontained numerous security issues and vulnerabilities when the security scan\nwas conducted from March 2015 to May 2015. This is evidenced by the KPMG\nreport dated 19 May 2015 that was produced to the Commission by the\nRespondent.\n14. In the KPMG report, KPMG had found 30 issues with the system, comprising of\n6 “Significant Issues”, 11 “Reportable Issues” and 13 “Observations”. Amongst\nthe issues raised, Commission notes that there were 3 significant issues and 1\nreportable issue with the external web application security, and 1 reportable\nissue in relation to the external network security.\n15. In this regard, there was at least one signfiicant issue in the KPMG report which\nis indicative of a failure of reasonable security arrangements even as of 19 May\n2015. This is the SQL injection vulnerability. The Commission understands that\nthe SQL injection vulnerability would have been found in the programming code\nof the Respondent’s external web applications, and may have been present in\nthese web applications from the outset. In the Commission’s view, this is a\ncommon and well-documented form of vulnerability that ought to have been\nreasonably anticipated, identified and rectified by the Respondent at an early\nstage.\n16. The Commission also notes that even as of 19 May 2015, the Respondent’s\nweb servers were accessible to the internet; and hosted the Respondent’s\nwebsite, which is the interface from which the Respondent had collected and\nstored the personal data from its users or customers. Accordingly, any\nvulnerability in the web servers or the web applications would pose a real risk\nor threat to the security of the personal data that was collected and/or held by\nthe organisation. It was therefore imperative that the Respondent take the\nnecessary measures to ensure that the servers and web applications\nthemselves would be secure and free from any known significant security risks\nor vulnerabilities. The fact that there were a number of issues with the security\nof the Respondent’s IT system, particularly, the SQL injection vulnerability,\nindicated to the Commission that the web security was lacking. The\nCommission notes that the personal data from the previously affected database\n(ie the database which was hacked) was only transferred from the internetfacing webservers after the postings to the Siph0n website in March 2015.\n17. Based on the above, the Commission finds that the Respondent had failed to\nmake reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data held in its\nweb servers, and it is therefore in breach of Section 24 of the PDPA.\nC.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n18. Given the Commission’s findings that the Respondent is in breach of its\nobligations under Section 24 of the PDPA, the Commission is empowered\nunder Section 29 of the PDPA to give the Respondent such directions as it\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\n\fdeems fit to ensure compliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the\nRespondent to pay a financial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million\nas the Commission thinks fit.\n19. In considering whether a direction should be made or given to the Respondent\nin this case, the Commission notes that:\na.\n\nthe Respondent had taken action to strengthen the security of its website,\nincluding engaging KPMG to undertake an internal IT security audit and\nassessment shortly after it had learnt of the posting of its customer’s or\nuser’s personal data on the Siph0n website. However, the Respondent’s\nactions (after the hacking incidents in February 2014) did not enable it to\ndetect and address at least one significant security lapse until several\nmonths later (ie after May 2015).\n\nb.\n\nthe data leak that gave rise to the complaint took place before July 2014,\nand there is no evidence that there has been a data breach to date,\nnotwithstanding the Respondent’s failure to make reasonable security\narrangements.\n\n20. In view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue\nany direction to the Respondent to take remedial action or to pay a financial\npenalty. Instead, it has decided to issue a Warning against the Respondent for\nthe breach of its obligations under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n21. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance\nof non-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the\nnecessary action to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the\nPDPA. The Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement\naction against the organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n1\n\nPersonal data” under Section 2 of the PDPA means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be\nidentifed from that data; or from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\nacess.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 4 of 4\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A warning was issued to Singapore Computer Society for failing to put in place reasonable security measures to prevent the accidental disclosure of the personal data of 214 registrants of an event via email.","tags":["Protection","Warning","General (eg.

No. S67SS0039C)\n... Respondent\nDecision Citation: [2016] SGPDPC 9\nGROUNDS OF DECISION\n20 April 2016\nA.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 March 2015, the Respondent notified the Commission that it inadvertently\ndisclosed certain personal data of individuals attending an event organised by\nthe Respondent to other individuals and had received information about the\ndisclosure from some of the individuals concerned. After being notified of the\nincident by the Respondent, the Commission undertook an investigation to\ndetermine whether there had been a breach of the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (the “PDPA”). The material facts of the case are as follows.\n\nB.\n\nMATERIAL FACTS AND DOCUMENTS\n\n2.\n\nIn April 2015, the Respondent jointly organised and conducted an event with the\nInfocomm Development of Singapore (“IDA”) named “IDEAS on Security\nAnalytics”. Prior to the event, on 16 March 2015, an employee of the Respondent,\n[Redacted] (Replaced with Ms L), sent out an email to all individuals who had\nregistered to attend the event (“registrants”), which had attached a copy of the\nregistration list for the event. The registration list contained personal data of\nabout 214 registrants (individuals). 11 of the registrants subsequently raised\nconcerns about the unauthorised disclosure of their personal data to the\nRespondent. The personal data which had been disclosed included information\nsuch as the registrants’ full names, NRIC numbers, contact numbers, email\naddresses, organisation and designation information. The Respondent\nconfirmed that it was not acting on behalf of IDA in relation to the collection, use,\ndisclosure or processing of the registrants’ personal data.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged to the Commission that the registration list was\nnot meant to be disclosed externally and had been inadvertently sent to\nregistrants on 16 March 2015. The Respondent explained that Ms L’s supervisor\n(who was also an employee of the Respondent) had sent her the registration list\nin an email which included a draft event confirmation email which Ms L was\nrequired to send to registrants. Ms L used the “Forward” function in her email\napplication to send the event confirmation email on 16 March 2015 but forgot to\nremove the attached registration list (which was automatically attached to her\nemail to registrants by her use of the “Forward” function).\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 1 of 4\n\n\f4.\n\nUpon being notified of the disclosure by some registrants, the Respondent took\nthe immediate step of initiating an email recall at 3 p.m. on 16 March 2015,\napproximately 40 minutes after the email with the registration list was sent.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent’s Data Protection Officer subsequently sent an official email\napology to the 11 registrants who had raised concerns to the Respondent over\nthe incident. All 11 registrants accepted the apology and did not pursue the\nmatter further. Neither the Respondent nor the Commission received other\ncomplaints relating to this incident.\n\nC.\n\nCOMMISSION FINDINGS AND BASIS FOR DETERMINATION\n\nRelevant issue(s) in this case\n6.\n\nThis case principally concerns an unauthorised disclosure of personal data by\nan employee of the Respondent. Under section 24 of the PDPA, an organisation\nis required to protect personal data in its possession or control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised disclosure, disposal,\naccess, collection, use, or similar risks (amongst others).\n\n7.\n\nA secondary issue in this case is that the Respondent did not have the consent\nof the registrants to disclose their personal data to other registrants (as required\nunder section 13 of the PDPA). However, as the Respondent never intended to\nmake such a disclosure, and hence would not have sought consent from the\nregistrants, the Commission notes that this case is more properly considered\nfrom the perspective of the Respondent’s obligations under section 24 of the\nPDPA. Nevertheless, the Commission is not precluding that other cases may\nrequire an examination of both sections 13 and 24.\n\nCommission’s findings on the relevant issue(s)\n8.\n\nIt is not disputed by the Respondent that its employee, Ms L, had made an\nunauthorised disclosure of registrants’ personal data to other registrants via her\nemail of 16 March 2015. The Commission notes that this unauthorised disclosure\narose from a number of factors which reflect poor data handling practices by the\nRespondent, including the following:\n(a)\n\nMs L’s supervisor had sent her the registration list containing registrants’\npersonal data in the same email which contained a draft event confirmation\nemail which Ms L was required to send to registrants. This gave rise to a\nrisk that Ms L may either not realise the registration list was attached or\nmay forget to delete the registration list when she used the “Forward”\nfunction in the email application to send the event confirmation email; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe registration list sent to Ms L was not protected by a password (or in\nany other manner which would prevent unintended recipients from opening\nit and accessing the data contained therein).\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\n\f9.\n\nUnder section 53(1) of the PDPA, any act done, or conduct engaged in, by an\nemployee shall be treated for the purposes of the PDPA as acts done, or conduct\nengaged in, by his employer as well as him. The Respondent is therefore liable\nfor the acts and conduct of its employees in relation to the unauthorised\ndisclosure of registrants’ personal data on 16 March 2015.\n\n10. In relation to the personal data which had been disclosed by the Respondent on\n16 March 2015, the Commission notes that a significant amount may be business\ncontract information, which is defined in section 2 of the PDPA as “an individual’s\nname, position name or title, business telephone number, business address,\nbusiness electronic mail address or business fax number and any other similar\ninformation about the individual, not provided by the individual solely for his\npersonal purposes”. For personal data which is business contract information,\nsection 4(5) of the PDPA provides that Parts III to VI of the PDPA, which includes\nsection 24, does not apply. Nevertheless, as at least some of the personal data\ndisclosed, for example, the NRIC numbers of registrants, was not business\ncontact information, the Respondent was required to protect such personal data\nin accordance with section 24.\n11. Overall, the Commission considers that the Respondent’s data handling\npractices in relation to the sending of the event confirmation email to registrants\ndid not include sufficient security arrangements to the standard required under\nsection 24 of the PDPA. The Commission therefore finds that the Respondent is\nin breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\nA.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMISSION\n\n12. The Commission is empowered under section 29 of the PDPA to give the\nRespondent such directions as it deems fit to ensure the Respondent’s\ncompliance with the PDPA. This may include directing the Respondent to pay a\nfinancial penalty of such amount not exceeding $1 million as the Commission\nthinks fit.\n13. In considering whether a direction should be given to the Respondent in this\ncase, the Commission notes the following:\n(a)\n\nA significant part of the personal data disclosed was business contact\ninformation;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent took prompt action to recall the emails of 16 March 2015\nwhich had the attached registration list, even though this process did not\nresult in a complete recall of all the emails; and\n\n(c)\n\nSCS informed the PDPC of the data breach voluntarily and was\ncooperative during the investigation.\n\n14. In view of the factors noted above, the Commission has decided not to issue any\ndirection to the Respondent under section 29 of the PDPA. Instead, the\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\n\fCommission has decided to issue a Warning to the Respondent for the breach\nof its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA.\n15. The Commission emphasises that it takes a very serious view of any instance of\nnon-compliance with the PDPA, and it urges organisations to take the necessary\naction to ensure that they comply with their obligations under the PDPA. The\nCommission will not hesitate to take the appropriate enforcement action against\nthe organisation(s) accordingly.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nCOMMISSION MEMBER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nPage 4 of 4\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"}]
