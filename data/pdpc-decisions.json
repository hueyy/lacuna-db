Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1.\n\nPayroll2U Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a payroll service provider that offers\n\npayroll outsourcing services and online payroll Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.\n\n2.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by the Organisation that the personal data of its client’s\nemployees had been posted on a ransomware leak site. The leak arose from a\nransomware attack on the servers of the Organisation around 29 December 2022 (the\n“Incident”).\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 January 2023, the Organisation received extortion emails from a threat\n\nactor identified as a LockBit affiliate. The Organisation immediately conducted an\n\n\finternal investigation and engaged an external forensics investigator to investigate the\nIncident and undertake remedial actions. Upon further investigations, it was\ndetermined that a total of 81.95 GB of data had been exfiltrated in the Incident and\nposted on the dark web. The personal data of 5,640 employees from the\nOrganisation’s client was affected, including their full name, bank account number,\nsalary information, NRIC number, address, date of birth and email address.\n\n4.\n\nInvestigations revealed that unauthorised activity had occurred from 29\n\nDecember 2022 to 16 January 2023, with a single compromised account used for\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to five servers on the Organisation’s AWS\nenvironment. Once connected to the working network, the threat actor gained\nunauthorised access to the developer’s drive and the company’s shared drive that\nwere both mapped to the compromised account. These drives gave access to the\naffected personal data.\n\n5.\n\nWhile the investigations were unable to conclusively determine how the threat\n\nactor obtained the credentials to the compromised user account, the investigation\nrevealed the following lapses that could have contributed to the Incident:\n\na.\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops, thus\nenabling a user to install/uninstall applications without restriction. The\nOrganisation confirmed that the compromised user had reformatted his\nlaptop and installed an unlicensed Windows Operating System that\nmight have downloaded ransomware and removed the Symantec\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\fEndpoint Protection. In addition, the compromised user also left the\ncomputer powered and web connected, allowing the threat actor to use\nthe account to login to the Remote Desktop Servers.\n\nb.\n\nMulti-Factor\n\nAuthentication\n\n(“MFA”)\n\nwas\n\nnot\n\nimplemented\n\nfor\n\nadministrator accounts and non-administrative accounts with access to\npersonal data.\n\nc.\n\nThere was an absence of tools to detect and remove the download of\nunauthorised software on company-issued laptops.\n\nd.\n\nThere was an absence of effective incident response and management\ncontrol, enabling the threat actor’s presence and activity within the\nOrganisation’s network to remain undetected between 29 December\n2022 to 16 January 2023.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n\na.\n\nDeactivated the compromised user account and forced change\npassword for all users accessing the network.\n\nb.\n\nImplemented MFA for users accessing internal and remotely accessible\nresources and environments.\n\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\fc.\n\nImplemented documentation and quarterly review of Windows network\ndrives and folder access. Collected log details and log reviews on a\nmonthly basis.\n\nd.\n\nConducted checks on all workstations to ensure they are equipped with\nSentinelOne and Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP).\n\ne.\n\nImplemented host-checking for SSL VPN users vis FortiClient to verify\nthat the SentinelOne and SEP processes are running before granting the\ndevice access.\n\nf.\n\nReviewed firewall configurations and rules. Fine-tuned web-filtering\nusing Fortinet UTM. Implemented secured file transfer for inbound and\noutbound traffic. Block sharing over cloud storage and whitelisted URLs\nbased on need to use basis.\n\ng.\n\nPerformed regular service account reviews to validate that all active\naccounts are authorised.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nbelow; and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to implement reasonable access\n\ncontrol. While the investigation noted and acknowledged the existence of proactive\ncybersecurity controls, the Organisation also admitted to storing the affected personal\ndata sets that included the bank account numbers and salary information on\nunsecured internal shared drives. Given both the volume and types of personal data\nhandled, the Organisation ought to have adopted additional access control beyond the\nbaseline of password protection.\n\n9.\n\nThe Organisation had the option of either frontend access control or other\n\noptions that focused on the backend. Frontend access control included MFA, at least\nfor users with remote access to the more sensitive data mentioned. Backend access\ncontrol included, for example, restrictive allocation according to the user’s need for\nadministrator-level rights that would impact personal data security as well as network\nsegmentation. Sensitive personal data could have been stored in segments of the\nnetwork that allowed access only on the basis of need.\n\n10.\n\nAs stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\n\nSystems (the “Guide”)1, access control privileges should be restricted and defined\nbased on the user roles/rights to data. Users should not be able to see information\nthat they do not need to know, and this should be reflected in an organisation’s access\ncontrol policy. In the present case, the Organisation should have assessed whether\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fthe developer in question needed account access rights to personal data of the type\naffected in the Incident.\n\n11.\n\nAnother backend access control option recommended in our Guide was\n\ndisallowing non-administrator employees from installing software and/or changing\nsecurity settings and restricting the right to do so to specific administrator accounts.\nThe Organisation failed to do so and non-administrative accounts were able to\ndownload unauthorised software on issued devices without being detected.\n\n12.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n13.\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, the Commission\nconsidered that a financial penalty was appropriate given the role of the Organisation\nas a payroll service provider and the types of personal data handled. In deciding the\nappropriate financial penalty amount, the Commission first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n14.\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, the\n\nCommission also considered the Organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\fwould be a proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter noncompliance with the PDPA. The Commission also considered the following mitigating\nfactors, which led to a further reduction in the financial penalty:\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\ninvestigations;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to a breach of the Protection\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n\nc.\n\nThis is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n15.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $4,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $16,800 and Directions were imposed on a registered salesperson of an estate agency for failing to obtain consent and inform individuals of the purposes for collecting and using their personal data.","tags":["Consent","Notification","Financial Penalty","Directions","Real Estate"],"date":"21 Mar 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_leecheemeng_29122023.pdf","nature":"Consent, Notification","title":"Breach of the Consent and Notification Obligations by a Registered Salesperson","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/03/breach-of-the-consent-and-notification-obligations-by-a-registered-salesperson","timestamp":"2024-03-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 14\n\nCase No. DP-2211-C0404\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nLee Chee Meng\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fLee Chee Meng\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2211-C0404\n29 December 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 8 November 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) received a complaint regarding the possible unauthorised collection\nand use of personal data by Mr Lee Chee Meng (the “Respondent”) for telemarketing\npurposes. The Commission subsequently commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the circumstances disclosed any breaches by the Respondent of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n2\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigations, the facts disclose a straightforward\n\nbreach of the PDPA. In particular, the Respondent admits to committing the infringing\nacts. The Commission has accordingly found the Respondent in breach of sections 13\nand 20 of the PDPA.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Respondent is a registered salesperson under the Estate Agents Act 2010.\n\nHe is appointed by ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd (“ERA”) to engage in estate agency\nwork and to otherwise promote the business of servicing the public in real estate\ntransactions.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nAt all material times, the Respondent is and was an independent agent of ERA\n\nwho receives commissions in respect of real estate services or transactions entered\ninto between customers and ERA.\n\n5\n\nThe Respondent was upfront in admitting that he has been purchasing personal\n\ndata from unknown third parties for telemarketing purposes for approximately 10 years\nfrom 2013.\n\n6\n\nIn the course of 2021, the Respondent purchased 5 sets of personal data\n\namounting to about 420,000 records (the “Purchased Data”) from an individual with\na foreign phone number known to the Respondent only as “Ali” (the “Seller”). The\nRespondent came to know of the Seller through social media and would communicate\nwith the Seller over Whatsapp, following which the Seller would e-mail the Purchased\nData to the Respondent in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The Respondent\npaid the Seller a total of about S$1,200 for the Purchased Data.\n\n7\n\nThe Purchased Data comprised the following:\n\nNumber of affected individuals\nTypes of personal data\n\n8\n\n~420,000\n• Name\n• E-mail address\n• Contact number\n• Address (either residential or office,\nbut not both)\n• Partial credit card number, i.e., the\nlast 4 digits (for some entries)\n\nAfter receiving each set of Purchased Data, the Respondent would sort through\n\nit for names, e-mail addresses, contact numbers, and residential addresses, and use\n\n3\n\n\fthis personal data to send targeted marketing e-mails and SMSes to the individuals\nconcerned. For example, if the Respondent saw that an individual was living in a\ncertain area of Singapore, he would send an e-mail or SMS to that individual informing\nhim or her of the property transaction prices in that area. The Respondent did not send\nmarketing communications to all the affected individuals as he estimated that about\n75% of the Purchased Data contained business-related information and not residential\ninformation.\n\n9\n\nThe Respondent stated that he did not use the Purchased Data for any other\n\npurpose, and that he included an unsubscribe function in his marketing emails. The\nlatter enabled him to delete the personal data of any individuals who used this\nunsubscribe function. He also stated that he would first check the contact numbers\nagainst the Do Not Call (“DNC”) Registry and would not send marketing SMSes to any\nDNC-registered contact numbers.\n\n10\n\nThe Commission found no evidence to contradict these statements. In\n\nparticular, the Commission has not received any DNC-related complaints involving the\nRespondent. There was also no evidence that the Respondent ever re-sold the\nPurchased Data, or that he was involved in the Seller’s business in any capacity other\nthan as a buyer (e.g., as an accomplice).\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nPreliminary Issues\n\n4\n\n\f11\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent was bound by the data protection obligations in\n\nParts 3 to 6A of the PDPA as he had operated as an “organisation” in respect of his\ncollection and use of the Purchased Data1:\n(a)\n\nThe definition of “organisation” in section 2(1) of the PDPA includes\nindividuals.\n\n(b)\n\nSection 4(1)(a) of the PDPA provides that Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA do\nnot impose any obligation on any individual acting in a personal or\ndomestic capacity. However, the Respondent was not acting in a\npersonal or domestic capacity in respect of his purchase of the\nPurchased Data from the Seller and subsequent use for telemarketing\npurposes. These actions were done for profit, in furtherance of the\nRespondent’s business as a real estate salesperson.\n\n(c)\n\nSection 4(1)(b) of the PDPA provides that Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA do\nnot impose any obligation on any employee acting in the course of his or\nher employment with an organization. However, as mentioned at [4]\nabove, the Respondent was not in an employee-employer relationship\nwith ERA. He acted at all material times as an independent agent.\n\nThe Consent and Notification Obligations under the PDPA\n\n12\n\nThe relevant data protection obligations applicable to the Respondent’s\n\ncollection and use of personal data are:\n\n1 The Commission has in earlier cases also determined that individuals fall within the definition of\n\n“organisation” under the PDPA, and that individuals are subject to the obligations in Parts 3 to 6A of the\nPDPA insofar as they are not acting in a personal or domestic capacity (see for example Re Sharon\nAssya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at [9] to [12]) and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi\nMobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12 (at [8])).\n\n5\n\n\f(a)\n\nthe obligation, before collecting, using or disclosing the personal data, to\ninform the individual(s) in question of the purposes for which such\npersonal data is being collected, used or disclosed (the “Notification\nObligation”)2; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe obligation to first obtain the consent of the individual(s) in question to\nthe collection, use or disclosure of the personal data for such purposes3\n(an individual cannot be said to have given consent unless he or she has\nbeen provided with the information required under the Notification\nObligation, and has provided consent for the stated purposes4) (the\n“Consent Obligation”).\n\n13\n\nThe central issue in this case is whether the Respondent breached the Consent\n\nObligation and/or the Notification Obligation under the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Respondent breached the Consent Obligation\n\n14\n\nOn the facts of this case, the Respondent breached the Consent Obligation by\n\nfailing to ascertain that the consent of the individuals concerned had been obtained\nbefore purchasing their personal data from the Seller and subsequently sending\nunsolicited telemarketing communications to them.\n\n15\n\nThe fact that the Respondent purchased the Purchased Data from a third party\n\n(i.e. the Seller) does not derogate from the Commission’s breach finding. The\nCommission has in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at [13]) and\n\n2 Section 20 of the PDPA.\n3 Section 13 of the PDPA.\n4 Section 14 of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\fRe Amicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor. [2019] SGPDPC 33 (at [26] and [47]) observed\nthat purchasing personal data from a third-party seller constitutes the collection of\npersonal data under the PDPA, notwithstanding that such personal data was not\ncollected directly from the individuals concerned themselves.\n\n16\n\nThe fact of this “indirect” collection does not exempt data buyers from their data\n\nprotection obligations in relation to the collection or subsequent use or disclosure of\nthe collected personal data. The required standard was articulated in Re Amicus\nSolutions (at [48] and [49]), quoting in turn the UK Information Commissioner’s Office\n(“ICO”)’s decision in The Data Supply Company:\n\n“48 … The ICO issued a monetary penalty of £20,000 and gave the following\nguidance in the Monetary Penalty Notice (at [22] to [25]):\n\nData controllers buying marketing lists from third parties must\nmake rigorous checks to satisfy themselves that the third party\nobtained the personal data fairly and lawfully, that the individuals\nunderstood their details would be passed on for marketing\npurposes, and that they have the necessary consent.\n\nData controllers must take extra care if buying or selling a list that is to\nbe used to send marketing texts, emails or automated calls. The Privacy\nand Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 specifically require\nthat the recipient of such communications has notified the sender that\nthey consent to receive direct marketing messages from them. Indirect\nconsent (ie consent originally given to another organisation) may be valid\nif that organisation sending the marketing message was specifically\n7\n\n\fnamed. But more generic consent (eg marketing ‘from selected third\nparties’) will not demonstrate valid consent to marketing calls, texts or\nemails.\n\nData controllers buying in lists must check how and when consent\nwas obtained, by whom, and what the customer was told. It is not\nacceptable to rely on assurances of indirect consent without\nundertaking proper due diligence. Such due diligence might, for\nexample, include checking the following:\n•\n\nHow and when was consent obtained?\n\n•\n\nWho obtained it and in what context?\n\n•\n\nWhat method was used – eg was it opt-in or opt-out?\n\n•\n\nWas the information provided clear and intelligible? How was it\nprovided – eg behind a link, in a footnote, in a pop-up box, in a clear\nstatement next to the opt-in box?\n\n•\n\nDid it specifically mention texts, emails or automated calls?\n\n•\n\nDid it list organisations by name, by description, or was the consent\nfor disclosure to any third party?\n\n•\n\nIs the seller a member of a professional body or accredited in some\nway?\n\n…\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n8\n\n\f49 While there is no uniform industry standard in relation to how a buyer should\nverify whether the seller has obtained the consent of the individuals, the\npositions articulated by the ICO must be right. A reasonable person would likely\nundertake proper due diligence, such as seeking written confirmation that the\npersonal data sold was actually obtained via legal sources or means, or inquire\nfurther as to whether the individuals had provided their consent and were\nnotified of the disclosure, and if so, obtain a sample of such consent and\nnotification.”\n\n17\n\nThe Respondent has fallen short of the standard set out in Re Amicus Solutions\n\nPte. Ltd. by failing to perform the required due diligence to ensure that the individuals’\nconsent had been obtained for the sale of the Purchased Data by the Seller to the\nRespondent, or for the Respondent’s subsequent use for the purposes of\ntelemarketing. During the Commission’s investigations, the Respondent admitted that\nhe did not know whether the Seller had obtained the consent of the individuals in\nrelation to the sale of the Purchased Data, and that he did not perform any additional\nverification checks or question the Seller as to how he had obtained the Purchased\nData. There is no evidence that the Respondent contacted the individuals directly to\nobtain their consent. The Respondent also stated that he was not aware of whether\nthe Purchased Data originated from any data breaches5.\n\n18\n\nThe Respondent was negligent in purchasing and using the Purchased Data\n\nfrom an unknown online seller without performing any due diligence in relation to the\nprovenance of the Purchased Data or whether the individuals concerned had been\n\n5 Based on the Commission’s investigations, the Purchased Data may have originated from the data\n\nbreach incident involving RedMart Limited (see Re RedMart Limited [2022] SGPDPC 8).\n\n9\n\n\fnotified of or given their consent for its collection and use. He therefore did not take\nsufficient steps to discharge the requirements under the Consent Obligation. As stated\nat [9] and [10] above, the Commission accepts that the Respondent had provided an\nopt-out option in his telemarketing e-mails, took pains to ensure compliance with the\nDNC provisions under the PDPA, and had breached the PDPA out of ignorance\ntowards his data protection obligations. Nevertheless, ignorance is not a legitimate\nexcuse for breaching the Consent Obligation. Accordingly, the Respondent was found\nto have negligently breached the Consent Obligation in relation to both his collection\nand use of the Purchased Data.\n\nWhether the Respondent breached the Notification Obligation\n\n19\n\nThe Commission applied the same standards set out at [18] above to its\n\nassessment of whether the Respondent breached the Notification Obligation. In this\nregard, the Respondent also did not perform the required due diligence to ensure that\nthe individuals had been informed of the purposes for which their personal data was\nsubsequently collected, used and/or disclosed by the Respondent and the Seller, and\nthere is likewise no evidence that the Respondent contacted the individuals directly to\ninform them of this. The Respondent has accordingly also negligently breached the\nNotification Obligation in relation to both his collection and use of the Purchased Data.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n20\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Respondent\n\nunder section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Respondent should be required to\npay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA were considered, including the following mitigating factors:\n10\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent was highly cooperative during the Commission’s\ninvestigations. In particular, the Respondent candidly admitted to the\ninfringing acts at first instance and co-operated fully with the investigation\nprocess.\n\n(b)\n\n21\n\nThe Respondent is a first-time offender.\n\nThe Commission considers that there are compelling policy reasons in favour\n\nof taking a strong stance against the unauthorised buying of personal data. Some of\nthese policy reasons have been enumerated in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang (at\n[30]), in the context of the unauthorised sale of personal data:\n\n“The Commissioner likewise takes a serious view of such breaches under the\nPDPA. There are strong policy reasons for taking a hard stance against the\nunauthorised sale of personal data. Amongst these policy reasons are the need\nto protect the interests of the individual and safeguard against any harm to the\nindividual, such as identity theft or nuisance calls. Additionally, there is a need\nto prevent abuse by organisations in profiting from the sale of the individual’s\npersonal data at the individual’s expense. It is indeed such cases of potential\nmisuse or abuse by organisations of the individual’s personal data which the\nPDPA seeks to safeguard against. In this regard, the Commissioner is prepared\nto take such stern action against organisations for the unauthorised sale of\npersonal data.”\n\n22\n\nAlthough the Commission’s investigations did not disclose that the Respondent\n\nre-sold the Purchased Data, the demand generated by buyers such as the\n11\n\n\fRespondent incentivises sellers to engage in the unauthorised sale of personal data,\ncontributing to the market for the unauthorised buying and selling of personal data.\nThere are strong policy reasons to deter would-be participants of such a market as its\nexistence significantly increases the risk of potential misuse or abuse of personal data.\n\nThe Respondent’s Representations\n\n23\n\nOn 20 October 2023, the Respondent was notified of the Commission’s\n\nPreliminary Decision, which sets out:\n(a)\n\nthe Commission’s findings on the Respondent’s breaches of the Consent\nObligation and the Notification Obligation (as set out above);\n\n(b)\n\nthe Commission’s intention to impose a financial penalty of S$28,000;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nthe Commission’s intention to give certain directions on the Respondent\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n\n24\n\nOn 1 November 2023, the Respondent submitted written representations on\n\nthe amount of the financial penalty to be imposed. These representations included the\nfollowing:\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent stated that while he had made sure not to send any\nmarketing SMSes to any DNC-registered contact numbers, he was\nunaware that using e-mail addresses for telemarketing purposes was\nalso a violation of the PDPA;\n\n12\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe Respondent had no malicious intentions in using the Purchased\nData and was only seeking to provide for his family; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent’s financial situation was extremely challenging. The\nfinancial penalty imposed would exacerbate his financial difficulties. In\nparticular, the Respondent stated that he was already struggling to meet\nhis ongoing expenses, including medical expenses for a family member’s\ntreatment.\n\nDecision\n\n25\n\nThe Commission is unable to accept the Respondent’s representations at\n\n[24(a)] and [24(b)] above:\n(a)\n\nAs stated at [18] above, ignorance is not a legitimate excuse for\nbreaching the PDPA. To the Respondent’s credit, he has in his\nrepresentations accepted that ignorance does not excuse his actions,\nand stated that he had only raised this point to provide context.\n\n(b)\n\nNotwithstanding the Respondent’s personal motivations in this regard,\nthe Respondent’s actions were ultimately still done for profit, in\nfurtherance of his business as a real estate salesperson.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission has already taken the Respondent’s self-confessed\nignorance about his data protection obligations and his personal motivations into\naccount when it determined that the Respondent had negligently breached the\nConsent and Notification Obligations: see [18-19] above.\n\n13\n\n\f26\n\nHowever, the Commission accepts and takes into account the Respondent’s\n\nrepresentation at [24(c)] above. When imposing financial penalties, the Commission\nmay take into consideration the personal and financial circumstances of the\norganisation / individual, bearing in mind that financial penalties should not impose a\ncrushing burden or cause undue hardship6. The Commission has given due\nconsideration to the Respondent’s financial situation based on the evidence furnished\nby the Respondent and accepts that the imposition of a high financial penalty would\ncause substantial hardship to the Respondent.\n\n27\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, including the\n\nRespondent’s representations, the Commission hereby imposes a reduced financial\npenalty of S$16,800. This decision is made on the basis of the exceptional financial\ncircumstances demonstrated by the Respondent, and should not be taken as setting\nany precedent for future cases.

(the “Organisation”) is a Singapore\n\ntelecommunications service provider offering broadband internet access, local and\nlong-distance digital IP telephony, prepaid and postpaid calling plans.\n\n2\n\nOn 22 April 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was alerted by the Singapore Police Force of a personal data breach\nincident involving the Organisation (the “Incident”), which the Organisation confirmed\non 24 April 2023.\n\n\f3\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision\nand to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA. Section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation to\nprotect personal data in its possession or control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nFacts of the Incident\n4\n\nThe Organisation’s customer management system (“CMS”) was designed and\n\ndeveloped in 2016 by an external vendor. This external vendor did not process\npersonal data on behalf of the Organisation and was not the Organisation’s data\nintermediary. The Protection Obligation in respect of customer personal data\nprocessed by the CMS therefore fell solely on the Organisation.\n\n5\n\nThe CMS from its initial design accepted any Python script requests that could\n\nbe exploited for unauthorised exfiltration of customer personal data. This failure to\nblock or manage scripts posed a data security risk and was a design flaw.\n\n6\n\nPost-Incident, the Organisation established through tracing web services and\n\ndatabased logs that Python scripts had indeed been used by the threat actor (“TA”) to\nextract .jpg files from the CMS. 29,903 attempts from 8 overseas IP addresses were\nmade over 5 days in March and April 2023, with 24,323 successful extractions of the\npersonal data of 24,323 individuals.\n\n\f7\n\nThe types of personal data exfiltrated were the front and back images of\n\nidentification documents (i.e., NRIC, passport, student pass and dependent pass) and\nother supporting documents such as tenancy agreements and letters of approval for\nwork permits issued by the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore.\n\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nRejected and denied all Python requests to the CMS;\n\n(b)\n\nRestricted overseas IP addresses from connecting to the Organisation’s\n\nnetwork;\n(c)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication and enhanced the password\n\ncomplexity requirement for the CMS’ admin users via web access; and\n(d)\n\nConducted a penetration test on the CMS.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nAs a Singapore telecommunications service provider, the Organisation had\n\nhigher-level security needs. This extended to the Organisation’s CMS that contained\nthe personal data of individuals who subscribed to the telecommunications services\nprovided by the Organisation.\n\n10\n\nFirst, the Organisation admitted it has breached the Protection Obligation under\n\nthe PDPA as it failed to provide any security requirements to the CMS IT vendor, in\nparticular, requirements that would have adequately addressed the data security risks\nposed by Python scripts.\n\n\f11\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to stipulate clear job specifications and\n\nsecurity requirements to the IT vendor who developed the CMS. There was also no\ncontractual obligation on the IT vendor to ensure that personal data would be\nprotected. In SAP Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 6, the Commission had reiterated the\nneed for organisations to provide clear job specifications and include data protection\nrequirements when engaging IT vendors. Thereafter, organisations are also expected\nto ensure that the IT vendor has satisfied the job specifications and data protection\nrequirements stipulated.\n\n12\n\nSecondly, the Organisation admitted that it was in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the PDPA as it neither had a sufficiently complex password policy\nnor enforced one. In the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\nSystems1, the Commission recommended a minimum of 12 alphanumeric characters\nwith a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. We also\nrecommended using phrases or paraphrase, combined with numbers and uppercase,\nlowercase and special characters, as these characteristics will make a password\nstronger and harder to decode.\n\n13\n\nPrior to the Incident, the Organisation’s CMS admin user password complexity\n\nrequired only 9 alphanumeric characters with at least one uppercase, which clearly fell\nshort of PDPC’s recommended password complexity. We urge organisations to meet\nPDPC’s recommended best practices relating to passwords, especially for privileged\naccess accounts such as admin accounts.\n\n1 PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems, page 15. Accessible at\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems.\n\n\f14\n\nThird, the Organisation also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation\n\nof the PDPA as it failed to ensure reasonable access control to its CMS. Given the\nnature of personal data the Organisation was in possession and control of, the\nOrganisation should have enhanced the access control to its CMS beyond the\nbaseline of password protection. This could have taken the form of implementing multifactor authentication for its CMS admin accounts, restricting access from overseas IP\naddresses to its CMS, and, last but not least, having an up-to-date web application\nfirewall to defend against typical web application attacks.\n\n15\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n16\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate given the Organisation involved and the nature of\nthe personal data affected in the Incident.\n\n17\n\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the\n\nrelevant factors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the\npersonal data breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n\f18\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the Organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and to deter noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n19\n\nFinally, I considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\n\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n20\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $9,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\fThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

Persons\nmay register their Singapore telephone numbers with the DNC Registry so as to not\nreceive unsolicited telemarketing calls and messages. The DNC Registry comprises\nof 3 separate registers (i) the No Text Message Register, (ii) the No Voice Call\nRegister, and (iii) the No Fax Message Register.\n\n2.\n\nFrom January 2023 to July 2023, the Commission received twelve (12)\n\ncomplaints arising from unsolicited telemarketing calls made by Lin DaoWen Kenny\n\n\f(the “Individual”) to telephone numbers registered on the No Voice Call Register of\nthe DNC Registry (the “Complaints”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether there had\n\nbeen any breaches of the “Do Not Call” provisions in Parts 9 and 9A of the PDPA\n(“DNC Provisions”). This case also illustrates how the employment of online tools to\ngenerate Singapore telephone numbers to market products or services may lead to a\nbreach of section 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\n4.\n\nThe Individual is a financial advisor. In order to generate leads, he used an\n\nExcel spreadsheet formula (“randbetween”) to generate a list of all numbers upon\nentering the extreme ends on a numerical spectrum. The Individual generated 1000\nnumbers (the “Phone List”) with the intention of finding Singapore telephone numbers\nto market his financial advisory services.\n\n5.\n\nOf the 1,000 numbers generated on the Phone List, 384 corresponded to\n\nSingapore telephone numbers that were registered with the No Voice Call Register of\nthe DNC Registry.\n\n6.\n\nThe Individual engaged a telemarketer to make marketing calls to the numbers\n\non the Phone List to promote his financial advisory services. The Individual admitted\nthat he failed to check if the telephone numbers were registered with the Do Not Call\nRegistry before providing the Phone List to the telemarketer. Given the means by\nwhich the Individual generated the Singapore telephone numbers, the Individual was\nalso unable to provide any evidence (written or otherwise) that he had obtained clear\nand unambiguous consent from the subscribers of the 384 DNC-registered numbers\n\n\fbefore making the marketing calls. In light of above, the Individuals has negligently\ncontravened section 43(1) of the PDPA.\n\n7.\n\nFurther, by generating the 384 Singapore telephone numbers through the Excel\n\nspreadsheet formula mentioned above and engaging a telemarketer to make\nmarketing calls to promote his financial advisory services, the Individual has also\ncontravened section 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8.\n\nThe Individual claimed to have inadvertently overlooked screening the numbers\n\non the Phone List on this occasion. The Assistant Commissioner considered that the\nIndividual had a previous compliance record of screening telephone numbers to\nascertain if they were on the DNC Registry. Further, the Individual immediately ceased\nthe telemarketing calls and promptly purchased more credits that can be used to\nscreen if the telephone numbers were registered on the DNC Registry so as to ensure\ncompliance with the DNC Provisions of the PDPA. Upon careful consideration of these\nfacts, the Assistant Commissioner issued a warning to the Individual for contravening\nsections 43(1) and 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\nThe following section(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in\nthe above summary:\nDuty to check register\n43.—(1) Subject to section 48(2), a person must not send a specified message\naddressed to a Singapore telephone number unless the person has, at the time the\nperson sends the specified message, valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone\nnumber is not listed in the relevant register.\nProhibition on use of dictionary attacks and address-harvesting software\n48B.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a person must not send, cause\nto be sent or authorise the sending of an applicable message.\n\n\f(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an employee (P) who sends, causes to be\nsent or authorises the sending of an applicable message in good faith —\n(a)\n\nin the course of P’s employment; or\n\n(b)\nin accordance with instructions given to P by or on behalf of P’s employer in the\ncourse of P’s employment.\n(3) However, subsection (2) does not apply to a person (P) who, at the time\nthe applicable message was sent, was an officer or a partner of the sender and it is\nproved that —\n(a)\nP knew or ought reasonably to have known that the telephone number is an\napplicable telephone number; and\n(b)\nthe applicable message was sent with P’s consent or connivance, or the\nsending of the applicable message was attributable to any neglect on P’s part.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 was imposed on Carousell for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its platform users in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fCarousell Pte. Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case Numbers. DP-2209-C0166 and DP-2210C0312\n\n28 December 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nCarousell Pte. Ltd. (“Carousell”) runs an online marketplace website and\n\nmobile application for the buying and selling of new and second-hand goods and\nservices (the “Platform”). In recent years, the Platform has expanded to include\nproperty listings. The Platform is available to users in several markets, including\nSingapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.\n\n2\n\nIn 2022, Carousell notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) of two data breach incidents:\n\n(a)\n\nOn 5 September 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of a data\n\nbreach incident involving the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of\n44,477 individuals across Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and the\nPhilippines using Carousell’s Platform (the “1st Incident”).\n\n2\n\n\f(b)\n\nOn 17 October 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of a separate\n\nand unrelated incident involving the sale of the personal data of at least 2.6\nmillion1 individuals using Carousell’s Platform (the “2nd Incident”) (collectively,\nthe “Incidents”).\n\n3\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine Carousell’s\n\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the\nIncidents. On 13 February 2023, Carousell requested for the investigations into the\nIncidents to be handled under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure\n(“EDP”), which the Commission acceded to. To this end, Carousell voluntarily and\nunequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision and to its contravention of\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Incidents.\n\nFacts of the 1st Incident\n\n4\n\nCarousell’s Platform includes a chat function allowing potential buyers to send\n\nand receive messages to and from listing owners on the Platform. This chat function\nwas available for use by both individuals who had registered accounts with the\nPlatform (“Registered Users”) and by individuals who did not register accounts with\nthe Platform (“Guest Users”). The chat function served all categories of listings on the\nPlatform, including property listings in different countries.\n\n1\n\nCarousell was unable to confirm the exact number of individuals affected. Carousell had estimated that\napproximately 3.389 million individuals may have been affected. However, the threat actor’s listing on the online\nforum claimed to consist of the personal data of approximately 2.6 million individuals.\n\n3\n\n\f5\n\nOn 13 July 2022, Carousell implemented changes to the chat function. The\n\nchange was intended to be limited to users in Philippines responding to property\nlistings. Where such users had provided their prior consent, their first name (if the user\nwas a Registered User), email address and phone number would be automatically\nappended to the message sent to the owner of the property listing.\n\n6\n\nHowever, due to human error, the changes caused the chat function to\n\nautomatically append the email addresses and names of Guest Users to messages to\nlisting owners of all categories in all markets (the “July 2022 Bug”). For Guest Users\nin the Philippines, their telephone numbers were also appended to the messages.\n\n7\n\nOn 18 August 2022, having not identified the July 2022 Bug, Carousell\n\nimplemented a fix to resolve an unrelated issue with the pre-fill functionality of the chat\nfunction (“August 2022 Bug”). However, these changes caused the chat function to\nautomatically append the email addresses and names of Registered Users to\nmessages to listing owners of all categories in all markets as well, expanding the effect\nof the July 2022 Bug. For Registered and Guests Users in the Philippines, their\ntelephone numbers were also appended.\n\n8\n\nCarousell was eventually made aware of the August 2022 Bug via a user report\n\nsent on 18 August 2022. On 24 August 2022, Carousell implemented a fix which\nresolved both the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs.\n\n9\n\nAs a result of the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs, the personal data of 44,477\n\nindividuals comprising email addresses of all affected users and mobile phone\n\n4\n\n\fnumbers of users in the Philippines were disclosed without their consent. Although the\nnames associated with users’ accounts were also disclosed, the Commission accepts\nCarousell’s explanation that these names were not necessarily indicative of actual\nnames of the users, and are voluntarily disclosed by users on his/her own public\nprofiles. As such, the Commission did not consider disclosure of these names relevant\nfor assessing the breaches of the PDPA in the Incidents.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n10\n\nFollowing the 1st Incident, Carousell took the following remedial actions:\nActions to mitigate the effects of the 1st Incident\n(a)\n\nDeleted all affected personal data disclosed in the chat function by 3\nSeptember 2022; and\n\n(b)\n\nNotified users who had written to Carousell about the 1 st Incident by 6\nSeptember 2022.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the 1st Incident or similar incidents\n(c)\n\nConducted an exercise to identify corrective and preventive measures to\nguard against the possible recurrence of similar incidents;\n\n(d)\n\nRevised its Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) policy such that personal\ndata\n\nissue\n\nreports\n\nare\n\nmarked\n\nas\n\n“Severity-1”\n\nto be resolved within 8 hours. Additionally, alerts of SLA breaches will\nnow trigger over the weekends to shorten the turnaround time for breach\ndetection and response;\n\n5\n\n\f(e)\n\nImplemented an automated unit test which automatically runs on every\nbuild of the Platform to ensure that the Platform does not erroneously\nappend any personal data in chat messages; and\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented requirement for additional approval from the Quality / Test\nengineers in each team prior to implementation of new features involving\nusers’ personal data.\n\n11\n\nThe Commission notes that Carousell did not notify all users affected by the 1st\n\nIncident as it assessed that the 1st Incident was unlikely to result in significant harm\ngiven that the disclosure was limited to basic contact information (telephone number,\nemail address).\n\nFacts of the 2nd Incident\n\n12\n\nOn 15 January 2022, Carousell launched a public-facing Application\n\nProgramming Interface (“API”) during a system migration process. However,\nCarousell inadvertently omitted to apply a filter on that API, resulting in a vulnerability\nwhich was eventually exploited by a threat actor (the “API Bug”).\n\n13\n\nThe API’s original intended function was to retrieve the personal data of users\n\n(“Following/Follower Users”) followed by or following a particular Carousell user\n(\"Subject User”). A filter applied to the API would have ensured that only publicly\navailable personal data of the Following/Follower Users - user name, name and profile\nimage – would be called up. However, due to an inadvertent omission of the filter, the\n\n6\n\n\fAPI was able to call up non-public personal data of Following/Follower Users. These\ncomprised their email addresses, telephone numbers and dates of birth.\n\n14\n\nA threat actor (“TA”) was able to exploit this vulnerability by scraping the\n\naccounts of 46 Subject Users with large numbers of associated Following/Follower\nUsers, thereby obtaining the personal data of these Following/Follower Users.\nForensic investigation revealed that the scraping of non-public data of various users\noccurred between 7 May 2022 and 13 May 2022, and then on 25 June 2022.\n\n15\n\nCarousell’s internal engineering team discovered the API Bug on 15 September\n\n2022 and deployed a patch on the same day. Carousell conducted internal\ninvestigations to determine whether there had been unauthorised access to its users’\npersonal data in the 60-day period prior to 15 September 2022, but did not detect any\nanomalies within that period. They therefore remained unaware of the exploitation by\nthe TA until 13 October 2022.\n\n16\n\nOn 13 October 2022, Carousell was alerted by the Commission that an\n\nindividual was offering the personal data of approximately 2.6 million Carousell users\nfor sale on an online forum. Carousell conducted investigations and confirmed that the\ndata had been exfiltrated as a result of the vulnerabilities caused by the API Bug. On\n17 October 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of the data breach.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n17\n\nFollowing the 2nd Incident, Carousell took the following remedial actions:\n\n7\n\n\fActions to mitigate the effects of the 2nd Incident\n\n(a)\n\nDeployed a fix on 15 September 2022, the same day on which the API\nBug was discovered;\n\n(b)\n\nCompiled a list of users who were following a large number of other users\nto identify any risk of data abuse;\n\n(c)\n\nIdentified and blocked the TA’s account on 13 October 2022, the same\nday on which Carousell was informed of the exploitation;\n\n(d)\n\nNotified all affected individuals by email.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the 2nd Incident or similar incidents\n\n(e)\n\nConfigured its GitHub repository to scan for and generate alerts for data\nleakage;\n\n(f)\n\nConducted a security audit for all existing APIs and implemented a\nsystemic regular audit;\n\n(g)\n\nImplemented an automated security audit process for API rollouts. Alerts\nare generated for all API code changes which involve personal data,\nwhich would result in those code changes being reviewed by the relevant\nteams;\n\n(h)\n\nImplemented rate limiting follow and batch-follow APIs to prevent\npotential abuse by users who follow other users;\n\n8\n\n\f(i)\n\nCompiled a list of users following large numbers of users a day and\nidentifying potential risks of data abuse, with the view to banning users\nwho attempted abuse;\n\n(j)\n\nActively monitored API requests for abnormal behaviour;\n\n(k)\n\nImposed stricter IP address rate limits;\n\n(l)\n\nExplored third-party anomalous API access solutions; and\n\n(m)\n\nImplemented annual penetration tests for customer-facing applications.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n18\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incidents, the Commission’s investigation\n\nfocused on whether Carousell had breached its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). Carousell was determined to have breached the Protection Obligation\nin two respects.\n\nFailure to conduct reasonably scoped pre-launch testing\n\n19\n\nProper pre-launch testing is necessary to identify data protection risks and\n\ndefects before new and updated IT features are deployed in live environments. This\n\n9\n\n\fhas been expressly stated in the Commission’s prior decisions2 and in guidance\npublished by the Commission.\n\n20\n\nThe importance of properly scoped code review was highlighted in the\n\nCommission’s previous decision of Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No.\n3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [9]:\n\n“…[O]rganisations should conduct code reviews and pre-launch testing before\nnew IT features or changes to IT systems are deployed. These processes allow\norganisations to pick up and rectify errors and/or flaws in the new IT features\nand/or systems prior to deployment. There have been a number of cases where\nerrors in the application code resulted in the unintended disclosure of personal\ndata or unintended access to personal data …”\n\n21\n\nAs stated at page 5 of the PDPC’s Handbook on How to Guard Against\n\nCommon Types of Data Breaches (“PDPC’s Handbook”), organisations should\nensure that applications are subjected to comprehensive testing such as unit testing,\nregression testing, security testing, and User Acceptance Testing (“UAT”) before\ndeployment. A comprehensive UAT should ensure good test coverage of scenarios\nincluding possible user journeys and exception handling, which should match realworld usage. PDPC’s Checklist to Guard Against Common Data Breaches (“PDPC’s\nChecklist”) also recommends a test suite encompassing functional and non-functional\nrequirements and security testing.\n\n2 SAP Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 6, Grabcar Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 14\n\n10\n\n\f22\n\nAdequate pre-launch testing includes implementing reasonable code review.\n\nAs the Commission has stated at page 3 of the PDPC’s Checklist, organisations\nshould ““[c]onduct code review and rigorous unit testing which includes complete\ntesting of functional requirements to verify the compliance to the requirements specs\nat early stage in system development lifecycle.”\n\n23\n\nIn respect of the 1st Incident, Carousell failed to conduct reasonable pre-launch\n\ntesting upon implementing its changes to the Platform’s chat function on 13 July 2022\nand 18 August 2022. Specifically, Carousell admitted that, since changes were only\nintended to impact Registered Users in a specific category of listings (i.e. property\nlistings in the Philippines market), testing was not undertaken to check how the\nchanges may have affected other users and listings outside the intended category.\nGiven that the same chat function served all categories of listings, Carousell should\nhave conducted pre-launch testing on categories other than property listings in the\nPhilippines market. Reasonable code reviews and testing would have detected the\nJuly 2022 and August 2022 Bugs before the changes went “live”.\n\n24\n\nIn respect of the 2nd Incident, Carousell had selectively performed code reviews\n\nand tests during its system migration, only for certain purposes and on certain APIs.\nSince the function of the API relevant to the 2nd Incident was to retrieve personal data,\nCarousell should have identified this API and tested it for data security risks. Carousell\nfailed to do so. Carousell admitted that prior to the 2 nd Incident, it did not mandate\ncomprehensive code reviews for security issues.\n\n11\n\n\fFailure to adequately document software functional and technical specifications\n\n25\n\nMaintaining\n\nreliable\n\ndocumentation\n\non\n\nthe\n\nfunctional\n\nand\n\ntechnical\n\nspecifications of an application helps an organisation keep track of issues over time.\nIt can help to provide context to historical changes and reasons why changes were\nmade in a certain way, which would be especially important where new personnel are\nexpected to take over work on the application. In this regard, page 5 of the PDPC’s\nHandbook recommends organisations to:\n\n“Invest effort to document all software functional and technical\nspecifications (e.g. program specifications, system specifications and\ndatabase specifications). The usefulness of this documentation will become\neven more apparent over time as the original developers move on from the\nproject and new developers take over the software maintenance and upgrading.\nWithout proper documentation, developers often have no references to fall back\non, and may end up making assumptions about code logic that could produce\nincorrect results.”\n\n26\n\nIn respect of the 1st Incident, lack of proper documentation contributed to the\n\nerror which resulted in the data breaches. Carousell’s Platform’s chat function, which\nwas essentially a chat widget and data form, served multiple purposes which were not\nlimited to facilitating property listings in the Philippines market. Depending on the\nuser’s purposes, different form fields would be visible to the user within the chat\nfunction. The engineer who implemented the changes to the chat function on its\nPlatform was not the original author of the function, and did not have the context\n\n12\n\n\fnecessary to know that such changes would affect messages regarding other users\nand listing categories.\n\n27\n\nCarousell admitted that, while its handover process (at the time of the Incidents)\n\nincluded a document of the key features supported by the outgoing engineer, such\nprocess was otherwise undocumented and/or not directly communicated to the\nincoming engineer by the outgoing engineer. With regard to the 1st Incident\nspecifically, Carousell admitted that while the handover documentation pertained to\nthe chat function’s technical aspects, it did not address how Carousell uses the\nfunction for different purposes or how changes would affect specific groups of users.\n\n28\n\nIn respect of the 2nd Incident, the APIs involved in the system migration were\n\nbuilt in 2016 and did not have proper documentation. Carousell admitted that, as a\nresult, the personnel involved in the system migration may not have been aware of the\nneed to apply the filter to the relevant API post-migration.\n\n29\n\nIn the circumstances, it is determined that the Organisation negligently\n\nbreached the Protection Obligation in the Incidents by failing to conduct adequately\nscoped pre-launch testing, and by failing to adequately document functional and\ntechnical specifications of its software.\n\n13\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n30\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on Carousell pursuant to\n\ns 48J of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty, the factors listed at\ns48J(6) of the PDPA were taken into account.\n\n31\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n(a)\n\nCarousell was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nCarousell took prompt and effective remediation actions upon discovery\nof the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs in the 1st Incident, and the API\nBug and the data exfiltration in the 2nd Incident; and\n\n(c)\n\n32\n\nCarousell has not previously contravened the PDPA.\n\nThe Commission also recognises that the TA in the 2nd Incident was particularly\n\nsophisticated in avoiding the security measures Carousell had implemented. Carousell\nhad, prior to the 2nd Incident, put in place API processes and security measures, such\nas rate-limiting and traffic monitoring against API vulnerabilities. Carousell’s security\nmeasures in respect of detecting anomalies and/or abuse of its APIs were found to be\nadequate in general. Despite these measures, the TA took actions to remain\nundetected.\n\n33\n\nThe Commission’s investigations were handled under the EDP, under which\n\nCarousell admitted to the facts set out in this decision and to its contraventions of the\n\n14\n\n\fProtection Obligation in the context of the Incidents. The Organisation’s early\nadmission of liability for its breaches of the Protection Obligation is considered a\nsignificant mitigating factor. An organisation that voluntarily admits to its noncompliance with the PDPA and takes measures to correct such non-compliance is an\norganisation that demonstrates that it can be responsible for the personal data in its\npossession or under its control3.\n\n34\n\nBased on the above assessment, the Commission determines that a financial\n\npenalty of $58,000 should be imposed on Carousell.\n\nDirections\n\n35\n\nWhile Carousell implemented technical measures to correct specific issues that\n\nresulted in the Incidents, it should also review its internal processes for software\ntesting and documentation to address the failures identified above.\n\n36\n\nAccordingly, the Commission hereby directs Carousell to carry out the following\n\nwithin 90 days:\n\n(a)\n\nReview its software testing procedures;\n\n(b)\n\nReview its processes and procedures for documenting functional and\ntechnical specifications of software;\n\n(c)\n\nRectify any gaps identified from the reviews above; and\n\n3 See Section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\n15\n\n\f(d)\n\nFurnish to the Commission a report of the reviews and rectification\nactions taken in response.\n\nDENISE WONG\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n16\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $48,000 was imposed on Koh Wei Ming @ Muhammad Amin Koh (trading as Mobile Chat) for using his customers’ personal data to register for additional prepaid SIM cards without their consent.

It has\noperated since 2015 from a shop located in Geylang. As a retailer of M1 SIM cards,\n\n1\n\nUnder Section 43 of the PDPA, a person is not allowed to send specified messages to a Singapore telephone number registered\nwith the DNC register unless the person has, at the time where he sends the specified message, valid confirmation that the\nSingapore telephone number is not listed in the DNC register.\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fKWM was provided a terminal device by M1 installed at the Organisation’s premises\nfor the purposes of SIM card registration (the “M1 Terminal Device”). The M1\nTerminal Device was used for registration of SIM cards prior to December 2021. SIM\ncard registration had to be carried out in accordance with the conditions of M1’s\ntelecommunications licence granted under Section 5 of the Telecommunications Act\n(Chapter 323).2 The typical SIM card registration process would be as follows:\n(a)\n\nFirst, the customer’s identity document (e.g. identity card, passport, work\n\npass etc.) would be scanned using the M1 Terminal Device, which is connected\ndirectly to M1’s registration system. The system would capture the customer’s\npersonal data, and state whether the customer had reached the permitted limit\nof 3 prepaid SIM cards.\n(b)\n\nNext, the barcode of the SIM card(s) would be scanned so that they\n\ncould be tagged to the registered customer.\n(c)\n\nFinally, a mobile application would be used to load credit value to the\n\nprepaid SIM card(s) to activate them for usage. This was done in the\nOrganisation’s premises. M1’s policy was for each prepaid M1 SIM card to have\na zero-initial balance, and for retailers to load some or all of the money paid by\nthe customer.\n\n4\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that KWM exploited the above\n\nregistration process in order to use his customers’ personal data without consent to\n\n2\n\nThe version of the Telecommunications Act 1999 which was in force at the time\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fregister for additional prepaid M1 SIM cards that his customers did not intend to\npurchase. To do so, KWM would employ one of two methods:\n(a)\n\nMethod 1 (Duplicate Scanning) – After scanning a customer’s identity\n\ndocuments via the M1 Terminal Device to register the SIM card they wished to\npurchase, KWM would scan the identity documents a second time to register a\nsecond SIM card to the same customer without their knowledge. KWM would\nthen hand over only one SIM card to the customer, and keep the other to sell\nto unauthorised purchasers.\n(b)\n\nMethod 2 (Incomplete Transactions) – Occasionally, customers who\n\nhad completed the registration process would not want to continue with their\npurchase after learning that the credit value of the SIM card would have to be\nseparately loaded. At this juncture, instead of cancelling or reversing the\nregistration process, KWM would keep the SIM card(s) and activate them\nwithout the customer’s knowledge, and thereafter offer them for sale to other\nunauthorised purchasers.\n\n5\n\nDuring investigations, KWM admitted that the purpose of the above two\n\nmethods was to earn extra money from the unauthorised sale of the preregistered SIM\ncards. In his 4 years of selling such SIM cards to anonymous purchasers, KWM\nestimated that he made a profit of approximately $35,000 (i.e. around 250 illicit SIM\ncards per year at a profit of $35 per card).\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f6\n\nThe affected personal data collected and used by KWM to register the illicit SIM\n\ncards include the following personal data of 73 individuals (used to register 95 SIM\ncards):\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nThe customers’ names;\n\n(b)\n\nThe customers’ addresses; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe customers’ NRIC / FIN / passport numbers.\n\nHowever, it is likely that the personal data of many more individuals\n\n(approximately 1,000) was affected, based on KWM’s admission that he sold an\naverage of 250 prepaid SIM cards annually over 4 years.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines an “organisation” to include “any individual,\n\ncompany, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”. The\nOrganisation is a sole proprietorship and has no separate legal personality from KWM.\nFurther, KWM was acting in a business capacity in selling the illicit SIM cards to make\na profit, and not a domestic capacity (which ordinarily would have excluded him from\nbeing bound by the PDPA).3 Accordingly, KWM (trading as the Organisation) is an\norganisation for the purposes of the PDPA.\n\nSee also Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 at [9] – [10] and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile)\n[2021] PDPC 12 at [8]\n3\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\f9\n\nBased on the circumstances set out above, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether KWM had breached:\n(a)\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA\n10\n\nUnder Section 13 of the PDPA, organisations are prohibited from collecting,\n\nusing or disclosing an individual’s personal data unless the individual gives, or is\ndeemed to have given, his consent, unless otherwise authorised under the PDPA or\nany other written law (the “Consent Obligation”).\n\n11\n\nKWM breached the Consent Obligation by using his customers’ personal data\n\nwithout their consent:\n(a)\n\nIn the case of Method 1 (Duplicate Scanning), KWM’s customers\n\nconsented to the collection and use of their personal data only for the purpose\nof registering the number of SIM card(s) they had requested. They did not\nprovide consent to KWM to use their personal data for any other purpose,\nincluding the registration of additional SIM cards.\n(b)\n\nIn the case of Method 2 (Incomplete Transactions), the customers had\n\nwithdrawn their consent to the use of their personal data at the point where they\nfound that the credit value of the SIM card would have to be separately loaded.\nThe correct action for KWM to take would have been to cancel the SIM card\nregistration and not use the customers’ personal data any further. Instead,\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fKWM proceeded to keep the registered SIM card and activated them\nseparately, thereby continuing with the use of customers’ personal data for\npurposes they had not consented to.\n\n12\n\nIn the premises, KWM breached the Consent Obligation.\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under Section 18 of the PDPA\n13\n\nUnder Section 18 of the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances, and where that individual has been\ninformed of the said purposes under Section 20 of the PDPA (the “Purpose Limitation\nObligation”). As set out in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in\nthe PDPA:4\n“The main objective of the Purpose Limitation Obligation is to ensure that\norganisations collect, use and disclose personal data that are relevant for the\npurposes, and only for purposes that are reasonable.\nFor the purposes of section 18 (and as stated in that section), whether a\npurpose is reasonable depends on whether a reasonable person would\nconsider it appropriate in the circumstances. Hence the particular\ncircumstances involved need to be taken into account in determining whether\nthe purpose of such collection, use or disclosure is reasonable. For example,\na purpose that is in violation of a law or which would be harmful to the\n\n4\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 16 May 2022) at [13.3] – [13.4]\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\findividual concerned is unlikely to be considered appropriate by a reasonable\nperson.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n14\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation limits the use of personal data to the\n\npurposes for which the data subject had been notified and consented to, unless an\nexception to the consent requirement is applicable. The purpose for processing is\nsubject to a backstop, in that it must be reasonable in the circumstances.5 In\nconsidering whether the Purpose Limitation Obligation was breached, it is obvious that\nthe data subject did not give his consent for his or her personal data to be used for\nregistering SIM cards that were to be sold to other purchasers. The purpose that the\ndata subjects had consented to were for registration of SIM cards that they were\npurchasing.\n\n15\n\nIn the present case, KWM admitted that his purpose for using his customers’\n\npersonal data was to register illicit SIM cards in order to sell them to third parties and\nthereby make a profit. KWM also admitted that he knew this was wrong and illegal.\nSuch use of personal data is clearly not a reasonable purpose under any\ncircumstances, as KWM’s customers could not have reasonably intended for their\npersonal data to be used to register illicit SIM cards for KWM’s financial gain.\n\n5\n\nSee Re AIA Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 10 at [18] and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC\n12 at [15]\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\f16\n\nIn the premises, KWM has breached the Purpose Limitation Obligation.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n17\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on KWM pursuant to\n\nsection 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty, the matters\nset out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\ntaken into account, including the following aggravating and mitigating factors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nKWM’s breaches of the PDPA were difficult to detect as they did not\n\ncome to light until the customers’ numbers and personal data had been misused\nto send marketing messages. The Commission notes that prepaid SIM cards\nare frequently used to further criminal activities; accordingly, a supplier of\nprepaid SIM cards who breaches the PDPA must be dealt with severely for\ndeterrence purposes;\n(b)\n\nKWM’s actions were intentional and took place over a long period of 4\n\nyears;\n(c)\n\nKWM’s breaches of the PDPA caused inconvenience to innocent\n\nparties, as the illicit SIM cards sold by him were used to send unsolicited\nmessages to phone numbers that were registered with the DNC Register;\n(d)\n\nThrough the sale of the illicit SIM cards for approximately 4 years, KWM\n\nfinancially gained approximately $35,000 through the misuse of his customers’\npersonal data; and\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n(e)\n\nKWM admitted to liability early in the investigation process, thus reducing\n\nthe time and resources expended on investigations.\n\n18\n\nKWM was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s letter\n\ndated 16 May 2023 and was invited to make representations on the same.\n\nRepresentations Made by KWM\n19\n\nOn 17 May 2023, KWM made the following representations to the Commission\n\nseeking that a financial penalty not be imposed:\n(a)\n\nHe is the sole breadwinner of his family. However, he is likely to have a\n\nperiod without any income as he had been charged with committing an offence\nunder Section 5(1) (read with Section 11A) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap.\n50A, Rev. Ed. 2007) for unauthorised use of computer material, and was likely\nto be sentenced to an imprisonment term. The Commission notes that on 14\nSeptember 2023, he was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for the said\noffence; and\n(b)\n\nHe was seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for\n\nmental health issues.\n\n20\n\nKWM’s representations are not accepted for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nDespite the Commission’s repeated requests for him to adequately\n\nsubstantiate his assertions of personal and financial hardship, he did not do so.\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe fact that he was charged and sentenced for a criminal offence,\n\narising from the same set of actions as those which caused the breaches of the\nPDPA, is not in and of itself relevant to any enforcement action taken by the\nCommission.\n(c)\n\nThe fact that he was seeking treatment at the IMH is not, in and of itself,\n\na mitigating factor – especially when he was unable to provide further\ninformation about (i) the condition(s) for which he was seeking treatment and\n(ii) how such condition(s) were related to his breaches of the PDPA.\n\n21\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires KWM to pay a financial penalty of $48,000 within 30\ndays from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which\ninterest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\n22\n\nNo further directions are required given that the Organisation has ceased the\n\nunauthorised sale of preregistered SIM cards.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Tipros for failing to use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate.","tags":["Consent","Notification","Purpose Limitation","Directions","Others"],"date":"14 Dec 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_tipros_080623.pdf","nature":"Consent, Notification, Purpose Limitation","title":"Breach of the Purpose Limitation Obligation by Tipros","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/12/breach-of-the-purpose-limitation-obligation-by-tipros","timestamp":"2023-12-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2023] SGPDPC 7\nCase No. DP-2207-C0019\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTipros\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 8\n\n\fTipros\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2207-C0019\n8 June 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1. On 21 July 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived a complaint that Tipros (the “Organisation”), a sole proprietorship in the\nwholesale of and repair of electrical appliances, had unreasonably disclosed the\npersonal data of the complainant when responding to the complainant’s review on\nthe Organisation’s Google reviews page (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The Commission commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) and for\nsuspected breaches of the same.\n\nFacts of the Case\n3. The complainant had engaged the Organisation to repair a refrigerator. Following\nthe repairs made, the complainant gave a “1-star” review on a Google reviews page\n“24hr fridge refrigerator #1 Quick repair service Trusted in Singapore”, which has\nsince been renamed “Tipros.sg”.\n\n4. The Organisation promptly responded to the complainant’s review. What is\nproblematic was that the Organisation included the complainant’s personal data,\nincluding the complainant’s residential address and mobile number in their\nPage 2 of 8\n\n\fresponse. The complainant filed a complaint with the Commission as the\ncomplainant was of the view that there was no reason for the Organisation to\ndisclose her personal data in the course of responding to the review she left on the\nOrganisation’s Google reviews page.\n\n5. Apart from the Organisation’s response to the complainant’s review, the\nCommission found 13 other responses on the Organisation’s Google reviews page\nwhich disclosed, in a similar fashion, the personal data of other customers who had\ngiven reviews.\n\nOur Investigations\n\n6. The Commission commenced investigations. In the course of investigations, it was\nascertained that the Organisation’s place of business was vacant and its registered\noffice was occupied by another business which was not related to the Organisation.\nThus, a Notice to Produce Documents and Information for Investigation (“NTP”)\nwas delivered by hand on 25 October 2022 to the residential address belonging to\nthe Organisation’s sole proprietress, one Er Lee Cheng @ Angela Er Wei Leng\n(“Angela”). The Organisation failed to respond by the stated deadline.\n\n7. Thereafter, the Commission issued three further notices to Angela to attend\ninterviews, which were delivered by hand to Angela’s residential address on 8\nNovember 2022, 15 December 2022, and 10 January 2023.\n\nPage 3 of 8\n\n\f8. Following these notices, an individual claiming to be Angela contacted the\nCommission through an unlisted number on various occasions, namely 11\nNovember 2022, 17 November 2022, and 27 December 2022, and declined our\nrequest to attend an interview, or to schedule any other alternative dates for an\ninterview.\n\n9. The Commission is satisfied that the Organisation had received due notice of our\ninvestigative proceedings. Given the Organisation’s refusal to respond to our NTP\nand our notices to attend an interview, the Commission proceeded with its\ninvestigations based on the evidence available to it.\n\n10. The Commission is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Organisation’s\nresponses which disclosed the complainant’s personal data had been posted by\nthe Organisation for the following reasons: First, The Google reviews page reflects\nthe name of the Organisation; and second, the Organisation has a direct and\nmaterial interest in the reviews given by the complainant and other individuals on\nthe Organisation’s Google reviews page.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n11. Based on the circumstances disclosed above, the Commission’s investigations\ncentered on whether the Organisation had breached the Purpose Limitation\nObligation under section 18 of the PDPA.\n\nPage 4 of 8\n\n\fThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of the PDPA\n12. Under section 18(a) of the PDPA, organisations may collect, use or disclose\npersonal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate\nin the circumstances and — under section 18(b) — that the individual had been\ninformed prior to the intended collection, use or disclosure (the “Purpose\nLimitation Obligation”).\n\n13. I had previously discussed the ambit of when it would be acceptable for an\norganisation to disclose personal data when responding to public comments in M\nStars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 and in Big Bubble\nCentre [2018] SGPDPC 25. In Re M Stars Movers, I stated at [18] and [19] as\nfollows:\n“The Deputy Commissioner advises caution in disclosing personal data when\nresponding to public comments. An organisation should not be prevented or\nhampered from responding to comments about it using the same mode of\ncommunications that its interlocutor has selected. In some situations, it may be\nreasonable or even necessary to disclose personal data in order to advance an\nexplanation. … An individual who makes false or exaggerated allegations\nagainst an organisation in a public forum may not be able to rely on the PDPA\nto prevent the organisation from using material and relevant personal data of\nthe individual to explain the organisation’s position on the allegations through\nthe same public forum.\n\nThe following observations may be made in this context about the approach\nthat the Commission adopts. First, the Commission will not engage in weighing\nPage 5 of 8\n\n\fallegations and responses on golden scales in order to establish proportionality.\nThe better approach is to act against disclosures that are clearly\ndisproportionate on an objective standard before the Commission intervenes in\nwhat is essentially a private dispute…”\n\n14. When an individual chooses a public platform to pass comments about an\norganisation, the organisation is fully entitled to respond on the same platform in a\nproportionate and reasonable manner. In such circumstances, the individual had\ninitiated the communication and selected the public platform. The nature of the\nindividual’s comments will determine whether a response from the organisation is\nnecessary. Where the nature of the individual’s comments invites a response for\nthe purpose of advancing an explanation, such a purpose is considered reasonable\nin the circumstances under section 18(a). In advancing an explanation, it may be\nnecessary to use or disclose relevant facts in order for the explanation to be\neffective. Such disclosure is reasonable in the circumstances provided that the\nextent of disclosure is proportionate.\n\n15. Further, the requirement under section 18(b) read with section 20(1)(b) that the\nindividual be informed of the purpose prior to use or disclosure is also met in these\ncircumstances. The raison d’être for this requirement is to keep the individual\ninformed of the purposes for which his or her personal data is to be used or\ndisclosed, unless such use or disclosure is for purposes that are authorised by law.\nIn cases such as the present, the individual initiated the communication and the\nnature of his or her comments shapes the organisation’s response. As long as the\norganisation’s response is for a reasonable purpose that is a natural consequence\nPage 6 of 8\n\n\fof the individual’s comments, the individual is deemed to have been informed of\nsuch purpose. Thus, where an individual makes a complaint on a public platform\nin relation to an interaction with the organisation, it is natural that the organisation\nresponds on the same platform for the purpose of providing an explanation. And if\nuse or disclosure of personal data is necessary for such a purpose, the individual\nis deemed to have been informed prior to such user or disclosure since it is the\nindividual’s earlier actions that had elicited the response.\n\n16. In the present case, I am of the view that the Organisation’s disclosure of the\ncomplainant’s personal data was unreasonable and disproportionate. The\ncomplaint related to the poor standard of service that the Organisation delivered.\n\n17. The complainant alleged that two weeks after the Organisation repaired his or her\nrefrigerator, the refrigerator stopped working. The complainant was aggrieved that\nthe Organisation sought a payment of $80 ($20 transport fees and $60 checking\nfees) to check on the refrigerator two weeks after the Organisation fixed the\nrefrigerator, and that the Organisation’s technician was supposedly not available\nover the weekend when the complainant had only engaged the Organisation\nbecause the Organisation had supposedly advertised itself as providing round-theclock service. Given the grievances flagged in the complainant’s review, there was\nno issue about the location for delivery of the service. Thus, it was unnecessary for\nthe Organisation to disclose the complainant’s residential address. In the same\nvein, I do not see how disclosure of the complainant’s mobile number was\nnecessary to advance an explanation in response to the complaint.\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\n\fThe Commission’s Decision\n18. Based on the facts established, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach\nof its obligation under section 18(a) of the PDPA. The Organisation’s failure to\nrespond to NTP and refusal to attend for an interview are duly considered as\naggravating factors. As the Organisation had not taken any action to remove or\namend its response to the complaint, there is no mitigating factors to speak of.\n\n19. In the circumstances, I hereby direct the Organisation to:\n(a) Remove the disclosure of the complainant’s residential address and mobile\nnumber in its response to the complainant’s comments on the Organisation’s\nGoogle reviews page; and\n(b) Review the 13 other responses on the Organisation’s Google reviews page\nwhere it had also disclosed personal data of other customers in response to their\nreviews, and to remove disclosure of personal data if such disclosure is not\nreasonable or proportionate in order for the Organisation to respond to the Google\nreviews.\nThe Organisation is given 30 days to comply with these directions.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on Ascentis for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Admin and Support Services"],"date":"10 Nov 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_ascentis_12092023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Ascentis","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/10/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ascentis","timestamp":"2023-11-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 10\n\nCase No. DP-2209-C0193 / DP-2209-C0217\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nAscentis Pte.

Ltd.\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner - Case No. DP-2209-C0193 / DP2209-C0217\n12 September 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 13 September 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team\nthat the personal data of 332,774 individuals had been exfiltrated from an eCommerce\nplatform (the “Platform”) owned by Starbucks Coffee Singapore Pte Ltd (“Starbucks\nSG”) and offered for sale online (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether the\n\ncircumstances of the Incident disclosed any contraventions of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). For the reasons set out below, the Commission\ndetermined that the developer of the Platform, Ascentis Pte Ltd (“the Organisation”)\nhad contravened section 24 of the PDPA (“the Protection Obligation”) in the context\nof the Incident.\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation requested and agreed for the investigation to be handled\n\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure, and voluntarily\nprovided and admitted to the facts set out below. The Organisation also admitted that\n2\n\n\fit had failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal\ndata exfiltrated during the Incident, in breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\n4\n\nThe Commission also accepted a voluntary undertaking from Starbucks SG\n\npursuant to section 48L(1)(a) of the PDPA for Starbucks SG to implement enhanced\nsecurity arrangements to improve its compliance with the PDPA1. No further\nenforcement action was taken against Starbucks SG.\n\nFacts of the Case\nThe CRM System and CRM Database\n5\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of developing, providing and integrating\n\nsoftware solutions for Customer Relationship Management and eCommerce.\n\n6\n\nOn 19 December 2014, Starbucks SG engaged the Organisation to develop,\n\nimplement, support, and host a Customer Relationship Management system (the\n“CRM System”) to support Starbucks SG’s “My Starbucks Rewards” loyalty program\n(the “Rewards Program”).\n\n7\n\nWhen an individual signed up as a member of the Rewards Program, their\n\npersonal data including name, email address, telephone number, and birth date was\ncollected and stored on a cloud database (the “CRM Database”).\n\n1\n\nA copy of Starbucks SG’s voluntary undertaking is available at https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Undertakings.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Project for development of the Platform\n8\n\nOn 14 September 2020, Starbucks SG engaged the Organisation to separately\n\ndevelop and provide, as well as render ongoing technical support for, the Platform, an\nonline store for the sale and purchase of products offered by Starbucks SG (“the\nProject”).\n\n9\n\nIn turn, on 1 January 2021, the Organisation engaged one Kyanon Digital Co.\n\nLtd (“Kyanon”), a company based in Vietnam in the business of software development\nand provision, to provide additional manpower and software development support to\nthe Organisation for its execution of the Project.\n\n10\n\nOne of Starbucks SG’s requirements for the Project was for a Rewards Program\n\nmember’s personal data to be auto-completed in electronic forms on the Platform,\nsuch that the member would not have to manually key in his/her personal data to\ncomplete a transaction on the Platform.\n\n11\n\nThe personal data of Rewards Program members was originally only stored on\n\nthe CRM Database (and not on the Platform). In order to make it more convenient for\nmembers to use the Platform, the Organisation implemented a process to\nautomatically synchronise a member’s personal data from the CRM Database to the\nPlatform whenever an individual logged in as a member on the Starbucks SG website\nand then visited the Platform. This synchronisation occurred in real-time. Once the\n4\n\n\fsynchronisation was complete, the member’s personal data would exist separately in\na database within the Platform. Both the CRM Database and the database within the\nPlatform were hosted and operated independently.\n\nKyanon’s involvement in the Project\n12\n\nDespite Kyanon’s engagement, the Organisation maintained control and\n\nmanagement of, and had direct involvement in, the Project. The leader of the team\ndelivering the Project (the “Project Team”), was an employee of the Organisation,\nwhile the remaining personnel comprising the Project Team were employees of\nKyanon (the “Kyanon Employees”)\n\n13\n\nThe Kyanon Employees were provided with accounts to the Platform with full\n\nadministrative privileges (the “Admin Accounts”). These enabled the Kyanon\nEmployees to support, check and perform configuration of the Platform, troubleshoot\nany technical problems, and check if data received on the Platform had been\nsynchronised correctly. The Admin Accounts also granted rights to Kyanon Employees\nto export data from the Platform (the significance of which is discussed below). Prior\nto the Incident, the Admin Accounts did not require multi-factor authentication (“MFA”).\n\n14\n\nOne of the Kyanon Employees, “Peter”, left the employ of Kyanon in May 2022.\n\nHe handed over the credentials to his Admin Account (“Peter’s Admin Account”) to\nthe remaining members of the Project Team via a shared Google Sheet. Despite the\ncessation of Peter’s employment with Kyanon, Peter’s Admin Account was not\n5\n\n\fdisabled. Rather, the Kyanon Employees changed the password of Peter’s Admin\nAccount to “Kyanon@123456”, updated the shared Google Sheet with the new\npassword, and continued using Peter’s Admin Account among themselves.\n\nThe Incident\n15\n\nSometime between 10 and 13 September 2022, a malicious actor used Peter’s\n\nAdmin Account to gain access to the Platform, where the personal data of those\nRewards Program members who had previously logged into the Platform was stored.\nThe Organisation was not able to determine the exact method by which the malicious\nactor gained access to Peter’s Admin Account; it was possibly through the\nabovementioned shared Google Sheet. The malicious actor granted other accounts\nadministrative privileges, performed data gathering, and exported the gathered data\nto an external email address.\n\n16\n\nIn total, the personal data of 332,774 individuals stored in the Platform\n\ncomprising names, email addresses, dates of birth, membership details relating to the\nRewards Program, last login dates to the Platform, the physical addresses of 181,875\nindividuals, and the telephone numbers of 310,560 individuals (“Subject Data”) was\nexfiltrated in the Incident.\n\n17\n\nThe Subject Data was subsequently advertised for sale on an online forum on\n\nthe dark web. The Commission was notified of the same by the Singapore Computer\nEmergency Response Team on 13 September 2022. Starbucks SG and the\n6\n\n\fOrganisation submitted data breach notifications to the Commission on 15 and 16\nSeptember 2022, respectively.\n\nRemedial Actions\n18\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took remedial actions which\n\nincluded:\n(a)\n\nActivating an emergency response team and establishing an investigation\nteam (including an external cybersecurity firm) to investigate the Incident;\n\n(b)\n\nDisabling access to the Platform by all accounts, validating all Platform\naccounts, and resetting all administrator accounts;\n\n(c)\n\nBlocking the malicious actor’s IP address in the Platform firewall;\n\n(d)\n\nMandating that all vendors, including Kyanon, perform full anti-virus and\nmalware scans, and provide reports of these scans to the Organisation\nbefore resuming work; and\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented MFA for all its accounts.\n\n7\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n19\n\nUnder the Protection Obligation, an organisation must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n20\n\nThe Protection Obligation also applies to data intermediaries2. A data\n\nintermediary is defined under section 2(1) of the PDPA as “an organisation which\nprocesses personal data on behalf of another organisation but does not include an\nemployee of that other organisation”. In turn, the “processing” of personal data is\ndefined as:\n“in relation to personal data, means the carrying out of any operation or set of\noperations in relation to the personal data, and includes any of the following:\n\n2\n3\n\n(a)\n\nrecording;\n\n(b)\n\nholding;\n\n(c)\n\norganisation, adaptation or alteration;\n\n(d)\n\nretrieval;\n\n(e)\n\ncombination;\n\n(f)\n\ntransmission;\n\n(g)\n\nerasure or destruction;”3\n\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA.\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\f21\n\nAs the developer and host of the CRM System and the Platform, the Organisation\n\nprocessed personal data (including the Subject Data) in the CRM Database and the\nPlatform on Starbucks SG’s behalf. Accordingly the Organisation was a data\nintermediary of Starbucks SG and was subject to the Protection Obligation in respect\nof the Subject Data.\n\n22\n\nThe reasonableness of an organisation’s security arrangements would be\n\nassessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such personal data and the\npossible impact of a data breach. As stated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines\non Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 16 May 2022)\n(“Advisory Guidelines”) at paragraphs 17.3(a) and (b), an organisation should:\n\n“a) design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n…\nc) implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of security\n…”\n\n23\n\nAdditionally, as stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices\n\nfor ICT Systems (“ICT Systems Guide”) at page 8:\n\n9\n\n\f“For organisations that hold large quantities of different types of personal data or\ndata that might be more sensitive to the individuals or the organisations, they\nshould additionally implement the relevant enhanced practices suggested in\neach section. The design and implementation of these protection measures\nshould always take into consideration the extent of the sensitivity of the data\nbased on the nature of business and types of services offered.”\n\n24\n\nIn the present case, having regard to the large volume of personal data hosted\n\nin the Platform, reasonable security arrangements to protect the Subject Data were\nnot implemented. The Commission sets out the reasons for this finding in the\nparagraphs below. In particular, the Organisation failed to disable Peter’s Admin\nAccount after he was no longer working on the Project.\n\n25\n\nIn the ICT Systems Guide, the Commission recommends at page 15 that\n\norganisations should, as a basic practice, conduct “Regular review of user accounts\nto ensure that all the accounts are active and the rights assigned are necessary (i.e.\nremove user accounts when a user has left the organisation or update the user’s\nrights when he/she has changed his/her role within the organisation).” (emphasis\nadded in bold).\n\n26\n\nIn this case however, the Organisation did not disable Peter’s Admin Account\n\nafter he left the employ of Kyanon but permitted its continued use by Kyanon\nEmployees. While Peter was an ex-employee of Kyanon and not of the Organisation,\n10\n\n\fit was nevertheless (by the Organisation’s own admission) the Organisation itself\nwhich retained responsibility for the development and management of the Platform,\nincluding the creation and management of administrator accounts. The Organisation\nadmitted that the failure to disable Peter’s Admin Account was a “lapse” on its part,\nand further admitted that it failed to create new accounts for the Kyanon Employees\nwho took over Peter’s duties.\n\n27\n\nThe failure to disable Peter’s Admin Account was exacerbated by the fact that\n\nthe account was not protected with a sufficiently complex password. Having taken over\nPeter’s Admin Account, the Kyanon Employees changed the password to\n“Kyanon@123456” (the “New Password”). The Organisation informed the\nCommission that the New Password met the Platform’s password complexity\nrequirements, namely that passwords be at least 8 characters in length, have at least\n1 upper and 1 lower case letter, at least 1 special character, and not be a repeat of\nthe account’s previous 5 passwords.\n\n28\n\nThe Commission has made clear in previous enforcement decisions that mere\n\ntechnical compliance with password complexity requirements is not good enough if\nthe password remains guessable4. Although the New Password complied with the\nPlatform’s password complexity requirements, it incorporated the name “Kyanon” and\n\n4\n\nRe Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPR 1 at [5(d)].\n\n11\n\n\fa sequential series of digits (“123456”). This made the New Password easily\nguessable and insecure.\n\n29\n\nFurther, the sharing of credentials for Peter’s Admin Account via a shared\n\nGoogle Sheet meant that anyone who obtained access to the said Google Sheet could\ngain access to Peter’s Admin Account. As the Commission has stated in the ICT\nSystems Guide at page 16, an organisation should “[h]ave clear policies that prohibit\nthe sharing of passwords such as admin credentials”. Such sharing posed a\nheightened risk of unauthorised access especially if a malicious actor was familiar with\nPeter’s user ID.\n\n30\n\nThe Organisation stressed to the Commission that passwords for accounts to the\n\nPlatform were hashed, and that the Organisation was unaware of the New Password.\nFurther, the Organisation stated that Peter’s Admin Account was used by Kyanon\nEmployees and not the Organisation’s employees, and that the New Password was\nset by the Kyanon Employees using Peter’s Admin Account.\n\n31\n\nWhile the immediate cause for the weak New Password and insecure sharing of\n\nthe credentials for Peter’s Admin Account may have been the Kyanon Employees, the\nOrganisation could have managed this better by specifying clearer data protection\nrequirements to Kyanon as part of its involvement in the Project, including in relation\nto account management.\n\n12\n\n\f32\n\nWhile the Master Services Agreement between the Organisation and Kyanon\n\ndated 1 January 2021 did impose broad data protection obligations on Kyanon, it did\nnot mandate any specific measures in relation to account management, beyond\nstating that “secure authentication and authorisation processes” were to be\nimplemented.\n\n33\n\nIn addition, Kyanon had provided the Organisation with a signed Letter of\n\nUndertaking in which Kyanon undertook to comply with “the standards in relation to\npersonal data protection, including those required under the Personal Data Protection\nAct (No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore (the “PDPA Policy”)”, the Organisation’s Security\nand Services Guide, and the Organisation’s Personal Data Handling and Measures.\nHowever, these documents did not specify any specific requirements for the disabling\nof ex-employee accounts.\n\n34\n\nTaking into consideration the above, the Commission finds the Organisation in\n\nbreach of the Protection Obligation for failing to disable Peter’s Admin Account after\nPeter was no longer a Kyanon employee.\n\nObservations on other data protection practices\n35\n\nSeparate to the above finding (which the Organisation admitted to), the\n\nCommission sets out observations on two other data protection practices which, if\nimplemented, could have prevented the unauthorised disclosure of personal data in\nthe Incident even if Peter’s Admin Account had not been disabled. For the avoidance\n13\n\n\fof doubt, these observations are made solely to provide guidance, and (i) do not\nconstitute additional findings of breaches of the Protection Obligation by the\nOrganisation in this case, or (ii) factor in any way in the Commission’s final decision in\nthis case.\n\nScoping of rights assigned to Admin Accounts\n36\n\nAll Admin Accounts assigned to Kyanon Employees were granted rights to\n\nexport data from the Platform, even though such rights may not have been necessary\nfor their work on the Project.\n\n37\n\nAs stated in the ICT Systems Guide (page 15) and paragraph 25 above, the\n\nCommission recommends regular review of user accounts to ensure that only the\nnecessary rights are assigned. The Commission has previously found organisations\nin breach for failing to carry out such review.5\n\nImplementation of MFA for Admin Accounts\n38\n\nThe level of privileges granted to all Admin Accounts created a heightened risk\n\nthat large volumes of personal data could be exfiltrated from the Platform if an Admin\nAccount was compromised. This risk was exacerbated by the fact that the Admin\nAccount did not require MFA. In Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3,\nthe Commission made clear that MFA should be implemented as a baseline\n\n5\n\nRedMart Limited [2022] SGPDPC 8 at [19].\n\n14\n\n\frequirement for administrative accounts with access to confidential or sensitive\npersonal data or large volumes of personal data.6\n\n39\n\nIn this case, the Organisation explained that while it had plans to implement\n\nMFA for the Admin Accounts (as part of unified access controls), these plans were\ndelayed due to manpower shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n40\n\nWhile the Commission recognises the business difficulties brought on by the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, implementation of MFA for the Admin Accounts could\nnevertheless have been given greater priority considering the volume of personal data\naccessible from the Platform, and the associated heightened data protection risks.\n\n41\n\nIt was not necessary for the Commission to make breach findings in relation to\n\nthe above two data protection practices in this case. However, the Commission will\nnot hesitate to find organisations in future enforcement cases in breach of the\nProtection Obligation for failing to implement the same – particularly in cases involving\nunauthorised use of administrative accounts with access to sensitive or large volumes\nof personal data.\n\n6\n\nLovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 at [51].\n\n15\n\n\fThe Commission’s Decision\n42\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty,\nthe Commission took into account the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA.\n\n43\n\nThe Commission notes that the personal data of 332,774 individuals was\n\naffected in the Incident and that this largely consisted of basic contact and account\nmembership information.\n\n44\n\nThe Commission also recognises that:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial actions to address the Incident;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Organisation has not previously been found to have breached the\nPDPA; and\n\n(d)\n\nthe Organisation had voluntarily accepted responsibility for the Incident,\nthus facilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of this case\nthrough the Commission’s expedited breach procedure.\n\n16\n\n\f45\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby\n\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $10,000 within 30 days from the\ndate of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the\nrate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty\nis paid in full.\n\n46\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures already\n\ntaken by the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n17\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $82,000 was imposed on Tokyo Century Leasing for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Finance and Insurance","Vulnerability"],"date":"10 Nov 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_tokyo_century_leasing_040923.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Tokyo Century Leasing","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/10/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-tokyo-century-leasing","timestamp":"2023-11-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 9\nCase No. DP-2206-B9897\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nTokyo Century Leasing (Singapore) Pte.

Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) of a ransomware attack which resulted in the encryption of the\npersonal data of 141,412 individuals (“Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested that the investigation be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure. The Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and admitted to the facts set out below, and admitted that it had failed to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data accessed\nand encrypted during the Incident, in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation is in the leasing and hire-purchase business. It operates a\n\nwebsite through which existing or potential customers may submit applications to enter\ninto hire-purchase or leasing agreements.\n\nPage 2 of 14\n\n\f4\n\nOn 12 June 2022, the Organisation was notified by a customer that he was\n\nunable to submit an online application. The Organisation conducted an internal\ninvestigation and discovered that 7 servers and 6 employee computers had been\ninfected with ransomware, resulting in the encryption of the personal data of 141,412\nindividuals, comprising:\n\na)\n\n111,156 customers whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number,\ndate of birth, address, contact number, income statement, email address,\nemployer information, bank account, and additionally for foreign customers,\ntheir passport numbers and employment pass numbers;\n\nb)\n\n30,220 guarantors whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number,\ndate of birth, address, contact number, income statement, email address,\nemployer information, and bank account; and\n\nc)\n\n36 employees whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number, date\nof birth, address, contact number, email address, bank account, resume\ninformation, and medical check-up information.\n\n(collectively the “Subject Data”)\n\n5\n\nThe Subject Data was encrypted by a virus with the extension “.myghost”. The\n\nOrganisation also discovered a ransom note instructing the Organisation to contact\n“apichai[@]keemail.me” or “teeraanu[@]tuta.io” to obtain the decryption key, failing\n\nPage 3 of 14\n\n\fwhich the Subject Data would be leaked. The ransom note did not specify a ransom\namount. The Organisation did not respond to the ransom note.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation notified the Commission of the Incident on 14 June 2022. On\n\n8 July 2022, the Organisation requested that the investigation be handled under the\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure, and in a statement by its\nManaging Director dated 29 July 2022, admitted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\nInvestigations were conducted between 14 June 2022 and October 2022,\n\ncomprising the efforts of an IT forensic investigation firm engaged by the\nOrganisation’s parent organisation, and the Commission’s own investigations. The\ninvestigations revealed that:\n\na)\n\nA malicious encryption programme “Stager.exe” had been executed on at\nleast 3 servers by a compromised administrator account through Remote\nDesktop Connections;1\n\nb)\n\nThe IP address of each of the Remote Desktop Connections was generated\nby a FortiGate 100E Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) and firewall device\n(“Device”) in use by the Organisation since September 2019;\n\nc)\n\nThe software installed on the Device was the outdated version 6.0.4 of\nFortiOS and had a known vulnerability CVE-2018-13379 (“Vulnerability”).2\n\n1\n\nA Remote Desktop Connection refers to the connection and control by a user to a target device (such as a computer) remotely\nthrough the internet or other network.\n2\nThis is the same vulnerability that may have been exploited in the data breach incident which is the subject of the Commission’s\ndecision in The Law Society of Singapore [2023] SGPDPC 4.\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\fThe effect of the Vulnerability was that a malicious actor could, via the\ninternet, remotely access system files on the Device, specifically\n“sslvpn_websession”, containing the username and password of a VPN\nsession. With such details, the malicious actor would be able to gain access\nto the VPN to which the target’s (in this case, the Organisation) devices\nwere connected;\n\nd)\n\nThe most likely cause of the Incident was that malicious actor(s) exploited\nthe Vulnerability, thereby gaining access to the Organisation’s VPN. The\nmalicious actor(s) in turn compromised one of the Organisation’s\nadministrator accounts, gaining access to the Subject Data stored on the\nOrganisations servers and computers. However, no evidence was\ndiscovered to indicate that the Subject Data had been exfiltrated;\n\ne)\n\nThe Device’s manufacturer released a patch in May 2019 to address the\nVulnerability,3 but the patch had not been installed by the time of the\nIncident. The Organisation informed the Commission that while its IT\nvendor had the responsibility of upgrading the Organisation’s firewall, such\nupgrading / patching was only triggered upon request by the Organisation.\nHowever, the Organisation was unaware of the patch, did not have\nprocesses in place to manage software patches, and therefore did not\nrequest its IT vendor to patch the Vulnerability; and\n\nFortinet, Inc, “FortiOS system file leak through SSL VPN via specially crafted HTTP resource requests” (FortiGuard Labs, 24\nMay 2019) <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384> accessed 23 March 2023.\n3\n\nPage 5 of 14\n\n\ff)\n\nThe Organisation had not implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (“MFA”)\nfor its administrator accounts at the time of the Incident.\n\nRemedial Action\n8\n\nAfter the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na)\n\nReported the Incident to the Singapore Police Force and the Commission,\nwithin 72 hours of the discovery by the Organisation of the same;\n\nb)\n\nPublished a notice of the Incident on its website, and engaged an external\ncall centre to provide hotline services to affected customers;\n\nc)\n\nConducted anti-virus scans on all its computers;\n\nd)\n\nEngaged an IT forensic investigation firm to scan and monitor the internet\nfor the Subject Data. The IT forensic investigation firm did not detect any\ndisclosure of the same on the internet;\n\ne)\n\nPatched the Vulnerability and its Windows systems;\n\nf)\n\nChanged the passwords for its administrator accounts for all its servers and\ncritical network equipment; and\n\ng)\n\nImplemented MFA for access to its VPN.\n\nPage 6 of 14\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n9\n\nUnder section 24 of the PDPA an organisation must protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n10\n\nThe reasonableness of an organisation’s security arrangements to protect\n\npersonal data would be assessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such\npersonal data and the possible impact of a data breach. As stated in the Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 17\nMay 2022) (“Advisory Guidelines”) at paragraphs 17.3(a) and (b), an organisation\nshould:\n\n“a) design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n…\nc) implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of security\n…”\n\n11\n\nIn the present case, the Subject Data comprised a large volume of sensitive\n\npersonal data affecting 141,412 individuals. Such data included names, NRIC\nnumbers, bank account information and income statements. Given the nature of such\nPage 7 of 14\n\n\fpersonal data, there was a heightened risk of identity theft and/or financial loss, which\ncalled for a higher standard of security arrangements.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons set out below the Commission determines that the Organisation\n\nfailed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the Subject Data, in\nbreach of the Protection Obligation. In particular, the Organisation failed to:\n\na)\n\nConduct regular monitoring for software patches;\n\nb)\n\nImplement processes to manage software patches and upgrades; and\n\nc)\n\nImplement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\nFailure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches\n13\n\nThe importance of conducting regular monitoring for software patches, and more\n\ngenerally testing the vulnerability of info-communications and technology (“ICT”)\nsystems, has been stressed repeatedly by the Commission.\n\n14\n\nIn Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11, the Commission highlighted at\n\nparagraph 14 that it was necessary for organisations to conduct regular reviews and\nmonitoring of their ICT systems, which would include monitoring for software patches\nand updates.\n\n15\n\nThe Commission has also made clear at page 27 of its Guide to Data Protection\n\nPractices for ICT Systems, that as a basic measure, organisations ought to “conduct\nPage 8 of 14\n\n\fregular ICT monitoring, alerts, security audits, scan and tests to detect vulnerabilities\nand non-compliance with organisational standards.”\n\n16\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to conduct regular monitoring for software\n\npatches for the software on the Device. The Device (with the Vulnerability) had been\nin use by the Organisation since September 2019, more than 3 months since the\nDevice’s manufacturer had released the patch in May 2019. The Vulnerability\nremained un-patched for a period of almost 3 years thereafter until the Incident\noccurred. The Organisation admitted that it was unaware of the patch until after the\nIncident and that it did not conduct regular monitoring for software patches. Had the\nOrganisation conducted regular monitoring for software patches, it would have learned\nof the patch for the Vulnerability.\n\n17\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches to the\nsoftware on the Device.\n\nFailure to implement processes to manage software patches and upgrades\n18\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches\n\nunderscores the importance for organisations to implement processes to manage the\nsame.\n\n19\n\nAs noted at paragraph 7(e) above, software patching was done on an ad-hoc\n\nbasis by the Organisation’s IT vendor on the instructions of the Organisation. However,\nas the Organisation failed to monitor for software patches, it was unaware of the\nPage 9 of 14\n\n\favailable patch for the Vulnerability, and did not instruct the IT vendor to install the\npatch.\n\n20\n\nBased on the Organisation’s clarifications to the Commission, it is likely that the\n\nOrganisation assumed that its IT vendor would monitor for software patches even\nthough the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor did not contain any requirements\nfor the IT vendor to conduct regular monitoring. The Organisation failed to properly\napply its mind to the issue of regular monitoring, as this was not contained in the\ncontract between the Organisation and its IT vendor.\n\n21\n\nIn its Checklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches, the\n\nCommission recommends at page 6 that organisations should, as a basic practice,\n“Develop an ICT policy that covers the critical aspects in IT security such as account\nand access control, password, email, IT risk management, asset and configuration,\nbackup and recovery, hardening and patching.”\n\n22\n\nWhile the Commission does not prescribe the specific terms of such ICT\n\npolicies and/or processes, the Organisation could, for example, have implemented\nprocesses by which the Organisation or its IT vendors were automatically notified of\navailable software patches, or reminded on a periodic basis to conduct checks for\nsoftware patches. Further, the contract between the Organisation and its IT vendor\ncould have specifically included an obligation for the IT vendor to conduct regular\nmonitoring for patches, without the need for the Organisation to request patching on\nan ad-hoc basis. However, the Organisation failed to implement any such processes\nto manage software patches and upgrades.\nPage 10 of 14\n\n\f23\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation provided the Commission with copies of its\n\nInternal Data Protection Policy and its Compliance Handbook. However, neither\ndocument sets out any processes to manage software patches and upgrades.\n24\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement processes to manage software patches and\nupgrades.\n\nFailure to implement MFA for administrator accounts\n25\n\nThe Organisation also failed to implement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\n26\n\nIn its decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 published\n\non 19 May 2022 (i.e. before the Incident), the Commission made clear that MFA was\nto be implemented as a baseline requirement for accounts with access to confidential\nor sensitive personal data or large volumes of personal data:\n\n“Henceforth, the Commission adopts the following tiered approach:\n\n(a) First, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data: see [46][47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach, unless the\norganisation can show that its omission is reasonable or implementation of 2FA\nis disproportionate.\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\f(b) Second, remote access by privileged accounts to information systems\nthat host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large volumes of\npersonal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA / MFA. The risks\nconcerning remote access are higher, thus the expectation to implement 2FA /\nMFA will correspondingly increase.\n\n(c) Third, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or sensitive\npersonal data, or large volumes of personal data, are expected to enable\nand configure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that is available out-of-the-box.\nOmission to do so may be considered an aggravating factor.”4 (emphasis added\nin bold)\n\n27\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to implement MFA for its administrator\n\naccounts despite these accounts having access to confidential and sensitive personal\ndata.5 The Organisation did not furnish any explanation as to why such failure was\nreasonable or that the implementation of MFA would have been disproportionate.\n\n28\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission notes that the present case and the first tier of the approach\n\nin Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 (reproduced at paragraph 25\nabove) deal specifically with administrator accounts. However, where an account is\n\n4\n\nSee Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd.

Further, the patch for the\nVulnerability had been available for a lengthy period of 2 years and 9 months from\nthe time the Organisation first started using the Device until the Incident, but was not\ninstalled during that time. The Organisation had also failed to implement MFA for its\nadministrator accounts.\n\n32\n\nThe Commission nevertheless recognises the following mitigating factors:\n\na)\n\nthe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\nb)\n\nthe Organisation took prompt remedial actions to address the Incident; and\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\n\fc)\n\nthe Organisation had voluntarily accepted responsibility for the Incident,\nthus facilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of this case\nthrough the expedited breach procedure.\n\n33\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby\n\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $82,000 within 30 days from the\ndate of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the\nrate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be\npayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty\nis paid in full.\n\n34\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures already\n\ntaken by the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 14 of 14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on Century Evergreen for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of jobseekers in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Employment","URL manipulation"],"date":"15 Sep 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_century_evergreen_260723.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Century Evergreen","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/09/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-century-evergreen","timestamp":"2023-09-15","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 5\n\nCase No. DP-2212-C0526\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCentury Evergreen Private Limited\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 11 December 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a complaint against Century Evergreen Private Limited\n(the “Organisation”) that images of identification documents (which includes the\nNational Registration Identity Card) submitted by jobseekers to the Organisation\nwere publicly accessible on the Organisation’s website (“Incident”). The\nOrganisation is a manpower contracting services company and required\njobseekers to submit their identification documents to verify the identity of and\nsuitability of the jobseeker in question.\n\n2. Following the complaint received, the Commission commenced investigations to\ndetermine the Organisation’s compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”). The Organisation requested that the investigation be handled\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fthe Organisation voluntarily provided and admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. The Organisation also admitted that it failed to implement reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and control,\nand was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n3. The Organisation admitted that the Insecure Direct Object References (“IDOR”)\nvulnerability on its website, which allowed the complainant to manipulate the URL\nhad existed from the time the website was launched on 9 November 2015. As a\nresult of this vulnerability, 96,889 images of identification documents belonging to\n23,940 individuals were downloaded from the Organisation’s website from 10 to 12\nDecember 2022.\n\n4. The Organisation admitted that it was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA as it\nfailed to include any security requirements to protect personal data in its contract\nwith the vendor who first developed and subsequently maintained the website. In\nthis regard, even though the Organisation had engaged an IT vendor from the time\nthe website was developed and launched, the Organisation remained solely\nresponsible for protecting the personal data in its possession and control at all\nmaterial times.\n\n5. What is expected from organisations who engage professional services to build\ntheir websites and other online portals is explained in the Commission’s Guide on\nBuilding Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) (the “Guide”). The Commission\nhad consistently advised organisations of the need to emphasise the protection of\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\fpersonal data to their IT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms.1 The\ncontract should clearly state the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the\nPDPA. In this regard, the Commission noted that there was a glaring omission of\nclauses to protect personal data in the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor.\n\n6. The Organisation also admitted that apart from conducting functionality testing\nwhen the website was first launched, the Organisation had no arrangements with\nits IT vendor to conduct any security tests prior to the launch of the website, or\nthereafter. The Organisation had also failed to impose any security requirements\non the IT vendor to protect personal data, via contract.\n\n7. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner found that the Organisation had\ncontravened section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n8. In deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered that\na financial penalty ought to be imposed as the personal data affected included not\njust the identification numbers, but the images of the identification documents.\nFurthermore, there was a long period of non-compliance. The vulnerability was not\naddressed since 2015.\n\n9. In deciding on the appropriate amount of financial penalty, the circumstances set\nout above and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were considered,\nspecifically the impact of the personal data breach on the individuals affected and\nthe nature of the Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA. In the\ncircumstances, this was not an insignificant breach given the number of individuals\n\n1\n\nSee Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1] and Re EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 38.\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\faffected (ie 23,940) and the nature of personal data exfiltrated: 96,889 images of\nidentification documents.\n10. The Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA was also not simply one of\nmere negligence but that of gross negligence. There was a long period of noncompliance on the facts of this case. As set out above, the Commission had issued\nthe Guide to assist SMEs, and consistently cautioned the need for organisations\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA even when they engage an IT vendor in our\nprevious decisions.2\n\n11. In deciding on the appropriate amount of the financial penalty, the following factors\nwere considered – the Organisation’s turnover and profitability, its cooperation\nthroughout the investigation, its voluntary admission of breach of the Protection\nObligation under the EDP, and the prompt remedial actions taken after the\nOrganisation became aware of the IDOR vulnerability. This included rectifying the\nIDOR vulnerability, making server configuration changes to improve security,\nimplementing vulnerability scans, migrating its backup server to an encrypted\nremote server, deploying additional security software and subscription to security\nservices, and securing a new contract with its vendor to manage the security of its\nwebsite. In addition to its prompt remedial actions, its poor performance in the most\nrecent financial year was also taken into consideration. Finally, the organisation\nhad admitted to its culpability at an early stage and elected to proceed under the\nEDP.\n\n2\n\nRe EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 38 and Re Vhive Pte Ltd (Case No. DP-2013-B8138).\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f12. For the reasons above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and directs the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of S$9,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date of\nthis decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgement debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount\nof such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on Autobahn Rent A Car for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1\n\nOn 21 October 2022, Autobahn Rent A Car Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal\ndata breach (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates a car-sharing service, Shariot, in Singapore. On 24\n\nSeptember 2022, the Organisation received customer feedback that a photograph on\nits mobile application had been replaced with a pornographic photograph. The\nOrganisation discovered that the pornographic photograph had been uploaded\nthrough an unrevoked administrator account belonging to an ex-employee, who had\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\fleft the Organisation in May 2022. The ex-employee received an email from an\nunknown sender on 10 September 2022 stating that his personal laptop had been\nhacked and demanding Bitcoins as ransom payment. The threat actor was able to log\ninto the Shariot’s mobile application administrator portal through the administrator\naccount belonging to the ex-employee, and used the export CSV function to download\na copy of the Shariot’s users personal data.\n\n3\n\nSubsequently, on 21 October 2022, a cybersecurity solutions provider alerted\n\nthe Organisation of a cybercrime forum post offering the sale of a Shariot database\ncontaining personal data. The Commission commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by the Organisation.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision.\nIt admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s internal investigations discovered that compromise of the\n\ndormant administrator account credentials enabled the unauthorised access to Shariot\nbackend admin web portal, leading to the exfiltration of 53,000 personal data sets of\nShariot users. The personal data that were affected in the Incident included names,\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\femail addresses, mobile phone numbers, NRIC numbers and general location data\n(e.g. Bishan, Toa Payoh or Orchard).\n\n6\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n(a)\n\nImmediately conducted an internal audit of its administrator accounts to\n\nensure that any employee access that was not required was revoked;\n(b)\n\nEnhanced its software code and admin panel user interface to mask\n\ndisplayed or exported NRIC numbers to show only the last 4 characters; and\n(c)\n\nConducted cyber hygiene and awareness training for all staff handling\n\npersonal data.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had failed to ensure it had reasonable security\n\narrangements in place to prevent the unauthorized access or disclosure of the\npersonal data in its possession or control, as it failed to implement and ensure\nreasonable access control to its backend admin web portal. First, the Organisation\nfailed to revoke the login credentials of an administrator account belonging to an exemployee once the employment relationship came to an end in May 2022. As a result,\nthe ex-employee’s administrator login credentials remained active, which – when\ncompromised – enabled the malicious actor access into its network.\n\n8\n\nSecond, the Organisation also admitted that the Incident would not have\n\nhappened if it had implemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) as an additional\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\faccess control for its administrator accounts that had access to its sizeable user\ndatabase. In Re Lovebonito [2022] SGPDPC 3, the Commission had highlighted the\nneed for organisations to strengthen access control, through the use of a one-time\npassword (“OTP”) or 2FA/MFA, to such accounts. Indeed, regardless of whether an\naccount is an administrative account, once an account is granted access rights to a\ndatabase containing sensitive personal data records or a significant volume of\npersonal data that would adversely impact the affected individuals in the event of a\npersonal data breach, we would encourage organisations to consider implementing\nenhanced access controls to the account such as through the use of a OTP or\n2FA/MFA to better safeguard the personal data.\n\n9\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n10\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate as the personal data breach was not insignificant.\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA. In this regard, while the NRIC numbers and general\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\flocation data was affected, this is less serious than if the NRIC images and specific\nGPS location had been disclosed.\n\n11\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter non-compliance\nwith the PDPA. On the facts of this particular case, the organisation’s turnover has\nbeen taken into consideration to arrive at a proportionate and effective financial\npenalty. I also considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $3,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\f13\n\nIn addition to the financial penalty imposed, the Organisation is also directed to\n\ndo the following:\n(a)\n\nImplement processes for systems and applications revocation within a\n\nreasonable window of cessation of need for access by an employee;\n(b)\n\nStrengthen access controls measures to administrator accounts with\n\naccess to databases holding personal data;\n(c)\n\nConduct reasonable security review of technical and administrative\n\narrangements for the protection of personal data in possession or under control\nof the Organisation within 60 days of the date of this Direction;\n(d)\n\nRectify any security gaps identified in the security review directed above;\n\nand\n(e)\n\nInform the Commission within 1 week of the completion on the steps\n\ndirected above.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

The DNC Registry comprises\nof 3 separate registers (i) the No Text Message Register, (ii) the No Voice Call\nRegister, and (iii) the No Fax Message Register.\n\n2\n\nBetween November 2022 and March 2023, the Commission received ten (10)\n\ncomplaints that one Wee Jing Kai Leon (“Individual”) had sent unsolicited\ntelemarketing messages to telephone numbers registered on the No Text Message\nRegister of the DNC Registry (the “Complaints”).\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether there had\n\nbeen any breaches of the “Do Not Call” provisions in Part 9 and 9A of the PDPA (“DNC\nProvisions”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n4\n\nThe Individual is a real estate salesperson registered with Propnex Realty Pte\n\nLtd since 2006. Over the years, the Individual collated a list of 2,918 Singapore\ntelephone numbers (the “Marketing List”).\n\n5\n\nOf the 2,918 telephone numbers in the Marketing List, 1,224 were registered\n\nwith the No Text Message Register of the DNC Registry on or around 31 March 2023.\n\n6\n\nThe Individual did not send any marketing messages to the telephone numbers\n\non his Marketing List before November 2022 and only admitted to sending a short\nmessaging service message each month from November 2022 to March 2023 (the\n“SMS Messages”) to the telephone numbers on the Marketing List to offer, advertise\nand/or promote his services as a real estate salesperson. According to the Individual,\nby November 2022, the challenging business environment had made it more difficult\nfor him to get leads. He therefore opted to rely on the numbers in the Marketing List to\nprospect for leads.\n\n7\n\nGiven that the Marketing List included 1,224 telephone numbers registered on\n\nthe DNC Registry, the Individual had sent approximately 6,120 SMS Messages to\n\n3\n\n\ftelephone numbers registered on the DNC Registry from November 2022 to March\n2023.\n\n8\n\nThe SMS Messages bore the sender ID “Propnex LW”, which is registered\n\nunder the SMS Sender ID Regime (“SSIR”)1 by DGK Global Pte Ltd (“DGK Global”),\na company owned by the Individual. During investigations, the Individual clarified that\nDGK Global was not involved in his real estate business, and that he used DGK Global\nto register the sender ID under SSIR because he needed a UEN number to do so.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Duty to check DNC Registry under section 43(1) of the PDPA\n9\n\nThe Commission’s investigation focused on whether the Individual had\n\nintentionally or negligently breached section 43(1) of the PDPA by:\n(a)\n\nsending “specified messages” addressed to Singapore telephone\nnumbers,\n\n(b)\n\nwithout having valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone numbers\nwere not listed in the DNC Registry at the time the specified messages\nwere sent.\n\n1\n\nThe SSIR was set up in March 2022 to enable organisations to protect their customers from receiving fraudulent\nSMS messages that spoofed the organisations’ SMS Sender IDs. Organisations intending to send SMS messages\nto Singapore mobile numbers can register any alphanumeric Sender IDs under the SSIR. The Full SSIR Regime\ncame into effect from 31 January 2023, upon which all non-registered Sender IDs will be marked as “LikelySCAM” for a transition period of 6 months. Thereafter, messages with non-registered Sender IDs will be blocked\nand not delivered to end-users.\n\n4\n\n\f“Specified message”\n10\n\nA message is a “specified message” if one of its purposes is for: 2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nAdvertising, promoting, or offering to supply or provide:\n(i)\n\ngoods or services;\n\n(ii)\n\nland or an interest in land;\n\n(iii)\n\nbusiness opportunity or an investment opportunity;\n\nAdvertising or promoting a supplier or provider (or a prospective supplier\nor provider) of the items listed in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) above.\n\n11\n\nWhether a “specified message” has one of the above purposes is determined\n\nwith regard to the following:3\n(a)\n\nthe content of the message;\n\n(b)\n\nthe presentational aspects of the message;\n\n(c)\n\nthe content that can be obtained using the numbers, URLs or contact\ninformation (if any) mentioned in the message; and\n\n(d)\n\nif the telephone number from which the message is made is disclosed to\nthe recipient (whether by calling line identity or otherwise), the content\n(if any) that can be obtained by calling that number.\n\n12\n\nThe SMS Messages were “specified messages” within the meaning of the DNC\n\nProvisions, as they were sent for the purpose of advertising and/or promoting the\nIndividual’s real estate services. The SMS Messages contained statements such as,\n2\n3\n\nTenth Schedule to the PDPA.\nSection 37(1) of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\n\f“Engage Professional & Committed Agent to Sell/Rent your Home.”, and “Whatsapp\nLeon Wee directly at https://chatwith.io/s/enquire to rent/sell your property”. They also\nincluded links to the Individual’s website and social media profiles.\n\n13\n\nThe Individual admitted that the SMS Messages were addressed to Singapore\n\ntelephone numbers, as also evidenced by the complaints received by the Commission.\n\nValid confirmation\n14\n\nA person can obtain valid confirmation that a Singapore telephone number is\n\nnot listed in the DNC Registry by doing the following:4\n(a)\n\nWithin 21 days before sending the specified message,5 the person can\napply for and receive confirmation from the Commission that the\nSingapore telephone number is not listed in the relevant register of the\nDNC Registry;6 or\n\n(b)\n\nThe person can obtain confirmation that the Singapore telephone\nnumber is not listed in the relevant register of the DNC Registry from a\n“checker”,7 but must not have reason to believe that, or be reckless as\nto whether the checker’s information was obtained more than 21 days\nago, or is false or inaccurate.\n\n4\n\nSection 43(2) of the PDPA.\nSection 15 of the Personal Data Protection (Do Not Call Registry) Regulations 2013 (the “DNC\nRegulations”).\n6\nUnder section 40(2) of the PDPA\n7\nA “checker” refers to a person that, for a reward, provides to another person (P) information on whether a\nSingapore telephone number is listed in the relevant register for the purpose of P’s compliance with Section 43(1)\nof the PDPA. A “checker” is a person other than the Commission, an employee of P, and an employee or agent\nof a checker.\n5\n\n6\n\n\f15\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Individual did not obtain valid confirmation that\n\nthe telephone numbers on his Marketing List were not listed in the DNC Registry.\n\nWhether the Individual received clear and unambiguous consent\n16\n\nEven if a specified message is sent to a Singapore telephone number without\n\nvalid confirmation that the number is not listed in the DNC Registry, a person does not\ncontravene section 43(1) of the PDPA if:\n(a)\n\nthe subscriber or user of the Singapore telephone number gave clear\nand unambiguous consent to the sending of the specified message; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe consent is evidenced in writing or other form so as to be accessible\nfor subsequent reference8. This means that the consent must be\ncaptured in a manner or form which can be retrieved and reproduced at\na later time in order to confirm that such consent was obtained. Possible\nforms include an audio or video recording of the consent given9.\n\n17\n\nIn the course of investigations, the Individual represented to the Commission\n\nthat he was under the impression that since he had obtained the telephone numbers\nprior to the enactment of the PDPA, he could use them for marketing purposes.\n\n18\n\nThe Commission recognises that a subscriber of a Singapore telephone\n\nnumber is deemed to have given his consent to a person to send a specified message\nto that Singapore telephone number if the subscriber consents to the sending of the\n8\n9\n\nSection 43(4) of the PDPA.\n[8.3] of the Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions (revised 1 February 2021)\n\n7\n\n\fspecified message before 2 January 2014 (i.e. before the DNC Provisions came into\neffect), and that consent has not been withdrawn.10 Even if the subscriber\nsubsequently adds his telephone number to the DNC Registry, this would not amount\nto withdrawal of consent.11\n\n19\n\nHowever, this does not relieve the Individual of his obligations under section\n\n43(4) to obtain the consent of the subscribers or users of the Singapore telephone\nnumber to which a specified message is sent to him. In other words, if the Individual\nintended to rely on section 43(4) of the PDPA, he should have obtained clear and\nunambiguous consent to the sending of the SMS Messages to the telephone numbers\nin his Marketing List from the subscribers of the Singapore telephone numbers\ncontained therein evidenced in written or other forms. The Commission sets out, at\n[8.5] of the Advisory Guidelines on the DNC Provisions (revised 1 February 2021),\nvarious methods through which such consent can be obtained from the subscribers or\nusers:\n“For example, persons may seek to obtain consent by asking individuals to:\na) respond to a pop-up on a webpage;\nb) respond to pop-ups or other form of notifications within mobile applications;\nc) fill out and submit a web form;\nd) fill out and submit a physical form;\ne) indicate their choice by signing or ticking against a check box printed on a\nletter or service agreement; or\n10\n11\n\nSection 47(4) of the PDPA.\nSection 47(5) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\ff) call or send an SMS to the person.”\n\n20\n\nThe Commission found no evidence of the Individual obtaining such clear and\n\nunambiguous consent from any of the subscribers of the Singapore telephone\nnumbers on the Marketing List, in written or other forms before or after 2 January 2014.\n\n21\n\nAccordingly, the Individual failed to obtain valid confirmation that the telephone\n\nnumbers in the Marketing List are not listed in the DNC Registry before sending the\nSMS Messages, and has negligently contravened section 43(1) of the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Individual is an employee acting in the course of employment\n22\n\nFor completeness, the Commission assessed whether the defence under\n\nsection 48 of the PDPA was available to the Individual, and concluded that it was not.\nSection 48(2) provides that section 43(1) does not apply to an employee who sends a\nspecified message to a Singapore telephone number if he can prove that he did so in\ngood faith in the course of his employment or in accordance with instructions given to\nhim by or on behalf of his employer in the course of his employment. The Commission\nconsidered the following:\n(a)\n\nIn accordance with industry practices, real estate salespersons such as\nthe Individual are not in an “employer-employee relationship” with their\nagencies.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Individual confirmed that he is not an employee of Propnex Realty\nPte Ltd (“Propnex”) despite being registered with them. He does not\n\n9\n\n\freceive salary from Propnex, nor does Propnex provide the Individual\nwith medical benefits, CPF contributions, or annual leave benefits. The\nIndividual is self-employed and does not report to Propnex on the\nconduct of his business.\n(c)\n\nThe contents of the SMS Messages related to the services of the\nIndividual specifically, and not Propnex.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n23\n\nIn determining whether any financial penalties or directions should be imposed\n\non the Individual, the Commission took the following into consideration:\n(a)\n\nThe Individual was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Individual had otherwise made efforts to ensure his compliance with\nother DNC Provisions, in particular the requirement under section 44 of\nthe PDPA to include clear and accurate information identifying the\nsender of the SMS Messages and how he can be readily contacted. He\nhad also provided recipients the option to unsubscribe from the SMS\nMessages, and would remove a recipient’s telephone number from the\nMarketing List if so requested; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Individual’s efforts to register the sender ID “Propnex LW” showed\na willingness to comply with regulatory regimes, in particular the SSIR.\n\n24\n\nHaving considered all the factors listed above, the Individual is hereby\n\nadministered a warning in respect of his breach of section 43(1) of the PDPA. No other\n\n10\n\n\fdirections are necessary in view of the Individual’s voluntary cessation of sending\nspecified messages to numbers on the Marketing List.\n\n25\n\nThe Commission observes that this case occurred alongside media reports of\n\nan increase in property scams. The Commission has also investigated complaints\ninvolving property agents who had concealed their identities while sending marketing\nmessages in contravention of the DNC Provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, while\nthere was no evidence that the Individual was involved in any scams or had attempted\nto conceal his identity in his marketing messages, the Commission will continue to\nmonitor this trend involving property agents and calibrate its decisions in future cases\naccordingly to ensure compliance with the DNC Provisions of the PDPA.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $74,400 was imposed on Ecommerce Enablers for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect users' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"16 Aug 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/decision---ecommerce-enablers.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Ecommerce Enablers","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/08/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ecommerce-enablers","timestamp":"2023-08-16","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 6\n\nCase No. DP-2009-B7056\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nE-Commerce Enablers Pte.

Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2009-B7056\n16 May 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 25 September 2020, E-Commerce Enablers Pte. Ltd. (“Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) and its customers of an\nincident involving unauthorised access to its customer data servers (the “Incident”).\nPDPC subsequently received 2 complaints from the Organisation’s customers in\nrelation to the Incident. On 12 November 2020, the Organisation's customer database\nwas offered for sale on an online forum indicating that personal data was exfiltrated\nduring the Incident.\n\n2\n\nPDPC commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s compliance\n\nwith the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the Incident.\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation runs an online platform offering cashback for purchases\n\nmade through affiliated merchant programs. The platform also provides coupons,\nvoucher codes, and comparison features with discounts for users.\n\n4\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation hosted its customer database on\n\nvirtual servers in an Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) cloud environment (“Customer\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fStorage Servers”). The Organisation employed a 12-man Site Reliability Engineering\n(“SRE”) team whose responsibilities included maintaining the Organisation’s\ninfrastructure, providing, and managing the Organisation’s cloud environment on\nAWS, and ensuring security of the AWS keys. The SRE team made use of an AWS\naccess key with full administrative privileges (the “AWS Key”) for the purposes of its\nwork, including infrastructure deployment. Only SRE team members had access to,\nand were authorised to use, the AWS Key. On 4 June 2019, the AWS Key was\ninadvertently committed to software code in a private repository in GitHub, by a senior\nmember of the SRE team. This was discovered by another SRE team member on 6\nJune 2019, and the AWS Key was removed from GitHub on the same day. However,\nit remained viewable in GitHub’s ‘commit history’, which records all changes and\nprevious versions of code uploaded on GitHub.\n\n5\n\nOn 21 June 2019, the AWS Key was to be deleted and replaced by a new key\n\nas part of an out-of-cycle key rotation. The member of the SRE team in charge of the\nkey rotation informed the SRE team (via email) that he had created a new key to\nreplace the AWS Key, and that he would be deleting the AWS Key. However, after\ncreating the replacement key, he failed to fully disable and remove the AWS Key.\n\n6\n\nAs a result, the AWS Key continued to be usable to access the Organisation’s\n\nAWS environment (and consequently the Customer Storage Servers) until shortly after\nthe time of the Incident, about 15 months later.\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fThe Incident\n7\n\nOn 9 September 2020, a malicious threat actor accessed the Organisation’s\n\nAWS environment utilizing the AWS Key. The AWS Key was likely found by the threat\nactor in the commit history of the GitHub private repository.\n\n8\n\nHaving gained privileged access to the AWS environment, the threat actor (i)\n\nconducted reconnaissance to identify the Organisation’s data repositories, (ii) modified\nsecurity settings including to allow remote internet access to the Organisation’s\ndatabase instances (i.e. its virtual servers hosting data), and (iii) generated a fresh\ndatabase instance to stage its data exfiltration.\n\n9\n\nThe threat actor then proceeded to exfiltrate data from the Customer Storage\n\nServers. The data items, and the corresponding number of individuals affected, are\nset out below:\n\nTypes of personal data\nEmail Address\n\nNumber of affected users\n1,457,637\n\nName\n\n840,210\n\nMobile number\n\n447,076\n\nAddress\n\n138,327\n\nGender\n\n23,278\n\nNRIC numbers\n\n9,961\n\nDate of birth\n\n202,634\n\nBank Account number\n\n299,381\n\nPartial credit card information, including:\n\n378,531\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f(i) partial credit card number (first 6 digits\nand last 4 digits)\n(ii) issuing bank\n(iii) country\n(iv) expiry month and year\n(v) Visa or Mastercard\n\n10\n\nOn 17 September 2020, the Organisation discovered during a routine security\n\nreview that there had been unauthorised access to its AWS environment. Further\ninvestigations revealed that there had been unauthorised third-party access to the\nOrganisation’s AWS environment.\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation subsequently engaged a private forensic expert, (“PFE”) to\n\ninvestigate further. The PFE confirmed that the unauthorised access had been carried\nout using the AWS Key. The Organisation conjectured that it was likely that the threat\nactor had obtained the AWS Key from GitHub’s commit history, where the AWS Key\nwas still visible despite the removal of the wrongly committed code from the private\nrepository in GitHub.\n\nRemedial actions\n12\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following remedial\n\nmeasures:\nImmediate remedial steps to contain the Incident\n(a)\n\nPerformed a full deletion of the AWS Key and rotated the other AWS keys;\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nReversed all changes made by the threat actor and triggered a forced\nlogout and password reset of all customers’ accounts;\n\nTo prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n(c)\n\nIncreased monitoring of logs to ensure heightened detection of any\nunauthorised access;\n\n(d)\n\nSeparated development and production accounts, resulting in a smaller\nsubset of engineers having access to the production environment;\n\n(e)\n\nSecured access to systems and data with several measures, including VPN\nand IP address whitelisting and database encryption; and\n\n(f)\n\nCreated a platform for employee security suggestions / breach reporting.\n\nSubsequent sale of personal data on Raidforums\n13\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Organisation’s database was offered for sale on\n\nRaidforums, an online cybersecurity forum commonly used for trading and selling of\nstolen databases. Raidforums’ domain name and content was independently seized\nby authorities from the United States in April 2022.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n14\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control, by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fdisclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). The Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\nObligation in two respects.\n\nLack of sufficiently robust processes for AWS key management\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation failed to ensure that processes to manage the AWS keys\n\nthat granted access to the Customer Storage Servers were sufficiently robust.\n\n16\n\nWhile the Organisation admitted that it could have done more to ensure that its\n\nemployees were performing their AWS key rotation duties properly, the Organisation\nclaimed that the compromise of the AWS Key arose from human error, and not\nbecause of any systemic issue with the Organisation’s security practices. According\nto the Organisation, there was no reason to doubt the capabilities of the SRE team\nmember in question, because (i) he was a senior member of the SRE team, (ii) his\nresponsibilities included key security and rotation, and (iii) he had dutifully rotated /\ndeleted all other keys assigned to him in the out-of-cycle key rotation. The SRE team\nmember’s inadvertent commit, and an incomplete rotation/deletion were in direct\ncontravention of the Organisation’s security practices. The Organisation accordingly\nsought to frame the Incident as a one-off case of human error.\n\n17\n\nThis position is not accepted. As explained in Re DataPost Pte Ltd,\n\nOrganisations cannot place sole reliance on their employees to perform their duties\nproperly as a security arrangement to protect personal data. There must be some\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\fprocesses to ensure that the step required from the employee is taken, such as\nindependent verification by another checker1.\n\n18\n\nFor example, a precaution the Organisation could have taken to ensure that the\n\nout-of-cycle key rotation was complete would have been to have a supervisor or\nanother SRE team member test either all or a reasonable sample of the old keys\n(depending on the number of keys being rotated) to verify that they had been disabled.\nThere was no such verification or testing practice put in place by the Organisation; the\nOrganisation relied wholly on the SRE team member’s seniority and experience.\n\n19\n\nWhen a high-risk task (e.g. rotation of an AWS key that gives access to the\n\nwhole of the AWS environment) is concerned, it is all the more important that there\nmust be additional verifications and checks.\n\nFailure to conduct periodic security review\n20\n\nSecond, specific security review by the Organisation on AWS keys could have\n\ncovered and detected whether the AWS Key remained active or had been used after\nthe out-of-cycle key rotation, and during the 15 months preceding the Incident. The\nOrganisation failed to conduct regular security review on whether the AWS keys had\nbeen properly rotated/deleted. In the course of investigations, the Organisation\nacknowledged that it could have done more to ensure that the SRE team was\nperforming their AWS key rotation duties properly. Following the Incident, the\n1 Re DataPost Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 10, at [13] – [16]\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\fOrganisation implemented a more secure process for temporary, time-limited keys to\nbe issued to SRE team members whenever access to the AWS environment was\nrequired. The Organisation also developed a specific IT security policy concerning the\nsecure sharing of keys internally.\n\nObservation on the incident management processes\n21\n\nFollowing discovery of the inadvertent committal of the AWS Key to GitHub, the\n\nOrganisation took 15 days to conduct a key rotation. Regardless of whether this had\nbeen an out-of-cycle rotation, the Organisation should review its incident management\nprocesses to determine whether it was reasonable to have taken 15 days to remediate\ncompromise of a full administrative privilege AWS access key.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n22\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, including the following aggravating and mitigating\nfactors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation lacked sufficiently robust processes to monitor its incident\nmanagement response to ensure reasonable remediation speed, which led\nto 15 days passing before the Organisation responded to the exposure of\nthe AWS Key;\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe AWS Key was exposed for a long period of 15 months;\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the\naffected individuals;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily acknowledged that its failure to ensure proper\nrotation and deletion of the AWS Key constituted a breach of the Protection\nObligation.\n\n23\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 15 February 2023 and was invited to make representations\non the same. The Organisation made representations on 22 March 2023, albeit not on\nits liability for breaches of the Protection Obligation or on the proposed financial\npenalty. Where accepted by the Commission, these representations have been\nincorporated into this decision.\n\n24\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $74,400\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f25\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 and $10,000 was imposed on Fullerton Healthcare and Agape CP Holdings respectively for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data belonging to Fullerton Healthcare’s corporate clients and direct patients.

(“Agape”) respectively notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) that the personal data of\nFHG’s customers had been accessed, exfiltrated, and offered for sale on the dark web\n(the “Incident”). The Commission commenced investigations to determine whether\nthe Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by FHG and Agape.\n\n2\n\nOn 11 January 2022 and 12 January 2022 respectively, FHG and Agape\n\nrequested for the investigations to be handled under the Commission’s Expedited\nDecision Procedure. In this regard, FHG and Agape voluntarily provided and admitted\nto the facts set out below and admitted that they had failed to implement reasonable\n\n2\n\n\fsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data accessed and exfiltrated in the\nIncident in breach of section 24 of the PDPA (the “Protection Obligation”).\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nFHG is an enterprise healthcare service provider which provides healthcare\n\nservices to individuals and employees of its corporate clients. In 2018, FHG engaged\nAgape, a business process outsourcing provider and social enterprise, to provide call\ncentre and appointment booking services for its customers (the “Services”). As part\nof its social enterprise initiatives, Agape engaged inmates from Changi Women’s\nPrison (the “Agents”) to assist in provision of the Services for FHG’s customers.\n\n4\n\nIn order to carry out the Services, FHG provided Agape with access to the\n\npersonal data of its customers via Microsoft SharePoint, a cloud-based document\nmanagement system. A single Agape personal computer (the “Computer”) was\nauthorised to access FHG’s SharePoint platform via an FHG-assigned SharePoint\naccount.\n\n5\n\nIn order to facilitate Agents’ access to FHG’s customer data from within Changi\n\nWomen’s Prison, Agape downloaded FHG’s customer data onto the Computer, and\nre-uploaded the customer data onto an internet-facing file server (“the Online Drive”).\nThe Online Drive was then white-listed for access by the Agents from within Changi\nWomen’s Prison.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Incident\n6\n\nOn 15 October 2021, FHG became aware that its customer data was being\n\noffered for sale on a dark web forum. FHG engaged cybersecurity consultants to\ninvestigate. On 18 October 2021, FHG’s cybersecurity consultants made contact with\nthe purported seller who claimed that he had exfiltrated FHG’s customer data from\nAgape’s Online Drive. By 22 October 2021, the post on the dark web forum advertising\nthe sale had been removed.\n\n7\n\nFHG’s cybersecurity consultants confirmed that the Incident solely involved and\n\naffected Agape’s Online Drive. FHG’s own systems and servers were not affected in\nthe Incident.\n\n8\n\nThe personal data of 156,900 FHG customers (133,866 direct patients and\n\n23,034 employees of FHG’s corporate clients) was accessed without authorisation in\nthe Incident, although the exact volume of exfiltrated personal data was unknown. The\naffected personal data comprised the following datasets:\nDirect patients\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nNRIC number / FIN;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(d)\n\nGender;\n\n(e)\n\nEmail address;\n4\n\n\f(f)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(g)\n\nFinancial information (Bank account numbers and bank codes);\n\n(h)\n\nHealth information (International Classification of Diseases codes that pertain\n\nto an individual’s diagnosis information, and codes for surgical procedures done in\nhospitals);\nEmployees of FHG’s corporate clients\n(i)\n\nName;\n\n(j)\n\nNRIC number / FIN / Passport number;\n\n(k)\n\nDate of birth;\n\n(l)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(m)\n\nFinancial information; and\n\n(n)\n\nHealth, and other information (Information relating to the utilisation of health\n\nbenefits by individual members, which include details of clinic names and claim\namount\n(collectively, the “Customer Data”).\n\nRemedial actions\n9\n\nAs part of remedial measures following the Incident, FHG informed affected\n\nclients and individuals promptly via SMS, email, and an FAQ page on its website,\nadvising on appropriate steps which could be taken to guard against potential risks.\nFHG also engaged Credit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd to provide free credit monitoring\nservices to affected individuals for 6 months.\n\n5\n\n\f10\n\nAgape suspended use of the Online Drive with effect from 19 October 2021,\n\nand, with the assistance of a forensic team, conducted internal checks on the\nComputer and Online Drive for other indicators of compromise.\n\n11\n\nFHG in coordination with Agape also:\n\n(a)\n\nrestricted Agape’s access to its SharePoint to “view-only”;\n\n(b)\n\ndeleted SharePoint files and folders that Agape did not need as part of data\n\nminimisation efforts;\n(c)\n\nceased synchronisation of data between SharePoint and the Computer;\n\n(d)\n\nchanged all passwords for Agape’s access to FHG’s SharePoint; and\n\n(e)\n\ndeleted the Customer Data from the Online Drive upon completion of Agape’s\n\ninvestigations into the Incident.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether Agape had contravened the Protection Obligation\n12\n\nAs a data intermediary of FHG, Agape is subject to the Protection Obligation\n\npursuant to section 4(2) of the PDPA. For the reasons set out below, Agape was\ndetermined to have breached the Protection Obligation in relation to the Customer\nData affected in the Incident.\n\n6\n\n\fFailure to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews\n13\n\nIn previous enforcement decisions, the Commission has emphasised the need\n\nfor organisations to conduct periodic security reviews of their IT systems. Such reviews\nenable organisations to detect vulnerabilities, assess security implications and risks,\nand ensure that reasonable security arrangements are implemented to eliminate or\nmitigate such risks. Periodic security reviews should be scoped based on the\norganisation’s assessment of its data protection needs, for example, taking into\naccount the type of personal data to be protected.1\n\n14\n\nIn Quoine Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 2 (“Quoine”), while the organisation had\n\nconducted periodic security reviews, these security reviews were improperly scoped\nand failed to include a particular account. The organisation explained that its current\nstaff were not aware of the reasons for the affected account’s set-up and security\narrangements, as the account had been created “at some time in the past (so legacy)”.\nThis explanation did not excuse the organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation.\nThe Commission found that it was incumbent on the organisation to have implemented\nthe necessary systems and processes to ensure that critical information about its\nsystems, including legacy systems, survived the turnover of its staff (Quoine at [23]).\n\n15\n\nSimilarly, while Agape had carried out periodic security reviews, these reviews\n\nfailed to cover the Internet-facing Online Drive. Agape admitted that this omission was\n\n1\n\nEverlast Projects Pte Ltd and others [2020] SGPDPC 20 (at [21]).\n\n7\n\n\fbecause the use of the Online Drive had been a legacy feature unique to Agape’s\nengagement by FHG, which was not implemented for any of Agape’s other clients. As\na result of this omission, Agape failed to review and assess the Online Drive’s security\nimplications and risks.\n\n16\n\nWhen the Online Drive was installed in December 2017, it was protected by a\n\npassword which met Agape’s password complexity policy (i.e. 8 to 10 characters with\na mix of upper and lower-case characters, numbers and symbols). However, at the\ntime of the Incident, the password for Agape’s Online Drive had been inadvertently\ndisabled for an estimated 20 months (since December 2019), the cause of which could\nnot be established. Agape admitted that this caused the Online Drive to become an\nopen directory listing on the Internet with no password protection, and highly\nvulnerable to unauthorised access, modification and similar risks over an excessive\nperiod of time.\n\n17\n\nIf Agape’s periodic reviews had been properly scoped to cover all of the IT\n\ncomponents under its Services rendered to FHG (including the Online Drive), this\nlapse could have been detected and rectified timeously.\n\nInadequate password policy and management\n18\n\nIn the course of investigations, Agape also admitted that prior to the password\n\nbeing disabled in December 2019, it had been shared by Agents to access the Online\n\n8\n\n\fDrive. In Terra Systems Pte. Ltd. [2021] SGPDPC 72, the Commission highlighted the\ndata protection risks associated with multiple users sharing a common password,\nincluding greater risks of unauthorised access by ex-staff and inadvertent disclosure\nto threat actors through social engineering, among others.\n\n19\n\nThe use of a common password among all Agents was exacerbated by the fact\n\nthat there was no expiry date set for the password. The failure to implement and\nenforce reasonable password management policies increased the vulnerability of the\nCustomer Data on the Online Drive to unauthorised access and other similar risks,\neven before the password had been disabled.\n\n20\n\nFor the above reasons, Agape was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation.\n\nWhether FHG had contravened Section 24 of the PDPA\nFailure to exercise reasonable oversight of vendor\n21\n\nUnder Section 4(3) of the PDPA, an organisation that engages a data\n\nintermediary to process personal data on its behalf, bears the same obligations under\nthe PDPA as if the personal data was processed by the organisation itself. This is so,\neven where the organisation engages the data intermediary to implement the\n\n2\n\nThis decision was subsequently subjected to reconsideration by the Commission. In Terra Systems\nPte Ltd [2022] SGPCPCR 1, the Commissioner affirmed the finding of the organisation’s breach of\nSection 24 of the PDPA and the financial penalty imposed.\n\n9\n\n\fnecessary data protection measures in relation to the personal data (Social Metric Pte\nLtd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at [15]).\n\n22\n\nThe Commission has reiterated in past decisions, such as SCAL Academy Pte.\n\nLtd. [2020] SGPDPC 2, that the Protection Obligation requires organisations to\nexercise reasonable oversight of their vendors.\n\n23\n\nSpecifically in the context of an organisation’s relationship with its data\n\nintermediary, the organisation (i.e. the data controller) has a supervisory or general\nrole for the protection of the personal data, while the data intermediary has a more\ndirect and specific role in the protection of personal data arising from its direct\npossession or control over the personal data. This means that a data controller may\nbe found in breach of the Protection Obligation, even though its data intermediary may\nnot be found in breach, and vice versa (Social Metric Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 17 at\n[16]).\n\n24\n\nIn this case, FHG engaged Agape as its data intermediary to carry out the\n\nServices using the personal data provided by FHG. Under the Protection Obligation,\nFHG was required to exercise reasonable oversight of Agape’s data processing\nactivities.\n\n25\n\nIn SCAL Academy Pte. Ltd. [2020] SGPDPC 2 (at [8]), even though the\n\norganisation in question had instructed its vendor to prevent certain documents from\n10\n\n\fbeing ‘leaked’ online, it did not check what security arrangements the vendor had\nimplemented to ensure this. This hindered the organisation and vendor from being\nable to identify any data protection risks and agree on the measures to be implemented\nto protect against unauthorised disclosure of the personal data in the documents.\n\n26\n\nIn this case, due consideration is given to the fact that FHG had conducted a\n\nhigh-level IT due diligence review of Agape prior to its decision to onboard Agape as\na vendor, and that FHG’s written agreement with Agape required the latter to comply\nwith the PDPA including, among others, obligations to take all appropriate and\nreasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards, and security\narrangements. Nevertheless, FHG’s failed to exercise reasonable oversight through\nregular monitoring of Agape’s personal data handling processes throughout the\nengagement, including how Agape stored and granted Agents’ access to the\nCustomer Data.\n\n27\n\nIn this regard, there was a point of contention between the parties over whether\n\nFHG was aware of and permitted the uploading of the Customer Data from Agape’s\nComputer to the Internet-facing Online Drive.\n\n28\n\nAccording to FHG, its understanding with Agape was that the local copy of the\n\nCustomer Data on the Computer was only to be used for emergency or exceptional\nsituations such as when Agape was unable to connect to FHG’s SharePoint during\nany system downtime or disruptive event. No other copies of the Customer Data were\n11\n\n\fto be made by Agape, whether from the SharePoint or the local copy on the Computer.\nFHG stated that it did not provide Agape with permission to upload the Customer Data\nfrom Agape’s Computer to the Online Drive.\n\n29\n\nIn contrast, Agape asserted that FHG was aware that the Agents were inmates\n\noperating from inside Changi Women’s Prison, and that there were IT restrictions\npreventing them from accessing the Customer Data directly from FHG’s Sharepoint.\nAs such, Agape had downloaded and uploaded the Customer Data onto its Online\nDrive for the Agents to access and use. Agape asserted that FHG was aware of\nAgape’s process of sharing Customer Data with the Agents as FHG’s representatives\nhad been present during “dry runs”.\n\n30\n\nWhile there was insufficient contemporaneous evidence to support either\n\nparty’s version of events, the fact remains that FHG was aware that Agape was\nengaging inmates from inside Changi Women’s Prison to carry out the Services, and\nthe Commission’s findings regarding FHG’s breach of the Protection Obligation are\nnot dependent on whether FHG permitted Agape to upload the Customer Data to the\nOnline Drive or not.\n\n31\n\nGiven that FHG was aware that access to the Customer Data would have to be\n\ngranted to a third party that was offsite for the provision of the Services, FHG should\nhave made reasonable enquiries to ascertain how the Customer Data was to be stored\nand transmitted, and how access to the Customer Data would be controlled. Had FHG\n12\n\n\fmade these enquiries and discovered the true state of affairs, they would have no\ndoubt required Agape to implement stricter controls to regulate Agents’ access and\nuse of the Customer Data. By failing to make such enquiries, FHG failed to appreciate\nthe reality of how Agape was storing, transmitting, and retaining the Customer Data,\nand failed to exercise reasonable oversight over Agape’s data processing activities.\n\nUnnecessary disclosure of sensitive personal data\n32\n\nSeparately, FHG inadvertently disclosed personal data only intended for its\n\nemployees’ internal use, onto the SharePoint system shared with Agape. This included\nsensitive financial information such as bank account numbers and bank codes, and\nhealth information such as ICD codes and codes for surgical procedures done in\nhospitals. These datasets were not required by Agape for the performance of the\nServices, and this inadvertent disclosure ultimately led to a greater loss of personal\ndata during the Incident.\n\n33\n\nWhen an organisation discloses more personal data than is needed for its\n\npurposes, this creates unnecessary data security risks, particularly where such data\nis more sensitive in nature3.\n\n3\n\nHabitat for Humanity Singapore Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 9 (at [19]-[20])\n\n13\n\n\f34\n\nIn the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems4 (at\n\npage 11), data minimisation has been encouraged as a good way for organisations to\nexamine what personal data is really needed. It should be a basic data protection\npractice for organisations to collect, use, or disclose only the least sensitive types of\npersonal data if different types of personal data can be used to achieve the same\npurpose.\n\n35\n\nFHG should have implemented robust measures to ensure that only personal\n\ndata necessary for performance of the Services was shared with Agape, and in\nparticular, that sensitive personal data was not inadvertently disclosed.\n\n36\n\nIn view of the above, FHG was determined to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation in respect of the Customer Data.\n\nVoluntary measures implemented by FHG and Agape\n37\n\nFollowing the Incident, FHG and Agape have voluntarily taken or will be taking\n\nthe following steps to prevent a recurrence of the Incident or similar events:\n\nFHG\n(a)\n\nAgents will now access FHG’s customer data directly from FHG’s SharePoint\n\nvia individual user accounts with multi-factor authentication;\n\n4\n\nPublished on 14 September 2021. The Guide compiles data protection practices from past Advisory\nGuidelines, Guides and data breach cases that should be adopted by organisations in their ICT policies,\nsystems and processes.\n\n14\n\n\f(b)\n\nFHG’s SharePoint has been reconfigured to grant “view-only” access to only\n\nthe specific files required by vendors for the services to be provided, with clear\nsegregation between the vendor’s SharePoint files and FHG’s internal SharePoint\nfiles;\n(c)\n\nFHG will formally communicate its internal personal data protection policies and\n\nprocesses to vendors in order for them to be applied to the vendors’ processing of\npersonal data on FHG’s behalf;\n(d)\n\nFHG will enhance its contracts with vendors to include additional data\n\nprotection obligations, such as the requirement for vendors to undergo regular\nvulnerability assessments and penetration testing, rights for FHG to audit the vendor’s\ndata processing practices, and requirements for vendors to have in place reasonable\ndata breach response management processes;\n\nAgape\n(e)\n\nWith the assistance of external cybersecurity consultants, Agape has refreshed\n\nits data protection and IT policies; and\n(f)\n\nAgape has increased data protection awareness by requiring employees to go\n\nthrough the assessment tools provided on the Commission’s website, enrolling\nemployees in Workforce Skills Qualifications PDPA courses for certification, and\nregularly conducting internal communications to maintain cybersecurity vigilance.\n\n15\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n38\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on FHG and Agape\n\nunder Section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether they should be required to pay a\nfinancial penalty under Section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at Section 48J(6)\nof the PDPA and the following mitigating factors were taken into account:\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nFHG and Agape were cooperative during the investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nFHG and Agape voluntarily admitted to their breaches of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nFHG and Agape took prompt remedial actions following discovery of the\n\nIncident.\n\n39\n\nWhile Agape’s breaches of the Protection Obligation were more causally\n\nproximate to the unauthorised access and disclosure of personal data in the Incident,\nFHG’s inadvertent disclosure of financial and health related data resulted in the impact\nof the Incident being amplified. As the data controller, FHG also bore the ultimate\nresponsibility to exercise due diligence and reasonable supervision over Agape. For\nthe purposes of assessing what amount of financial penalty would be proportionate\nand effective as a deterrent, it was also taken into consideration that FHG’s annual\nturnover based on its latest available audited accounts, was almost 50 times higher\nthan that of Agape’s.\n16\n\n\f40\n\nHaving carefully considered all the relevant circumstances, the Commissioner\n\nhereby requires that:\n(a)\n\nFHG pay a financial penalty of $58,000; and\n\n(b)\n\nAgape pay a financial penalty of S$10,000;\n\nwithin 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n41\n\nIn quantifying the financial penalties imposed, no weight was placed on Agape’s\n\nstatus as a social enterprise. The standard of security arrangements expected under\nthe Protection Obligation will depend on the volume and nature of personal data in the\norganisation’s possession or control, regardless of whether the organisation is a forprofit business, a charity, or a social enterprise5.\n\n42\n\nIn addition to the financial penalties imposed, FHG and Agape are also directed\n\nto do the following:\n\n5\n\nSee Singapore Red Cross Society [2020] SGPDPC 16 at [10]\n\n17\n\n\fFHG\n(a)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nReview processes and contractual obligations with Agape and existing\nvendors processing personal data on behalf of FHG, to ensure that such\nvendors have sufficiently robust data handling processes to protect\npersonal data in their possession and/or control;\n\nii.\n\nReview existing internal processes to ensure that only personal data\nnecessary for fulfilling contractual obligations is disclosed to vendors via\nsecured channels and with reasonable access controls considering the\ntype and volume of personal data being disclosed; and\n\n(b)\n\nNotify the Commission within 14 days of the completion of the reviews above,\n\nwith an outline of their scope.\n\nAgape\n(c)\n\nWithin 60 days from the date of this decision:\ni.\n\nEnsure that the scope of its periodic security reviews and any security\naudits include the protection of personal data handled in all of Agape’s\nsystems and processes;\n\nii.\n\nResolve and record in writing with FHG the data protection requirements\nand job specifications for the processing of personal data on behalf of\nFHG, including arrangements for the exercise of regular oversight by\nFHG to verify that the requirements and specifications are being met;\nand\n18\n\n\f(d)\n\nNotify the Commission within 14 days of the completion of the reviews above,\n\nwith an outline of their scope.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n19\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Kingsforce Management Services to ensure the implementation of regular patching, updates and upgrades for all software and firmware supporting its website(s) and application through which personal data in its possession may be accessed.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Employment","Protection","Patching"],"date":"11 May 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_kingsforcemanagementservicespteltd_100323.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Kingsforce Management Services","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-kingsforce-management-services","timestamp":"2023-05-11","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2023] SGPDPCS1\n\nCase No. DP-2202-B9480\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nKingsforce Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 31 January 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified by Kingsforce Management Services Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”) of the sale on RaidForums, on or about 27 December 2021, of\ndata from its jobseeker database (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The affected database held approximately 54,900 jobseeker datasets, comprising\nname, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, job qualifications,\nlast and expected salary, highest qualification and other data related to job\nsearches.\n\n3. External cyber security investigators identified outdated website coding\ntechnology, with critical vulnerabilities, as the cause of the Incident.\n\n\f4. The Commission accepted the Organisation’s request for handling under the\nCommission’s expedited breach decision procedure. The Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision, and to\nbreach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“the PDPA”).\n\n5. The Organisation admitted work had not been completed on the website at launch\nowing to contractual disputes with the developer. The Organisation subsequently\nengaged IT maintenance vendors in an effort to ensure the security of the website.\nHowever, maintenance had been ad-hoc and limited to troubleshooting\nfunctionality issues from bugs, glitches and/or when a page failed to load.\n\n6. In breach of the Protection Obligation, the Organisation failed to provide sufficient\nclarity and specifications to its vendors on how to protect its database and personal\ndata. In Re Civil Service Club, the Commission had pointed out that organisations\nthat engage IT vendors can provide clarity and emphasize the need for personal\ndata protection to their IT vendors by a) making it part of their contractual terms,\nand b) reviewing the requirements specifications to ensure that personal data\nprotection is reflected in the design of the end-product.1 Further, post-execution of\nthe contract, an organization is also expected to exercise reasonable oversight\nover its vendor during the course of the engagement to ensure that the vendor is\nprotecting the personal data by adhering to the stipulated requirements.2\n\n1 Re Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15.\n2 Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 317 at [16] and [17].\n\n\f7. Another breach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation was failure to\nconduct reasonable periodic security reviews, including vulnerability scans, since\nthe launch of its website. The requirement for and scope of reasonable periodic\nsecurity reviews had long been established in the published decisions of the\nCommission.3 The PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems\nalso emphasized the need to periodically conduct web application vulnerability\nscanning and assessments, post deployment, as a basic practice to ensure\ncompliance with the Protection Obligation under the PDPA.4\n\n8. The Organisation is therefore found to have breached the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n9. In deciding the enforcement action in this case, the Commission considered the\nOrganisation’s efforts towards website security, cooperation throughout the\ninvestigation, voluntary admission of breach of the Protection Obligation and the\nprompt remediation taken. The last included immediate suspension of its website,\nand the engagement of a new developer to develop a new and enhance web\napplication. The Commission also notes that the affected personal data was no\nlonger or accessible following the shutdown of RaidForums. In the circumstances,\nthe Commission directs the Organisation to do the following:\n\na. To submit to the Commission, within twenty-one (21) days from the date of\nissue of this Direction, a plan to ensure regular patching, updates and upgrades\n\n3 See, eg, Re WTS Automotive Services Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 317; Re Bud Cosmetics Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] PDP Digest 351; and Re Watami Food Service Singapore Pte Ltd [2019] PDP Digest 221.\n4 Pages 21 and 22 of the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems.\n\n\ffor all software and firmware supporting its website(s) and applications through\nwhich personal data in its possession may be accessed.\n\nb.

To outline each implementation step with deadlines to ensure that the entire\nimplementation is completed within sixty (60) days from the date of issue of this\nDirection.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

This means that the Organisation\nvoluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision;\nand admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act\n(the “PDPA”).\n\n1\n\n\f3.\n\nAn issue that arose in this case is whether fictitious names or pseudonymous\n\npersonal particulars form part of the personal data under the possession or control of\nthe Organisation. The importance of this lies in how it may potentially reduce the size\nof the dataset that was at risk. In their addendum to the Written Statement, the\nOrganisation stated that it does not verify the names provided by the users, and\nsuggested that the impact of the Incident might be more limited as some of the users’\nnames may be incomplete, fictitious or pseudonymous.\n\n4.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines “personal data” to be data, whether true or\n\nnot (emphasis added), about an individual who can be identified from that data; or\nfrom that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have\naccess. The PDPA caters for the situation where not every record of personal data\nthat is under the possession or control of an Organisation is verified. It takes a practical\napproach, as the accuracy of personal data records will change with the passage of\ntime (e.g. information becomes outdated) or individuals may intentionally provide\ninaccurate information (e.g. users hiding their age or using fictitious residential\naddresses to bypass restriction of services by age or geolocation). What matters is\nthat the Organisation, having collected the information, takes steps to comply with their\nobligations under the PDPA, such as to protect them and to ensure that they are used\nin accordance with the purpose of their collection.\n\n5.\n\nThe situation is different when the organisation, as a data security or data\n\nmanagement measure, applies pseudonymisation or anonymisation techniques on\npersonal data that is in their possession or under their control. In such circumstances,\nif the risk of reidentification is adequately addressed and managed, the resulting\ndataset may be treated as anonymised. The key difference is the intention of the\n2\n\n\forganisation and its ability to direct and control the data processing activities required\nto achieve the resultant anonymised dataset.1\n\n6.\n\nIn this case, the Organisation was collecting data from its customers. Their\n\ncustomer database contained names, email addresses and additional details such as\ntheir shipping address, billing address, and date of birth. It also contained credit card\ndetails of 98 customers. Even if some customers had provided incomplete, fictitious or\npseudonymous personal particulars or payment details, the Organisation had\ncollected personal data. For the purpose of this investigations, it matters not that some\nof these customers may have provided inaccurate information. The Organisation’s\nobligations under the PDPA applies to the entire customer database.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the Incident occurred because the threat actor\n\nhad successfully exploited vulnerabilities present in the Magento open-source version\n1.9.x.x which the Organisation had employed for its online store. These vulnerabilities\nwere present because the Organisation failed to apply four Magento security patches\nreleased on 28 Nov 2017, 25 June 2019, 8 October 2019 and 28 April 2020 by Adobe.\n\n8.\n\nCompounding the above, support for Magento version 1 had ended on 30 June\n\n2020. The Organisation admitted that it should have upgraded to Magento opensource version 2.0 after Adobe ended the support for Magento 1 on 30 June 2020.\nThe Organisation had planned to upgrade to Magento version 2 in early 2020, but its\nplans were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Having said that, Adobe had\nannounced in November 2015 that it will end support for Magento 1.x in 36 months,\n\n1 See Personal Data Protection Commission, Advisory Guidelines on the Personal Data Protection Act\n\nfor Selected Topics, at paras 3.5, 3.8 and 3.13.\n3\n\n\fi.e. by November 2018. In September 2018, Adobe then announced that it would\nextend the support to 30 June 2020. Given the ample notice given by Adobe to the\nOrganisation of the need to upgrade the version of Magento Open Source which it was\nusing in order to continue receiving support and security patches from Adobe, it is\ndifficult to look past the Organisation’s prolonged failure to do the needful and perform\nthe necessary upgrades.\n\n9.\n\nThe Commission had consistently advised organisations on the importance of\n\napplying software patches. In our Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems,\nthe Commission had highlighted that organisations should perform system patching\npromptly to fix security vulnerabilities. If software patches are not updated as\nrecommended by the software provider, they may not contain the latest cybersecurity\nupdates and may compromise the organisation’s defence against cyber-attacks.\n\n10.\n\nWe note that the Organisation had considered and evaluated the four patches\n\nbut decided to hold back on installing them. However, these four patches were\nreleased by Adobe to address several high severity risk issues and critical bugs,\nincluding the injection of malicious codes. The Organisation’s failure to patch had\nincreased the risks of a malicious code injection capable of capturing users’ personal\ndata.\n\n11.\n\nIn light of the above, the Organisation is found to have breached the Protection\n\nObligation under section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n4\n\n\f12.\n\nThe Commission notes that after the Incident, the Organisation took prompt\n\nremedial actions, including notifying affected individuals and various technical\nmeasures to improve its security. The Organisation is also taking steps to upgrade to\nMagento version 2.\n\n13.\n\nIn deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered\n\nthe Organisation’s cooperation throughout the investigation, the voluntary admission\nof breach of the Protection Obligation, and the prompt remedial actions taken.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the issuance of the Commission’s preliminary decision, the\n\nOrganisation represented that it was unfair to state that was a prolonged failure to\nperform the necessary upgrade. This is because there was a lead time of 6 months\nbefore the end of support when it made the decision to upgrade, before the COVID19 pandemic disrupted its plans. The Organisation’s representation is not accepted\nas, notwithstanding the disruptions caused by the pandemic, the Organisation had\nbeen given ample notice of the impending end of support but took no action to perform\nthe necessary upgrade from November 2015 to early 2020.\n\n15.\n\nHaving considered the circumstances set out above, the factors listed at section\n\n48J(6) of the PDPA and the representations made by the Organisation, the Deputy\nCommissioner for Personal Data Protection hereby finds the Organisation in breach\nand directs the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of S$8,000 within 30 days from\nthe notice accompanying date of this decision, failing which interest at the rate\nspecified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgement debts shall accrue and be\n\n5\n\n\fpayable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty\nis paid in full.\n\n16.\n\nThe Organisation is also directed to:\na.\n\nComplete the upgrading of its website to a supported software version,\nincluding vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, within 6\nmonths of the direction.\n\nb.\n\nInform the Commission with 14 days of the completion of the above.\n\nThe following is the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

The\nCommission commenced investigations to determine whether the circumstances\nbehind the Incident disclosed any breaches by the Organisation of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Organisation is a body corporate established under the Legal Profession\n\nAct 1966 and represents members of the legal profession in Singapore. Every\nadvocate and solicitor called to the Singapore bar is a statutory member of the\nOrganisation as long as they have a practising certificate in force. At the material time,\nthe Organisation stored the personal data of its current and former members\n(“Members”) in one of its servers for the purposes of carrying out its statutory\nfunctions.\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nThe Organisation had implemented an off-the-shelf secure VPN solution,\n\nFortiOS, to manage remote access to its servers (the “VPN System”). The\nOrganisation also engaged a vendor (the “Vendor”) to provide IT support services,\nincluding maintenance of the VPN System. For completeness, the Vendor was not the\nOrganisation’s data intermediary as it did not access or process the personal data of\nthe Members in the course of carrying out its IT support services.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation also implemented antivirus / malware detection software at\n\nthe servers, and password complexity requirements for its users’ accounts. In\nparticular, account passwords had a maximum lifespan of 3 months before a\ncompulsory change was required.\n\n5\n\nAdditionally, the Organisation had in place a written data protection policy and\n\nconducted data protection training for its staff highlighting cybersecurity threats such\nas phishing and ransomware. Periodic emails on data protection awareness and\nreminders were also sent to staff.\n\nThe Incident\n6\n\nOn 27 January 2021, a threat actor gained access to the account of the\n\nOrganisation’s IT administrator (“compromised admin account”) and used this to\ncreate a new account with full administrative privileges. Using this new account, the\nthreat actor moved through the Organisation’s network without detection and located\nthe Organisation’s servers. The threat actor then executed a ransomware attack on\nthe servers, encrypting their contents.\n\n3\n\n\f7\n\nA total of 16,009 Members’ personal data was affected in the Incident, including\n\neach Member’s full name, residential address, date of birth, and NRIC number. Other\ndata items were also affected but they are either in the nature of business contact\ninformation or publicly available information.\n\n8\n\nThe attack was detected on the same day by antivirus / malware detection\n\nsoftware deployed by the Organisation. The Organisation took immediate steps to\nremove the new administrator account created by the threat actor and restored the\nservers to their original state from secured back-ups.\n\nRemedial actions\n9\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation also took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a)\n\nRemoved unused administrator accounts and initiated password resets for\nall administrator accounts;\n\n(b)\n\nReduced privileged access for the compromised admin account (to create\nnew administrator accounts);\n\n(c)\n\nHired an in-house cybersecurity professional to take charge of the\nOrganisation’s IT security matters;\n\n(d)\n\nImplemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for all VPN access; and\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented VPN IP location whitelisting to allow only Singapore-based IP\naddresses.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n4\n\n\f10\n\nThe Commission’s investigation centred on whether the Organisation had\n\nbreached its obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA to protect personal data in its\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,\ndisposal or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”). As the Vendor was not the\nOrganisation’s data intermediary, the Protection Obligation in this case was borne\nsolely by the Organisation.\n\nFindings from the investigations\n11\n\nInvestigations disclosed that there could have been multiple threat actors\n\ntargeting the Organisation or the same group of threat actors targeting the\nOrganisation through multiple channels – through brute force attacks, phishing email,\nand exploiting the unpatched VPN vulnerability of the VPN System.\n\n12\n\nBrute-force attacks. Around ten days before the Incident, multiple\n\nunsuccessful login attempts using a “guest” account were found since 18 January\n2021. There were also further unsuccessful attempts made using random accounts.\nHowever, investigations did not surface evidence that the initial entry by the threat\nactor had been via a successful brute force attack on the compromised admin account.\n\n13\n\nPhishing emails. Investigations also revealed that the Organisation was\n\nattacked by the Netwalker ransomware, most commonly introduced via phishing\nemails. From the Vendor’s explanations, the administrator of the compromised admin\naccount could have received a phishing email with a link and entered his credentials.\nHowever, investigations did not surface evidence of any phishing email relevant to this\n5\n\n\fransomware; neither was there evidence that the compromised admin account’s\ncredentials was obtained by a threat actor through phishing.\n\n14\n\nVulnerability of the VPN System. At the material time before the Incident,\n\nMFA was not implemented for the Organisation’s administrator access to its servers.\nThis meant that once authenticated, an admin user had rights to create new accounts,\nassign privileged security groups, and access all of the Organisation’s servers without\nthe need for a second factor.\n\n15\n\nInvestigations revealed that there was a vulnerability in the VPN System which\n\ncould be exploited to gain access credentials if left unpatched (the “Vulnerability”).\nThis was assessed to be a possible way in which the threat actor obtained the\ncredentials of the compromised admin account:\n(a)\n\nAround November 2020, a file containing more than 45,000 session links\nand IP addresses for the VPN System of affected organisations (including\nthe Organisation) was found posted in online forums by someone who had\nobtained the information by exploiting the Vulnerability.\n\n(b)\n\nWithout patching the VPN System’s firmware, each session link would\ndisclose the credentials of users in plain text, including passwords.\n\n(c)\n\nThe date/time of the online publication (i.e. November 2020) was sufficiently\nproximate to the threat actor’s successful intrusion in January 2021 using\nthe compromised admin account.\n\n6\n\n\f16\n\nFrom the foregoing, it would appear that of the three possible attack vectors,\n\nthe vulnerability in the VPN System could have given the threat actor entry into the\nOrganisation’s environment.\n\nNo breach of the Protection Obligation for omission to patch the Vulnerability\n17\n\nThe developer of the VPN System, Fortinet, had disclosed the Vulnerability as\n\nearly as 24 May 2019. It released an Operating System (“OS”) upgrade to remedy the\nissue, which contained the updates to remedy the issue. The VPN System had a user\ninterface (“UI”) through which the OS upgrade availability could be notified. According\nto the Vendor, the Vendor had regularly checked the UI if OS upgrades were available\nbut there were no prompts of updates available for download prior to the Incident.\nAccording to the Organisation, it was only after it communicated the issue to the\ndeveloper, after the incident, that the UI subsequently prompted availability of some\npatches that included the OS upgrade remedying the Vulnerability.\n\n18\n\nThe Commission recognises that organisations may rely on vendors engaged\n\nto provide IT security maintenance to obtain and apply needed software upgrades and\npatches. If so, the Protection Obligation requires organisations to stipulate such\nrequirements clearly in writing as part of the job specifications of such vendors. In this\ncase, patching of the VPN System had been a specific obligation explicitly outsourced\nby the Organisation to the Vendor via contract.\n\n19\n\nIn addition to clearly stipulating the vendor’s scope of IT maintenance and/or\n\ndevelopment work, organisations are expected to exercise reasonable oversight over\nthe vendor’s performance of the subcontracted services, including patching – Re\n7\n\n\fSmiling Orchard (S) Pte Ltd and Ors [2016] SGPDPC 191. There should be a clear\nmeeting of minds as to the services the service provider has agreed to undertake and\norganisations must follow through with procedures to check that the outsourced\nprovider is delivering the services.\n\n20\n\nThe Commission appreciates that the technical nature of information on\n\nsoftware patching and upgrades limits the degree of oversight that many organisations\ncan exercise on vendor performance in this regard. The Commission notes that the\nOrganisation had put in place a process to ensure that there were maintenance logs\nin respect of the Vendor’s activities. Thus, the Organisation, to its credit, had put in\nplace a system to monitor its Vendor’s activities. In technical areas where the\nOrganisation depends on its Vendor’s technical expertise, this is reasonably adequate.\nThe situation may be different if there was a very well-publicised issue with a wellknown commercial solution (e.g. vulnerabilities affecting a network router) that the\nOrganisation ought to know that it uses. In such situations, the Organisation might be\nat least expected to query its Vendor about whether it is exposed and ask for a\nremediation plan. But this is probably limited to well-known and well-publicised issues\nin mass media.\n\n21\n\nCarefully weighing the above circumstances, the Commission has decided that:\n\n(a) it had been reasonable for the Organisation to rely on the Vendor to perform\nsoftware security patching, including of the Vulnerability, and (b) that the Organisation\n\n1\n\nSee also Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd and Integrated Health Information Systems Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC\n3.\n8\n\n\fhad in this case discharged its duty of oversight of the Vendor’s patching function.\nTherefore the Organisation has not breached the Protection Obligation.\n\nBreach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation in other aspects\n22\n\nInvestigations revealed that the password for the compromised admin account\n\nwas “Welcome2020lawsoc”. Despite this password complying with the Organisation’s\nown password complexity rules, the Organisation acknowledged that this was a weak\npassword and vulnerable to dictionary attacks due to the use of a full word and the\nOrganisation’s name. As highlighted in Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1, a\npassword that meets complexity rules in form could still be regarded as a weak\npassword if it was easily determined and vulnerable to brute force attacks. In that case,\nthe password “Chi!zzle@2018” incorporated the organisation’s name and was\ndetermined to be a weak password. Further, the Organisation informed that the\ncompromised admin account’s password had been used for more than 90 days and\nhad not been changed every 3 months, as required by the Organisation’s password\npolicy. In the circumstances, the Organisation failed to enforce its password policy in\nrelation to the compromised admin account.\n\n23\n\nIn the Commission’s recent Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\n\nsystems2, it has been observed that unauthorised access is one of the most common\ntypes of data breaches. This can happen, for example, through the use of a weak\npassword which is easily guessed by hackers. To remediate this, it may be practical\nto look into implementing processes in ICT systems to minimise risk of brute force\n\n2\n\nPublished on 14 September 2021, replacing the Guide to Data Protection by Design for ICT systems published\non 31 May 2019, after the Incident.\n9\n\n\fattacks (e.g. a pre-defined number of failed login attempts) and ensure information is\naccessed only by the authorised/authenticated persons performing the intended\nactivities. Additionally, as 2FA or MFA becomes more broadly available, the adoption\nof these tools should become the norm for accounts with administrative privileges, for\nsystems managing sensitive data or large volumes of personal data3.\n\n24\n\nNext, the Organisation also did not conduct a review of its security\n\narrangements within the last 3 years prior to the Incident. Regular assurance checks\nhelp organisations ensure that ICT security controls developed and configured for the\nprotection of personal data are properly implemented and practised4. In Re WTS\nAutomotive Services Pte Ltd [2018] SGPDPC 265, the Commission emphasised (at\n[18]) for the need for regular review of security arrangements and tests to detect\nvulnerabilities.\n\n25\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation is found to have negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by (i) using an easily guessable password for the\ncompromised admin account, (ii) failing to change the password for the compromised\nadmin account at reasonable intervals, and (iii) failing to conduct any periodic security\nreviews in the three years leading up to the Incident.\n\n3\n\nSee the Commission’s recent release of the handbook on common causes of data breaches in How to Guard\nagainst Common Types of Data Breaches published on 24 May 2021 (at page 13), after the Incident; See Love\nBonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3.\n4\nSee the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems.\n5\nSee also Jigyasa [2020] SGPDPC 9.\n10\n\n\fThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n26\n\nNotwithstanding that the Organisation’s breaches of the Protection Obligation\n\nwere not directly related to the Incident, the Commission’s role is not limited to\ninvestigating only the immediate or proximate causes of a data breach incident 6. In\ndetermining whether directions (if any) should be given to the Organisation pursuant\nto Section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether a financial penalty ought to be imposed\npursuant to Section 48J of the PDPA, the Deputy Commissioner took into\nconsideration the relevant facts and circumstances of the case, and in particular the\nfollowing factors:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s breaches of the Protection Obligation were not the most\nproximate cause of the Incident (which was the VPN Vulnerability);\n\n(b)\n\nThe datasets affected in the Incident were not of a higher sensitivity (e.g.\npersonal data of a financial or medical nature);\n\n(c)\n\nThe risk of unauthorised access to the Members’ personal data was limited\ndue to early detection of the unauthorised access, which also allowed\nprompt containment and restoration of the servers to its original state;\n\n(d)\n\nThere was no evidence of any exfiltration or misuse of the personal data of\nthe Members; and\n\n(e)\n\n27\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions in response to the Incident.\n\nFor the above reasons, it is adequate for directions to be issued in this case.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner hereby directs the Organisation to:\n(a)\n\nEngage qualified security service providers to conduct a thorough security\naudit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the security,\n\n6\n\nSee Love Bonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3.\n11\n\n\fmaintenance, creation and removal of accounts with administrative\nprivileges that can access directly and/or create access to personal data in\nthe possession or control of the Organisation;\n(b)\n\nFurnish to the Commission within 14 days a schedule stating the scope of\nthe security audit;\n\n(c)\n\nProvide the full security audit report to the Commission, by no later than 60\ndays from the date of the issue of this direction;\n\n(d)\n\nRectify any security gaps identified in the security audit report, review and\nupdate its personal data protection policies as applicable, and\n\n(e)\n\nInform the Commission within 1 week of completion of rectification and\nimplementation in response to the security audit report.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n12\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $37,000 was imposed on OrangeTee & Tie for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect users' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Real Estate"],"date":"17 Apr 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_orangetee_210223.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by OrangeTee & Tie","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-orangetee-and-tie","timestamp":"2023-04-17","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 3\n\nCase No. DP-2108-B8712\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nOrangeTee & Tie Pte Ltd\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fOrangeTee & Tie Pte Ltd\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2108-B8712\n21 February 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 4 August 2021, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“Commission”)\n\ncontacted OrangeTee & Tie Pte Ltd (“Organisation”) after receiving information\nindicating that a threat actor had managed to exfiltrate databases in the Organisation’s\npossession, which were believed to contain personal data.\n\n2\n\nSubsequently, on 6 August 2021, the Organisation notified the Commission of\n\nan incident involving unauthorised access to its IT network (the “Incident”). The\nOrganisation also gave a media statement on the same day informing members of the\npublic about the Incident and inviting any concerned customers to contact the\nOrganisation’s call centre for clarification.\n\n3\n\nThe\n\nCommission\n\nthen\n\ncommenced\n\ninvestigations\n\nto\n\ndetermine\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in\nrelation to the Incident.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation is a real estate enterprise based in Singapore and has been\n\nin operation since 2000.\n\n\f5\n\nFour servers maintained by the Organisation were involved in the Incident,\n\nnamely: the Production Web Server, the Production Database Server, the\nDevelopment Web Server, and the Development Database Server. The Production\nWeb Server and the Development Web Server (collectively the “Web Servers”) were\ninternet-facing, in that they were directly accessible from the internet. The Production\nWeb Server was linked to the Production Database Server, while the Development\nWeb Server was linked to the Development Database Server.\n\n6\n\nThe personal data of employees and customers of the Organisation was stored\n\non the Production Database Server and the Development Database Server\n(collectively the “Database Servers”). The personal data had not been encrypted.\n\n7\n\nThe Databases Servers were running Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Standard\n\nversion 11.0.6251.0 (Service Pack 3) at the time of the Incident, which Microsoft had\nceased support for on 9 October 2018. Additionally, the version of Microsoft SQL\nServer the Organisation used was also not updated, as the most current Service Pack\n4 was not installed.\n\nThe Incident\n\n8\n\nOn 3 August 2021, the Organisation received a ransom demand email from an\n\norganisation which identified themselves as ‘ALTDOS’. The email was sent from an\nemail address which is known to be used by the ALTDOS group. The threat actor\nclaimed that they had been hacking the Organisation’s network since June 2021 and\n\n\fhad stolen “hundreds of databases”, some of which were claimed to contain sensitive\ninformation. The ransom demand also contained video footage of five databases\npurported to have been stolen, which showed that sensitive data might have been\nexfiltrated from the Organisation’s servers.\n\n9\n\nIn the same email, the threat actor demanded a ransom of 10 Bitcoins for the\n\nsafety and non-disclosure of the exfiltrated databases and threatened disclosure if the\nransom was not paid. The Organisation filed a police report and reported the Incident\nto the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team, a division of the Cyber\nSecurity Agency of Singapore.\n\n10\n\nOn 4 August 2021, having not received the demanded ransom, ALTDOS\n\ncarried out a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack which brought down the\nOrganisation’s network, and sent an additional ransom demand via email and\nWhatsApp to some of the Organisation’s employees.\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation engaged a private forensic expert (“PFE”) to ascertain the\n\ncause and extent of the Incident. PFE’s investigations disclosed that, contrary to their\nclaims, the threat actor exfiltrated personal datasets from eleven databases,\ncontaining personal data set out in the table below:\n\nCategory of\n\nNumber of\n\nIndividuals\n\nIndividuals\n\nEmployees\n\n305\n\nTypes of Personal Data Affected\n\nName, full NRIC/FIN/passport number and bank account\nnumber\n\nCustomers\n\n245,752\n\nName, full NRIC/FIN/passport number and property\ntransaction amount\n\n\fAgents\n\n10,526\n\n1. Name, full NRIC/FIN/passport number and bank\naccount number (2,301 individuals)\n\n2. Name, full NRIC/FIN number, bank account number\nand commission amount (4,763 individuals)\n\n3. Name, full NRIC/FIN number, commission amount\n(286 individuals)\n\n4. Name, full NRIC/FIN number (3,176 individuals)\nTOTAL\n\n12\n\n256,583\n\n-\n\nThe PFE’s investigations found that the threat actor had carried out certain web-\n\nbased attacks and exploited vulnerabilities on the Web Servers to successfully\nexfiltrate databases from the outdated Database Servers. The following observations\nwere made by the PFE:\n(a)\n\nProduction Web Server – the PFE concluded that the threat actor used\n\nSQL injection attacks on the Production Web Server. SQL injections are a way\nof exploiting vulnerable website code and forms to return data from a SQL\ndatabase that should not be available to a user. The PFE also found that the\nthreat actor had likely used a malicious tool known as ‘SQL Map’ on vulnerable\nwebpages in the Production Web Server, to automate the systematic probing of\nwebpages for SQL injection vulnerabilities. Once the vulnerabilities were\ndiscovered, the threat actor then proceeded to exploit the vulnerabilities to\naccess and exfiltrate data from four databases within the Production Database\nServer at some point(s) between 24 June 2021 and 3 August 2021.\n\n(b)\n\nDevelopment Web Server – the PFE could not locate forensic artefacts\n\nto confirm the mode of attack by the threat actor. However, the PFE identified\n\n\fevidence of cross-site scripting attacks. Cross-site scripting attacks involve the\ninjection of malicious scripts into trusted websites which are then executed on\nend-users’ browsers. In this case, malicious code had been injected into the\nDevelopment Web Server. This led the PFE to believe that the Development\nWeb Server was compromised. The threat actor is believed to have exploited the\ncompromised Development Web Server to access and exfiltrate data from seven\ndatabases on the Development Database Server, although it was unclear how\nand when this had occurred.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n13\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following remedial\n\nmeasures:\n\nImmediate remedial steps to contain the Incident\n\n(a)\n\nShut down and isolated the affected servers from the rest of the IT network;\n\n(b)\n\nUpdated its servers with the latest security patches;\n\nTo prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n\n(c)\n\nTested the affected servers for vulnerabilities and deployed enterprisegrade anti-malware software across the IT network;\n\n\f(d)\n\nCarried out security hardening activities, including the removal of redundant\nservices, restricting access and services, and ensuring the server is secure\nto ‘Center for Internet of Security’ (CIS) benchmarking standards;\n\n(e)\n\nCarried out detailed analysis of intrusion prevention logs;\n\n(f)\n\nReviewed and secured the firewall configuration;\n\n(g)\n\nSeparated the public-facing website from the internal agent portal and\nensured that the former was securely hosted;\n\n(h)\n\nImplemented a web application firewall to protect the network; and\n\n(i)\n\nLiaised with the PFE on the recovery process as well as improving IT\nsecurity.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n14\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). The Organisation was determined to have breached the Protection\nObligation in the following two respects.\n\n\fUse of production data in Development Servers for testing purposes\n\n15\n\nFirst, the Organisation used ‘live’ production data for development and testing\n\npurposes without sufficiently robust processes to protect the personal data through\nproper safeguards.\n16\n\nThe ‘live’ production data used included personal data and had been stored in\n\nthe development environment (i.e. the Development Servers) from which the datasets\nhad been exfiltrated by the threat actor. The Organisation explained the use of ‘live’\nproduction data as being necessary in order for the testing computations to be\naccurately derived, and for the actual business process flow to be effectively tested.\n\n17\n\nThe Commission has advised in its Handbook on How to Guard Against\n\nCommon Types of Data Breaches (the “Handbook”) at page 11 that use of ‘live’\nproduction personal data for testing creates a security risk. 1 The safer practice would\nbe to use anonymised data for testing purposes. Synthetic data, which is fake data\nthat contains similar characteristics as the real data, is a form of anonymised data.\nAnother way is to use pseudonymised data where direct identifiers have been replaced\nwith pseudonyms. The Commission has explained the rationale for anonymisation of\npersonal data for development and business study in the Advisory Guidelines on the\nPDPA for Selected Topics:\n\nHandbook on How to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches (“Handbook”), page 11: “Out of convenience, many\norganisations use production data for system testing in their test environments. But as test environments tend to be much less\nsecured, there is a high risk of data breach in a test environment.” (https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/news-andevents/announcements/2021/05/handbook-on-how-to-guard-against-common-types-of-data-breaches-now-available)\n1\n\n\f“3.14 Anonymisation of personal data enables businesses to tap on data\nfor insights and innovation while at the same time provides protection to\nindividuals. It also reduces the impact of harm to individuals in the event of a\ndata breach. Where possible, Organisations should adopt such practices for\nexternal sharing of data. It can even be adopted when sharing data internally,\nparticularly where individuals need not be identified for the purposes of\nprocessing.\n\n3.15 In the event of a data breach, the level of data anonymisation,\ncorresponding\n\nsafeguards\n\nimplemented\n\nand\n\nproper\n\nassessment\n\nby\n\norganisations in considering the harms of the anonymised data would be taken\ninto consideration to assess if data has been properly anonymised.”2\n(emphasis in bold added)\n\n18\n\nThe Commission’s position on this issue had been reiterated in Re PINC\n\nInteractive Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 1, in which it was held that the organisation had\nbreached the Protection Obligation by using a synthetic dataset that contained\npersonal data belonging to real users. It should have used 100% synthetic data.3\n\n19\n\nHowever, where the use of ‘live’ personal data is operationally necessary,\n\nsufficiently robust processes should be implemented to safeguard the personal data.\nTesting or development environments are usually not as secured as production\nenvironments. The Organisation in this case had failed to implement sufficiently robust\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on the PDPA for Selected Topics, page 14, paragraphs 3.14 – 3.15 (https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelinesand-consultation/2020/02/advisory-guidelines-on-the-personal-data-protection-act-for-selected-topics)\n3\nRe PINC Interactive Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 1, [10] – [12]\n2\n\n\fprocesses in the form of a security assessment of the risk from using, and storing,\n‘live’ personal data in a testing environment. Such a security assessment could\nconsider, for example, whether to restrict access to a smaller group of testers and limit\nthe duration when live data is loaded in the testing environment. If the testing\nenvironment is accessible from the Internet, security assessment ought to also be\ncarried out of the risk of unauthorised web entry.\n\n20\n\nWithout such an assessment, the Organisation was not positioned to make an\n\ninformed decision on whether the security arrangements to protect the personal data\nhad been reasonable or had needed to be enhanced. The lack of sufficiently robust\nprocesses to protect personal data through proper safeguards, such as the conduct of\na reasonable security assessment, amounted to a breach of the Protection Obligation\nby the Organisation.\n\nFailure to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews prior to the Incident\n\n21\n\nSecond, the Organisation failed to conduct reasonable periodic security\n\nreviews for its servers.\n\n22\n\nThe Commission’s previous decisions4 and the Guide5 have established that\n\nperiodic security reviews should be conducted to a reasonable standard to identify and\nremedy any vulnerabilities. Such scheduled reviews should be in place as a basic\npractice as it would likely have resulted in the detection of the vulnerabilities arising\nfrom the outdated software and the risk of SQL injection techniques. The Organisation\n\n4\n5\n\nWTS Automotive Services Pte. Ltd. [2018] SGPDPC 26 and Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11\nGuide, page 21, paragraph (g)\n\n\fadmitted in its submissions to the Commission that it had not considered the need for\nsuch security reviews in its IT security policy.\n\n23\n\nBoth Web Servers were internet-facing and were connected to production data\n\nstored in both Database Servers, thereby exposing the ‘live’ production data contained\ntherein (containing personal data) to security risks. However, owing to its failure to\nconduct periodic security reviews for the Web and Database Servers, the Organisation\ndid not recognise the risks engendered by the outdated software and did not take steps\nto assure itself that all internet-facing servers were adequately protected. Had the\nOrganisation conducted reasonable periodic security reviews prior to the Incident, the\nvulnerabilities to SQL injection techniques in the Web Servers would have been known\nand remedied. The Incident could then very likely have been avoided.\n\n24\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation by (i) using personal data belonging to real users in a\ndevelopment environment (i.e. the Development Servers) without a sufficiently robust\nprocess for a reasonable security assessment of the risk, and (ii) failing to conduct\nreasonable security reviews prior to the Incident.\n\nOrganisation’s position on the failure to update Microsoft SQL Server 2012\n\n25\n\nThe Organisation explained its failure to update the Database Servers’\n\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2012 version and install Service Pack 4 as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s IT team relied on Microsoft’s own auto-scan function\n\nto be alerted to available updating patches as a prompt for installation. This\n\n\fMicrosoft tool ran once a month before the Incident. The tool, however, failed to\ndetect that the installed version of Microsoft SQL Server 2012 in the servers\nrequired patching, and that the required patch in the form of Service Pack 4 had\nbeen available.\n\n(b)\n\nThe tool had not previously failed to detect and alert about required\n\nupdates.\n\n(c)\n\nThe alternative option of requiring the IT team to conduct a manual\n\nreview of all updates released by Microsoft every month had not been practical\nor reasonable as compared to relying on the auto-scan function.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation’s IT team did not use third-party scanning software to\n\nmonitor and detect available patches because even these might not have\nidentified the need to patch Microsoft SQL Server 2012 with Service Pack 4.\n\n26\n\nThe Commission’s investigation revealed no known issues relating to the\n\navailability or installation of Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 4 updates. The\nProtection Obligation required the Organisation to have sufficiently robust processes\nto protect personal data through regular patching / updates / upgrades of important\nsoftware. The question is whether the Organisation’s reliance on system prompts in\nthe form of alerts from the Microsoft auto-scan function had amounted to a sufficiently\nrobust process for patching in the circumstances of this case.\n\n\f27\n\nService Packs are significant collations of updates and patches that have been\n\nreleased. When released, Service Packs effectively provide a new baseline of updates\nand patches. On the question above, the Commission noted that the Microsoft\nKnowledge Base site indicated that the Service Pack 4 update had been available\nthrough the usual Windows Update auto-scan function since October 2017. This\nmeans that it would have been available for almost 4 years at the time of the Incident.\nConsidering that an important software patch in the form of the Service Pack 4 had in\nthis case been available for almost 4 years, the Organisation’s reliance on system\nprompts such as alerts through the auto-scan function had not been a sufficiently\nrobust process to patch important software for the security of personal data. The\nOrganisation should be aware of significant Service Packs and consciously decide\nwhether to upgrade.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n28\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1), and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account, including the following mitigating factors:\n\nMitigating Factors\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions, including notifying the\naffected individuals;\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted that it had breached the Protection\nObligation in Section 24(a) of the PDPA in failing to protect personal data\nin its possession by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission further notes that names and property transaction amounts\n\nwere among the categories of personal data which was exfiltrated. Whilst the\nCommission took the exfiltration of such personal data into account in its decision, it\ndoes not consider these categories to be highly sensitive in nature as this information\nis, to a certain extent, already in the public domain. For example, a member of the\npublic is able to look up such information through a land titles search on the Singapore\nLand Authority website (for names), or a search on the Urban Redevelopment\nAuthority website for caveats lodged (for property transaction amounts). Thus, this\ninformation is publicly available as defined in s 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n30\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $37,000\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n\f31\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A warning was issued to an individual for using dictionary attack methods to generate telephone numbers which were then used for telemarketing purposes, thereby breaching section 48B of the PDPA.","tags":["Do Not Call Provisions","Warning","Others","Telemarketing"],"date":"17 Apr 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_taishinfatt_140223.pdf","nature":"Do Not Call Provisions","title":"Breach of Section 48B of the PDPA (Prohibition on Use of Dictionary Attacks) by an individual","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/04/breach-of-section-48b-of-the-pdpa-prohibition-on-use-of-dictionary-attacks-by-an-individual","timestamp":"2023-04-17","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 2\n\nCase No. ENF-DNC-210826-0015\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nTai Shin Fatt\n… Individual\n\nDECISION\n\n\fTai Shin Fatt\nLee Ti-Ting, Assistant Commissioner - Case No. ENF-DNC-210826-0015\n\n14 February 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the Personal Data Protection Commission (“the Commission”)\n\nwas notified by the Singapore Police Force that the Singapore Civil Defence Force\n(“SCDF”) had received an influx of marketing calls between 25 and 28 June 2021 from\ntelephone numbers registered to one LongSheng Consultancy Pte Ltd (“LongSheng”)\non behalf of one Tai Shin Fatt (the “Individual”). The Commission commenced\ninvestigations to determine whether the circumstances relating to the calls disclosed\nany breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n2\n\nThe Individual is an insurance director with a large and well-known insurance\n\ncompany managing a team of 25 insurance agents. In an effort to conduct marketing\ncalls more efficiently, the Individual sought to engage the services of 2 companies\nhereinafter referred to as the “Call Automation Vendor” and the “Checker”.\n\n3\n\nThe Call Automation Vendor provides software to facilitate the making of\n\nautomated calls using customised scripts. The Checker’s service comprises the\nprovision of telephone numbers (from which automated calls could be made), and the\nprovision of software to check whether the telephone numbers of intended recipients\n\n\fwere registered with the Do Not Call Registry (“DNCR”). The systems / software of the\nCall Automation Vendor and the Checker were intended to work in tandem as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nthe telephone numbers of intended recipients would be uploaded onto the Call\nAutomation Vendor’s software;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Checker’s software would check the DNCR for such telephone numbers;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nthe Call Automation Vendor’s software would then avoid making any calls to the\ntelephone numbers which appeared in the DNCR.\n\n4\n\nAs the Call Automation Vendor and the Checker do not contract directly with\n\nindividuals, the Individual caused LongSheng to enter into contracts with the Call\nAutomation Vendor and the Checker on 17 March 2021 and 20 May 2021 respectively,\nto provide the services outlined at paragraph 3 above. The Individual used LongSheng\nas a corporate vehicle by which to procure the services of the Call Automation Vendor\nand the Checker.\n\n5\n\nFollowing the engagement of the Call Automation Vendor and the Checker, and\n\npursuant to instructions from the Individual, the Call Automation Vendor provided 10\nchannels in its software, while the Checker subscribed for 10 telephone numbers in\nthe name of LongSheng from which to make the automated marketing calls.\n\n6\n\nThe Individual wished to test the systems provided by the Call Automation\n\nVendor and the Checker, for which recipient telephone numbers were required. One\nof the Individual’s staff suggested to generate recipient telephone numbers by:\n\n\f(a)\n\nusing commonly seen telephone numbers for the first 4 digits of each telephone\nnumber; and\n\n(b)\n\nrandomly generating the last 4 digits of the telephone number by automated\nmeans.\n\n7\n\nThe Individual authorised this method of generating the telephone numbers,\n\nand his staff proceeded to use Microsoft Excel to do so.\n\n8\n\nThe Individual’s staff generated a total of 18,809 telephone number (“Subject\n\nNumbers”), which included 400 telephone numbers beginning with the digits “995”.\n“995” is the SCDF emergency line.\n\n9\n\nThe Subject Numbers were contained in 3 lists, which were uploaded onto the\n\nCall Automation Vendor’s software by a member of the Individual’s staff. The Individual\nthen clicked “send/call” in the Call Automation Vendor’s software to commence the\nautomated marketing calls.\n\n10\n\nBetween 25 and 28 June 2021, a total of 22,268 automated marketing calls\n\nwere made (the “Subject Calls”), of which 433 were to the SCDF emergency line (the\n“Incident”). Such calls were not blocked as the SCDF emergency line was not\nregistered in the DNCR.\n\n11\n\nOn 28 June 2021, while reviewing the call recordings, the Individual discovered\n\nthe calls made to the SCDF emergency line and immediately instructed his staff to\nstop using the Call Automation Vendor’s software. He also contacted the Call\n\n\fAutomation Vendor to stop making further automated marketing calls; and deleted the\nlists containing the Subject Numbers.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe prohibition under Section 48B of the PDPA\n12\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation focused on whether the Individual had breached section 48B(1) of the\nPDPA by sending, causing to be sent, or authorising the sending of “applicable\nmessages” - namely, (i) messages with a Singapore link to (ii) telephone numbers\ngenerated by a dictionary attack or address harvesting software (\"Section 48B\nProhibition\").\n\n13\n\nThe Section 48B Prohibition and other provisions of the PDPA setting out\n\nrelevant definitions are reproduced below:\nTerm and definition\n(…) a person must not send, cause to be sent or\n\nPDPA provision\ns48B(1)\n\nauthorise the sending of an applicable message.\n“applicable message” means a message with a\n\ns48A(1)\n\nSingapore link that is sent to any applicable telephone\nnumber;\n“message” means any message, whether in sound, text,\n\ns36(1)\n\nvisual or other form;\n(2) In this Part, an applicable message has a Singapore\nlink in any of the following circumstances:\n\ns48A(2)\n\n\f(a)\n\nthe message originates in Singapore;\n\n(b)\n\nthe sender of the message —\n(i)\n\nwhere the sender is an individual — is\n\nphysically\n\npresent\n\nin\n\nSingapore\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nmessage is sent; or\n(ii)\n\nin any other case —\n(A)\n\nis formed or recognised under the\n\nlaw of Singapore; or\n(B)\n\nhas an office or a place of business\n\nin Singapore;\n(c)\n\nthe telephone, mobile telephone or other device\n\nthat is used to access the message is located in\nSingapore;\n(d)\n\nthe recipient of the message —\n(i)\n\nwhere the recipient is an individual — is\n\nphysically\n\npresent\n\nin\n\nSingapore\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nmessage is accessed; or\n(ii)\n\nin any other case — carries on business or\n\nactivities in Singapore when the message is\naccessed;\n(e)\n\nif the message cannot be delivered because the\n\ntelephone number to which the message is sent has\nceased to exist (assuming that the telephone number\nexisted), it is reasonably likely that the message would\n\n\fhave been accessed using a telephone, mobile\ntelephone or other device located in Singapore.\n“applicable telephone number” means a telephone\n\ns48A(1)\n\nnumber that is generated or obtained through the use of\n—\n(a)\n\na dictionary attack; or\n\n(b)\n\naddress‑harvesting software;\n\n“dictionary attack” means the method by which the\n\ns48A(1)\n\ntelephone number of a recipient is obtained using an\nautomated means that generates possible telephone\nnumbers\n\nby\n\ncombining\n\nnumbers\n\ninto\n\nnumerous\n\npermutations;\n“address‑harvesting software” means software that is\n\ns48A(1)\n\nspecifically designed or marketed for use for —\n(a)\n\nsearching the Internet for telephone numbers; and\n\n(b)\n\ncollecting, compiling, capturing or otherwise\n\nharvesting those telephone numbers\n\n14\n\nThe Section 48B Prohibition was introduced as part of the 2020 amendments\n\nto the PDPA and came into effect on 1 February 2021. It was intended to supplement\nthe existing “Do Not Call” provisions in Part 9 of the PDPA in striking the correct\nbalance between safeguarding consumer interest and permitting legitimate business\ninterests in direct marketing by:\n\n\f(a)\n\nestablishing clear guardrails for sending unsolicited commercial messages; 1\nand\n\n(b)\n\naddressing consumer annoyance and deterring spammers who use\ntechnologies that make it easier to indiscriminately send unsolicited commercial\nmessages (including robocalls) to a large number of recipients.2\n\n15\n\nThe Section 48B Prohibition operates by targeting the indiscriminate manner\n\nby which recipient telephone numbers may be generated and targeted, usually by\nautomated means. It does not serve as a blanket prohibition on the sending of\nunsolicited commercial messages, and leaves room for legitimate direct marketing.\n\nWhether the Individual had contravened the s48B Prohibition\n16\n\nFor the Individual to have breached the Section 48B Prohibition, he must have:\n\n(a)\n\nsent, cause to be sent or authorized the sending of;\n\n(b)\n\na message;\n\n(c)\n\nwith a Singapore link;\n\n(d)\n\nto telephone numbers generated or obtained through use of:\n\n17\n\n(i)\n\na dictionary attack; or\n\n(ii)\n\naddress harvesting software.\n\nBased on the facts of the Incident as set out above, the elements for breach of\n\nthe Section 48B Prohibition are made out:\n\n1\n\nSingapore Parliamentary Debates (2 November 2020) vol 95, at page 36 (S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and\nInformation)\n2 Public Consultation Paper issued by the Ministry of Communications and Information and the Personal Data Protection\nCommission dated 14 May 2020, at paragraphs 53 54(b)\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Individual specifically authorised and caused the making of the Subject\nCalls to the Subject Numbers.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Subject Calls were automated calls based on a customised script provided\nby the Call Automation Vendor. The Subject Calls were therefore messages in\nsound form, and “messages” as defined by s36(1) of the PDPA.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Subject Calls were made in Singapore. As such, the Subject Calls had a\n“Singapore link” within the meaning of s48A(2) of the PDPA.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Subject Numbers were generated by using commonly seen telephone\nnumbers for the first 4 digits, then randomising the remaining 4 digits. Strings\nof numbers were combined and resulted in the creation of 18,809 different\npermutations – i.e. unique telephone numbers – and the process was\nperformed using automated means via Microsoft Excel. This was therefore a\n“dictionary attack” within the meaning of s48A(1) of the PDPA.\n\n18\n\nAccordingly, the Individual is determined to have contravened the Section 48B\n\nProhibition.\n\nThe Commission’s Decision\n\n19\n\nBy using a “dictionary attack” to generate the Subject Numbers and then\n\ncausing and/or authorising the Subject Calls to be made to the Subject Numbers, the\nIndividual failed to stay within the “clear guardrails” of the PDPA to safeguard\nconsumer interests.\n\n\f20\n\nTo make matters worse, numerous calls were made to the SCDF emergency\n\nline. The importance of keeping the SCDF emergency line open and unobstructed for\ngenuine emergencies cannot be over-emphasised. That said, the fact that automated\nmarketing calls were made to the SCDF is not itself relevant to the Individual’s breach\nof the Section 48B Prohibition. The issue is with the method used to generate the\nSubject Numbers, and the Individual’s role in authorising the Subject Calls.\n\n21\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n(a)\n\nthe Individual was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Individual has not previously contravened the PDPA;\n\n(c)\n\nthe Individual had made efforts to ensure that he complied with his obligations\nunder Part 9 of the PDPA relating to the DNCR when making the Subject Calls;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nthe Individual voluntarily took action to cease the Subject Calls upon discovery\nthat the SCDF had been called.\n\n22\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, the Commission hereby\n\nadministers a warning to the Individual in respect of his breach of the Section 48B\nProhibition. No other directions are necessary in view of the remedial actions already\ntaken by the Individual.\n\nLEE TI-TING\nASSISTANT COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"Sembcorp Marine was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident whereby threat actor(s) exfiltrated personal data by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability present in an application.","tags":["Protection","Not in Breach","Others","Ransomware","No breach"],"date":"10 Mar 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_sembcorp-marine-ltd_070223.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"No breach of the PDPA by Sembcorp Marine","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/03/no-breach-of-the-pdpa-by-sembcorp-marine","timestamp":"2023-03-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 2\nCase No. DP-2206-B9934\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nSembcorp Marine Ltd\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 25 July 2022, Sembcorp Marine Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the\nPersonal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal data\nbreach that had occurred through the exploitation of the Log4J zero-day\nvulnerability (the “Incident”).\n\n2. As a result of the Incident, the personal data of 25,925 individuals was\nexfiltrated. The personal data affected included their name, address, email\naddress, NRIC number, telephone number, passport number, photograph, date\nof birth, bank account details, salary, and medical screening results.\n\n1\n\n\f3. The Organisation engaged an external cybersecurity company, Sygnia, to\ninvestigate the Incident. Its investigations found that the threat actor had\nexploited three Log4J vulnerabilities present in an application (the\n“Application”) to gain unauthorised access to a server as early as on 4 January\n2022. The threat actor also deployed the “Cobalt Strike” beacon, conducted\nreconnaissance, and made lateral movements across several machines, before\nexfiltrating data between 10 and 23 June 2022, and deploying a ransomware\non 28 June 2022.\n\n4. Threat intelligence research revealed that the ransomware campaign which\naffected the Organisation began targeting users of the Application in January\n2022. Given that reports of the Log4J vulnerability were first made in December\n2021, it would have been difficult for the Organisation to detect and prevent the\ninfiltration when it was one of the early targets, having been infiltrated as early\nas 4 January 2022.\n\n5. After finding out about the Log4J vulnerability, the Organisation took prompt\nactions to identify instances of Log4J vulnerabilities across all the software\napplication it was using. The Organisation started identifying instances of Log4J\nvulnerabilities across its systems on 14 December 2021. It applied the security\npatches immediately when they were made available by the respective software\nvendors. The Organisation also implemented workarounds recommended by\nthe vendors, for systems which patches were not available or had not been\nreleased. Additional measures such as blocking incoming and outgoing Log4J\ntraffic were also taken.\n2\n\n\f6. We are satisfied that the Organisation had made reasonable security\narrangements to protect personal data in its possession and/or control in\nrelation to the Incident. The Organisation had in fact adopted good practices in\nrelation to its Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems. This\nincluded a cybersecurity testing programme, regular vulnerability assessment\nand penetration testing, and cyber security monitoring.\n\n7.

Ltd.\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2010-B7267\n\n21 December 2022\nIntroduction\n1.\n\nFor an organisation to effectively safeguard the personal data in its possession or\n\ncontrol, it must first know what its personal data assets are. The surest way to ensure such\nvisibility is to maintain a comprehensive personal data asset inventory. This case is, amongst\nother things, a cautionary tale of the consequences of not maintaining a proper personal data\nasset inventory.\n\n2.\n\nOn 29 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nwas notified by a third party about a possible data leak by Eatigo International Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”). A cache of personal data that was suspected to be from the Organisation’s\ndatabase was being offered for sale on an online forum (the “Incident”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n3.\n\nThe Organisation provides an online restaurant reservation platform which offers\n\nincentives such as discounts to its users. In its daily operations, it regularly collects and\nprocesses the personal data of its users in order to facilitate restaurant reservations and the\nprovision of incentives.\n\n4.\n\nAfter the Commission was notified of the Incident, it informed the Organisation on 30\n\nOctober 2020 of an online forum purportedly selling the personal data from various ecommerce\nwebsites, including a database containing personal data that were suspected to have been\nobtained from the Organisation. Separately, the Organisation was also notified of the Incident\nPage 2 of 22\n\n\fon the same day by a user and a Channel News Asia journalist. The Organisation proceeded to\ncarry out investigations.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation’s investigations revealed that the personal data for sale on the online\n\nforum did not match any current databases in use by the Organisation at the time of the Incident,\nbut matched the structure of a legacy database which contained user data as of late 2018, when\nthe database was last updated (the “Affected Database”). The Affected Database was hosted\non the infrastructure of a Cloud Service Provider located in Singapore, and was previously in\nuse by the Organisation until 2018. Thereafter, the Organisation migrated to its current online\nplatform, which entailed a complete redevelopment of data storage and infrastructure. Whilst\nthe Organisation did not intend to continue to utilise the personal data contained in the Affected\nDatabase, it was nevertheless retained to support the migration of data to the new platform.\nAfter the migration, the Affected Database was not included in the Organisation’s Virtual\nPrivate Network (“VPN”) infrastructure. Unfortunately, as the Organisation transitioned to the\ncurrent engineering team, knowledge of the Affected Database was lost.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation was unable to ascertain exactly when the threat actor gained\n\nunauthorised access to the Affected Database. However, since the Affected Database was last\nupdated in late 2018, the Incident was likely to have occurred some time between 2018 and\n2020 (when the Affected Database was put up for sale on an online forum). Investigations\nrevealed the following:\n\n(a)\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Affected Database was accessible from the internet and\naccessible by anyone who had the requisite credentials;\n\n(b)\n\nNone of the Organisation’s employees at the material time had knowledge of the\nAffected Database or possessed the credentials to access the Affected Database;\n\nPage 3 of 22\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe databases inside the Cloud Service Provider’s Relational Database Services\n(“RDS”) were intended to have randomly generated alphanumeric passwords of a\nminimum 13-character length. However, there had been no such password rotation rules\nimplemented for the Affected Database;\n\n(d)\n\nThere was no security review conducted on the protection provided to the personal data\ncontained in the Affected Database;\n\n(e)\n\nThere was no system in place to monitor the exfiltration of large volumes of data from\nthe Affected Database; and\n\n(f)\n\nNo personal data asset inventory or access logs were maintained, and the Organisation\nwas unable to establish how or when the threat actor gained unauthorised access to the\nAffected Database.\n\n7.\n\nThe Affected Database held the personal data of approximately 2.76 million of the\n\nOrganisation’s users. Because the Organisation had effectively lost track of a database of that\nsize, network security and access control measures deployed by the Organisation were not\napplied to the Affected Database.\n\n8.\n\nConsequently, the Affected Database was accessed and likely exfiltrated in the Incident\n\nand put up for sale on an online forum. A sample of 154 personal data sets were also posted on\nthe online forum. The types of personal data affected (the “Dataset”) were as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nEmail;\n\n(c)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(d)\n\nGender;\n\n(e)\n\nPasswords in MD5 Hash; and\n\nPage 4 of 22\n\n\f(f)\n\nFacebook ID number and tokens of around 10 users, which can provide access to the\nFacebook accounts of users and their accounts with the Organisation’s online platform.\n\n9.\n\nThe personal data of a total of 154 of the Organisation’s users were displayed in the\n\nforum post, and appeared to have been randomly selected from the Affected Database. As of\n13 November 2020, the post on the online forum no longer lists the Organisation’s personal\ndata for sale.\n\n10.\n\nUpon discovery of the Incident, the Organisation implemented, or has been in the\n\nprocess of implementing, the following remedial actions:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Affected Database was securely backed-up and then deleted;\n\n(b)\n\nAll databases were ensured to be accessible only inside VPN (i.e. no direct internet\naccess);\n\n(c)\n\nAll passwords to access databases were changed as of 30 October 2020;\n\n(d)\n\nAffected individuals were notified;\n\n(e)\n\nSecurity Settings on Systems Infrastructure were upgraded;\n\n(f)\n\nDifferent VPN for different categories of staff were created:\n\n(g)\n\nAccess security for data storages and cloud services was improved, including increasing\nthe password rotation and strengthening the password rules.\n\n(h)\n\nAll personal data in all non-production was anonymised;\n\n(i)\n\nThe logging and monitoring systems was reviewed to detect data access anomalies and\ntrace access;\n\n(j)\n\nAccess for external services used with the Organisation’s platform was reviewed;\n\n(k)\n\nPenetration Testing was conducted;\n\n(l)\n\nAll staff were updated on policies relating to network security, and subject to Data\nprotection and social engineering prevention training;\nPage 5 of 22\n\n\f(m)\n\nAll internal users in the Organisation’s cloud infrastructure and data storage were\nsubject to review;\n\n(n)\n\nAccess and error logging for all databases were added;\n\n(o)\n\nThe entire infrastructure, including which servers are currently inside vs. outside\ndemilitarized zone (DMZ), was subject to review; and\n\n(p)\n\nAccelerated implementation of recommendations of security audit completed by an\nexternal consultant in September 2020.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n11.\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigations centred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) to protect personal data in its possession\nor under its control by taking reasonable security steps or arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (“the\nProtection Obligation”).\n\n12.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, it is determined that the Organisation failed to implement\n\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the Affected Database from the risk of\nunauthorised access. This includes a failure to ensure that the Affected Dataset was properly\naccounted for in the Organisation’s personal data asset inventory, and a failure to implement\nreasonable data protection processes.\n\n13.\n\nIn determining what constitutes reasonable security steps or arrangements, an\n\norganisation should have regard to the nature of the personal data in its possession and control,\nas well as the impact that the disclosure of the data might have on the affected persons. As\n\nPage 6 of 22\n\n\fstated in the Commission’s Advisory on Key Concepts in the PDPA (the “Advisory”)1 at\n[17.2]:\n“There is no ‘one size fits all’ solution for organisations to comply with the Protection\nObligation. Each organisation should consider adopting security arrangements that are\nreasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, for example, taking into consideration\nthe nature of the personal data, the form in which the personal data has been\ncollected (e.g. physical or electronic) and the possible impact to the individual\nconcerned if an unauthorised person obtained, modified or disposed of the\npersonal data. For example, in the employment context, it would be reasonable to\nexpect a greater level of security for highly confidential employee appraisals as\ncompared to more general information about the projects an employee has worked on.”\n\n14.\n\nThe Affected Database contained personal data relating to approximately 2.76 million\n\nindividuals, encompassing personal data such as passwords, access IDs and Facebook tokens.\nGiven the high volume of personal data contained in the Affected Database, it was incumbent\non the Organisation to implement policies and practices to meet such security needs to\ndischarge its obligation under the Protection Obligation.\n\nLapses in managing of personal data asset inventory\n15.\n\nFor organisations with substantial personal data assets, the maintenance of an accurate\n\nand up-to-date personal data asset inventory is a pre-requisite for complying with the Protection\nObligation. The personal data asset inventory should catalogue all personal data assets in the\norganisation’s possession or control, so as to ensure that such personal data is covered by the\norganisation’s security measures. Maintaining such an inventory ensures that the organisation\n\n1\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 1 February 2021)\nPage 7 of 22\n\n\fretains the necessary institutional memory of the personal data assets that is or was previously\nunder its possession or control even if there is turnover of staff. Any significant lapse in an\norganisation’s inventory management and maintenance would impair the organisation’s ability\nto know whether the data protection processes it implemented are sufficient to cover all its\npersonal data assets.\n\n16.\n\nThis requirement to maintain a personal data asset inventory is not novel. As stated in\n\nRe Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [13]:\n“In addition, it is important for an organisation to be aware of and track its\npersonal data assets. The creation and maintenance of a personal data asset\nregister (i.e. a record identifying all personal data in the organisation’s possession\nor control) is a good practice that would assist organisations to comply with the\nProtection Obligation. An up-to-date personal data asset register provides the\norganisation with an accurate record of all the personal data in its possession or\ncontrol, and enables the organisation to ensure its periodic security reviews covers\nthe personal data assets. It also enables the organisation to more effectively review\nthe implementation of its data protection policies, for example, the access control\nlist setting out the employees who have access to the IT systems the personal data asset\nis stored in, whether the internal business owner of the personal data asset has reviewed\nit for data quality issues, and initiating the process for disposing personal data that have\nreached the end of its life cycle within the organisation.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n17.\n\nSimilarly, it was stated in Re Civil Service Club [2020] SGPDPC 15 at [15]:\n\nPage 8 of 22\n\n\f“From the Appointed Day, the Organisation’s failure to take any reasonable steps to\nensure sufficient obligations are imposed on the Vendor (when developing and\ntroubleshooting the CMS, Membership Portal and Virtual Cards) to protect the\nMembers Data was a breach of its obligations under section 24 of the PDPA. A period\nof about five years had elapsed since 2 July 2014 to 2 July 2019. The Organisation, as\nowner of the CMS, should have included it as part of its personal data asset\ninventory and ensured that its data protection policies covered personal data held\nin the CMS. Had this been done, the Organisation would have identified these gaps\nin the business requirements for the CMS, which would have set it down the path\nto rectifying these gaps through one or both of the options discussed in the\npreceding paragraph. The Organisation, as owner of the CMS, is responsible for\nidentifying the omission and articulating its business requirements relating to the\nprotection of personal data stored in the CMS. This would have led to action by the\nVendor in recommending technical fixes to enhance the CMS. It is the failure to identify\nthe omission and articulate business requirements, and for a not-trivial period of five\nyears, that is the gravamen of the Organisation’s breach of the PDPA.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n18.\n\nIn this connection, the Commission’s Guide to Developing a Data Management\n\nProgramme (the “Guide”) states that an organisation should establish a personal data asset\ninventory as part of Data Protection Impact Assessment (“DPIA”), and sets out the information\nthat should be recorded by the organisation at pages 13 and 23:\n“By conducting a DPIA, an organisation would be in a better position to assess if the\nhandling of personal data complies with the PDPA or data protection best practices,\nand to implement appropriate policy, technical or process measures. For more\n\nPage 9 of 22\n\n\finformation on the DPIA, please refer to the Guide to Data Protection Impact\nAssessments.\n\nAs part of a DPIA, it is recommended to establish a data inventory (see Data\nInventory Maps, Data Flow Diagrams and Other Registers on page 23) and classify the\nrisk level of the data in the context that it is collected, used and disclosed\nthroughout the data life cycle, from creation, distribution, storage, to disposal.\nThis may be mapped onto a risk matrix for assessment and implementation of\nappropriate control for the identified risk levels.\n\n...\nData Inventory Maps, Data Flow Diagrams and Other Registers\n\nKnown risks should be managed through a good understanding of the life cycle and\nflow of personal data in your organisation. This can be done through documenting the\npersonal data handled using diagrams and charts such as data inventory maps or data\nflow diagrams, as illustrated in Annex C.\n\nThe data inventory map and data flow diagram should also include information\non the business purposes for collection, use and disclosure of personal data, the\nindividuals and third parties who handle personal data under the organisation’s\npossession or control, as well as the classification of the data to manage user access.\nThey should also deal with when and how the organisation should dispose of or\nanonymise the personal data for long-term archival. As good practice, it is important\nthat employees and third parties access personal data on a need-to-know basis. Different\nsets of data may be accessed by different parties.”\n(emphasis added)\n\nPage 10 of 22\n\n\f19.\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation’s oversight in failing to maintain the Affected\n\nDatabase in its personal data asset inventory resulted in the omission to extend its extant\nsecurity arrangements to the Affected Database. This resulted in the following:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation did not maintain proper records of the Affected Database and was\nunable to locate documentation related to user permission for the Affected Database.\nThere was a dearth of records of the details of the data lifecycle of the personal data in\nthe Affected Database from collection to disposal.\n\n(b)\n\nAfter the re-development and migration of the Organisation’s online platform, the\nOrganisation did not conduct a proper handover of the Affected Database despite the\nturnover in staff. This led to the Organisation’s engineering team in 2020 having no\nknowledge of the existence of the Affected Database or its access credentials.\n\n(c)\n\nSince the Organisation lacked visibility of the Affected Database, it was omitted from\nthe Organisation’s periodic security review. The Organisation thus did not have the\nopportunity to assess whether the Affected Database needed to be retained, or whether\nits security arrangements should be updated. During the Commission’s investigations,\nthe Organisation indicated that the Affected Database should not have been retained\nfollowing the successful migration of the Organisation’s online platform in 2018. It\nstands to reason that if the Organisation had covered the Affected Database in its\nperiodic security reviews and assessed that it should be deleted, the Incident could have\nbeen prevented.\n\n(d)\n\nSince the Affected Database was effectively forgotten about, the Organisation also did\nnot put in place any systems to monitor the exfiltration of data from the Affected\nDatabase, thus impeding its ability to react swiftly to mitigate the effects of the Incident.\nPage 11 of 22\n\n\f20.\n\nThe Organisation’s negligence in this regard left an internet-accessible database\n\ncontaining the personal data of approximately 2.76 million individuals (i.e. the Affected\nDatabase) outside its data protection architecture, creating a clear vulnerability that was\nexploited by threat actors.\n\n21.\n\nThe Organisation’s poor knowledge management often led to it providing inconsistent,\n\nextraneous and dilatory responses to the Commission’s notices to produce specified\ninformation and documents (“NTPs”) relating to the Organisation’s access models, causing the\nCommission to expend substantial time and resources to seek various rounds of clarifications\nwith the Organisation. This includes, but is not limited to, the following responses to the\nCommission’s NTPs:\n\n(a)\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Organisation stated that the Affected Database was only\naccessible through VPN via certificates. After the Commission sought further\nclarifications, the Organisation stated on 14 December 2020 that it was in fact not\nincluded in the Organisation’s VPN structure;\n\n(b)\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Organisation stated that only 14 users had VPN access, but\nsubsequently stated on 14 December 2020 that a total of 29 users with access without\nVPN; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation also gave conflicting information about its password policies\nregarding the Affected Database. On 16 November 2020, it purported to have put in\nplace a password policy for the Affected Database prior to the Incident. However, on\n10 February 2021, it indicated that no specifically predefined password rules applied to\nthe Affected Database. On 4 March 2021, after further clarifications were sought, the\nOrganisation stated that it no longer had the username and password for the Affected\n\nPage 12 of 22\n\n\fDatabase, and that nobody from its engineering team had any knowledge of the\nusername and password.\nOther lapses in the Organisation’s data protection policies and processes\n22.\n\nBesides failing to adequately maintain its personal data asset inventory, investigations\n\nalso revealed other lapses and shortcomings in the Organisation’s data protection policies and\nprocesses. As referenced in paragraph 18, the Guide states that by establishing a personal data\nasset inventory as part of an organisation’s DPIA, it would be better positioned to assess if the\nhandling of personal data complies with the PDPA or data protection best practices, and to\nimplement appropriate policy, technical or process measures. In this regard, aside from its\nlapses in its management of its personal data asset inventory, the Organisation also did not\nimplement some other basic data protection processes.\n\n23.\n\nFirst, organisations that have a high volume of personal data within their possession\n\nand / or control should implement sufficiently robust processes to protect personal data through\nreasonable security monitoring. This ensures that organisations have sufficient situational\nawareness of its network security, enabling it to react timeously to data breaches. This step is\nembedded into the responsibilities of a data protection officer, as stated in the Advisory at\n[21.4]:\n“An organisation’s DPO plays an essential role in how the organisation meets its\nobligations under the PDPA. The responsibilities of the DPO often include working\nwith senior management and the organisation’s business units to develop and\nimplement appropriate data protection policies and practices for the organisation. In\naddition, the DPO would undertake a wide range of activities, which may include\nproducing (or guiding the production of) a personal data inventory, conducting data\nprotection impact assessments, monitoring and reporting data protection risks,\nPage 13 of 22\n\n\fproviding internal training on data protection compliance, engaging with stakeholders\non data protection matters and generally acting as the primary internal expert on data\nprotection.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n24.\n\nExamples of such security monitoring measures are provided in the Commission’s\n\nGuide to Securing Personal Data in Electronic Medium at [4.1(j)] and [9.1] applicable at the\nmaterial time2:\n“Conduct periodic checks for personal data stored in ICT systems. For personal\ndata that is not required in any form anymore, securely dispose the data (refer to\nsection 8). If there is a need to retain the data but not in identifiable form, e.g. for\nperforming data analytics, consider anonymising the data.\n….\nComputer networks allow communication between computers and devices that are\nconnected to them. Internal corporate computer networks may be connected to external\nnetworks, such as the Internet. It is important for an organisation to ensure that its\ncorporate computer networks are secure. Vulnerabilities in the network may allow\ncyber intrusion, which may lead to theft or unauthorised use of electronic personal data.\nDefences that may be used to improve the security of networks include:\n•\n\nIntrusion prevention systems (“IPS”) - a device or software application that\nmonitors network or system activities and prevents malicious activities or\npolicy violations;\n\n2\n\nThe guide has been replaced by the Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems (updated 14\nSeptember 2021), which recommends similar security monitoring measures at pages 10 and 17.\nPage 14 of 22\n\n\f•\n\nIntrusion detection systems (“IDS”) – a network security appliance that monitors\nnetwork and system activities for malicious activities and may raise alerts upon\ndetecting unusual activities;\n\n•\n\nSecurity devices that prevent the unauthorised transfer of data out from a computer\nor network;\n\n•\n\nFirewalls; and\n\n•\n\nWeb proxies, anti-virus and anti-spyware software.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n25.\n\nIn this case, the high volume of personal data in the Affected Database necessitated a\n\nhigher level of security awareness through robust security monitoring. However, the\nOrganisation’s monitoring system extended only to performance and latency monitoring. The\nOrganisation did not implement security monitoring for exfiltration of sizeable volumes of data\nbased on pre-set limits. Given the considerable volume of personal data in the Organisation’s\npossession and / or control, including the personal data of the approximately 2.76 million\nindividuals contained in the Affected Database, this is a reasonable security arrangement that\nthe Organisation should have implemented.\n\n26.\n\nSecond, given the volume of personal data under the Organisation’s possession and /\n\nor control, the Organisation also should carry out periodic security audits which should include\na reasonable vulnerability assessment of its IT infrastructure. This would entail the discovery\nand mapping of all parts of the Organisation’s network, including the Affected Database. If\nthis had been carried out, it might have led to the re-discovery of the Affected Database, which\nwould have allowed the Organisation to take the necessary steps to either improve the security\nof the Affected Database or delete it entirely. However, based on the Commission’s\n\nPage 15 of 22\n\n\finvestigations, the Organisation conducted no such security audits in relation to the Affected\nDatabase.\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n27.\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation under\n\nsection 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\nconsidered, with particular emphasis on the following factors:\n\nMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had implemented the remedial measures set out in paragraph\n10 swiftly to address the Incident.\n\nAggravating Factors\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation was grossly negligent in its failure to keep proper records or\ndocumentation of the Affected Database and to effect a proper handover to new\nemployees vis-à-vis the Affected Database. Most egregiously, there was no\ninstitutional memory amongst the Organisation’s employees of the Affected\nDatabase by late 2020, or of the access credentials.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation had left the Affected Database exposed to a risk of\nunauthorised access and exfiltration for a protracted period of time, from\nOctober 2018 to late 2020.\n\n(d)\n\nAs stated in paragraph [21], the Organisation’s dilatory responses to the\nCommission’s NTPs resulted in delays in the investigations.\n\nPage 16 of 22\n\n\f28.\n\nAdditionally, the Organisation also impeded the Commission’s investigations by\n\nresponding in an uncooperative and evasive manner to the Commission’s NTPs:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation objected to the Commission’s request for information about the\naccess models implemented for current production databases, giving the excuse that it\nmight create “additional security risks”; and\n\n(b)\n\nSimilarly, objecting to provide information regarding access to the Affected Database,\nciting the reason that this was against their policy and might create “additional security\nrisks” even though the Affected Database had already been deleted on 3 November\n2020.\n\n29.\n\nOrganisations that are uncooperative and that throw up objections will only prolong\n\ninvestigations. The Commission will not be deterred by such tactics. If, as is possible in this\ncase, the Organisation did not have the information or needed more time to recover the\ninformation, honesty is the best policy. Hiding behind vague notions like “additional security\nrisks” without providing details can and will be interpreted as cavalier and obstructive, and will\nbe taken as an aggravating factor when the eventual outcome is determined.\n\n30.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Commission made a preliminary decision to impose a\n\nfinancial penalty on the Organisation for its breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\n31.\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s\n\nletter dated 26 November 2021 and was invited to make representations. On 10 December\n2021, the Organisation made the following representations to the Commission urging the\nCommission to impose a warning in lieu of a financial penalty, or to reduce the financial\npenalty to be imposed:\nPage 17 of 22\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Organisation had not intended to frustrate the Commission’s investigation.\n\nInstead, the Organisation’s internal investigations and responses to the Commission’s\nNTPs were hampered due to diminished corporate knowledge of the Affected Database\nat the material time and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its management and\noperations. In support, the Organisation stated that:\ni. On July 2018, the Organisation’s former Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”)\nresigned, with the various back-end engineers that he recruited following suit.\nConsequently, the new CTO and team of back-end engineers lacked corporate\nmemory and had no knowledge of the Affected Database;\nii. The internal investigations on the Incident were hampered by turbulence in the\nCompany's organisation during the Covid-19 pandemic, and despite the steps\ntaken to maintain system documentation, the Affected Database was not\nuncovered; and\niii. The conduct cited in [21] and [28] above stemmed from a misunderstanding of\nthe Commission’s queries and the new CTO, being from a different cultural\nbackground, being reluctant to provide sensitive data to the Commission;\n(b)\n\nThe contemplated financial penalty in the preliminary decision would be\n\ncrushing on the Organisation and would likely lead to financial distress and the closure\nof its business. As the Organisation operates in the food and beverages industry, its\nbusiness suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic and left it in a risky financial position\nfrom which is it has yet to recover from. Any financial penalty imposed would\nadversely affect the Organisation’s business, and deter any further investors or lenders\nfrom providing any further loans or investments to the Organisation; and\n\nPage 18 of 22\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe impact of the Incident was limited. The Organisation raised the following\n\npoints in support:\ni. The Organisation did not collect NRIC numbers, birth dates and sensitive\nfinancial data such as credit card information. The login passwords that were\ncollected were encrypted using MD5 Hash ;\nii. As of 10 December 2021, the Company received less than 100 requests from\nusers to delete their accounts following the Incident; and\niii. The online forum post initially offering personal data from the Affected\nDatabase for sale appears to have been taken down as of 13 November 2020.\nDiminished corporate knowledge and conduct during the Commission’s investigations\n\n32.\n\nThe Organisation’s representations in [31(a)] do not merit a waiver or reduction in the\n\nfinancial penalty imposed. Staff turnover is no excuse for a lack of corporate knowledge, and\nit is incumbent on organisations to take reasonable steps to bolster institutional memory to\nmanage any security risks arising thereof. This includes the implementation of practices such\nas the maintenance of a personal data asset inventory as detailed in [16] to [18], which would\nhave enabled it to conduct proper handovers to new staff.\n\n33.\n\nAs for the difficulties experienced by the Organisation during its own internal\n\ninvestigations and any misunderstandings it may have had in relation to the Commission’s\nNTPs, it should have been candid with the Commission about its difficulties and sought\nclarifications and extensions of time to respond to the NTPs. Instead, its lack of transparency\nduring the investigation stage caused the Commission to expend substantial time and resources\nin engaging the Organisation. In its representations, the Organisation has also admitted that it\n\nPage 19 of 22\n\n\fshould have substantiated its position during the NTP stage to avoid giving the Commission\nthe impression that it was being uncooperative and evasive.\n\nLikely impact of a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\n34.\n\nOne of the considerations in the imposition of a financial penalty is the likely impact of\n\nthe imposition of such penalty on an organisation, including the ability of the organisation to\ncontinue its usual activities: see section 48J(6)(i). When determining the appropriate financial\npenalty, the Commission has consistently considered the financial circumstances of the\norganisation or person involved, bearing in mind that financial penalties imposed should avoid\nimposing a crushing burden or cause undue hardship on the organisation or person3.\n\n35.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Commission accepts the Organisation’s representation\n\nat [31(b)] that the imposition of the financial penalty proposed would likely lead to financial\ndistress and the closure of its business. However, a mere warning is inappropriate in view of\nthe egregiousness of the Organisation’s breach of the PDPA and the impact of the Incident.\nHence, the imposition of a reduced financial penalty, to be paid out in instalments, would be\nmore proportionate and appropriate in ensuring the Organisation’s compliance with the PDPA.\n\n36.\n\nIn arriving at its decision, the Commission had regard for the following factors\n\nconcerning the Organisation’s financial situation, and the likely impact that the proposed\nfinancial penalty in the preliminary decision would have on it:\n(a)\n\nIn the Organisation’s audited financial statements for the financial year ending\n\n31 December 2020, its independent auditor stated that there was significant doubt on\n\n3\n\nRe Jigyasa [2021] SGPDPCR 1; Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11; and Neo Yong Xiang (trading as\nYoshi Mobile) [2021 SGPDPC 12\nPage 20 of 22\n\n\fthe ability of the Organisation to continue as a going concern and to realise its assets\nand discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of business;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation’s monthly income statements from 2021 indicated that it was\n\nincurring heavy net losses on a month-to-month basis (with the exception of one\nmonth); and\n(c)\n\n37.\n\nThe Organisation had various substantial short-term loans due in the near future.\n\nThe above evinces a clear picture of an organisation in a parlous financial situation\n\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with various debts and liability (some incurred to keep\nthe business afloat) coming due in the near future. In view of this situation, the Commission\nshall refrain from imposing a financial penalty that might push the Organisation’s business\neven closer to the brink.\n\nImpact of the Incident\n\n38.\n\nThe Commission had already taken into account the impact of the Incident when\n\ncalibrating the financial penalty in the preliminary decision. At the same time, the Commission\nalso took into consideration the fact that the Affected Database contained the personal data of\na very high number (2.76 million) of individuals, which necessitated the implementation of\nmore robust security measures by the Organisation. The impact of the Incident should not be\nminimised, and the financial penalty imposed should reflect this.\n\nAcceptance of the Commission’s findings\n\n39.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission notes that the Organisation voluntarily accepted the\n\nCommission’s findings in the preliminary decision that it had failed to comply with the\nProtection Obligation and explicitly indicated that it would not seek to challenge these findings.\nPage 21 of 22\n\n\fThe Organisation’s voluntary acceptance of liability (even at this late stage) ought to be\nreflected in the financial penalty. Had the Organisation accepted responsibility for the Incident\nat an earlier stage of the investigation, it could have significantly shortened the time for\ninvestigations and resolution of this case through the expedited breach procedure and also\nbenefited from greater mitigatory considerations. Nonetheless, an organisation that voluntarily\naccepts responsibility for its non-compliance with the PDPA should be recognised as an\norganisation that demonstrates its commitment to the Accountability Obligation and shows that\nit can be responsible for the personal data in its possession or under its control4: see [46] of\nFarrer Park Hospital Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 6.\n\n40.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case including the representations\n\nmade by the Organisation, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of $62,400 in 12 monthly instalments by the due dates as set out in the notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n41.\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no further\n\ndirections need be issued to the Organisation\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n4 Refer to section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 22 of 22\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to CPR Vision Management Pte Ltd to conduct a security audit of its technical and administrative arrangements for the protection of personal data in its possession or control and rectify any security gaps identified in the audit report.

The Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received data\nbreach notification reports from (i) L’Oreal Singapore Pte Ltd (“L’Oreal”) on 29\nOctober 2021 and (ii) L’Occitane Singapore Pte Ltd (“L’Occitane”) on 1 November\n2021 respectively of a ransomware attack on their customer relationship\nmanagement (“CRM”) system vendor, CPR Vision Management Pte Ltd (the\n“Organisation”). The Organisation is a data intermediary that helped to process\npersonal data collected by L’Oreal and L’Occitane.\n\n2. The ransomware attack affected a server and three network attached storage\n(“NAS”) devices in the Organisation’s office (“office network”), and led to the\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\fencryption of the personal data belonging to 83,640 L’Occitane’s customers and\n35,079 L’Oreal’s customers, which included their name, address, email address,\nmobile number, NRIC number, date of birth, age, gender, race, nationality, loyalty\npoints and amount spent.\n\n3. The Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. It also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24\nand the Retention Limitation Obligation under Section 25 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act (the “PDPA”).\n\n4. The Organisation’s internal investigations found the threat actor had first gained\naccess to the office network via a compromised user account VPN connection on\n13 October 2021 before executing the ransomware attack on or about 15 October\n2021. However, due to the limited data logs available on the Organisation’s\nFortiGate firewall and VPN appliance, the Organisation was not able to determine\nhow the threat actor gained access to the compromised user account VPN. As part\nof the immediate remediation efforts, the Organisation reset the credentials of the\ncompromised user account VPN and the password credentials of all VPN accounts\nacross the Organisation.\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\f5. The Organisation admitted that its endpoint security solution would have been able\nto detect and block the unauthorised entry attempts to the office network affected\nin the Incident. However, the Organisation failed to extend the deployment of this\nprotection solution to the affected office network. This could have been because\nthe domain controller server within the affected office network had been earmarked\nto be decommissioned after the data was copied to MS365 Sharepoint. Another\nreason for the omission may have been the fact that the Organisation set up the\naffected office network for business continuity purposes, when it shifted to its new\npremises, sometime between 6 – 9 April 2020, on the eve of the nation-wide\nCOVID-19 circuit breaker in Singapore.\n\n6. The Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection Obligation as it\nfailed to have reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal\ndata in its possession and control. As a CRM system vendor, the Organisation\nprocesses and processed a high volume of web traffic containing personal data on\nbehalf of many e-commerce retailers, including L’Oreal and L’Occitane, and would\nordinarily be held to a higher standard. The Organisation’s omission to deploy its\nendpoint security solution to the affected office network suggests that the\nOrganisation failed to maintain an inventory of its data assets.\n\n7. Even if there were extenuating circumstances in April 2020 which could have partly\nexcused the Organisation’s omission to include the affected office network in its\ndata inventory, it was inexcusable for the Organisation to let this state of affairs\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\fpersist for more than one and-a-half years, from April 2020 until October 2021. We\nshould add however, that as part of its remediation efforts, the Organisation has\nsince ensured that its endpoint security solution was deployed to all office and enduser devices.\n\n8. The Organisation also admitted to being in breach of the Retention Limitation\nObligation. The Organisation admitted that the affected personal data in the\nIncident had been legacy content, which should have been deleted together with\nthe domain controller server earmarked for decommissioning, and for which no\nbusiness or legal purpose existed for retention. The Organisation highlighted\nhowever, that this lapse was not in accordance with its own data retention policy.\nHad the Organisation complied with the Retention Limitation Obligation and\ndeleted the personal data in question, the Incident would not have amounted to a\nbreach of the Retention Limitation Obligation under the PDPA.\n9. In the course of our investigations, L’Oreal furnished documentary evidence which\nshowed that L’Oreal had specifically instructed the Organisation, pursuant to its\ndata retention policies, to delete the affected personal data on 26 March 2021. This\nwas duly acknowledged by the Organisation, and the Organisation furnished a\npurported Certificate of Destruction dated 17 May 2021 stating that the personal\ndata had been deleted on 6 May 2021.\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\f10. Similarly, L’Occitane also raised its concerns that the Organisation failed to seek\nits prior written consent before duplicating the personal data to other nonproduction environments.\n11. The Commission is satisfied that neither L’Oreal nor L’Occitane had any knowledge\nof the retention and storage of the legacy personal data by the Organisation on the\naffected NAS device; and neither had any control over the NAS device used by the\nOrganisation to store the personal data affected by the ransomware attack. Both\nL’Oreal and L’Occitane had also adequately provided in their contracts with the\nOrganisation to ensure compliance with the Protection and Retention Limitation\nObligations under the PDPA. The Commission is therefore of the view that despite\nthe personal data breach incident, L’Oreal and L’Occitane had acted consistently\nwith and complied with the relevant obligations under the PDPA.\n12. Having considered the circumstances set out above, including the Organisation’s\nupfront admission of liability, and the fact that data analysis conducted by the data\nsecurity team of the Organisation’s parent company did not uncover any evidence\nto suggest that data exfiltration or modification had occurred, the Commission\nconsidered that it would be most appropriate in lieu of imposing a financial penalty,\nto direct the Organisation to comply with the following action:\na. Conduct a thorough security audit (with report) of its technical and\nadministrative arrangements for the protection of personal data in its possession\nor control;\nb. Rectify any security gaps identified in the security audit report;\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\fc. Conduct a comprehensive review of all of the Organisation’s databases\ncontaining personal data to ensure full compliance with the Retention Limitation\nObligation under Section 25 PDPA;\nd. Review and update the personal data policies of the Organisation as applicable,\nincluding clarification of the roles of data intermediaries and vendors in complying\nwith the Retention Limitation Obligation under section 25 of the PDPA, within 60\ndays from the date the security audit report is delivered to the Organisation; and\ne. Inform the Commission within 1 week of the completion of the steps directed\nabove.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal or similar risks\nand;\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\nRetention of personal data\n25. An organisation must cease to retain its documents containing persona data, or remove the means\nby which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to\nassume that –\n(a) the purpose for which the personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the\npersonal data; and\n(b) retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.\nPage 6 of 6\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"RedMart had failed to obtain consent and inform its suppliers of the purpose for collecting images of the physical NRICs and other identification documents.

The Warehouses were regularly\nvisited by suppliers delivering goods and produce (“Visitors”), and the Organisation\nimplemented measures to regulate such Visitors’ access to the Warehouses. Security\ncheckpoints at the Warehouses used an Organisation-issued tablet computer\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\f(“Tablet”) to take photographs of Visitors’ NRIC or other identification documents (“ID\nPhotographs”). The Organisation said it collected ID Photographs to Visitors seeking\naccess to areas where food safety risks had to be managed. The Organisation\nexplained that these measures are intended to deter acts that could compromise food\nsafety and facilitate investigations of food safety incidents.\n\n3\n\nPrior to the Incident, there were no notices at the Warehouses’ security\n\ncheckpoints informing Visitors of the purpose for collection of ID Photographs. After\nbeing notified by the Commission of the Incident, the Organisation put up notices at\nthe Warehouses’ security checkpoints to inform Visitors of the purpose of collection of\nID Photographs.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n4\n\nConsidering that the Tablets remained in the possession of the Organisation’s\n\nsecurity team at all times, and that there was no evidence of misuse of the ID\nPhotographs collected, the impact of the Incident was limited. Having collected the ID\nPhotographs, the Organisation is obliged to protect these and associated personal\ndata to a standard commensurate to the risks that unauthorised access, use or\ndisclosure might pose to respective individuals. The nub of the issue in this case is the\nlegal basis upon which these ID Photographs were collected. The Organisation could\nhave relied on two possible grounds.\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\f5\n\nFirst, Visitors may have volunteered their IDs to be photographed on request.\n\nHowever, the Organisation’s failure to inform Visitors of the purpose for collecting the\nID Photographs was contrary to sections 14(1)(a) and 18(b) of the PDPA read with\nsection 20. Further, the collection of a photographic image of their IDs was a condition\nfor entry. Visitors enter the Warehouses to make deliveries as part of their employment\nor business. It is not a product or service that they chose to access, as contemplated\nby section 14(2)(a) of the PDPA. Hence, even if the requirement of notification of\npurpose had been met, this is not a situation where persons making deliveries as part\nof their employment or business could be said to have consented to allowing a\nphotographic image of the IDs to be taken as a condition for a product or service\nprovided by the Organisation which such persons wanted access to. Consent is not\nthe most appropriate basis for collection and use of the ID Photographs. Accordingly,\nthe Organisation did not obtain valid consent from the Visitors for collecting the ID\nPhotographs, and would have breached section 13 of the PDPA if this ground was\nrelied on.\n\n6\n\nThere was an alternate ground available to the Organisation. The purpose of\n\npublic food hygiene and safety, cited by the Organisation in the present case, is a\nlegitimate interest of the Organisation, and also of its business partners and ultimately,\nconsumers. Ensuring good public hygiene and safety benefits all downstream food\nand beverage businesses, supermarkets and diners who eventually consume food\nthat was stored in the Warehouses. The Organisation may therefore rely on the\nexception at Paragraph 1, Part 3 of the First Schedule of the PDPA (“Legitimate\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\fInterests Exception”) to collect the ID Photographs without Visitors’ consent. The\nLegitimate Interests Exception was introduced in the PDPA effective 1 February 2021,\nand could have been invoked by the Organisation any time after this date.\n\n7\n\nTo rely on the Legitimate Interests Exception, prior to collecting the ID\n\nPhotographs, the Organisation would have had to conduct and document an\nassessment determining whether the Organisation’s interests in collecting the ID\nPhotographs outweighed the adverse effect to Visitors. For any adverse effects\nidentified, the Organisation would have had to implement reasonable measures to\neliminate, mitigate or reduce the likelihood of occurrence. The Organisation would also\nhave had to provide Visitors with reasonable access to information about the\nOrganisation’s collection of the ID Photographs, which could have been done by way\nof disclosure in the Organisation’s public data protection policy.\n\n8\n\nThe Commission accepts that the Organisation implemented access controls to\n\nregulate how the ID Photographs were collected and stored, which in turn reduced the\nrisk of misuse of the ID Photographs. Notwithstanding, based on the reasons provided\nby the Organisation, the collection had been solely or primarily to deter acts that could\ncompromise food safety and facilitate investigations into food safety incidents. The\ncollected ID Photographs contained full NRIC / ID numbers together with other\npersonal information that, in combination, had identified Visitors to a high degree of\nfidelity. The Commission noted that the collection of ID Photographs or full NRIC\nnumbers had not been required by law in this case, and it is incumbent on the\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\fOrganisation to justify why the collection of ID Photographs had been a reasonable\npractice in these circumstances.\n\nThe Commission’s Preliminary Decision\n\n9\n\nIn view of the above, bearing in mind that the Organisation had taken some steps\n\nto remediate the Incident, the Commission’s preliminary decision was to give the\nfollowing directions to the Organisation:\n\n(a)\n\nTo within 60 days of this decision, conduct and document an assessment to:\n\n(i)\n\nevaluate whether the collection of ID Photographs from Visitors is\nreasonably necessary for the Organisation’s interests in deterring and\ninvestigating security incidents at the Warehouses.\n\n(ii)\n\nIf the Organisation intends to rely on the Legitimate Interests Exception for\nsuch collection, to:\n\n(A)\n\nidentify whether the Organisation’s collection of ID Photographs (or\nother personal data) from Visitors is likely to have an adverse effect\non Visitors;\n\n(B)\n\nidentify reasonable measures that could be implemented to eliminate,\nmitigate, or reduce the likelihood of such adverse effects occurring;\nand\n\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\f(C) determine whether the Organisation’s interest in collecting the ID\nPhotographs (or other personal data) outweighs the adverse effect to\nVisitors (if any) after the above measures are implemented.\n\n(iii)\n\nIf the Organisation does not intend to rely on the Legitimate Interests\nException, to identify the basis under which the Organisation intends to\ncollect the ID Photos (or other personal data) from Visitors, and to\nimplement the necessary policies and processes for such collection to be\nin compliance with the PDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nTo provide the Commission with a copy of the Organisation’s above assessment\nwithin 14 days of its completion.\n\nThe Organisation’s Representations\n\n10\n\nThe Commission’s preliminary decision was communicated to the Organisation\n\non 8 July 2022. On 22 July 2022, the Commission received representations from the\nOrganisation in respect of the preliminary decision. The Organisation claimed that it\nhad complied with the PDPA when collecting ID Photographs from Visitors, on the\nfollowing bases:\n\n(a)\n\nIt was in the national interest to collect ID Photographs in order to establish the\nidentities of Visitors to a high fidelity and deter potential food security incidents\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\fat the Warehouses, an exception to the obligation to obtain consent pursuant to\nParagraph 2, Part 2 of First Schedule to the PDPA (“National Interest\nException”);\n(b)\n\nThe collection of ID Photographs was necessary to facilitate investigations into\nfood security incidents at the Warehouses, an exception to the obligation to\nobtain consent pursuant to Paragraph 3, Part 3 of First Schedule to the PDPA\n(“Investigations Exception”); and/or\n\n(c)\n\nThere was deemed consent from Visitors for collection of the ID Photographs, as\nthese were volunteered, and collected for the reasonable purposes as part of\nefforts to ensure food security (pursuant to section 15 of the PDPA).\n\n11\n\nThe Organisation’s representations are not accepted:\n\n(a)\n\nThe National Interest Exception does not apply. The Organisation’s food security\nconcerns, while valid, are limited to its own Warehouses and are not at the level\nof the “national defence or “national security” concerns contemplated by the\ndefinition of “national interest” at section 2 of the PDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Investigations Exception does not apply. In order to rely on the Investigations\nException, the collection of personal data must be for the purpose of an ongoing\ninvestigation and cannot be for a hypothetical future investigation.\n\n(c)\n\nThere was no deemed consent from Visitors for the Organisation’s collection of\nthe ID Photographs. Visitors were not given a choice in the matter and cannot be\nsaid to have voluntarily provided their IDs as contemplated under section 15(1)\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\fof the PDPA. Further, it would not have been obvious to Visitors that fact that\nphotographic images of IDs would be taken and then stored.\n\n12\n\nInsofar as collection and use of ID Photographs from Visitors prior to 8 July 2022\n\nhad been on the bases cited by the Organisation above, the Commission finds that\nthe Organisation had not been in compliance with the PDPA.\n\nReliance on Legitimate Interests Exception\n\n13\n\nHowever, the Organisation also informed the Commission of its intention to rely\n\non the Legitimate Interests Exception as the basis for such collection going forward.\nTogether with its representations, the Organisation provided the Commission with a\ncopy of an internal assessment it had carried out on 22 July 2022 for its reliance on\nthe Legitimate Interests Exception going forward (“LIE Assessment”).\n\n14\n\nIn the LIE Assessment, the Organisation identified that there was a need to\n\nestablish and/or verify the identities of Visitors to the Warehouses to a high degree of\nfidelity, when they were entering areas of the Warehouses containing dry food and\nfresh produce that were susceptible to contamination and tampering. Collection of ID\nPhotographs served the legitimate interests of deterring and investigating potential\nfood security incidents, which could cause harm to the public and damage to the\nOrganisation’s reputation.\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\f15\n\nThe Organisation identified that its collection of the ID Photographs exposed\n\nVisitors to the risks of unauthorised use and disclosure of their personal data, and\ndetailed the measures it had implemented to eliminate or mitigate these adverse\neffects. These included:\n\n(a)\n\nlimiting collection of ID Photographs to only Visitors accessing areas of the\nWarehouses with higher risk of food security incidents;\n\n(b)\n\nrestricting access to the Tablets;\n\n(c)\n\nrestricting the application used to collect ID Photographs on the Tablets to only\nwork when connected to a dedicated Wi-Fi network at the Warehouses;\n\n(d)\n\nimmediately uploading the collected ID Photographs to the Organisation’s\nbackend server (and not storing them locally on the Tablets);\n\n(e)\n\nlimiting access to the ID Photographs (on the backend server) to the\nOrganisation’s DevOps team, and only when such access was on-site at the\nOrganisation’s offices and connected to its internal network; and\n\n(f)\n\nretaining the ID Photographs for a maximum of one year.\n\n16\n\nThe Organisation assessed the benefit in collecting the ID Photographs to be\n\n“significant” considering the potential harm that could be caused to the public by a food\ncontamination incident. The Organisation also assessed that its implementation of the\nabove measures rendered the “adverse impact from users” to be “low”. The\nOrganisation confirmed that it would notify Visitors of its reliance on the Legitimate\nInterests Exception by way of notices posted at the relevant security posts.\n\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f17\n\nThe Commission accepts that the Organisation’s interest in deterring food\n\nsecurity incidents at the Warehouses is legitimate. The Commission also accepts that\nthere may be a legitimate interest served in implementing enhanced identification\nrequirements to regulate access to high risk areas, and that the collection of ID\nPhotographs promote this interest. Most importantly, the Commission recognises that\nthe risks of unauthorised access, use and/or disclosure of the ID Photographs have\nbeen significantly lowered on account of the enhanced access controls implemented\nby the Organisation to protect the ID Photographs.\n\nThe Commission’s Decision\n\n18\n\nFor the above reasons, the Commission is satisfied that the Organisation has\n\nmet the requirements for reliance on the Legitimate Interests Exception in this case.\nAs the Organisation has already complied with the proposed direction (contemplated\nat [9] above) by carrying out the LIE Assessment to the Commission’s satisfaction, it\nis no longer necessary for the direction to be issued.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"No further action"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Thomson Medical to conduct scan of the web to ensure no publication of affected personal data online and to include in the review of its application deployment process, measures such as the arrangements for security testing and the implementation of data retention policy.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1. On 26 October 2020, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was notified that the Thomson Medical Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) Health Declaration Portal was not secure, enabling public\naccess to the personal data of visitors (the “Incident”) stored in a CSV (comma\nseparated values) file.\n\n2. Visitor data collected on the Organisation’s Health Declaration Portal had been\nstored concurrently in a publicly-accessible CSV file as well as a secured\n1\n\n\fdatabase from 16 April 2020, when the health declaration portal was first used\nby the Organisation to 8 September 2020, when the storage of the visitor data\nwas changed to only the secured database instead of the CSV file. The CSV\nfile was hosted on the Organisation’s web server.\n\n3. The Organisation admitted that, contrary to the instructions given to the\nemployee to switch the data storage from the CSV file to secured database\nexclusively, and the organisation’s protocols, its in-house developer had\nomitted to remove a software code, causing the visitor data to be stored in the\nCSV file and the same in-house developer had omitted to change the default\nweb server configuration, thereby allowing public access to the hosted CSV file.\nThe switch to storage in a secured database would have ensured access\ncontrols by requiring user login ID and secure password protection, as well as\nencryption of data transfers using SSL certificates. The access controls would\nensure that only authorized users would be able to access the data.\n\n4. The Commission’s investigations revealed that the affected CSV file contained\nthe personal data of 44,679 of the Organisation’s visitors, including the date\nand time of visit, temperature, type of visitor (purpose of visit), name of visitor,\nname of newborn, contact number, NRIC/FIN/passport number, doctor/clinic\nname or room visiting, and answers to a health declaration questionnaire (which\nincluded a declaration by the visitor that he/she did not have any symptoms or\nrecent exposure to the Covid-19 virus).\n2\n\n\f5. The Organisation accepted that it was in breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder section 24 of the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). The\nCommission finds that the Organisation had breached section 24 of the PDPA\nfor two reasons.\n\n6. First, even though the Organisation’s existing policies required the visitor data\ncollected to be stored in a secured database, the Organisation failed to ensure\nthat there were processes in place to ensure these policies and instructions\nwould be complied with. The Organisation stated that the in-house developer\nhad been the only staff in its IT department familiar with the programming\nlanguage used for the health declaration form. This, however, should not have\nprevented the Organisation, as an example, from requiring the in-house\ndeveloper to demonstrate to another staff member, and for that staff member\nto verify that the storage instructions had been complied with. As noted in Re\nAviva Ltd [2017] SPDPC 14, relying solely on individual employees to perform\ntheir tasks diligently, with no oversight or supervision, is not a reasonable\nsecurity arrangement.\n\n7. Second, the Organisation failed to conduct reasonable pre-launch testing\nbefore the Health Declaration Portal went live. While acceptance testing and\nsome technical tests were conducted, there had been no security testing to\nverify that there were access controls to the visitor data collected.\n3\n\n\f8. Having said that, it is a mitigating fact that the Organisation’s in-house\ndeveloper sought to comply with the Organisation’s policies and swiftly rectified\nthe software code on 8 September 2020, when he first discovered the coding\nerror whilst updating the health declaration questionnaire.\n\n9. The forensic investigator engaged by the Organisation did not uncover any\nevidence that the disclosed data had been exported and posted online,\nincluding on the Dark Web. The Organisation’s server logs also revealed that\nthe CSV file was only accessed 4 times from 3 different local IP addresses.\nGiven the timing of the access instances, it is probable that these instances\nwere made by the complainant and by the Commission when investigating this\nmatter, which suggests that the impact of this Incident was limited.\n\n10. The Commission noted a parallel between the facts of this case and Re Spear\nSecurity Force Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 12, in that both cases arose from a\nsingle complaint about a potential breach of the PDPA, with no other evidence\nsuggesting that the personal data had actually been exposed to unauthorised\nthird parties due to the lapses by the Organisation.\n\n11. The personal data exposed here included the clinic or room that the individual\nintended to visit, and the reason for the visit. This could be to seek treatment,\naccompany a patient, or a business visit made by a sales representative of a\npharmaceutical or medical device company. While the personal data exposed\n4\n\n\fincluded some health-related information, this had essentially been health\ndeclaration information for the purpose of containment of the pandemic. The\ninformation did not in fact reveal any potentially sensitive information such as\nwhether the visitor was Covid-19 positive.1\n\n12. The personal data disclosed is also not on par with Re Singapore Health\nServices Pte. Ltd.& Ors. [2019] SGPDPC 3 (“Singhealth”). In the Singhealth\ncase, we recognised the sensitivity involved in the exposure of the affected\nindividuals’ personal data in their “clinical episode information, clinical\ndocumentation, patient diagnosis and health issues and Dispensed Medication\nRecords” as the information and personal data affected may allow one to\ndeduce the condition for which a patient had sought treatment, and may lead\nto the unintended disclosure of serious or socially embarrassing illnesses.2\nWhile there is some personal data in the present case which may reveal the\nclinic which an affected individual had sought treatment, this is of a much more\nlimited scope as compared to the Singhealth case.\n\n13. The Commission accepted that the Organisation took prompt remedial action\nto contain the exposure. This include removing the affected CSV file and\nchanging all the passwords to the database, even though it was not affected by\nthe Incident. To prevent a recurrence of a similar incident, the Organisation also\n\n1\n\nCf Re Terra Systems Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 7.\n\n2 See Re Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd.& Ors. [2019] SGPDPC 3, at [139].\n\n5\n\n\freviewed its application deployment process to take into consideration data\nsecurity, and rectified all potential gaps discovered during a vulnerability scan.\n\n14. Given the lack of evidence suggesting that personal data had actually been\nexposed to unauthorised third parties due to the lapses by the Organisation and\nthe limited impact of the Incident, the Commission considered that it would be\nmost appropriate in lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to impose directions.\n\n15. Another factor which prompted the Commission to impose directions in lieu of\na financial penalty was the fact that at the material time, such health declaration\ninformation was widely collected across the island. There was also a\ncorresponding acceptance and support from members of the public of the need\nfor the collection of such health declaration information in order for the relevant\nauthorities to effectively respond to and control the potential spread of COVID19.\n\n16. Given the above, the Commission directs the Organisation to carry out the\nfollowing within 60 days:\n\na. In relation to the Organisation’s remedial action of reviewing its\napplication deployment process to take into consideration data security,\ni. The Organisation shall ensure that the intended measures\ninclude arrangements for reasonable pre-launch security testing\n6\n\n\fto be conducted before the launch of any new website,\napplication, portal or other online feature for the processing of\npersonal data; and\nii. The Organisation shall ensure that the intended measures\ninclude the development and implementation of a data retention\npolicy to meet the Retention Limitation Obligation under section\n25 of the PDPA.\n\nb. In relation to the Organisation’s remedial action of scanning the Dark\nWeb for evidence of exfiltration of the personal data,\ni. The Organisation shall conduct a scan of the Clear/Surface Web,\nas well as a renewed scan of the Dark Web to confirm that there\nis no evidence of publication of the affected personal data online.\n\nc. By no later than 14 days after the above actions have been carried out,\nthe Organisation shall submit to the Commission a written update\nproviding details of the actions taken.\n\nThe following provision(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in\nthe above summary:\nProtection Obligation\n24(a) Failure to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n7\n\n\f(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal\nor similar risks\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"}]
