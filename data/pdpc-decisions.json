[{"description":"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (MARINA BAY SANDS PTE LTD) Decision The Personal Data Protection Commission (“PDPC”) has imposed a financial penalty of $315,000 on integrated resort operator Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd (“MBS”) for breaching the Protection Obligation under the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). The penalty was determined in accordance with the revised Financial Penalty framework introduced by the Personal Data Protection (Amendment) Bill 2021.  Incident In October 2023, 665,495 MBS patrons had their personal data illegally accessed and exfiltrated by unknown threat actor(s). The affected data, which included names and contact details that identified MBS’ patrons, was later found offered for sale on the dark web. Such data leaks can be further exploited in phishing scams or identity theft.  Cause MBS admitted to breaching the Protection Obligation by failing to take reasonable security measures to protect the personal data in its possession. This occurred during a large-scale software migration exercise in March 2023.   It was necessary for MBS to ensure that security policies (eg. who could access the data) were applied when migrating from the old software to the new. This meant that all related applications accessed through its Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) and respective identifiers, needed to be duly covered before and after the migration. However, one of the identifiers affecting the Art Science Friends webpage was omitted during the migration. As the webpage no longer had proper security policies in place, this allowed malicious threat actor(s) to access and exfiltrate its patrons’ personal data. Despite the clear risks involved in such a massive migration exercise, MBS had:  • made a single employee responsible; • for manually compiling the list of API configurations; • without due second layer checks.   MBS failed to discover and correct the omission for six months, leaving its’ patrons’ personal data unprotected. MBS’ failure to put in place proper processes to ensure the due implementation of its security policies post-migration was a negligent contravention of the Protection Obligation.  As a large enterprise with significant turnover in Singapore, it is clear that MBS had the required resources to protect their patrons’ personal data.   Enforcement Action From 1 October 2022, Parliament raised the maximum financial penalty for large organisations with annual turnovers in Singapore of more than S$10 million, to 10% of their annual turnovers. This change was aimed at achieving more effective deterrent enforcement, signalling the importance of data protection in the digital economy.  PDPC imposed a financial penalty on MBS which accounts for the scale of the data breach which exposed the personal data of more than half a million patrons without their consent. PDPC also took into account MBS’ voluntary admission of liability, and its implementation of immediate remediation measures including reactivating security measures for the website on the same day.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Arts, Entertainment and Recreation"],"date":"28 Oct 2025","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_mbs_28102025-(final)-v3.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Marina Bay Sands Pte Ltd","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2025/10/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-marina-bay-sands-pte-ltd","timestamp":"2025-10-28","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2025] SGPDPC 6\nCase No. DP-2310-C1622\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nMarina Bay Sands Pte.

Ltd.\n\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2310-C1622\n28 October 2025\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 25 October 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission\") received a notification from Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) about a data breach incident (the “Incident”) whereby a threat actor\nhad used the account credentials of six (6) existing Sands Rewards Lifestyle (“SRL”)\nmembers to access the customer records of approximately 665,495 SRL members\n(the “Affected Data”). Investigations later revealed that the Affected Data was\nexfiltrated and made available for sale online on the dark web.\n\n2\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether the\n\ncircumstances relating to the Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n3\n\nOn 6 May 2024, the Organisation requested for the investigation to proceed\n\nunder the Expedited Decision Procedure, which the Commission acceded to. To this\n\nPage 2 of 90\n\n\fend, the Organisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision, and to the Organisation’s breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation is an integrated resort which operates amongst other things,\n\na hotel, casino, shopping mall and the ArtScience Museum. The Organisation also\noffers, amongst others, the following two membership programmes:\n\n(a)\n\nSRL – enables members to earn points through spending on at various\nattractions operated by the Organisation, which can then be redeemed\nfor rewards such as discounts and vouchers.\n\n(b)\n\nArtScience Friends (“ASF”) – Existing SRL members that are visitors\nof the ArtScience Museum have the option to also join the ASF\nmembership programme to access additional benefits and privileges\nrelating to the ArtScience Museum such as priority entry and discounts\nat the ArtScience Museum’s retail stores.\n\nPage 3 of 90\n\n\fSecurity measures relating to SRL and ASF members’ data\n\n5\n\nAs part of the SRL and ASF membership programmes, the Organisation\n\ncollected the personal data of approximately 1.9 million individuals, including their\nnames, email addresses, phone numbers, countries of residence, membership\ninformation among other types of personal data.\n\n6\n\nTo balance the twin imperatives of protecting data relating to both SRL and ASF\n\nmembership programmes and creating a smooth customer experience for members,\nprior to the Incident, the Organisation enacted a policy of segregated and differentiated\naccess controls for different types of data:\n\n(a)\n\nMembers could access both the SRL and ASF webpages from the\nOrganisation’s website and ArtScience Museum website respectively,\nthrough a 4-digit Personal Identification Number (“PIN”), with the initial\nPIN set by default based on individual members’ birthdates. This is\nsubject to an automatic lockout in the event of 5 failed login attempts\nwithin a 24-hour window (the “Password Policy”). This allowed\nmembers to access basic identification, contact information and\nmembership tier.\n\nPage 4 of 90\n\n\f(b)\n\nTo obtain access to additional data such as “Account Information”,\n“Dollars History”, “Vehicle Registration” and “Transaction History”,\nmembers were required to complete an SMS or email one-time\npassword (“OTP”) verification with CAPTCHA. OTP verification is\nrequired for each user session.\n\n(c)\n\nTo ensure that members are only able to carry out activities related to\ntheir own accounts on the Organisation’s website, it also implemented\nan access token verification policy (“Token Verification Policy”), where\nan access token is generated for a 30-minute window after a user\nsuccessfully logged into one of its webpages. When a user made a\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (“HTTP”) request to the ASF web server to\naccess a part of the Organisation’s network, a token verification check\nwas carried out to authenticate that the request was related to the same\nuser ID as the access token. If the check was unsuccessful, users would\nnot be granted permission to carry out the requested activity.\n\n(d)\n\nTo earn and redeem loyalty points to benefit from the privileges of\nmembership, SRL / ASF members were required to be physically present\nat the Organisation’s property and to present their membership card.\n\nPage 5 of 90\n\n\f7\n\nPrior to the Incident, the Organisation also:\n\n(a)\n\nImplemented a set of data protection and security policies, guidelines,\nstandards and procedures, including the following:\ni.\n\nPersonal Data Protection Policy Manual;\n\nii.\n\nData Retention and Classification Policy;\n\niii.\n\nIT Acceptable Use Policy;\n\niv.\n\nInformation Security Program Policy;\n\nv.\n\nIT Software Asset Management Standard;\n\nvi.\n\nCyber Security Monitoring Standard;\n\nvii.\n\nEnterprise Cyber Incident Response Plan;\n\nviii.\n\nTactical Incident Response Plan;\n\nix.\n\nMalware Protection and Vulnerability Management Standard;\n\n(b)\n\nEmployed security monitoring tools;\n\n(c)\n\nPut in place a Security Operations Centre to monitor, prevent, detect and\nassist in investigating and responding to cyber threats;\n\n(d)\n\nPerformed regular software security patching;\n\nPage 6 of 90\n\n\f(e)\n\nCarried out regular vulnerability assessment scans, architecture\nreviews, threat risk assessments, code scans, code reviews and\npenetration testing;\n\n(f)\n\nConducted regular audits across IT systems to ensure the effectiveness\nof security controls;\n\n(g)\n\nObtained certifications for the ISO/IEC 270011 and the PCI DSS2\nstandards; and\n\n(h)\n\nConducted data protection and security training sessions amongst the\nOrganisation’s staff.\n\nThe Incident\n\n8\n\nFrom 19 to 20 October 2023, an unknown threat actor circumvented the\n\nOrganisation’s security arrangements to access and exfiltrate the Affected Data.\n\n1\n\nAn international standard to manage information security jointly published by the International\nOrganization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission.\n2 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.\n\nPage 7 of 90\n\n\fInitial Access to the Compromised Accounts\n\n9\n\nThe threat actor initially gained unauthorised access to six (6) ASF accounts\n\n(the “Compromised Accounts”) through “password spraying” whereby the same\npassword was used on many SRL and ASF accounts until access was obtained. By\nvirtue of the Password Policy, all the default SRL / ASF account passwords were 4digit PINs based on the birthdates of the individual members, which made the\npassword spray method effective.\n\n10\n\nThereafter, the threat actor used the 6 Compromised Accounts to make various\n\nsuccessful HTTP requests from the ASF webpage to access the personal data of other\nSRL members. This enabled the threat actor to use the Compromised Accounts as a\nspringboard to access the data of other SRL members identified at [18] below, which\nwas anomalous for two reasons:\n\n(a)\n\nAs explained in [6(a) to (c)], access to the Compromised Accounts\nshould have only allowed the threat actor to access the six individual\nmembers’ basic identification, contact information and membership tier,\nand not the personal data of other SRL members.\n\nPage 8 of 90\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe Token Verification Policy should have only allowed the\nCompromised Accounts to make HTTP requests relating to their own\nuser IDs, and not the user IDs of other SRL members.\n\nThe Misconfiguration Error\n\n11\n\nInvestigations\n\nrevealed\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nabove\n\nanomaly\n\nstemmed\n\nfrom\n\na\n\nmisconfiguration error during the Organisation’s migration to a new middleware\nsoftware platform3 between September 2022 and March 2023 (the “Migration\nExercise”). The Migration Exercise involved, amongst other things, the wholesale\nreplication of the Application Programming Interface (“API”) configurations previously\ncontained in the old middleware platform onto the new middleware platform (the “API\nReplication”). Significantly, the Organisation opted to effect the API Replication\nprocess manually.\n\n12\n\nThe employee in charge of the API Replication (“Employee”) was tasked to\n\nmanually collate a list of all the APIs and their respective calling app IDs 4 into an\ninventory list for the purpose of the API Replication (“Inventory Listing”). However,\n\n3 Middleware refers to the software that lies between an operating system and the applications running\n\nit, and functions as a hidden translation layer to enable communications and data management for\ndistributed applications.\n4 An identifier associated with a specific application that is used to, amongst other things, ensure that\nany calls or messages made by an application are legitimate and authorised.\n\nPage 9 of 90\n\n\fthe Employee inadvertently omitted the external ArtScienceMuseum calling app ID\nfrom the Inventory Listing. Consequently, as the Inventory Listing was subsequently\nutilised to configure the token check configuration in the new middleware platform, the\nToken Verification Policy did not apply to the ASF webpage (the “Misconfiguration\nError”).\n\nAccess and exfiltration of the Affected Data\n\n13\n\nThe Misconfiguration Error created an acute security vulnerability by enabling\n\nanyone accessing the ASF webpage with a valid access token to manipulate the\nparameters of the member ID (which was in a guessable numeric format) in the HTTP\nrequest to access the personal data of any other SRL members via a HTTP request.\n\n14\n\nThe threat actor exploited this vulnerability to gain unauthorised access to the\n\npersonal data of 665,495 SRL members (i.e. the Affected Data) comprising the\nfollowing categories of personal data:\nType of Personal Data\n\nNumber of Affected Individuals\n\nNames\n\n663,703\n\nEmail Addresses\n\n487,639\n\nPhone numbers\n\n663,703\n\nCountries of Residence\n\n496,393\n\nSRL membership numbers and\ntiers\n\n665,495\n\nPage 10 of 90\n\n\f15\n\nSubsequently, the Organisation confirmed to the Commission that the Affected\n\nData was put up for sale on the dark web, evidencing that the Affected Data was\nexfiltrated by the threat actor.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n16\n\nFollowing discovery of the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following\n\nremedial measures on the day itself, and within three months:\n\nActions to mitigate the effects of the Incident\n\n(a)\n\nDeactivated the Compromised Accounts;\n\n(b)\n\nEnabled the Token Verification Policy for the ASF webpage, and\nconducted penetration testing to verify that this was effective to deny\naccess token reuse on the ASF website;\n\n(c)\n\nInspected and validated all the rest of the Organisation’s webpages to\nensure that the Token Verification Policy was enabled;\n\n(d)\n\nNotified the affected individuals;\n\nPage 11 of 90\n\n\fActions to prevent recurrence of the Incident or similar incidents\n\n(e)\n\nEnhanced the Token Verification Policy to mandate and automate\napplication checks for all of the Organisation’s webpages;\n\n(f)\n\nEnhanced the Organisation’s software configuration testing process to\nrevalidate the Token Verification Policy for all of the Organisation’s\nwebpages prior to going live;\n\n(g)\n\nEnhanced security monitoring by developing and implementing a script\nto detect and alert access tokens used to request for multiple customer\nrecords;\n\n(h)\n\nSetting up digital accounts for all SRL members with different usernames\nand passwords (with a higher level of complexity) for members to access\ntheir membership via any digital platforms; and\n\n(i)\n\nRestricted the use of 4-digit pins with physical membership cards to only\non-premises transactions.\n\nPage 12 of 90\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation contravened the Protection Obligation under section 24 of\nthe PDPA\n\n17\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation focused on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the\n“Protection Obligation”). Given the high volume of personal data in the\nOrganisation’s possession, the Organisation is obligated to implement security\narrangements that were commensurate with its higher-level security needs to\ndischarge the Protection Obligation.\n\nMisconfiguration Error\n\n18\n\nThe Commission has consistently held that organisations cannot rely solely on\n\ntheir employees performing their duties properly as a security arrangement to protect\npersonal data, and that organisations must also put in place processes to ensure that\n\nPage 13 of 90\n\n\fany step(s) required from employees are properly taken5. Where the employees’\nactions may affect personal data of higher volumes and/or sensitivity, and where such\nactions involve a higher susceptibility to human error, more robust processes should\nbe implemented. The Commission had previously opined in its Guide to Data\nProtection Practices for ICT Systems (“ICT Guide”) that when implementing ICT\nsecurity measures, organisations should as a basic practice do the following:\n\n“Automate build and deployment processes to minimise manual steps\nand hence reduce human errors. For example, execute predefined scripts\ninstead of manually typing out commands each time a new build of an\napplication is required; this eliminates errors in typing and the possibility of\naccidentally leaving out certain commands, as well as in deploying the new\nbuild to the wrong environment, such as deploying a test build to the production\nenvironment.”\n(emphasis added)\n19\n\nIn the present case, the Migration Exercise exposed a large volume of personal\n\ndata in the Organisation’s possession to data protection risks. Additionally, the manual\nnature of the API Replication meant that more robust processes were required to\nmitigate the risks of human error. In this regard, the Commission highlighted in the ICT\n\n5 Re E-Commerce Enablers Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 6 at [17-18]. See also Re Furnituremart.sg [2017]\n\nat [21], Re DataPost Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 10 at [11] and Re Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [2830].\n\nPage 14 of 90\n\n\fGuide that processes such as automation are meant to address risks associated with\nhuman error, such as accidentally leaving out of certain commands when a new\napplication is being built and deployed.\n\n20\n\nInstead, the Organisation relied entirely on the Employee to carry out the API\n\nReplication manually. This design flaw heightened the susceptibility of the API\nReplication to human error, which eventuated in the form of the Misconfiguration Error.\nThis engendered a vulnerability in the Organisation’s system that was exploited by the\nthreat actor to access and exfiltrate the Affected Data.\n\n21\n\nIn relation to the Employee responsible for the Misconfiguration Error, the\n\nOrganisation submitted to the Commission that:\n\n(a)\n\nDue to the Employee’s expertise in middleware applications and\nconsistent high performance, the Organisation was confident of the\nEmployee’s ability to lead the Migration Exercise; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Employee had been required to participate in training on the new\nmiddleware platform and had been provided with the new middleware\nplatform’s installation document detailing the scripts to be executed as\npart of the Migration Exercise.\n\nPage 15 of 90\n\n\f22\n\nThese do not constitute reasonable security arrangements, as expertise per se\n\ndoes not render an employee infallible. The Organisation should not have placed all\nresponsibility on the Employee to carry out the API Replication properly, without any\naccompanying measures to address the risk of human errors, such as independent\nverification checks6 or automation of the API Replication process.\n\n23\n\nIn connection with the foregoing, the Organisation admitted that, by failing to\n\nput in place measures to prevent the Misconfiguration Error from arising, it had\ncontravened the Protection Obligation.\n\n24\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds that the Organisation negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements\nto mitigate the risk of human error when carrying out the API Replication.\n\nObservations on access control measures\n\n25\n\nGiven that the threat actor’s initial point of entry into the Organisation’s system\n\nwas through the Compromised Accounts, the Commission would make the following\nobservations about the Organisation’s access control measures. For the avoidance of\n\n6 See Re E-Commerce Enablers Pte. Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 6 at [16-18].\n\nPage 16 of 90\n\n\fdoubt, these observations are made solely to provide guidance, and (1) do not\nconstitute additional findings of breaches of the Protection Obligation by the\nOrganisation in this case; or (2) factor in any way in the Commission’s final decision\nin this case.\n\n26\n\nWhen developing access control measures to safeguard personal data,\n\nOrganisations are required to implement basic password requirements such as a\nminimum password length and complexity7. The Organisation’s Password Policy\nmandated that default SRL account passwords comprised of 4 digits based on the\nmember’s birthdate with no requirement for change on first use, which was a weak\npassword policy that made it relatively easy for threat actors to decipher and left the\nSRL accounts vulnerable to password spray attacks. At the same time, the\nCommission acknowledges that by using segregated and differentiated access\ncontrols for different types of data, the Organisation imposed stronger guardrails on\nmore sensitive data, thus limiting the impact of a breach of the SRL accounts to six\naccounts. But for the Misconfiguration Error, the threat actor would not have been able\nto access the bulk of the Affected Data even after accessing the Compromised\nAccounts.\n\n7 See ICT Guide.\n\nPage 17 of 90\n\n\f27\n\nThat said, it was not necessary for the Commission to make any breach findings\n\nin relation to the access control measures employed by the Organisation.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n28\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, and the amount of financial penalty imposed\n(if any), the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were considered.\n\nFactors considered by the Commission\n\n29\n\nIn terms of the nature, gravity and duration of the non-compliance by the\n\nOrganisation, the Organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation led to the\nunauthorised access and disclosure of personal data relating to 665,495 individuals,\nwhich was voluminous. The Commission further notes that the vulnerability\noccasioned by the Misconfiguration Error was present for at least 6 months (from\nMarch to October 2023), and that the Affected Data was exfiltrated and put up for sale\non the dark web.\n\n30\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\nPage 18 of 90\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Organisation had otherwise implemented adequate and appropriate\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession\nand/or under its control;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt actions after being alerted about the\nIncident to mitigate the effects of the Incident and to prevent a\nrecurrence;\n\n(c)\n\nInvestigations were handled under the Expedited Decision Procedure,\nunder which the Organisation admitted to the facts set out in this decision\nand to its contravention of the Protection Obligation; and\n\n(d)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations.\n\nThe Organisation’s Turnover\n\n31\n\nIn assessing what amount of financial penalty would be proportionate and\n\neffective to deter non-compliance with the PDPA, the Commission also took into\naccount the Organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore, based on the Organisation’s\naudited accounts.\n\nPage 19 of 90\n\n\f32\n\nEffective 1 October 2022, the maximum financial penalty imposable for\n\ncontraventions of any provision in Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA (the “Data Protection\nObligations”) by organisations whose annual turnover in Singapore exceeds $10\nmillion, has been raised from $1 million to 10% of an organisation’s annual turnover in\nSingapore8.\n\n33\n\nThis increase in the maximum imposable financial penalty evinces Parliament’s\n\nintent to sharpen the Commission’s teeth in order to signal the importance of data\nprotection in the burgeoning digital economy. As explained by then-Minister for\nCommunications and Information at the Second Reading of the Personal Data\nProtection (Amendment) Bill:\n\n“The objective here is to ensure that we achieve the requisite deterrent\neffect on organisations… The proposed maximum financial penalty is\ncomparable with other domestic legislation such as the Telecommunications\nAct and Competition Act and signals that data protection is of that level of\nimportance in the digital economy.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n8\n\nSee section 48J(3)(a) of the PDPA read with regulation 10A(1) of the Personal Data Protection\n(Enforcement) Regulations 2021.\n\nPage 20 of 90\n\n\f34\n\nGiven the considerable size of the Organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore,\n\nthe Commission considers that a proportionately higher financial penalty is necessary\nto serve as an effective deterrent to both the Organisation, and other organisations\nwith turnovers of similar size.\n\n35\n\nThis is consistent with the Commission’s approach in recent decisions following\n\nthe raising of the maximum amount of financial penalty9, and was recently articulated\nin Re Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation Ltd [2024] SGPDPC 3 (“KTT”) at\n[40]:\n“In quantifying the financial penalty to be imposed in any given case, the\nCommission aims to strike a careful balance between an amount that is (i)\nproportionate to the circumstances and effect of the organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA but (ii) that remains effective as a deterrent\nwhen considering the means of the organisation. In the present case, upon\na consideration of all the factors listed under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, the\nCommission is of the view that a higher financial penalty is warranted to ensure\nthat the financial penalty meted is proportionate in light of the Organisation’s\nlong period of non-compliance with the Protection Obligation (including during\n\n9 See Re Fullerton Healthcare Group Pte Limited and Agape CP Holdings Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 5 at\n\n[39], Re Autobahn Rent A Car Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPCS 4 at [11], Re Century Evergreen Private Limited\n[2023] SGPDPCS 5 at [11].\n\nPage 21 of 90\n\n\fthe Migration exercise in May 2020 and again during the Divestment in July\n2022) and the type and nature of the personal data affected. A higher financial\npenalty is also warranted to ensure that the financial penalty meted will\nbe effective in ensuring future compliance with the PDPA and to achieve\nthe requisite deterrent effect.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n36\n\nGoing forward, errant organisations should expect that the size of their annual\n\nturnover will continue to be a factor in the Commission’s assessment of the amount of\nfinancial penalty to be imposed.\n\n37\n\nHaving considered all of the matters set out above, the Commissioner\n\npreliminarily determined that the Organisation should pay a financial penalty of\n$450,000.\n\n38\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no\n\nfurther directions needed to be issued to the Organisation.\n\nPage 22 of 90\n\n\fRepresentations made by the Organisation\n\n39\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 13 September 2024 and was invited to make\nrepresentations. On 27 September 2024, the Organisation made representations to\nthe Commission (“Representations”) to clarify certain facts stated in the preliminary\ndecision, some of which the Commission accepts and has amended accordingly in\nthis decision. The Organisation also disputed the Commission’s imposition of a\nfinancial penalty, and in the alternative, the amount of the financial penalty. The\nOrganisation contended that:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Commission was not empowered to impose a financial penalty\nunder section 48J(1) of the PDPA, as the Organisation had not breached\nthe Protection Obligation “negligently”;\n\n(b)\n\nAlternatively, even if the Commission was empowered to impose a\nfinancial penalty, the Commission erred in law by taking into\nconsideration the Organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore when\ncalculating the amount of the financial penalty. Doing so caused the\namount of the financial penalty imposed to be inconsistent with the\n\nPage 23 of 90\n\n\ffinancial penalties imposed in previous similar cases, which were not\ncalculated with reference to the relevant organisations’ turnover; and\n\n(c)\n\nRegardless of whether the Commission was empowered to take into\nconsideration the Organisation’s turnover, the amount of the financial\npenalty imposed should be reduced as the Commission’s preliminary\ndecision did not sufficiently account for relevant mitigating factors.\n\n40\n\nThe Commission shall address each of these representations in turn.\n\nRepresentation 1: The Commission erred in determining that the Organisation\ncontravened the Protection Obligation negligently\n\n41\n\nUnder section 48J(1)(a) of the PDPA, the Commission may require an\n\norganisation to pay a financial penalty if it is satisfied that the organisation intentionally\nor negligently contravened any of the Data Protection Obligations. The Organisation\ncontends that while it did breach the Protection Obligation, its breach was not\n“negligent” in the meaning of section 48J(1)(a). The Organisation’s position is that:\n\n(a)\n\nAn organisation only breaches the Protection Obligation negligently if it\nought to have known at the relevant time that its conduct would result in\n\nPage 24 of 90\n\n\funauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification\nor disposal of personal data in its possession, or similar risks (the\n“Risks”).\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation bases this position on the Competition and Consumer\nCommission of Singapore’s (“CCCS”) Guidelines on Directions and\nRemedies (effective 1 February 2022) (“CCCS Guidelines”), arguing\nthat the same legal standard should be adopted for both the PDPA and\nthe Competition Act 20024. The CCCS Guidelines state CCCS’ position\nthat a relevant infringement under the Competition Act 2004 is committed\nnegligently “where an undertaking ought to have known that its\nagreement or conduct would result in a restriction or distortion of\ncompetition” (the “CCCS Standard”);\n\n(c)\n\nWhile the Organisation admits that the measures it adopted fell short of\nwhat was required by the Protection Obligation, it nevertheless acted\nreasonably and was not negligent in relation to its conduct of the\nMigration Exercise and API Replication:\n\nPage 25 of 90\n\n\fi.\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation\n\nhad\n\nimplemented\n\nvarious\n\nsecurity\n\narrangements to ensure that the Affected Data was adequately\nprotected, including testing and vulnerability assessments10:\n\nii.\n\nThere was no alternative to manually creating the Inventory\nListing and carrying out the API Replication. Whilst the\nOrganisation does not dispute that, in general, deployment\nprocesses should be automated to minimise human errors, there\nwere technical limitations on the extent to which this could have\nbeen done for the Migration Exercise. Other aspects of the\ndeployment were carried out using the Organisation’s standard\nprocesses, which involved automation, and such processes also\nhad controls in place to minimise vulnerabilities; and\n\niii.\n\nThe Organisation had assigned the Employee, the most qualified\nperson with the relevant expertise, to lead the team in the API\nReplication. In light of the Employee’s high level of expertise and\nconsistent good performance, as well as the nature of the\nInventory Listing task, the Organisation argued that it could not be\nsaid that the Organisation ought to have known at the time that\n\n10 See [16] above.\n\nPage 26 of 90\n\n\fthere was a need to have separate independent verification of the\nEmployee’s work. The Organisation was also reasonable in its\nbelief at the time that it would be unnecessary to have other less\nqualified personnel carry out checks on the Employee’s work\nthroughout the Migration Exercise as a whole.\n\nThe Commission’s decision on whether the Organisation breached the\nProtection Obligation negligently\n\n42\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Commission’s view is that the CCCS Standard\n\nsuggested by the Organisation would not be appropriate in the context of the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n43\n\nFirst, the CCCS Standard relates to infringements under the Competition Act\n\n2004 where undertakings (a) enter into anti-competitive agreements11, (b) abuse a\ndominant market position12, or (c) enter into anti-competitive mergers13 (“the\nCompetition Infringements”). The Competition Infringements all concern specific\nprohibited conduct relating to definitive competition-related harms (e.g. entering into\nan anti-competitive merger). These are conceptually distinct from the Risks which are\nnot predicated on the occurrence of specific conduct.\n\n11 Section 34 of the Competition Act 2004.\n12 Section 47 of the Competition Act 2004.\n13 Section 54 of the Competition Act 2004.\n\nPage 27 of 90\n\n\f44\n\nSecond, the Commission also disagrees with the Organisation’s application of\n\nthe CCCS Standard to suggest that negligence would only be found if an organisation\nought to have known that its conduct would result in the Risks (i.e. its conduct would\nnecessarily result in unauthorised access or collection of the Affected Data). This\nappears to conflate negligence with the more stringent standard of recklessness,\nwhich applies when a person fails to address risks that are blatant or obvious14 and\ndoes not apply here.\n\n45\n\nThe applicable standard for negligence must be grounded in how the Protection\n\nObligation operates. A non-compliance with the Protection Obligation arises where an\norganisation fails to implement security arrangements that it reasonably should have,\nconsidering the Risks posed to the personal data in its possession or under its control.\nThere are two aspects to this, both evaluated on an objective standard – (a) what are\nthe reasonably foreseeable risks posed to the personal data in the organisation’s\npossession or under its control, and (b) what security arrangements should the\norganisation have reasonably implemented to protect the personal data in its\npossession or under its control from the said risks.\n\n14 Public Prosecutor v Hue An Li [2014] 4 SLR 661 at [45] and [49].\n\nPage 28 of 90\n\n\f46\n\nThe nature of the risks posed to personal data in an organisation’s possession\n\nor under its control can be assessed based on a variety of factors including (a) the\nvolume, type and nature of the personal data, (b) the manner in which the personal\ndata is processed and the degree of risk such processing might entail, (c) the form in\nwhich the personal data was collected or stored, and (d) the impact that unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal of the personal\ndata would have on data subjects15. The Commission’s ICT Guide provides guidance\non the data protection practices which organisations should have regard to when\nimplementing security arrangements to address these risks.\n\n47\n\nAn organisation which breaches the Protection Obligation, fails to implement\n\nmeasures that a reasonable organisation in its position would, having regard to the\nforeseeability of the risk and the adequacy of the safeguards in place. If the risk was\nreasonably foreseeable and the security arrangements (or lack thereof) to reduce,\nmitigate or eliminate that risk fell below the standard expected of a reasonable\norganisation, the breach would necessarily be negligent.\n\n48\n\nWith these principles in mind, the Commission now turns to consider whether\n\nthe Organisation had committed a negligent breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\n15 Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Revised 1 October 2021) at [17.2].\n\nPage 29 of 90\n\n\fWas the Organisation negligent in failing to implement reasonable security\narrangements to prevent the Misconfiguration Error?\n\n49\n\nThe Organisation has explained in its representations that the API Replication\n\ncould not be automated and had to be done manually, since the old middleware\nplatform could not automate the extraction of the existing API configuration. While the\nCommission accepts this explanation, the Commission is unable to accept the rest of\nthe Organisation’s representations on this issue and maintains its finding that the\nOrganisation negligently breached the Protection Obligation within the meaning of\nsection 48J(1)(a) of the PDPA.\n\n50\n\nFirst, the manual nature of the Inventory Listing made it more susceptible to\n\nrisks of human error including inadvertent omissions of APIs or calling app IDs, or\ninaccuracies in the items recorded. This called for more robust systemic processes to\nmitigate these risks beyond placing the burden on one employee at one single point\nof failure. The Protection Obligation requires the instituting of security arrangements,\nor in other words, a safe system to protect personal data from the carelessness of\nindividual persons.\n\n51\n\nIf an API was omitted during the Inventory Listing, the Organisation had no\n\nother downstream arrangements whether during the Migration Exercise or six months\n\nPage 30 of 90\n\n\fafter the new middleware platform had gone live, to detect this omission and reinstate\nany relevant security policies or controls in relation to the omitted API. Once an omitted\nAPI is not subject to the Organisation’s security policies or controls, it becomes more\nvulnerable to external cybersecurity threats targeting its personal data assets through\nthis API. It was thus entirely foreseeable that errors or omissions in the Inventory\nListing could lead to vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor to\ncircumvent its cybersecurity defences and gain unauthorised access to the Affected\nData. In particular:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation admits that this was the first ever middleware migration\nit was performing, and it had “no SOPs per se” for such a process. It\ncalled this an “exceptional, large-scale” and “complex exercise” that\ninvolved implementing a hybrid cloud and on-premises API management\nplatform with API policies and configuration for the migration of\nmiddleware. Given that the API Replication was a new and complex\nundertaking for the Organisation, and the volume of personal data in the\nOrganisation’s possession, the Organisation should reasonably have\ntaken greater care to implement robust security arrangements and\nsecondary checks at each critical stage, especially for manual steps. For\nexample, the Organisation could have carried out a security test after the\nMigration Exercise was concluded to detect cybersecurity vulnerabilities\n\nPage 31 of 90\n\n\fthat may have arisen due to human error, instead of waiting for routine\nsecurity testing to take place months after deployment.\n\n(b)\n\nThe APIs are part of the Organisation’s network architecture which, if left\nunprotected, would be targeted by threat actors. It was foreseeable that\nan omission during the creation of the Inventory List and subsequent API\nReplication would mean that the Organisation’s security arrangements\nwould not have applied to the orphaned API, exposing the Organisation’s\npersonal data to the Risks. This omission can be seen as analogous to\nan organisation’s failure to accurately maintain a personal data asset\ninventory to ensure that the said assets are covered by the organisation’s\nsecurity policies: see Eatigo International Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 9 at\n[15] to [16]. Similarly, one key reason for carrying out the API Replication\nwas to ensure that the Organisation had full visibility of all the APIs in its\nmiddleware platform after the Migration Exercise was complete, so that\nit could implement its extant security arrangements (including the Token\nVerification Policy) on all APIs post-migration to protect the APIs from\ncybersecurity risks.\n\n(c)\n\nIn fact, the Organisation had undertaken a threat risk assessment in\nJanuary 2022 i.e. before embarking on the Migration Exercise (as\nrecorded in its Threat Risk Assessment Report). The Organisation had\n\nPage 32 of 90\n\n\fflagged misconfiguration of API settings as a risk as “misconfigured API\nsettings can not only expose sensitive user data, but also system\ndetails that may lead to full server compromise”. The risk of an API\nmisconfiguration leading to the compromise of personal data in the\nOrganisation’s possession was therefore entirely foreseeable by the\nOrganisation, including more broadly, omissions during coding.\n\n52\n\nOn balance, a reasonable organisation ought to have foreseen that an omission\n\nin assembling the Inventory List manually, especially in a new and complex\nmiddleware migration, might create a cybersecurity vulnerability with foreseeable\nramifications for personal data security. This is not a risk that is only discernible upon\na retrospective assessment, as evidenced by the Organisation’s own Threat Risk\nAssessment Report. While the Commission accepts the Organisation’s representation\nthat the API Replication could not have been automated, given the foreseeable risk of\nhuman error inherent in the manual process and the risks posed to the Affected Data\nin turn, it was unreasonable for the Organisation to rely solely on the Employee to\ncarry out the API Replication, without any meaningful layer of checks on the\ncorrectness of the Inventory List, APIs and calling app IDs in the new middleware\nplatform, before it went live.\n\nPage 33 of 90\n\n\f53\n\nSecond, the Employee’s expertise and experience per se were an insufficient\n\nbasis for the Organisation to rely solely on the Employee to conduct the Inventory\nListing and API Replication without instituting any meaningful secondary checks. As\nstated at [18] to [22] above, it was not reasonable for the Organisation to make the\nEmployee responsible for the API Replication without further checks.\n\n54\n\nThird, while the Organisation claims it conducted extensive pre-deployment\n\nchecks and post-deployment penetration testing on the new middleware platform,\nthere is no indication that any of these tests could have detected an omission in the\nInventory List and the Misconfiguration Error.\n\n55\n\nThe Organisation’s approach meant that the Misconfiguration Error would not\n\nhave been detected unless, as it happened, it was exploited by a threat actor in a data\nbreach, or full penetration testing was conducted. The Organisation explained that it\ndid not perform the latter because, among other things, it did not consider that there\nto have been any change in the security parameters in the new middleware platform.\nThis assumption rested on the false premise that the Employee’s Inventory List was\naccurate and complete. The Commission does not accept that the Organisation could\nnot take reasonable steps to prevent the unauthorised access to the Affected Data.\nHad the Organisation taken steps to minimise the risks of human error during the API\nReplication by way of additional checks, it would likely have detected the\n\nPage 34 of 90\n\n\fMisconfiguration Error. The Commission maintains its finding that the Organisation\ncontravened the Protection Obligation negligently. Accordingly, the Commission is\nempowered to require the Organisation to pay a financial penalty pursuant to section\n48J(1) of the PDPA.\n\nRepresentation 2: The Commission erred in law by taking into consideration the\nOrganisation’s turnover in Singapore when determining the amount of financial penalty\nto be imposed\n\n56\n\nThe Organisation separately contends that the Commission erred in law by\n\ntaking the size of the Organisation’s turnover into account when calculating the\nfinancial penalty to be imposed. While the Organisation makes several arguments in\nthis regard, its contentions broadly fall into 2 categories:\n\n(a)\n\nUltra vires: The Organisation says that section 48J of the PDPA does\nnot empower the Commission to take into consideration the\nOrganisation’s annual turnover when determining the amount of the\nfinancial penalty to be imposed. It contends that:\n\ni.\n\nFirst, nothing in sections 48J(3) or 48J(6) of the PDPA states that\nthe Commission should take into account an organisation’s\nturnover.\n\nPage 35 of 90\n\n\fii.\n\nSecond, referring to statements made by the then-Minister for\nCommunications and Information and other members of\nParliament at the 2nd reading of the Personal Data Protection\n(Amendment) Bill on 2 November 2020 (the “PDP (Amendment)\nBill 2nd Reading”), the Organisation suggests that Parliament\nwas “categorical” in explaining that the increased financial penalty\ncap was intended to ensure that the financial penalties imposed\nby the Commission were “proportionate to the severity of the data\nbreach”. In the Organisation’s view, Parliament “did not intend to\nimport a new approach of taking turnover into account as a factor\nto enhance the quantum of the financial penalty”.\n\niii.\n\nThird, taking into account the Organisation’s turnover would be\ncontrary to section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA, under which the\nCommission must have regard to whether a financial penalty\nimposed is “proportionate” and “effective” in ensuring compliance\nand\n\ndeterring\n\nnon-compliance\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nPDPA.\n\nCiting\n\njurisprudence from criminal law, the Organisation contends that\nproportionality has nothing to do with the means of the infringer,\nbut is solely about whether the severity of the penalty is\ncommensurate with severity of the infringement. Similarly, the\n\nPage 36 of 90\n\n\fOrganisation contends that there is “no principle under Singapore\nlaw” that requires the calibration of a penalty based on the means\nof an organisation to ensure effective deterrence.\n\niv.\n\nFourth, based on the above, turnover is an “irrelevant”\nconsideration which the Commission does not have the discretion\nto take into account as a matter of law. The Organisation\nhighlights the CCCS’ approach to quantifying financial penalties\nunder the Competition Act 2004 to suggest that the reasons\njustifying a turnover-based approach in the competition context\n(to reflect the economic significance of the infringement), do not\napply to the PDPA. The Organisation also observes that there are\nno published decisions arising from other statutory regimes with\nfinancial penalty caps based on 10% of an entity’s annual\nturnover in Singapore16, which lend support to the Commission’s\napproach of scaling financial penalties based on turnover.\n\n(b)\n\nUnequal treatment: The Organisation also contends that the\nCommission’s decision on the preliminary financial penalty infringed\nArticle 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (“Article\n\n16 Specifically, section 10(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1999, section 19(c) of the Gas Act 2001\n\nand section 14(c) of the Electricity Act 2001.\n\nPage 37 of 90\n\n\f12(1)”) as it subjected the Organisation to arbitrary discrimination on the\nbasis of its turnover.\n\ni.\n\nThe proposed financial penalty would result in the Organisation\nbeing treated differently from other organisations which were\n“equivalent or similar save for having a lower turnover”. The\nOrganisation refers to the financial penalties previously imposed\nby the Commission in SingHealth17, PPLingo18, Eatigo, and\nCarousell19 (the “Precedent Cases”) as evidence of differential\nand disproportionate treatment.\n\nii.\n\nThe differential treatment of the Organisation was not based on\nlegitimate reasons which bore a sufficient rational relation to the\nobjective of section 48J of the PDPA, which in the Organisation’s\nview is to “impose proportionately higher financial penalties for\nmore severe contraventions of the PDPA”.\n\n57\n\nThe\n\nCommission\n\nconsiders\n\neach\n\ncategory\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s\n\nrepresentations in turn.\n\n17 Singapore Health Services Pte. Ltd. & Ors [2019] SGPDPC 3.\n18 PPLingo Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 12.\n19 Carousell Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 13.\n\nPage 38 of 90\n\n\fThe Commission’s decision on Organisation’s representations regarding ultra vires\n\n58\n\nWhile the Organisation’s representations in this regard attempt to construe the\n\nproper scope of the Commission’s powers under section 48J of the PDPA, they do not\naccord primacy to the text of the relevant provisions in the PDPA and their statutory\ncontext, over any extraneous material20.\n\n59\n\nIn the Commission’s view, the plain language and structure of section 48J of\n\nthe PDPA clearly demonstrate that the size of an organisation’s annual turnover is a\nrelevant factor to be taken into consideration by the Commission when quantifying\nfinancial penalties.\n\n60\n\nFirst, section 48J(3) (read with section 48J(1)(a)) of the PDPA expressly refers\n\nto the organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore when defining the maximum\nfinancial penalty that can be imposed on organisations for breaches of the Data\nProtection Obligations:\n“48J. Financial penalties\n(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commission may, if it is satisfied that\n—\n\n20 Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney General [2017] 2 SLR 850 (“Tan Cheng Bock”) at [43].\n\nPage 39 of 90\n\n\f(a)\n\nan organisation has intentionally or negligently contravened any\n\nprovision of Part 3, 4, 5, 6, 6A or 6B; or\n(b)\n\na person has intentionally or negligently contravened —\n(i)\n\nany provision of Part 9; or\n\n(ii)\n\nsection 48B(1),\n\nrequire, by written notice, the organisation or person (as the case may\nbe) to pay a financial penalty.\n(…)\n(3) A financial penalty imposed on an organisation under subsection\n(1)(a) must not exceed the maximum amount to be prescribed, which in\nno case may be more than the following:\n(a)\n\nin the case of a contravention on or after the date of\n\ncommencement of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\n(Amendment) Act 2020 by an organisation whose annual\nturnover in Singapore exceeds $10 million — 10% of the\nannual turnover in Singapore of the organisation;\n(b)\n\nin any other case — $1 million.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n61\n\nUnder regulation 10A of the Personal Data Protection (Enforcement)\n\nRegulations 2021 (“Enforcement Regulations”), the maximum amount prescribed for\n\nPage 40 of 90\n\n\fthe purposes of section 48J(3) mirrors the statutory limit set by section 48J(3) of the\nPDPA:\n\n“10A. Maximum amount of financial penalties\n(1) The maximum amount prescribed for the purposes of section 48J(3) of the\nAct is —\n(a)\n\nin the case of a contravention on or after 1 October 2022 by an\n\norganisation whose annual turnover in Singapore exceeds $10 million\n— 10% of the annual turnover in Singapore of the organisation; and\n(b)\n\nin any other case — $1 million.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n62\n\nEffectively, section 48J(3) of the PDPA bifurcates organisations that fail to\n\ncomply with the Data Protection Obligations into two classes – organisations with\nannual turnover of $10 million and below (“Low Turnover Class”), and organisations\nwith annual turnover more than $10 million (“High Turnover Class”).\n\n(a)\n\nOrganisations within the Low Turnover Class are subject to a maximum\nfinancial penalty of $1 million.\n\nPage 41 of 90\n\n\f(b)\n\nBy comparison, regardless of the nature of their non-compliance21,\norganisations within the High Turnover Class are subject to higher or\nlower maximum financial penalties depending solely on the size of their\nannual turnover. For the High Turnover Class, turnover is obviously one\nof the relevant considerations for financial penalty quantification, as the\nlarger the turnover, the higher the maximum penalty that can legally be\nimposed. Whilst this determines the maximum financial penalty that can\nbe imposed, the determination of the actual financial penalty in a given\ncase is a case-specific and multi-factorial exercise that the Commission\nwill elaborate on below.\n\n(c)\n\nIf Parliament did not intend for turnover to be a relevant consideration in\nquantifying financial penalties for the High Turnover Class, there would\nhave been no need for section 48J(3) of the PDPA to refer to turnover at\nall. A higher penalty dollar amount could have been stipulated instead.\n\n(d)\n\nThis is what was done for financial penalties imposable for\ncontraventions of the obligations under Part 9 of the PDPA (“the Do Not\nCall Obligations”). Under section 48J(4) of the PDPA, the maximum\nfinancial penalties imposable on any persons (regardless of turnover) for\n\n21 For completeness, section 48J(5) of the PDPA does contemplate that different maximum amounts\n\nmay be prescribed in respect of contraventions of different provisions of the PDPA. However, no such\ndifferentiated maximum amounts have been prescribed.\n\nPage 42 of 90\n\n\fcontraventions of the Do Not Call Obligations are expressed as a fixed\ndollar amount:\n\n“(4) A financial penalty imposed on a person under subsection\n(1)(b)(i) must not exceed the maximum amount to be prescribed,\nwhich in no case may be more than the following:\n\n63\n\n(a)\n\nin the case of an individual — $200,000;\n\n(b)\n\nin any other case — $1 million.”\n\nSecond, contrary to the Organisation’s suggestion, the fact that turnover is not\n\nspecifically identified in section 48J(6) of the PDPA does not mean that it is irrelevant\nfor the exercise of the Commission’s discretion when determining the amount of\nfinancial penalty to be imposed. Section 48J(6)(j) of the PDPA also requires the\nCommission to consider any other matter that may be relevant when determining the\namount of financial penalty imposed, which clearly signals that the factors set out in\nsections 48J(6)(a) to (i) of the PDPA are not intended to be the only factors that the\nCommission may consider. Such a narrow reading of the provision would render\nsection 48J(6)(j) of the PDPA otiose.\n\nPage 43 of 90\n\n\f64\n\nThe Commission must have regard to all of the matters listed in section 48J(6)\n\nof the PDPA when quantifying financial penalties for contraventions of both the Data\nProtection Obligations and the Do Not Call Obligations. In this context, it is\nunderstandable why the list of matters at section 48J(6) of the PDPA does not make\nexplicit reference to turnover, if Parliamentary intent was that turnover be less relevant\nof a factor for breaches of the Do Not Call Obligations.\n\n65\n\nThird, section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA obliges the Commission to consider\n\nwhether the amount of the financial penalty to be imposed will be effective in deterring\nnon-compliance with the PDPA. This limb reflects the over-arching purpose of\ndeterring non-compliance with the PDPA amongst all organisations generally. Unlike\nthe other sub-provisions of section 48J(6) of the PDPA, which refer to “the\norganisation” (i.e. the organisation that has contravened the PDPA), section 48J(6)(h)\nof the PDPA describes “deterring non-compliance with this Act” generally, and without\nreference to the specific organisation that is subject to the financial penalty.\n\n66\n\nIn this context, the Commission agrees with the Organisation that “deter” in the\n\nmeaning of section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA refers to both specific deterrence (i.e.\ndeterring the organisation’s own ongoing or future non-compliance with the PDPA),\nand general deterrence (i.e. deterring other organisations from non-compliance with\nthe PDPA). The Commission addresses both facets below.\n\nPage 44 of 90\n\n\fSpecific deterrence\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation represents that the need for specific deterrence only\narises if there is a risk of an organisation re-infringing, and the size of an\norganisation’s turnover has no bearing on this. The Organisation further\nsuggests that the Commission already has powers to address an\norganisation’s risk of re-infringement by issuing directions under section\n48I of the PDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nThis broad characterisation does not obviate the need to consider an\norganisation’s annual turnover, and misses what specific deterrence is\nabout in the context of section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA. Once the\nCommission is satisfied that the organisation’s contravention of the Data\nProtection Obligation(s) was intentional or negligent pursuant to section\n48J(1)(a) of the PDPA, it exercises its discretion to determine whether to\nimpose a financial penalty on the organisation. Once it decides to do so,\nthe Commission would then have regard to the factors listed in section\n48J(6) of the PDPA in “determining the amount of a financial penalty\nimposed under [section 48J(1)]”. Specific deterrence is taken into\nconsideration when quantifying the amount of the financial penalty to be\nimposed. In the context of section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA, this is an issue\n\nPage 45 of 90\n\n\fof weight, and not relevance (i.e. whether a financial penalty should be\nimposed at all).\n\n(c)\n\nThe Commission accepts that there are factors which would go towards\nlowering the weight to be placed on specific deterrence in a given case.\nThese include where (i) an organisation voluntarily admits to, and\naccepts responsibility for its non-compliance with the PDPA, and/or (ii)\nvoluntarily implements remedial measures to correct its noncompliances with the PDPA without the need for the Commission to\nissue directions to this effect under section 48I of the PDPA. The\nCommission has already taken these factors into account to reduce the\nfinancial penalty imposed on the Organisation in this case.\n\nGeneral deterrence\n(d)\n\nFor the financial penalty to serve as an effective general deterrent, it\nmust signal to organisations of similar size and circumstances that\ncontraventions of the PDPA will attract financial penalties of a level that\nwould\n\ndissuade\n\nsuch\n\norganisations\n\nfrom\n\nnon-compliance.\n\nFor\n\norganisations in the High Turnover Class particularly, low financial\npenalties that do not consider the sizes of their annual turnover may not\nsufficiently dissuade them from non-compliance if the financial penalty\ncan be factored as a cost of business. The Commission elaborates on\n\nPage 46 of 90\n\n\fthis below in the context of considering relevant extraneous materials\nthat confirm this position.\n\n67\n\nFourth, section 48J(6)(i) of the PDPA obliges the Commission to consider the\n\nlikely impact of the imposition of the financial penalty on an organisation, including the\nability of the organisation to continue its usual activities. The financial penalty meted\nout should avoid imposing a crushing burden or cause undue financial hardship to the\norganisation. To assess how the imposition of a financial penalty may affect an\norganisation’s ability to continue operating its business, the Commission must\nnecessarily consider the organisation’s financial means, including the size of its\nturnover. If the Commission assesses that imposition of a financial penalty may lead\nto financial distress and closure of the organisation’s business, the Commission may\nreduce the financial penalty quantum to avoid imposing a crushing burden on the\norganisation. If turnover and the financial means of organisations are not relevant to\ndetermining the amount of financial penalties, the Commission would not be able to\ngive effect to section 48J(6)(i) of the PDPA.\n\n68\n\nFifth, section 48J(5A) of the PDPA provides that for the purposes of determining\n\nthe maximum financial penalty imposable on organisations in the High Turnover Class,\n\nPage 47 of 90\n\n\fan organisation’s annual turnover is to be ascertained from its most recent audited\naccounts at the time the financial penalty is imposed22.\n\n69\n\nThe fact that the relevant turnover to be considered is the turnover at the time\n\nof imposition of the financial penalty (and not, for example, the organisation’s turnover\nat the time its contraventions were committed), supports that the financial penalty is\nabout deterring ongoing or future contraventions, and not about approximating\neconomic harms that result from such contraventions. Where an organisation gains a\nfinancial benefit or avoids a financial loss as a result of its non-compliance, this is\ntaken into account as a separate factor under section 48J(6)(c) of the PDPA.\n\n70\n\nSixth, there is nothing in the language or structure of section 48J of the PDPA\n\nthat supports the Organisation’s suggested interpretation that turnover is only a\nrelevant consideration in the context of “severe breaches”. In the Commission’s view,\nthis is too narrow a reading of section 48J of the PDPA based on its unambiguous\nplain language. The primary source of information as to the legislative intent should\nbe the text of the provision itself, and extraneous material should not be used to call\nthe ordinary meaning of a statutory provision into question23.\n\n22 See section 48J(5A) of the PDPA: “For the purposes of subsections (3)(a) and (4A)(b), the annual\n\nturnover in Singapore of an organisation or a person (as the case may be) is the amount ascertained\nfrom the most recent audited accounts of the organisation or person available at the time the financial\npenalty is imposed on that organisation or person.”\n23 Tan Cheng Bock at [45] to [48].\n\nPage 48 of 90\n\n\f71\n\nIn any event, the relevant extraneous material either confirms that turnover is a\n\nrelevant factor in determining financial penalties to be imposed under section 48J of\nthe PDPA, or does not support the view proposed by the Organisation (i.e. that\nParliament’s intent in amending section 48J of the PDPA was only for the Commission\nto impose proportionately higher financial penalties for more severe breaches).\n\nMinisterial statements at PDP (Amendment Bill) 2nd Reading\n\n72\n\nContrary to the Organisation’s representations, the statements made by the\n\nthen-Minister at the PDP (Amendment) Bill 2nd Reading confirm that the objective\nbehind increasing the financial penalty cap when the PDPA was amended in 2021 was\nto enhance the effectiveness of the Commission’s enforcement overall and not to limit\nhigher financial penalties only to “severe” cases:\n\n(a)\n\nIn introducing the category of amendments including what is now section\n48J, the then-Minister framed the over-arching purpose of these\namendments as being to enhance the effectiveness of the Commission’s\nenforcement. At the end of his opening speech, the then-Minister\nemphasised that the amendments to the PDPA were about creating\ngreater organisational accountability for personal data, so as to enhance\nSingapore’s status as a global hub for data flows and digital transactions.\nPage 49 of 90\n\n\fThis point was once again emphasised in the then-Minister’s closing\nspeech, where he explicitly framed the increase as being about creating\nmarket incentives to motivate organisations to adopt better data\nprotection standards in general, and not just about taking stronger\nenforcement action in “severe” cases:\n\n“Sir, I will elaborate on the amendments which aim to: first,\nstrengthen consumer trust through organisational accountability;\nsecond,\n\nensure\n\neffective\n\nenforcement;\n\nthird,\n\nenhance\n\nconsumer autonomy; and fourth, support data use for innovation.\n(…)\nSir, let me now move to the second cluster of amendments, which\nseeks to enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of the\nPDPC’s enforcement.”\n(…)\n\n“Sir, in summary, the proposed amendments to the PDPA will\nstrengthen consumer trust with greater accountability for the\nprotection of personal data; it will give greater certainty for\norganisations to use data for legitimate business purposes with\nthe requisite safeguards; and it will ultimately enhance\n\nPage 50 of 90\n\n\fSingapore’s status as an important node in the global network of\ndata flows and digital transactions. Sir, I beg to move.”\n(…)\n“To support that and to ensure organisations take their obligations\nto protect data seriously, we are introducing both incentives and\npenalties – carrots and sticks, if you will. The PDPC will issue new\nadvisory guidelines with examples and illustrations, so that\norganisations have ample notice of the expected standard of\nconduct.\n(emphasis added)\n\n(b)\n\nWhen later presenting the specific amendments that introduced section\n48J, the then-Minister did record that the Commission would ensure that\nfinancial penalties would be proportionate to the severity of data\nbreaches. However, this was in the specific context of pre-empting\nconcerns heard during public consultations about the increase in the\nfinancial penalty cap, and not for the purposes of framing the purpose or\nobject of the amendments as a whole. Contrary to the Organisation’s\nsuggestion, the Commission is unable to read into this statement any\nsuggestion that higher financial penalties (calculated with reference to\nan organisation’s turnover) would only be imposed in “severe” cases:\n\nPage 51 of 90\n\n\f“Clause 24 increases the maximum financial penalty for breaches\nof Parts III to VI, and the new Parts VIA and VIB, to 10% of an\norganisation’s annual turnover in Singapore or $1 million,\nwhichever is higher. This penalty framework is similar to that in\nother\n\ndomestic\n\nregulation\n\nand\n\nlegislation,\n\nincluding\n\nthe\n\nCompetition Act and the Telecommunications Act.\n\nDuring public consultations, concerns were raised about the\nhigher financial penalties. I would like to assure Members, as well\nas the broader community, that the PDPC will ensure that\nfinancial penalties imposed are proportionate to the severity of the\ndata breach. The Bill also provides for Ministerial discretion to\nreview the effective date for these penalties to commence and we\nintend for the revised financial penalty cap to take effect no earlier\nthan one year after the Act comes into force.\n…\nAs data breaches cannot always be prevented, the PDPC’s\nenforcement framework reinforces the importance of dealing\nexpeditiously with data breaches to reduce harm, through\nmeasures like breach reporting and statutory undertakings.\n\nPage 52 of 90\n\n\fLast year, PDPC investigated 185 cases, issued 58 decisions and\nordered 39 organisations to pay a total of $1.7 million in financial\npenalties and that includes the highest financial penalty sums the\nPDPC imposed in 2019, which were $750,000 and $250,000 on\nIHiS and SingHealth respectively.\nThe Bill enhances PDPC’s investigation powers and raises the\nfinancial penalty cap, to improve the effectiveness of PDPC’s\nenforcement.\n\nWe are also creating market incentives, which can motivate\norganisations to practise high standards of data protection.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n(c)\n\nMember of Parliament Mr Desmond Choo had earlier asked the thenMinister whether the increased financial penalty cap would put\nSingapore at a comparative economic disadvantage to other Asian\njurisdictions which subjected organisations to lower maximum financial\npenalties, and asked the then-Minister to reconsider re-aligning the\n\nPage 53 of 90\n\n\fmaximum financial penalty to be in line with other Asian jurisdictions 24.\nIn responding to Mr Desmond Choo’s question in his closing speech,\nthat the then-Minister spoke about the “reasonableness” of the increased\nfinancial penalty cap, and reiterated that the objective was to achieve the\nrequisite deterrent effect on organisations. This suggests that the\n“requisite” or appropriate deterrent effect could only be achieved by way\nof a maximum financial penalty expressed as a percentage of an\norganisation’s annual turnover (introduced in the new section 48J of the\nPDPA), and not a fixed amount as was the case with the examples of\nMalaysia, Hong Kong and Philippines raised by Mr Desmond Choo:\n\n“There are some concerns about the reasonableness of the\nincreased financial penalty cap. Mr Desmond Choo proposed\naligning the financial penalty cap with other Asian jurisdictions.\n24 “My third point of clarification relates to the increased financial penalties under the amendments. The\n\nmaximum financial penalty that can be meted out is a fine amounting to 10% of the defaulting\norganisation’s annual turnover in Singapore. For comparison, the contravention of Personal Data Laws\nin Hong Kong attracts a maximum financial penalty of HKD$1 million; in Malaysia it is RM$300,000 and\nin the Philippines, it is PHP$5 million.\nThe worry, which has been similarly reflected during the public consultation, is that the maximum fine\nthat can be imposed might be too large compared to worldwide standards, especially in Asia. Could this\ndisadvantage Singapore as an offshore destination, where MNCs might choose other Asian countries\nover ours to set up operations? While the penalty imposed on a contravening organisation will vary\nnaturally according to the facts, this might artificially create the impression that the financial penalties\nunder Singapore’s data privacy regime are much harsher compared to those of its neighbours. In light\nof this, can the Ministry reconsider the maximum financial penalty that it is imposing on defaulting\norganisations to better align with the standards in neighbouring Asian jurisdictions or competing\neconomies?”\n\nPage 54 of 90\n\n\fThe objective here is to ensure that we achieve the requisite\ndeterrent effect on organisations. And that is why the financial\npenalties have been calibrated in the way that I have described.\nThe proposed maximum financial penalty is comparable with\nother domestic legislation such as the Telecommunications Act\nand Competition Act and signals that data protection is of that\nlevel of importance in the digital economy.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n(d)\n\nIn referring to the equivalent financial penalty caps under the\nTelecommunications Act 1999 and Competition Act 2004, the thenMinister was not suggesting that the same policy considerations\nunderpinned their respective financial penalty regimes. The thenMinister was simply referring to these regimes as domestic examples of\nfinancial penalty caps based on turnover, which supported the\n“reasonableness” of the proposed financial penalty cap under the PDPA.\n\n(e)\n\nIn all, the Commission is unable to glean from the Parliamentary\nexcerpts cited by the Organisation any support for its proposed reading\nof Parliamentary intent.\n\nPage 55 of 90\n\n\fClosing Note to Public Consultation on Draft Personal Data Protection\n(Amendment) Bill\n\n73\n\nSecond, contrary to the Organisation’s representations, the statements made\n\nby the then-Ministry of Communications and Information (“MCI”) and the Commission\nin their closing note to the public consultation on the proposed amendments to the\nPDPA issued on 5 October 2020 (“Closing Note”)25 do not convey any intent for\nconsideration of an organisation’s turnover to be limited to only “severe” cases. The\nCommission stated that in a given case, the appropriate financial penalty would be\ndetermined based on a variety of relevant factors including the facts of the individual\ncase, the seriousness of the breach and its impact, the level of the organisation’s\nculpability, the need for deterrence, and the overall proportionality of the amount. This\nis consistent with the existing structure of section 48J of the PDPA outlined above,\nand does not amount to any representation on the Commission’s part that an\norganisation’s turnover would play a limited or specific role in the exercise of the\nCommission’s discretion when quantifying financial penalties.\n\n25\n\nhttps://pdpc.gov.sg/guidelines-and-consultation/2020/05/public-consultation-on-personal-dataprotection-(amendment)-bill\n\nPage 56 of 90\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe relevant section of the Closing Note which pertained to feedback\nreceived on the increased financial penalty cap is reproduced below in\nfull:\n\n“Increased Financial Penalty Cap\n\n6. MCI/PDPC proposed to increase the maximum financial\npenalty for data breaches under the PDPA to (i) up to 10% of an\norganisation’s annual turnover; or (ii) S$1 million, whichever is\nhigher. The higher cap is intended to serve as a stronger deterrent\nand enable PDPC to take effective enforcement action based on\nthe circumstances and seriousness of a breach, in order to uphold\norganisational accountability for personal data.\n\n7. Approximately a third of all the respondents were concerned\nwith the increase in the financial penalty cap, with some citing the\neconomic downturn arising from COVID-19. Some respondents\nalso requested for a sunrise period before the increased financial\npenalty cap takes effect. There were also several respondents\nwho requested that MCI/PDPC make clear in the draft PDP\n(Amendment) Bill that the financial penalty cap refers to 10% of\n\nPage 57 of 90\n\n\fan organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore; or S$1 million,\nwhichever is higher.\n\n8. MCI/PDPC notes organisations’ feedback and will take into\naccount the prevailing economic situation in refining the financial\npenalty framework. Regardless of the higher cap, in determining\nthe appropriate financial penalty quantum, PDPC will continue to\nbe circumspect and guided by the facts of the individual case, as\nwell as relevant factors including the seriousness of the breach\nand its impact, level of culpability, the need for deterrence, and\nthe overall proportionality of the amount.\n\n9. In determining the financial penalty quantum, PDPC currently\nconsiders factors such as whether the organisation took any\naction to mitigate the effects of the data breach and the type and\nnature of the personal data affected. Some of these factors are\nlisted in the Guide on Active Enforcement. To provide clarity and\nregulatory certainty, MCI/PDPC intends to set out in the PDPA a\nnon-exhaustive list of factors that PDPC would consider and give\nweight to as appropriate when determining the quantum of\nfinancial penalty to impose.\n\nPage 58 of 90\n\n\f10. MCI/PDPC also intends to amend the draft PDP\n(Amendment) Bill to expressly state that the maximum financial\npenalty for the DP Provisions is (i) up to 10% of an organisation’s\nannual turnover in Singapore; or (ii) S$1 million, whichever is\nhigher. MCI/PDPC intends to have tiered financial penalty caps\nfor breaches of the DNC provisions, aligned with the\negregiousness of the breach.”\n(emphasis added)\n\n(b)\n\nNothing in the above supports the Organisation’s suggestion that\nconsideration of turnover was only intended to be limited to “severe”\ncases.\n\n(c)\n\nWhile the Organisation claims that the Closing Note “specifically\nemphasises that the appropriate financial penalty quantum (would be)\ntied to the egregiousness of the breach”, the Commission notes that the\nstatement cited by the Organisation at paragraph 10 of the Closing Note\nwas made in respect of the Do Not Call Obligations, which are not\nsubject to a turnover-based financial penalty cap. In any event, the\nCommission sees no inconsistency with the egregiousness of an\n\nPage 59 of 90\n\n\forganisation’s breach being one determining factor in the amount of any\nfinancial penalty imposed.\n\nDecision of the CCCS in quantifying financial penalty under the Competition Act\n2004\n\n74\n\nThird, the Organisation argued that CCCS’ rationale for calculating financial\n\npenalties based on an undertaking’s turnover does not apply to the PDPA context. In\nthe Organisation’s view, unlike the PDPA, the size of the undertaking is directly\nrelevant to the economic harm caused to the relevant market by the Competition\nInfringements and therefore “directly correlate to the severity of the infringement itself”.\nThe Organisation referred the Commission to the CCCS’ decision in Collusive\nTendering (Bid-Rigging) for Termite Treatment/Control Services by Certain Pest\nControl Operators in Singapore CCS 600/008/06 (9 January 2008) (“Pest Control\nOperators”) to illustrate the abovesaid point.\n\n75\n\nWhile the Commission agrees that the Competition Infringements address\n\nconceptually different harms from the Data Protection Obligations, a closer\nexamination of CCCS’ decision in Pest Control Operators reveals that CCCS also\ncompared the proposed financial penalty against the size of the undertaking’s turnover\n\nPage 60 of 90\n\n\fin order to ensure that the financial penalty was effective as a deterrent given the\nrelative size and financial position of the undertaking.\n\n“379. Another factor is whether the financial penalty calculated after adjustment\nfor the duration of infringement represents a relatively low proportion of an\nundertaking's total turnover, for example, where that undertaking has significant\noperations in other markets. In such a case, the Commission may consider it\nnecessary to increase the undertaking's penalty at this stage to arrive at a sum\nthat represents, for that undertaking, a significant amount that will act as a\nsufficient deterrent, having regard to the seriousness of the infringement(s) and\nthe undertaking's total turnover. These points are considered in the detailed\nassessment in relation to each Party.\n\n…\n\n382. As for the size of the undertakings in question, the Commission considers\nthat this would have been taken into consideration when applying a percentage\nrate to each undertaking's relevant turnover as a starting point. The\nCommission recognises that some Parties are larger than others and where a\nParty’s relevant turnover constitutes a relatively small percentage of its total\nturnover, the Commission may consider adjustments to ensure that the financial\npenalties will represent a significant sum and act as an adequate deterrent for\n\nPage 61 of 90\n\n\fsuch a Party, having regard to the seriousness of the infringement(s) and the\ntotal turnover. As such, the Commission considers that no downward\nadjustment for smaller Parties would be appropriate at this stage.\n\n383. The Commission notes that the financial position of the Parties is a\nrelevant consideration in determining whether the penalty imposed will be\nsufficiently deterrent, not only in relation to the Party in question but also in\nrelation to like-minded undertakings which may consider engaging in anticompetitive activities.\n\n…\n\n438. … The Commission is mindful that the financial penalty to be imposed\nshould commensurate with the size and financial position of the undertaking. In\nthis instance, the Commission is of the view that the figure reached after\nadjustment for duration is not a significant sum in relation to [the undertaking]\nbecause both the figure and the relevant turnover taken into account for the\nstarting point represent an inadequate proportion of [the undertaking’s] total\nturnover for the year ending 31 December 2006. In accordance with paragraph\n379, in order to achieve the objectives described in paragraph 377, the\nCommission considers that it is necessary to increase the penalty figure\n\nPage 62 of 90\n\n\freached after the adjustment to the duration to give a figure that represents a\nsignificant sum to Killem.”\n\n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted)\n\nBased on the above, CCCS increased the amount of the financial penalty imposed to\na larger percentage of the undertaking’s turnover, not simply because turnover\ncorrelated to the severity of the anti-competitive infringement, but because the penalty\nneeded to represent a “significant sum” to the undertaking. This is consistent with the\nCommission’s view on the relevance of an organisation’s turnover when determining\nthe appropriate amount of financial penalty to serve as an effective deterrent.\n\n76\n\nFor all of the above reasons, the Organisation’s representations on this issue\n\nare not accepted. The Commission maintains that it is relevant to consider the\nOrganisation’s turnover in determining the amount of financial penalty to be imposed\nin this case.\nObservation – Decision of the European Data Protection Board construing\nequivalent provisions under EU’s General Data Protection Regulation\n\n77\n\nThe Commission also observes that the practice of taking an organisation’s\n\nannual turnover into account for the purpose of ensuring effective deterrence is\nconsistent with the practices of foreign data protection authorities. Article 83 of the\nPage 63 of 90\n\n\fGeneral Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), which bears conceptual\nsimilarities to section 48J of the PDPA, has been interpreted by the European Data\nProtection Board (“EDPB”) to allow reference to an undertaking’s turnover when\ncalculating the size of equivalent administrative fines imposed under the GDPR.\n\n(a)\n\nArticle 83(1) of the GDPR requires that administrative fines imposed in\neach individual case be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The\nEDPB explained in “Guidelines 04/2022 on the calculation of\nadministrative fines under the GDPR”26 (“EDPR Fine Guidelines”), that\na fine is effective if it re-establishes compliance with the GDPR, punishes\nunlawful behaviour, or both27, and described “dissuasiveness” as being\nabout both general deterrence (discouraging others from committing the\nsame infringement in the future) and specific deterrence (discouraging\nthe addressee of the fine from committing the same infringement\nagain)28. This mirrors section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nSimilar to section 48J(3) of the PDPA, articles 83(4) to 83(6) of the\nGDPR create a two-class regime for administrative fines. Undertakings\nwith total worldwide annual turnover of EUR 500 million or less are\n\n26 https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-\n\n06/edpb_guidelines_04022_calculationofadministrativefines_en.pdf\n27 EDPB Fine Guidelines, section 7.1, para 135.\n28 EDPB Fine Guidelines, section 7.3, paras 142 – 143.\n\nPage 64 of 90\n\n\fsubject to maximum fine amounts which are fixed (described as “static\nmaximum amounts”)29.\n\nUndertakings with total worldwide annual\n\nturnover of more than EUR 500 million are subject to maximum fine\namounts expressed as a percentage of the undertaking’s total worldwide\nannual turnover30 (described as “dynamic maximum amounts”).\n\n(c)\n\nSimilar to section 48J(6) of the PDPA, article 83(2) of the GDPR lists\nvarious factors that EU supervisory authorities must give “due regard to”\nwhen deciding on the amount of the administrative fine to be imposed,\nwhich largely overlaps with section 48J(6) of the PDPA, and does not\nexplicitly state that the size of an undertaking’s annual turnover should\nbe considered when determining the administrative fine quantum.\n\n(d)\n\nHowever, in EDPB Binding Decision 1/2021 on the dispute arisen on the\ndraft decision of the Irish Supervisory Authority regarding WhatsApp\nIreland under Article 65(1)(a) GDPR31, the EDPB made clear that the\nsize of an undertaking’s turnover was not just relevant to determining the\nmaximum fine that could be lawfully imposed under the GDPR, but was\nalso of relevance in the calculation of the fine amount. The undertaking\n\n29 EUR 10 million for infringements of the provisions listed in Article 83(4), and EUR 20 million for\n\ninfringements of the provisions listed in Articles 83(5) and 83(6).\n30 2% for infringements of the provisions listed in Article 83(4), and 4% for infringements of the provisions\nlisted in Articles 83(5) and 83(6).\n31\nhttps://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp\n_redacted_en.pdf\n\nPage 65 of 90\n\n\fin question, Whatsapp Ireland Limited (“WhatsApp IE”), made\narguments that were substantively similar to those made by the\nOrganisation in respect of section 48J of the PDPA:\n\n“407. WhatsApp IE’s position is that “[the] sole relevance of\nturnover for the purpose of Article 83 GDPR is to ensure that any\nproposed fine - once calculated - does not exceed the maximum\nfining caps set out in Articles 83(4) to (6) GDPR.” Furthermore,\nWhatsApp IE states that “turnover is not a relevant factor to take\ninto account as part of the Article 83(2) GDPR assessment”\nbecause this provision “prescriptively lists the relevant factors that\ncan be taken into account and the legislature chose not to include\nturnover as a specific factor”. WhatsApp IE rejects the notion that\n“sensitivity to punishment needs to be taken into account and that\nthe fine needs to have a noticeable impact on the profits of an\nundertaking”, as was raised by the (German Supervisory\nAuthority). Moreover, in WhatsApp IE’s view “such an\ninterpretation would be contrary to legal certainty as such a\nprecise factor should have been expressly included in Article\n83(2) GDPR”.”\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nPage 66 of 90\n\n\f(e)\n\nThe EDPB rejected Whatsapp IE’s arguments and explained the\nrelevance of turnover, as follows:\n\n“408. “Turnover” is mentioned explicitly in Article 83(4)-(6) GDPR,\nin connection with the calculation of the maximum fine amount\napplicable to undertakings with a total annual turnover in the\nprevious financial year that amounts to more than 500 million\nEUR (the dynamic maximum fine amount). The aim is clear: to\nensure an effective, appropriate and dissuasive fine can be\napplied to deter even to the largest undertakings. The Guidelines\non Administrative Fines state that “[i]n order to impose fines that\nare effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the supervisory\nauthority shall use for the definition of the notion of an undertaking\nas provided for by the CJEU for the purposes of the application of\nArticle 101 and 102 TFEU”. The connection is made between the\nsize of the undertaking, measured in terms of turnover, and the\nmagnitude a fine needs to have in order to be effective,\nproportionate and dissuasive. In other words, the size of an\nundertaking - measured in terms of turnover - matters.\n\n409. Though it is true that neither Article 83(2) GDPR nor Article\n83(3) GDPR refer to the notion of turnover, drawing from this an\n\nPage 67 of 90\n\n\fabsolute conclusion that turnover may be considered exclusively\nto calculate the maximum fine amount is unsustainable in law.\nFirstly, including a reference to turnover in these provisions is\nunnecessary, as on the one hand all fines - whether set close to\nthe upper limit or far below it - must be set at a level that is\neffective, proportionate and dissuasive (cf. Article 83(1) GDPR),\nand on the other hand the dynamic maximum fine amount sets\nout the limits within which the (Supervisory Authorities) may\nexercise their fining power. Secondly, it would be internally\ncontradictory for the GDPR to introduce a dynamic upper limit to\nfines, while at the same time prohibiting supervisory authorities\nfrom assessing whether a fine might need to be increased or\ndecreased in light of the turnover of a company - again - to ensure\nit is effective, proportionate and dissuasive (cf. Article 83(1)\nGDPR).\n\n410. The words “due regard shall be given to the following” in\nArticle 83(2) GDPR by themselves do not indicate the list is an\nexhaustive one. The wording of Article 83(2)(k) GDPR, which\nallows for any other aggravating or mitigating factor to be taken\ninto account - even though not explicitly described - supports this\nview.\nPage 68 of 90\n\n\f411. The application of a dynamic maximum fine amount is not a\nnovelty in EU law, as this is a well- established notion in European\ncompetition law. While the EDPB concedes there are differences\nbetween both systems, the similarities are such that CJEU case\nlaw from the field of competition law may serve to clarify a number\nof questions on the application of the GDPR. In particular, the\nEDPB notes that taking into consideration turnover - as one\nrelevant element among others - for the calculation of fines is an\naccepted practice in the field of competition law.\n\n412. In light of all of the above, the EDPB takes the view that the\nturnover of an undertaking is not exclusively relevant for the\ndetermination of the maximum fine amount in accordance with\nArticle 83(4)-(6) GDPR, but it may also be considered for the\ncalculation of the fine itself, where appropriate, to ensure the fine\nis effective, proportionate and dissuasive in accordance with\nArticle 83(1) GDPR. The EDPB therefore instructs the (Irish\nSupervisory Authority) to take this into account in the present\ncase in the context of amending its Draft Decision on the basis of\nthis binding decision.”\n\n(emphasis added; internal citations omitted)\n\nPage 69 of 90\n\n\f(f)\n\nIn the Commission’s view, the reasoning above is equally persuasive in\nrespect of section 48J of the PDPA. It would be internally contradictory\nfor section 48J of the PDPA to set a maximum financial penalty\nexpressed as a percentage of the organisation’s turnover, while at the\nsame time prohibiting the Commission from considering that turnover to\nassess the size of the financial penalty.\n\nThe Commission’s decision on Organisation’s representations on unequal treatment\n\n78\n\nThe Organisation cites the Court of Appeal’s decision in Syed Suhail bin Syed\n\nZin v Attorney-General [2021] 1 SLR 809 (CA) (“Syed Suhail”) as basis for its\narguments that it has been unequally treated in the meaning of Article 12(1). In Syed\nSuhail, the Court of Appeal set out a 2-step framework to determine whether decisions\ntaken by an executive body (such as the Commission) infringed Article 12(1):\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, are the persons allegedly discriminated between equally situated,\nsuch that any differential treatment calls for justification? This is a factual\nenquiry. If the persons allegedly discriminated between are not equally\nsituated, there is no contravention of Article 12(1).\n\n(b)\n\nSecond, if the persons allegedly discriminated between are equally\nsituated, was differential treatment by the executive body reasonable?\n\nPage 70 of 90\n\n\f79\n\nSimply put, the Syed Suhail test requires persons in like situations to be treated\n\nalike32. Applying the test in Syed Suhail, the Commission disagrees that the\nOrganisation has been subject to any unlawful discrimination.\n\n80\n\nFirst, the Organisation has not identified another equally situated organisation\n\nwhich the Commission has treated differently. While the Organisation asserts that its\npreliminary financial penalty was higher than those imposed in the Precedent Cases\n(which concerned breaches of a similar or worse severity), those organisations were\nnot equally situated with the Organisation, as they were subject to a different statutory\nfinancial penalty regime.\n\n81\n\nUnder section 48J(3) of the PDPA read with regulation 10A of the Enforcement\n\nRegulations, for organisations in the High Turnover Class, only contraventions\n\n32 The Court of Appeal elaborated on the analytical approach to the first step of the Syed Suhail test in\n\nAttorney-General v Datchinamurthy a/l Kataiah [2022] SGCA 46 at [30]:\n“30 (…) (I)n ascertaining whether persons are equally situated, the court is to have regard to\nthe nature of the executive action in question (…) and consider whether, in that context, the\npersons being compared are so situated that it is reasonable to consider that they should be\nsimilarly treated. Put another way, the test is a factual one of whether a prudent person would\nobjectively think the persons concerned are roughly equivalent or similarly situated in all\nmaterial respects (…). Here, the notion of being equally situated is “an analytical tool used to\nisolate the purported rationale for differential treatment, so that its legitimacy may then be\nassessed properly”; the first limb of the test in (Syed Suhail) being intended to identify the\n“purported criterion for the differential treatment in question” (…). The subsequent question,\nunder the second limb of the test, would then be whether the differential treatment was\nreasonable.”\n(emphasis added, internal citations omitted)\n\nPage 71 of 90\n\n\foccurring on or after 1 October 2022 are subject to the increased maximum financial\npenalty of 10% of the organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore. In all other cases\n(including contraventions by organisations in the High Turnover Class which occur\nbefore 1 October 2022), the maximum financial penalty remains at S$1 million. The\ncontraventions in the Precedent Cases all occurred before 1 October 2022.\nAccordingly, even though those organisations were in the High Turnover Class, they\nwere not equally situated with the Organisation under the section 48J regime.\n\n82\n\nSecond, it suffices to say that organisations with different sizes of turnover –\n\nparticularly, organisations within the High Turnover Class with different sizes of\nturnover - are not equally situated. For the reasons stated above, the size of an\norganisation’s turnover is a relevant factor that informs the exercise of the\nCommission’s discretion under section 48J of the PDPA. If the size of an\norganisation’s turnover is a relevant consideration, differentiating between\norganisations on the basis of this relevant consideration is legitimate and lawful. The\nanalysis ends at the first stage of the Syed Suhail test.\n\n83\n\nThird, even if the Organisation is considered to be equally situated to all other\n\norganisations in the High Turnover Class (such that the analysis proceeds to the\nsecond stage of the Syed Suhail test), differentiating financial penalties based on\norganisations’ turnovers bears a rational relation to, and indeed promotes, section\n\nPage 72 of 90\n\n\f48J’s object of ensuring effective deterrence of contraventions of the PDPA. If the\nfinancial penalty is too small, large organisations may simply factor the risk of a low\npenalty as part of the cost of doing business. This would rob the financial penalty of\nits intended deterrent effect and be inimical to the aim of ensuring that contraventions\nof the PDPA do not recur.\n\n84\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation’s representations alleging unequal\n\ntreatment in the quantification of the preliminary financial penalty are not accepted.\n\nThe Organisation’s other representation on the use of turnover in determining financial\npenalties\n\n85\n\nFor completeness, the Commission addresses the Organisation’s contention\n\nthat quantifying financial penalties based on turnover may incentivise large\norganisations to structure their data processing in such a way that would result in\nsmaller subsidiaries being legally responsible for the Data Protection Obligations.\n\n86\n\nTo the extent that organisations remain responsible for personal data\n\nprocessed on their behalf and for their purposes by a data intermediary33, the\nCommission does not consider this to militate against a turnover-based approach to\n\n33 Section 4(3) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 73 of 90\n\n\fquantifying financial penalties. Ultimately, the Commission will scrutinise the\nsubstance of the arrangements between organisations and their data intermediaries\nto determine for whose benefit the personal data is being processed, and where (and\nto what extent) control resides. Should the Commission determine that organisations\nhave deliberately structured their internal data processing to avoid or minimise liability\nfor poor data protection practices, it will not hesitate to take such conduct into account\nin determining the amount of any financial penalty imposed.\n\nThe Commission’s Financial Penalty Framework\n\n87\n\nIn its representations, the Organisation suggested that the Commission had\n\ndetermined the preliminary financial penalty arbitrarily and without reference to any\nobjective computation framework. This is not the case, and the Commission takes this\nopportunity to elaborate on key aspects of its analytical framework for determining the\namount of financial penalties to be imposed under section 48J of the PDPA (the “FP\nFramework”).\n\nGuiding Principles\n\n88\n\nThe Commission is guided by principles distilled from sources including: (a) the\n\nlanguage and structure of the PDPA, (b) Parliamentary intent as expressed in the\nSecond Reading speeches during the enactment and amendment of the PDPA, (c)\nPage 74 of 90\n\n\fthe practices of foreign data protection authorities in administering similar financial\npenalty regimes, and (iv) jurisprudence from the Singapore courts in the domain of\ncriminal sentencing (with the necessary adjustments for the difference in statutory\ncontext).\n\n89\n\nDeterrence & Proportionality: First, as expressed in section 48J(h) of the\n\nPDPA, the primary competing considerations at the heart of the FP Framework are\nthat financial penalties must be large enough to deter non-compliance effectively, but\nnot too large such that they are not proportionate to the seriousness of the noncompliance. The Commission acknowledged this inherent tension in KTT at [40]:\n“In quantifying the financial penalty to be imposed in any given case, the\nCommission aims to strike a careful balance between an amount that is (i)\nproportionate to the circumstances and effect of the organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA but (ii) that remains effective as a deterrent when\nconsidering the means of the organisation.”\n\n90\n\nBalancing interests: Second, in considering the relative weight to be given to\n\neffective deterrence and proportionality, the Commission must be mindful of the\noverarching balance that the PDPA itself aims to strike between the right of individuals\n\nPage 75 of 90\n\n\fto protect their personal data and the need of organisations to collect, use or disclose\npersonal data for legitimate purposes34.\n\n91\n\nAs expressed by the then-Minister during the Second Reading of the Personal\n\nData Protection (Amendment) Bill, the ultimate purpose of effective enforcement of the\nData Protection Obligations is to strengthen consumer trust with greater organisational\naccountability for personal data protection, so as to enhance Singapore’s standing as\na trusted global hub for international data flows and digital transactions35. Put\ndifferently, financial penalties imposed under the PDPA are not ends in themselves to\npunish errant organisations. They are a regulatory tool for organisations to take greater\naccountability for data protection, which in turn gives individuals greater confidence to\nentrust their personal data to organisations. Ultimately, this promotes a trusted\necosystem of personal data flows between individuals and organisations.\n\n92\n\nLike and consistent treatment: Third, the Commission must give effect to the\n\ntwo-tiered financial penalty regime created by section 48J(3) of the PDPA (i.e.\ndifferential treatment of the Low Turnover Class and High Turnover Class). The twotier regime suggests that the size of an organisation’s turnover should be accorded\n\n34 Section 3 of the PDPA.\n35 See [72(a)] above.\n\nPage 76 of 90\n\n\fmore weight for organisations in the High Turnover Class. Other relevant factors must\nbe given similar weight in similar cases.\n\n93\n\nSpecific application: Fourth, the FP Framework must not be applied\n\nmechanistically without sensitivity to the particular facts and circumstances of a given\ncase. The determination of a financial penalty is a multi-faceted, and necessarily factspecific exercise. All the factors set out in section 48J(6) of the PDPA, including any\nother relevant factors not specifically listed therein, must be taken into account. While\nthe principles underpinning the FP Framework must be applied consistently, this is not\na mathematical exercise and the Commission must have room to make adjustments\nand give appropriate weight to factors based on their specific relevance to the\norganisation and contravention in question36.\n\n94\n\nWhile the Commission is sharing details of its FP Framework in order to provide\n\nguidance, nothing set out below should be construed as creating any expectation that\nthe Commission will or will not take any particular course of action in a future case, as\nevery case requires individual consideration. The FP Framework is a guide and does\nnot limit or restrict the full extent of the Commission’s powers under the PDPA,\n\n36 Drawing from the principles stated by the High Court in Syed Fathuddin Putra bin Syed a Rahman v\n\nPublic Prosecutor and another appeal [2024] 3 SLR 1672.\n\nPage 77 of 90\n\n\fparticularly in administering and enforcing the PDPA. The FP Framework may be\nupdated and supplemented by the Commission as appropriate.\n\nThe FP Framework\n\n95\n\nThe Commission’s FP Framework consists of a preliminary step followed by a\n\nfive-step methodology to calculate the appropriate financial penalty.\n\nPreliminary Step – Determining the Case Max FP\n96\n\nAt the outset, the Commission ascertains the statutory maximum financial\n\npenalty (“Statutory Max FP”) from section 48J(3) of the PDPA:\n\n(a)\n\nFor organisations in the Low Turnover Class, the Statutory Max FP is\n$1,000,000; and\n\n(b)\n\nFor organisations in the High Turnover Class, the Statutory Max FP is 10%\nof the organisation’s annual turnover in Singapore.\n\n97\n\nThe Commission then applies a percentage rate or quantum cap not exceeding\n\nthe Statutory Max FP based on the nature of the organisation’s contravention of the\nData Protection Obligations, to allow room for adjustments at other stages. In general,\n\nPage 78 of 90\n\n\fintentional contraventions will attract a higher percentage rate than negligent\ncontraventions. This determines the maximum financial penalty considered by the\nCommission in a given case (“Case Max FP”).\n\n98\n\nOnce the Case Max FP is determined, the Commission will proceed to apply\n\nthe five-step methodology of the FP Framework to quantify the appropriate financial\npenalty for each case.\n\nStep 1 – Identifying the level of culpability and harm\n99\n\nFirst, the Commission will identify the level of culpability and harm of the non-\n\ncompliance.\n\n100\n\nConsidering all the relevant factors, the Commission will determine whether the\n\nlevel of culpability is “low”, “medium” or “high”. Some of the factors that go towards\nthe Commission’s assessment of the level of culpability include (but are not limited to):\n\n(a)\n\nThe nature, gravity and duration of the organisation’s non-compliance37;\n\n(b)\n\nIf the organisation’s contravention was negligent, the extent of the\nnegligence; and\n\n37 Section 48J(6)(a) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 79 of 90\n\n\fIf the organisation’s contravention was intentional, factors including the\n\n(c)\n\ndegree of planning and pre-meditation38.\n\n101\n\nConsidering all the relevant factors, the Commission will determine whether the\n\nlevel of harm is “slight”, “moderate” or “severe”. Some of the factors that go\ntowards the Commission’s assessment of the level of harm include (but are not limited\nto):\n\n(a)\n\nThe type, nature and/or sensitivity of the personal data affected39;\n\n(b)\n\nThe gravity of the organisation’s non-compliance40, for example the number\nof affected individuals;\n\n(c)\n\nThe extent of harm or prejudice caused to individuals (if any) as a result of\nthe non-compliance, for example unauthorised disclosure of personal data\nwhich could expose individuals to greater risks of identity theft41;\n\n38\n\nNeo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12 at [18].\n\n39 Section 48J(6)(b) of the PDPA.\n40 Section 48J(6)(a) of the PDPA.\n41 KTT at [38].\n\nPage 80 of 90\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe extent of risks the affected personal data was exposed to as a result of\nthe non-compliance, for example, whether the affected personal data was\nonly accessed, or whether it was publicly disclosed.\n\nStep 2 – Calculating the Starting FP\n102\n\nBased on the level of culpability and harm assessed in Step 1, the Commission\n\nwill identify the indicative levels of culpability and harm to determine the starting range\nand within that range, the approximate starting financial penalty to be imposed\n(“Starting FP”), up to the Case Max FP.\n\nStep 3: Aggravating and mitigating factors\n103\n\nThe Commission will then adjust the Starting FP to account for relevant\n\naggravating and mitigating factors.\n\n104\n\nThe relevant mitigating factors that the Commission may consider include (but\n\nare not limited to):\n\n(a)\n\nwhere the organisation voluntarily takes timely and effective action to\nmitigate the effects and consequences of its non‑compliance42;\n\n42 Section 48J(6)(d) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 81 of 90\n\n\f(b)\n\nwhere the organisation cooperates with the Commission’s investigations43;\n\n(c)\n\nwhere the organisation voluntarily admits to its non-compliance (including\nby way of the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure)44;\n\n(d)\n\nwhere the organisation has, despite its non‑compliance, otherwise\nimplemented adequate and appropriate measures for compliance with the\nPDPA45; and\n\n(e)\n\nwhere the organisation has complied with any direction given by the\nCommission under section 48I or 48L(4) of the PDPA in relation to\nremedying or mitigating the effect of the non‑compliance46.\n\n105\n\nThe relevant aggravating factors that the Commission may consider include\n\n(but are not limited to):\n\n(a)\n\nwhere the organisation has previously failed to comply with the PDPA47;\n\n43 PPLingo at [41(d)], Section 48J(6)(j) of the PDPA.\n44 KTT at [35(b)].\n45 Section 48J(6)(e) of the PDPA.\n46 Section 48J(6)(g) of the PDPA.\n47 Section 48J(6)(f) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 82 of 90\n\n\f(b)\n\nWhether the organisation gained any financial benefit or avoided any\nfinancial loss as a result of the non-compliance48;\n\n(c)\n\nwhere the organisation has acted in a dilatory or uncooperative manner\nduring the Commission’s investigations49; and\n\n(d)\n\nwhere the organisation fails to comply with any direction issued by the\nCommission under section 48I or 48L(4) in relation to remedying or\nmitigating the effect of its non-compliance50.\n\nStep 4: Impact of the financial penalty on the organisation\n106\n\nIn Step 4, the Commission will determine whether the imposition of the\n\nproposed financial penalty will affect the organisation’s ability to continue its usual\nactivities51. This is a question of assessing the likely impact of the financial penalty on\nthe financial health of the organisation and will be based on the available evidence,\n\n48\n\nSection 48J(6)(c) of the PDPA.\n\n49 Eatigo at [21] and [27].\n50 Section 48J(6)(g) of the PDPA.\n51 Section 48J(6)(i) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 83 of 90\n\n\fincluding from the representations furnished by the organisation. The financial penalty\nshould not impose a crushing burden or cause undue hardship to the organisation52.\n\n107\n\nIf the Commission assesses that the financial penalty would adversely affect\n\nthe organisation’s ability to continue its usual activities, the Commission may (i) extend\nthe time for payment of the financial penalty, (ii) allow for payment of the financial\npenalty to be made in instalments, or (iii) reduce the amount of the financial penalty.\n\nStep 5 – Final adjustment\n108\n\nFinally, the Commission will take a “last look” at the amount of the financial\n\npenalty derived via Steps 1 to 4, and make any final adjustment to ensure that the\nproposed financial penalty is effective and proportionate53. This does not constitute a\ncarte blanche to wholly revise the derived financial penalty. In most cases, the\nCommission expects that all relevant considerations would have been taken into\naccount as part of Steps 1 to 4. Step 5 merely provides the Commission with a final\nopportunity to consider whether the amount of the financial penalty strikes the\nappropriate\n\nbalance\n\nbetween\n\nachieving\n\neffective\n\ndeterrence\n\nand\n\nensuring\n\nproportionality.\n\n52 Re Jigyasa [2021] SGPDPCR 1; Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11; Neo Yong Xiang\n\n(trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12.\n53 Section 48J(6)(h) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 84 of 90\n\n\fApplication of FP Framework to the present case\n\n109\n\nThe Commission now explains how the FP Framework was applied to\n\ndetermine the appropriate financial penalty to be imposed on the Organisation for its\nnegligent breach of the Protection Obligation, and also address the representations\nmade by the Organisation relating to the preliminary financial penalty.\n\nPreliminary Step – Determining the Case Max FP\n\n110\n\nSince the Organisation is in the High Turnover Class, the applicable Statutory\n\nMaximum FP is 10% of the Organisation’s annual turnover. Based on the nature\nof the Organisation’s negligent contravention of the Protection Obligation, the\nCommission applied the appropriate percentage rate subject to the quantum cap,\nwhich is below the Statutory Max FP, to derive the Case Max FP.\n\nPage 85 of 90\n\n\fStep 1 – Identifying the level of culpability and harm\n\n111\n\nBased on the nature, gravity and duration of the Organisation’s contravention\n\nof the Protection Obligation, the Commission determined the Organisation’s level of\nculpability to be low.\n\n112\n\nBased on the fact that the Incident led to the unauthorised access to, and\n\nexfiltration of the personal data of 665,495 individuals but that the Affected Data only\ncomprised the names, email addresses, phone numbers, countries of residence and\nSRL membership information of the affected individuals, the Commission determined\nthe level of harm to be moderate.\n\nStep 2 – Calculating the Starting FP\n\n113\n\nBased on the specific factors relevant to culpability and harm as assessed in\n\nStep 1, the Commission determined the starting range and approximate starting\nfinancial penalty within the low-moderate band.\n\nPage 86 of 90\n\n\fStep 3 – Mitigating and aggravating factors\n\n114\n\nIn the preliminary decision, the Commission had taken into account the\n\nmitigating factors set out at [30] in applying a reduction to the Starting FP.\n\n115\n\nIn its representations on the Commission’s preliminary decision, the\n\nOrganisation contended that the Commission had not taken into account two\nadditional mitigating factors which warranted a further reduction in the financial\npenalty:\n\n(a)\n\nThis was the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the\nPDPA; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had voluntarily notified all individuals affected by the\nIncident in a reasonably timely manner, going beyond its legal obligation\nunder section 26D(2) of the PDPA.\n\n116\n\nOn (a), the fact that this was the Organisation’s first non-compliance with the\n\nPDPA is merely a neutral factor, and not a relevant factor which merited further\nreduction of the financial penalty. In the Commission’s decision in Redmart Limited\n[2022] SGPDPC 8, the organisation argued that a further reduction in the financial\n\nPage 87 of 90\n\n\fpenalty imposed was merited as the organisation’s non-compliance was its first breach\nof the PDPA, and its first experience of a data breach. The Commission rejected this\nrepresentation on the following basis:\n\n“35\n\nIn calibrating the financial penalty in the preliminary decision, the\n\nCommission had already taken into account the fact that this was the\nOrganisation’s first non-compliance with the PDPA, and no further reduction is\nmerited. In support of its representations, the Organisation also cited Aviva Ltd\nand Toh-Shi Printing Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 15 (“Aviva\"), where\nthe Commission had taken into account the fact that the breach of the\nProtection Obligation by the organisation was its second breach in\napproximately one year, and both data breach incidents involved similar fact\npatterns and causes. In Aviva, the Commission had considered the\norganisation’s previous non-compliance as a contributory factor that justifies an\nincrease in the financial penalty meted as the organisation had failed to improve\nits data protection practices. In contrast, the lack of antecedents in this instance\nmeans that the Commission did not increase the financial penalty imposed on\nthe Organisation. To be clear, the absence of an antecedent does not, ipso\nfacto, merit a reduction in the financial penalty imposed.”\n(emphasis added)\n\nPage 88 of 90\n\n\f117\n\nOn (b), the Commission appreciates that the Organisation’s voluntary\n\nnotification to all affected individuals (despite not being legally obligated to do so under\nsection 26D(2) of the PDPA), would have enabled affected individuals to take prompt\nsteps to safeguard their interests. When organisations involved in data breaches\nvoluntarily notify affected individuals, they demonstrate accountability for their data\nprotection practices. The Commission therefore accords some additional mitigatory\nweight to this factor.\n\n118\n\nConsidering the matters raised in the Organisation’s representations, the\n\nCommission also accords greater mitigatory weight to the overall prompt and voluntary\nremedial measures taken by the Organisation, including containment of the Incident\nwithin one day of its discovery.\n\n119\n\nTaking into consideration these further factors, the Commission reduces the\n\nfinancial penalty to $315,000.\n\nStep 4 – Impact of the financial penalty on the organisation\n\n120\n\nThe Commission assesses that the proposed financial penalty of $315,000\n\nwould not adversely affect the ability of the Organisation to continue its usual activities.\n\nPage 89 of 90\n\n\fStep 5 – Final Adjustment\n\n121\n\nHaving taken into consideration all relevant circumstances of the case, the\n\nCommission determines that no further adjustment to the financial penalty is required.\n\nThe Commission’s final decision\n\n122\n\nHaving considered the Organisation’s representations, the Commissioner\n\ndetermines that the financial penalty imposed should be reduced to $315,000.\n\n123\n\nThe Organisation shall pay the financial penalty of $315,000 within 30 days\n\nfrom the date of the notice accompanying this decision, failing which interest at the\nrate specified in the Rules of Court 2021 in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and\nbe payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 90 of 90\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to the Management Corporation - Strata Title Plan No. 4599 for failing to develop and implement policies and practices that are necessary to meet its obligations under the PDPA.","tags":["Accountability","Directions","Others","MCST"],"date":"07 Aug 2025","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_mcst-4599_19052025.pdf","nature":"Accountability","title":"Breach of the Accountability Obligation by MCST 4599","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2025/08/breach-of-the-accountability-obligation-by-mcst-4599","timestamp":"2025-08-07","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n2025 SGPDPC 3\n\nCase No. DP-2405-C2318\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nThe Management Corporation - Strata Title Plan No. 4599\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n1\n\n\fThe Management Corporation - Strata Title Plan No. 4599\n2025 SGPDPC 3\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2405-C2318\n19 May 2025\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nOn 4 May 2024, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\n\nreceived a complaint from an individual (the “Complainant”) against The Management\nCorporation - Strata Title Plan No. 4599 (“Organisation”) about the Organisation’s\nrejection of the Complainant’s access request to closed-circuit television camera\n(“CCTV”) footage involving the Complainant (“4 May 2024 Complaint”). On 25 June\n2024, the Commission received a complaint from the Complainant on the\nOrganisation’s failure to retain CCTV footage involving the Complainant.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation is the management corporation of The Scotts Tower\n\nCondominium (the “Condominium”), and has the control, management and\nadministration of the Condominium’s common property. The Organisation had\nappointed Knight Frank Property & Facilities Management Pte. Ltd. (“KFPFM”) as the\nmanaging agent of the Condominium between 28 April 2023 and 31 May 2024. From\n1 June 2024, the Organisation appointed Ohmyhome Property Management Pte Ltd\n(“Ohmyhome”) as the managing agent of the Condominium.\n2\n\n\f3\n\nAt the time of the Incident, KFPFM was the Organisation’s data intermediary,\n\nas it processed data on behalf of the Organisation when carrying out its duties,\nincluding handling access requests. KFPFM’s capacity as a data intermediary was\nalso recorded in the Managing Agent Agreement between itself and the Organisation.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation had also appointed a security company to, amongst other\n\nthings, operate CCTVs that record footage of areas around the Condominium.\n\nThe Incident\n\n5\n\nOn 13 April 2024, the Complainant was involved in a traffic accident on Cairnhill\n\nRoad, alongside the Condominium.\n\n6\n\nOn 25 April 2024, the Complainant wrote to KFPFM to request access to\n\nfootage involving himself which was captured by the Condominium’s CCTV cameras\nat the time of the accident (“Access Request”).\n\n7\n\nOn the same day, KFPFM instructed the security company to review and\n\ndownload CCTV footage that captured the accident on 13 April 2024 (“CCTV\nFootage”). While the security company confirmed that the Condominium’s CCTV\ncamera did capture the CCTV Footage, it was unable to download the footage\nbecause it did not have the requisite administrator credentials.\n\n8\n\nOn 29 April 2024, KFPFM informed the Organisation of the access request and\n\nrequested for the Organisation’s instructions on its response.\n\n9\n\nIn the meantime, as the Condominium’s CCTV system only retained footage\n\nfor 17 days, the CCTV Footage was automatically overwritten on 30 April 2024. On 2\n3\n\n\fMay 2024 , KFPFM on behalf of the Organisation notified the Complainant of its refusal\nof the Access Request. This led to the 4 May 2024 Complaint, in which the\nComplainant claimed that the Access Request was wrongfully denied. On 25 June\n2024, the Complainant again wrote to the Commission, asserting that KFPFM,\nOhmyhome and/or the Organisation failed to preserve the personal data that the\nComplainant requested for.\n\n10\n\nFrom 4 May 2024 to 4 August 2024, the Commission engaged the parties to\n\nseek clarification on facts and to ascertain the nature of the Complainant’s grievances\nwith the Organisation, KFPFM, and/or Ohmyhome. As will be elaborated below, since\nthe CCTV Footage had been overwritten and was no longer in the Organisation’s\npossession or control, the Commission was unable to make any directions as regard\ngranting access to it pursuant to section 48H of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”). Nevertheless, based on the facts provided, the Commission commenced\nan investigation to determine the Organisation’s compliance with the PDPA.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nThe Access Obligation under section 21 of the PDPA\n\n11\n\nSection 21 of the PDPA (the “Access Obligation”) requires an organisation to\n\nprovide as soon as reasonably possible, upon request by an individual, personal data\nabout the individual that is in its possession or under its control1. By the time the\nComplainant filed his complaint with the Commission on 4 May 2024, the CCTV\nFootage had been overwritten and was no longer in the Organisation’s possession or\n\n1 The exceptions and exemptions to this obligation are set out at sections 21(2) and (3) and the Fifth\n\nSchedule of the PDPA.\n4\n\n\funder its control. The Commission therefore was not able to make a determination on\nwhether the Complainant should have been provided access to the CCTV Footage.\nNevertheless,\n\nthe\n\nCommission\n\nmakes\n\nthe\n\nfollowing\n\nobservations\n\non\n\nthe\n\nOrganisation’s handling of the Access Request. In denying the Access Request, the\nOrganisation sought to rely on the exception in section 21(3)(c) of the PDPA, which\nstates that an organisation must not provide an individual with the individual’s personal\ndata if the personal data could reasonably be expected to reveal personal data about\nanother individual.\n\n12\n\nIn this regard, personal data about an individual may be disclosed without\n\nconsent where such personal data is publicly available.2 This includes situations\nwhere, in providing an individual access to his / her personal data, an organisation\nwould also disclose the personal data of another individual that is also publicly\navailable. Where the CCTV Footage was of a public road alongside the Condominium,\nany personal data captured therein would have been publicly available. The\nCommission has provided express guidance with examples in its Advisory Guidelines\non the PDPA for Selected Topics (Revised 23 May 2024), at [4.48-4.50]. 3\n\n13\n\nIn any case, it was open to the Organisation to mask the images of other\n\nindividuals in the CCTV Footage before providing access to the Complainant. The fact\nthat the personal data of other individuals may appear in CCTV footage does not\noperate as an automatic justification for a blanket refusal to grant access. When met\nwith an access request, organisations are expected to take steps to comply with the\nAccess Obligation, including considering whether other individuals’ personal data can\n\n2 See section 17(1) and Part 2 of the First Schedule to the PDPA.\n3 See also the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Revised 16 May\n\n2022), at [15.34].\n5\n\n\fbe masked or omitted when providing access, instead of denying access outright.\nOrganisations are entitled to charge reasonable fees for services provided to an\naccess request applicant to enable the organisation to respond to the applicant’s\nrequest.4\n\n14\n\nAnother justification relied upon by the Organisation to deny access was that\n\nsection 47(1)(b)(viii) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004\n(“BMSMA”) applies when a request for access to CCTV footage is made. This\nprovision requires a management corporation to make available for inspection any\nrecord or document in its custody or under its control, where an application is made\nby one of the following – (a) a subsidiary management corporation; (b) a subsidiary\nproprietor or mortgagee; (c) prospective purchaser; or (d) a mortgagee of that lot or by\na person authorised. The Organisation asserted that as the Complainant did not fall\nwithin any of the above categories of persons, it was not obliged to avail the CCTV\nFootage to the Complainant.\n\n15\n\nThis is misconceived. Provisions of such other written law shall prevail over\n\nprovisions of the PDPA to the extent that there are inconsistencies.5 However, in this\ncase, there is no inconsistency between the Complainant making the Access Request\nto the Organisation and section 47 of the BMSMA, which only applies when a person\nentitled under that provision e.g. a subsidiary proprietor, applies to inspect the CCTV\nfootage.6 Since the Complainant did not fall within any of the above categories of\npersons, his Access Request should have been handled under section 21 of the\nPDPA.\n\n4 Regulation 7 of the Personal Data Protection Regulations 2021\n5 Section 4(6)(c) of the PDPA.\n6 See Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 4436 [2018] SGPDPC 18 at [14].\n\n6\n\n\f16\n\nGiven the circumstances surrounding the Organisation’s handling of the\n\nIncident, the Commission focused its investigation on determining the Organisation’s\ncompliance with sections 22A, 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA.\n\nPreservation of personal data when processing an access request\n\n17\n\nThe Commission considered whether the Organisation’s deletion of the CCTV\n\nFootage amounted to a breach of section 22A of the PDPA, which provides that where\nan organisation refuses to provide access to personal data upon request, it is required\nto preserve a copy of the personal data for not less than 30 days from the date of\nrefusal, i.e. the date on which the organisation notifies the individual of its refusal. 7\nSection 22A presumes that, as an organisation can only provide access to personal\ndata in its possession or control, it may only refuse access to existing personal data\nthat is still in its possession or control.\n\n18\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation did refuse access, but the CCTV Footage\n\nno longer existed on the date the Organisation communicated its refusal. If the CCTV\nFootage was deleted after the Organisation’s refusal, the Organisation may have been\nfound in breach of section 22A. However, since the CCTV Footage no longer existed\non the date of the Organisation’s refusal, the Commission does not make this finding.\nNevertheless, the Commission has found the Organisation in breach of section 12 of\nthe PDPA for its failure to implement proper processes to handle access requests\n(addressed below).\n\nThe Accountability Obligation under sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA\n\n7 See Section 22A of the PDPA read with Regulation 8 of the Personal Data Protection Regulations\n\n2021.\n7\n\n\f19\n\nBased on the manner in which the Access Request was handled, the\n\nCommission also focused its investigation on whether the Organisation had breached\nits obligations under sections 11(3) and 12 of the PDPA (the “Accountability\nObligation”). Section 11(3) of the PDPA requires an organisation to designate one or\nmore individuals, a data protection officer (“DPO”), to be responsible for ensuring\ncompliance with the PDPA.8 Section 12 of the PDPA requires an organisation to,\namongst other things, develop and implement policies and practices that are\nnecessary for the organisation to meet the obligations of the organisation under the\nPDPA.\n\n20\n\nThe Organisation was determined to have breached the Accountability\n\nObligation in two respects.\n\nFailure to develop and implement policies and practices\n\n21\n\nThe importance of developing and implementing policies and practices has\n\nbeen repeatedly emphasised.9 In the Advisory Guidelines for Management\nCorporations (revised 17 May 2022) (“MCST Guidelines”), the Commission\nspecifically stated that MCSTs are required to develop and implement policies and\npractices that are necessary for it to meet its obligations under the PDPA.10 While the\nMCST may delegate certain data protection duties and functions to the managing\nagent, the MCST remains fully responsible for complying with the PDPA.11\n\n8 See also the Advisory Guidelines for Management Corporations Guidelines (revised 17 May 2022)\n\nat [2.6].\n9 See Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [32], and M Stars Movers & Logistics [2017] SGPDPC 15 at\n[31] to [37].\n10\nSee [2.6]\n11 See MCST No. 4375 [2020] SGPDPC 4; and the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines for\nManagement Corporations (revised 17 May 2022) at [2.6] to [2.8]\n8\n\n\f22\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Organisation did not develop and implement its\n\nown data protection policy. When requested to provide a copy of the Organisation’s\npersonal data policy and internal guidelines, the Organisation provided its managing\nagent Ohmyhome’s Personal Data Protection Policy instead. This policy was\ndeveloped to address the needs of Ohmyhome, and was not conceived to meet the\nOrganisation’s needs. The policy did not, for example, address how access requests\nmade by data subjects to the Organisation shall be handled. An organisation’s data\nprotection policy must be contextualised to its own operational setting and practices.12\nIt is insufficient for the organisation to simply take reference from or outsource\ncompliance with the PDPA to its managing agent.\n\n23\n\nIn addition, the Organisation gave no written instructions or standard operating\n\nprocedure to its managing agents or its security company on how they should handle\nrequests for access to personal data, including requests for access to CCTV footage.\nIf the Organisation had applied its mind to this issue, it would have also identified that\nthe security company did not have the requisite administrator credentials to download\nCCTV footage, and would have rectified that gap.\n\n24\n\nIn light of the above, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of section\n\n12 of the PDPA.\n\nFailure to designate data protection officer\n\n25\n\nThe Organisation admitted that they had not appointed a DPO at the time of the\n\nIncident, and is therefore in breach of section 11(3) of the PDPA.\n\n12 See Tiger Airways and others [2017] SGPDPC 6 at [33].\n\n9\n\n\f26\n\nThe Commission notes that following the Incident, the Organisation has since\n\nappointed a DPO to be responsible for ensuring compliance with the PDPA.\n\n27\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation is found to have negligently breached\n\nthe Accountability Obligation by (i) failing to develop and implement policies and\npractices that are necessary for the Organisation to meet its obligations under the\nPDPA; and (ii) failing to designate one or more individuals to be responsible for\nensuring that the Organisation complies with the PDPA.\n\nNo breach of the PDPA by KFPFM\n\n28\n\nThe Access and Accountability Obligations do not apply to data intermediaries.\n\nThe Commission’s assessment is therefore focused on the Organisation’s compliance\nwith the PDPA. The Commission also notes that KFPFM had consulted the\nOrganisation on the Access Request, and had requested for the Organisation’s\ninstructions on a response.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n29\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Commission hereby\n\ndirects the Organisation to carry out the following within 60 days:\n(a)\n\nDevelop and implement policies necessary to meet its obligations\nunder section 12 of the PDPA;\n\n(b)\n\nPut in place procedures for the management of CCTV footage upon\nreceipt of requests under section 21 of the PDPA for access to personal\ndata that may be captured in the footage;\n10\n\n\f(c)\n\nCommunicate the policies and procedures in (a) and (b) to relevant\nstakeholders such as its data intermediaries and contractors; and\n\n(d)\n\nFurnish to the Commission a written update within 7 days of the\ncompletion of the above directions.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"The Institute of Mental Health was found not in breach of the PDPA in relation to an incident which occurred on or about 20 March 2024 whereby a research officer approached and identified the complainant by his full name to seek consent for participation in a medical study.","tags":["Consent","Not in Breach","Healthcare","Consent"],"date":"31 Jul 2025","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_institute-of-mental-health_21052025.pdf","nature":"Consent","title":"No Breach of the Consent Obligation by Institute of Mental Health","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2025/07/no-breach-of-the-consent-obligation-by-institute-of-mental-health","timestamp":"2025-07-31","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2025] SGPDPC 1\n\nCase No. DP-2404-C2257\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nInstitute of Mental Health\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 14\n\n\fInstitute of Mental Health\n\n[2025] SGPDPC 1\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2404-C2257\n21 May 2025\nIntroduction\n1.\n\nThe Complainant lodged a complaint against the Institute of Mental Health (the\n\n“Organisation”) with the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\non 5 April 2024 for using his personal data without consent. The Commission\ncommenced investigations to determine if the Organisation had complied with the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”). The Commission had conducted its\ninvestigations and issued an initial Decision on 15 November 2024. However, the\nComplainant subsequently brought certain new material facts to the Commission’s\nattention. These facts were not part of the Complainant’s evidence prior to the\nissuance of the initial Decision. Nevertheless, the Commission conducted further\ninvestigations and amended the Decision to clarify the relevant factual background\nand the basis of the Commission’s decision.\n\nFacts\n2.\n\nOn 20 March 2024, the Complainant was waiting to see a doctor at the waiting\n\narea of the Organisation’s clinic. A research officer (“RO”) from the Organisation\napproached the Complainant and identified the Complainant by his full name. The RO\nsought the Complainant’s consent to participate in a study relating to certain medical\nconditions affecting outpatients at tertiary psychiatric hospitals (“Study”). The\nComplainant lodged a complaint with the Organisation that day, seeking an\nPage 2 of 14\n\n\fexplanation as to why the doctor had disclosed his name and health condition and/or\nhistory to the RO, without his consent (the “Incident”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation replied to the Complainant on 12 April 2024, explaining that\n\nthe RO had approached the Complainant’s attending doctor on the day of his\nappointment for the names of suitable participants in the Study and their appointment\ntimes. The Organisation assured the Complainant that the attending doctor had only\nprovided the names of suitable participants to the RO and the RO was not provided\nwith other personal data such as the participants’ medical information (i.e. diagnosis\nor treatment).\n\n4.\n\nAs part of our investigations, the Commission interviewed both the attending\n\ndoctor and the RO. The attending doctor explained that the RO had approached him\nfor participants in the Study and the RO was looking for patients of a particular age\ngroup and medical profile. The attending doctor then provided the names of suitable\nparticipants and their appointment times at the clinic to the RO. Armed with the names\nof the potential participants in the Study and their appointment times, the RO then\nsearched for these potential participants’ queue numbers in the Organisation’s\ndatabase to locate their whereabouts in the Organisation. The RO proceeded to the\nwaiting area and identified the Complainant after spotting his queue number on his\nhospital slip, approached the Complainant to enquire whether he might be interested\nin joining the Study, and was rebuffed.\n\n5.\n\nInvestigations established that at the time of the Incident, the Organisation had\n\nplaced a notification prominently at the manned registration counters, payment and\npharmacy counters in the clinic, which are high traffic areas and therefore highly likely\nPage 3 of 14\n\n\fto be visible to all patients visiting the clinic. The notification states amongst other\nthings, that “We may use your personal data to invite you to participate in suitable care\nprogrammes or shortlist you for participation in relevant research studies” (the\n“Notification”). The Organisation had placed these Notifications in the clinic since\n2014. In this regard, the Commission notes that the Complainant has visited the same\nclinic since 2013 and was visiting the clinic at regular intervals immediately prior to the\ndate of the Incident.\n\nIssues for Determination\n6.\n\nFirst, it is important to clarify at the outset that while the Complainant was\n\naggrieved by the disclosure of his health condition and history and other personal data\nby his attending doctor to the RO, this does not constitute a disclosure of personal\ndata under the PDPA. Section 4(1)(b) of the PDPA provides that the data protection\nobligations apply to the organisation handling the data and not on individual\nemployees acting in the course of their employment. Since it is not in dispute that both\nthe attending doctor and the RO are employees of the Organisation, there was no\ndisclosure of the Complainant’s personal data by the Organisation to third parties.\n\n7.\n\nThe Commission wishes to point out that public health care providers in\n\nSingapore routinely provide care or carry out other care-related activities in a team\nsetting. It is therefore not possible for a patient to expect that his/her medical\ninformation would not be shared or disclosed in some form to other members of the\nclinical team, or shared, disclosed to or deduced by other employees in non-clinical\nroles. Having said that, the Organisation also needs to ensure that it only uses an\nindividual’s personal data after having obtained the necessary consent and that its\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\femployees’ access to an individual’s medical information is strictly confined to a needto-know basis.\n\n8.\n\nHence, for the purpose of this assessment, the Commission is concerned\n\nultimately with the Organisation’s use of the Complainant’s personal data to identify\nand approach him as a potential candidate for participation in the Study (the “Study\nRecruitment Purpose”).\n\n9.\n\nSecond, with respect to the personal data affected, the Commission disagrees\n\nwith the Organisation’s response that the Organisation had only used the names of\npotential participants that may be recruited for the Study and that no other personal\ndata, such as the medical information and age of potential participants had been used.\nIn the Commission’s view, the Organisation would only be able to approach and recruit\npotential participants for the Study after assessing that these potential participants are\nof a particular age group, suffer or suffered from a medical condition related to the\nStudy, and fit the parameters of the Study.\n\nDeputy Commissioner’s Decision\n10.\n\nThe Commission is of the view that the following issue arises for determination\n\n– Whether the Organisation obtained the Complainant’s consent or deemed consent\nby notification before using his personal data for the Study Recruitment Purpose.\n\nPage 5 of 14\n\n\fConsent Obligation\n11.\n\nSection 13(a) of the PDPA provides that an organisation must not use an\n\nindividual’s personal data unless the individual has given or is deemed to have given\nhis / her consent (the “Consent Obligation”). Section 14(1) of the PDPA states that\nan individual has not given consent unless the individual has been notified of the\npurposes for which his personal data will be collected, used or disclosed and the\nindividual has provided his consent for those purposes.\n\n12.\n\nThe PDPA does not specify any particular manner in which consent should be\n\nobtained. As stated in [12.4-12.6] of the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key\nConcepts in the PDPA1, consent can be obtained in several ways:\n\n“Consent can be obtained in several ways. Consent that is obtained in writing\nor recorded in a manner that is accessible is referred to in these Guidelines as\n‘express consent’. Such consent provides the clearest indication that the\nindividual has consented to notified purposes of the collection, use or disclosure\nof his personal data.\n\nIn situations where it may be impractical for the organisation to obtain express\nconsent in writing, it may choose to obtain verbal consent. As good practice,\norganisations can consider adopting the following practices in cases when\nconsent is obtained verbally, to prove that verbal consent had been given, in\nthe event of disputes:\n\n1 https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelines-and-consultation/2020/03/advisory-guidelines-on-key-concepts-\n\nin-the-personal-data-protection-act\n\nPage 6 of 14\n\n\fa) Confirm the consent in writing with the individual (which may be in electronic\nform or other form of documentary evidence); or\n\nb) Where appropriate in the circumstances, make a written note (which may\nbe in electronic form or other form of documentary evidence) of the fact that\nan individual had provided verbal consent.\n\n…\n\nDepending on the facts in some cases, the Commission may consider that\nconsent is inferred or implied from the circumstances or the conduct of\nthe individual in question. This is a form of consent where the individual\ndoes, in fact, consent to the collection, use and disclosure of his personal\ndata (as the case may be) by his conduct, although he has not expressly\nstated his consent in written or verbal form.”\n(emphasis in bold added)\n\nImplied Consent\n13.\n\nSince the Complainant did not provide express consent for the use of his\n\npersonal data for the Study Recruitment Purpose, the Commission considered\nwhether the Organisation had obtained his implied consent for the same purpose.\nWhether implied consent has been given is ultimately determined by the\ncircumstances and conduct of the parties involved. In Re German European School\nSingapore [2019] SGPDPC 8 (“GESS”), the parents of a student at GESS (AB)\n\nPage 7 of 14\n\n\fchallenged the applicability of GESS’ bye-laws on the basis that express consent was\nnot given. PDPC opined that:\n\n“… As the school’s bye-laws were made available to the parents, they must be\ntaken to have agreed to enroll their children in the school on that basis. This is\ncertain the case in the present matter as AB has been enrolled in GESS for\nmore than 10 years. I find that the parents’ decision to enrol[l] him, and to\ncontinue having him enrolled in the school for a substantial period,\namounts to an acceptance of the school’s bye-laws… This constitutes\nimplied consent for the purposes of the PDPA and, as it was validly given\nby AB’s parents, amounts to consent by AB pursuant to section 14(4) of the\nPDPA.”\n(emphasis in bold added)\n\n14.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, by displaying the Notification prominently on the\n\nmanned registration counters since 2014, and on payment and pharmacy counters in\nthe clinic prior to the date of the Incident, the Organisation has taken reasonable steps\nto bring the Notification to the attention of its patients including the Complainant. The\nComplainant stated that he had proceeded to the self-registration kiosks to register for\nhis appointment at the Organisation’s clinic and that the self-registration kiosks did not\ndisplay the Notification. In this regard, the Commission notes that the manned\nregistration counters (which are right at the entrance of the clinic and displayed the\nNotification) were in very close proximity to the self-registration kiosks. The\nOrganisation’s display of the Notification at the manned registration counters right at\n\nPage 8 of 14\n\n\fthe entrance of the clinic is consistent with the Commission’s Guide to Notification2\nwhich states that for physical displays, “Notice should be prominently displayed prior\nto and during the collection, use and disclosure of personal data.”\n\n15.\n\nFurther, the Complainant had ample reasonable opportunities to see the\n\nNotification at some point during his visits to the clinic from 2014 when the\nOrganisation first started displaying the Notification on the manned registration\ncounters of the clinic, to the date of the Incident on 20 March 2024.\n\n16.\n\nHaving been satisfied that the Complainant was notified of the Study\n\nRecruitment Purpose, the Commission is also of the view that the Complainant had\nprovided implied consent for the use of his personal data for the Study Recruitment\nPurpose:\n\n(a)\n\nDespite being afforded reasonable opportunities to view the Notification from\n2014 to 2024, the Complainant continued to visit the Organisation’s clinic and\nnever objected to the use of his personal data for the Study Recruitment\nPurpose. Further, the Complainant continued to provide his personal data to the\nOrganisation through the provision of his name, age and medical information\n(which naturally evolved over that time).\n\n(b)\n\nOn the date of the Incident, the Complainant proceeded to wait for his\nappointment after registering as a patient at the Organisation’s clinic.\n\n2 https://pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resrouces/2019/09/guide-to-notification\n\nPage 9 of 14\n\n\f17.\n\nOn this basis, the Commission is of the view that the Complainant had provided\n\nhis implied consent to the Organisation to use his personal data for the Study\nRecruitment Purpose. Accordingly, the Organisation was not in breach of the Consent\nObligation.\n\nDeemed consent by notification\n18.\n\nThe Organisation in its submissions to the Commission had argued that it had\n\nobtained the Complainant’s deemed consent by notification to use his personal data\nfor the Study Recruitment Purpose. Whilst it is not necessary for the Commission to\nassess this submission (as the Complainant had provided implied consent), it is\nnevertheless beneficial to assess the Organisation’s submission on this point.\n\n19.\n\nSection 15A of the PDPA provides that an individual is deemed to have\n\nconsented to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data for a purpose that he\nhad been notified of, and he has not notified the organisation that he does not consent\nto the proposed collection, use or disclosure of the personal data.\n\n20.\n\nAs stated in [12.23] of our Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA,\n\ndeemed consent by notification is particularly useful where an organisation wishes to\nuse existing data for secondary purposes that are different from the primary purposes\nfor which it had originally collected the personal data for, and it is unable to rely on any\nof the exceptions to consent for the intended secondary use. In the present\ncircumstances, the Organisation had initially collected the Complainant’s personal\ndata for the purpose of his medical treatment, but was now seeking to use the\n\nPage 10 of 14\n\n\fComplainant’s personal data for a secondary purpose, i.e. the Study Recruitment\nPurpose.\n\n21.\n\nTo rely on section 15A of the PDPA, an organisation needs to do the following\n\nbefore collecting, using or disclosing any personal data of an individual:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, conduct an assessment to determine if the proposed collection, use or\ndisclosure may have an adverse effect on the individual and take the necessary\nmeasures to eliminate or mitigate any adverse effects. The organisation must\nretain a copy of the assessment through the period that it collects, uses or\ndiscloses personal data based on deemed consent by notification, and provide\nthe Commission with a copy of the assessment upon request3\n\n(b)\n\nSecond, take reasonable steps to bring to the individual’s attention its intention\nto collect, use or disclose the personal data and the purpose for which the\npersonal data will be collected, use or disclosed.\n\n(c)\n\nFinally, take reasonable steps to alert the individual to the means and time\nperiod within which the individual may notify the organisation that he does not\nconsent to such use of his personal data. The individual must be provided with\na reasonable period to opt out before the organisation collects, uses or\ndiscloses his personal data.\n\n3 [12.25] of Advisory Guideline on Key Concepts in the PDPA\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\f22.\n\nIn the Commission’s view, the Organisation has satisfied the first requirement\n\nas the proposed Study was reviewed and approved by the Domain Specific Review\nBoard, an independent committee that reviews and approves research studies to\nensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The prominent display of the\nNotification on all the clinic counters would also satisfy its second obligation to take\nreasonable steps to bring to the individual’s attention its intention to collect, use or\ndisclose the personal data for the Study Recruitment Purpose.\n\n23.\n\nHowever, while the Organisation may have satisfied the first and second\n\nrequirements as set out above, it did not satisfy the third requirement. In the course of\nour investigations, the Commission established that the Organisation did not take any\nsteps to bring to the Complainant’s attention the manner (or time period) by which the\nindividual may notify the Organisation that he does not consent to the use of his\npersonal data for the Study Recruitment Purpose.\n\n24.\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the contact details of its Data\n\nProtection Officer (DPO) can be found on its website and that patients who have\nconcerns or queries about IMH’s personal data protection policies and practices may\ncontact its DPO. In addition, patients can speak directly to its counter staff or Quality\nService Manager and request not to be shortlisted and invited to participate in any\nresearch studies.\n\n25.\n\nWhile this may no doubt be true, the measures outlined by the Organisation are\n\ninsufficient as they place the onus on the individual to navigate the Organisation’s\nbureaucracy to find out how he may opt out. It remains the case that the Organisation\ndid not take reasonable steps to alert and bring to the Complainant’s attention that he\nPage 12 of 14\n\n\fmay notify the Organisation of his refusal to give consent to the Organisation’s\nproposed collection, use or disclosure of his personal data to be invited to participate\nin suitable care programmes or relevant research studies, and the manner (or time\nperiod) by which he could do so.\n\n26.\n\nAccordingly, the Commission is of the view that the Organisation cannot rely on\n\ndeemed consent by notification to justify its use of the complainant’s medical\ninformation and age for the Study Recruitment Purpose.\n\nConclusion\n27.\n\nWhile the Commission finds the Organisation to be in compliance with the\n\nConsent Obligation on the basis of that it had obtained the Complainant’s implied\nconsent before using his personal data for the Study Recruitment Purpose, the\nCommission recognises that as a matter of best practice, the Organisation could have\ndone better to ensure that it obtained the express consent of individuals concerned\nprior to collecting, using or disclosing their personal data, particularly when this\ninvolved an individual’s medical information.\n\n28.\n\nThe Commission notes that the Organisation has since voluntarily reviewed its\n\nprocesses on its own accord and issued a revised guideline on the recruitment of\nsubjects for research studies and clinical trials. Moving forward, the clinical team will\nfirst inform potential participants about the research recruitment, for which the patient\nmay be a suitable candidate, either verbally or through research collateral material\nproduced with the intention of recruiting patients or the general public to participate in\nclinical research, prior to direct contact by a member of the research team.\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\n\f29.\n\nAfter the consultation with the attending care team, the RO would then proceed\n\nto approach potential participants to seek their express consent to participate in the\nresearch. For clarity, these changes do not and will not change the current process\nwhereby a RO may approach patients in clinic waiting areas to participate in surveys\nor research studies where no patient medical records are used or disclosed.\n\n30.\n\nThe Commission is satisfied with these changes implemented by the\n\nOrganisation as the Organisation will henceforth obtain and rely on the express rather\nthan implied consent of individuals before using their medical information to approach\nand recruit potential participants for research studies.\n\n31.\n\nWhile this may increase the Organisation’s administrative load, the\n\nOrganisation would also be able to rely on deemed consent by notification under\nsection 15A of the PDPA in future, so long as it tweaks its Notification to alert\nindividuals of the means and duration by which they may give notice to the\nOrganisation of their refusal to give consent to the Organisation’s proposed collection,\nuse or disclosure of their personal data for recruitment in suitable care programmes or\nrelevant research studies.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 14 of 14\n\n\f","decision":"Not in Breach"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $17,500 was imposed and directions were issued to Ezynetic for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Financial Penalty","Others","Access control","Protection"],"date":"03 Jul 2025","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_ezynetic-pte-ltd_03032025.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Ezynetic","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2025/06/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ezynetic","timestamp":"2025-07-03","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2025] SGPDPCS 2\n\nCase No. DP-2406-C2585\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nEzynetic Pte.

This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in\n\n\fthis decision. It also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation operates an information technology system which was linked\n\nto the Moneylenders Credit Bureau (“MLCB”) platform operated by Credit Bureau\n(Singapore) Pte Ltd1 via Application Protocol Interfaces (“APIs”) (the “moneylending\nsystem”).\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s clients would input personal data of their prospective loan\n\napplicants and borrowers into the moneylending system which would allow them to\nverify the applicants’ and borrowers’ loan eligibility, generate the MLCB credit reports,\ntrack the loans, instalments, collections, payments and generation of profit and loss\nreports.\n\n6\n\nOn 24 June 2024, the Organisation discovered that it could not access the\n\nmoneylending system, and the relevant databases had been deleted by a threat actor\nwho managed to gain access to its database server.\n\n7\n\nInvestigations found that the threat actor had exploited a vulnerable web service\n\napplication to gain access and control of its system administrator (“SA”) account2 to\naccess the moneylending system. After gaining access to the moneylending system,\nthe threat actor exfiltrated the personal data of the affected individuals.\n\n1 Credit Bureau (Singapore) Pte Ltd is the designated credit bureau by Ministry of Law Singapore to operate the\n\nMLCB platform.\n2 The SA account login, short for system administrator, is one of the riskiest server-level principals in SQL Server.\nIt’s automatically added as a member of the sysadmin fixed server role and, as such, has all permissions on that\ninstance and can perform any activity.\n\n\f8\n\nThe personal data exfiltrated included a combination of the name, address,\n\nemail address, telephone number, NRIC number, date of birth and the financial\ninformation available in the MLCB Credit Reports of 190,589 individuals.\n\n9\n\nThe MLCB platform was not compromised as the Incident only involved\n\nunauthorised access into the Organisation’s internal systems by the threat actor.\n\n10\n\nInvestigations revealed the following lapses by the Organisation that had\n\ncontributed to the Incident:\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation failed to disable or adequately secure the SA account\nwhich is a well-known SQL server account, and is often targeted by\nmalicious users. The access controls mechanism implemented for the SA\naccount was inadequate. The password, at the time of the Incident, which\nwas p@ssword1 or Password@1, was susceptible to brute force attacks;\nand\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation did not perform any periodic vulnerability assessment or\npenetration testing of its infrastructure.\n\nRemedial Action\n\n11\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation promptly took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n\na.\n\nRebuilt its entire network and migrated to a cloud environment for its\nservers;\n\n\fb.\n\nEnhanced security measures were implemented for the new network after\nconsultations with the Cybersecurity Agency of Singapore (“CSA”) and the\nMinistry of Law Singapore; and\n\nc.\n\nNotified all affected clients on 1 July 2024.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n12\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n13\n\nTaking into account the Organisation’s admission, and for the reasons set out\n\nbelow, the Deputy Commissioner determines that the Organisation failed to implement\nreasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and/or\ncontrol, thus acting in breach of section 24 of the PDPA:\n\na.\n\nFailure to have reasonable access control. The volume and types of\n\npersonal data in the possession and under the control of the Organisation\nrequired it to have adopted enhanced access controls. Given that the SA\naccount granted privileged access to the Organisation’s moneylending\nsystem, adequate authorisation and authentication processes were\nrequired. This includes the implementation and enforcement of a strong\npassword policy that includes a minimum level of password complexity,\nand a fixed period of password validity or regular change of passwords,\n\n\fthe weak password used for the moneylending system during the Incident\nwas an inadequate security arrangement to safeguard the personal data\ncontained in the moneylending system.\n\nb.\n\nFailure to conduct reasonable periodic security review. At the time of the\nincident, no network vulnerability assessments or penetration testing had\nbeen conducted. As stated in page 5 of the Commission’s Checklists to\nGuard Against Common Types of Data Breaches (the “Checklists”)3,\norganisations should, as a basic practice, periodically conduct web\napplication vulnerability scanning and assessments post deployment. The\nOrganisation’s failure to conduct reasonable periodic security review\namounted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n14\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\nFinancial Penalty\n\n15\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation under\n\nSection 48J of the PDPA, the Commission considered that a financial penalty was\nappropriate given the role of the Organisation as a SaaS provider that processes\npersonal data entrusted to it by its client. As a SaaS provider, the Commission the\nOrganisation should possess the necessary technical expertise to implement\nreasonable cybersecurity measures to address the evolving threats.\n\n3 https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems\n\n\f16\n\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, the Commission first\n\nconsidered the impact of the personal data breach on the individuals affected and the\nnature of Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA. In addition, in order to ensure\nthat the financial penalty imposed is proportionate and effective, having regard to\nachieving compliance and deterring non-compliance with the PDPA, the Commission\nalso considered the Organisation’s annual turnover.\n\n17\n\nThe Commission also considered the following factors:\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our investigations;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\nObligation under the EDP; and\n\nc.\n\n18\n\nThis is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the PDPA.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Deputy Commissioner made a preliminary decision\n\nto impose a financial penalty of $17,500 on the Organisation for its breach of the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n19\n\nIn addition, to ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the Protection\n\nObligation, the Deputy Commissioner also directed the Organisation, under section\n48I of the PDPA, to obtain CSA’s Cyber Trustmark Certification for its new IT network\nand report to the Commission on its completion.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\n20\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 2 December 2024 and was invited to make representations.\n\n\fOn 3 December 2024, the Organisation made the following representations to the\nCommission seeking a waiver or reduction in the financial penalty:\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation had expended significant financial commitment to\ninvestigate, mitigate the effects of the breach and fortifying its systems\nagainst future cybersecurity threats;\n\nb.\n\nIt had suffered significant operational disruptions and continued financial\nlosses as a result of the Incident; and\n\nc.\n\nIt had maintained full transparency and cooperation with all regulatory\nbodies throughout the investigation.\n\n21\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Organisation’s representations were not\n\naccepted for the reasons outlined below:\n\na.\n\nThe fact that the Organisation has expended significant financial\ncommitment to implement remedial measures post-data breach does not\nwarrant a further reduction, as it is a necessary part of its obligation to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements under the Protection\nObligation.\n\nb.\n\nThe operational disruptions and financial losses suffered by the\nOrganisation were part of the vicissitudes of dealing with the aftermath of\na serious data breach incident and its previous non-compliance with the\nProtection Obligation. Whilst the Organisation did provide some invoices\nshowing that it had incurred expenses to implement remedial measures,\nthese did not show that the Organisation is in such a dire financial situation\n\n\fthat the imposition of a financial penalty of $17,500 would adversely\nimpact its ability to continue its business; and\n\nc.\n\nThe Commission had already taken into account of the cooperativeness\nof the Organisation, in arriving at the preliminary decision.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n22\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the Deputy\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $17,500\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Courts in respect of judgement debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n23\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation is also directed to:\n\na.\n\nObtain CSA’s Cyber Trustmark Certification for its new IT network within\n9 months from the date of this Decision; and\n\nb.\n\nTo report to the Commission within 14 days upon completion of the above\naction outlined above.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\fThe following section(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the above\nSummary of The Decision:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

Ltd.\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1\n\nHMI Institute of Health Science Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a healthcare\n\ntraining provider in Singapore. On 2 May 2024, the Organisation notified the Personal\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal data breach incident\nafter it received a complaint from an affected individual who found an Excel file\ncontaining the personal data of 761 individuals which the Organisation had\ninadvertently made publicly available on the Internet (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe personal data disclosed included a combination of the name, address,\n\nemail address, telephone number, NRIC number, date of birth, nationality, race,\ngender and educational qualification.\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for the investigation\n\nto proceed under the Expedited Decision Procedure. To this end, the Organisation\nvoluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision. It also\n\n\fadmitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n4\n\nInvestigations revealed that the affected individuals had provided their personal\n\ndata to the Organisation via the Students’ Career Portal (the “Portal”), which was\npreviously part of the Organisation’s website from 2017 to 2019. In December 2019,\nthe Organisation decided to decommission the Portal. Investigations revealed that the\nOrganisation did not follow up with the vendor to ensure that the Portal had been\nproperly decommissioned, other than checking and confirming that the Portal was no\nlonger accessible at its original URL address.\n\n5\n\nThe Excel file continued to reside in the web directory of the Organisation’s\n\nwebsite with no access control to prevent indexing by online search engines. This led\nto the Excel file being indexed and made publicly accessible via an online search using\nrelevant keywords.\n\nRemedial Action\n\n6\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation promptly took the following remedial\n\nactions:\n(a) Removed the Excel file in its web directory;\n(b) Liaised with internet search engines to ensure that all web links to the Excel\nfile had been removed;\n\n\f(c) Implemented an internal checklist for all future commissioning, onboarding\nand decommissioning of IT solutions; and\n(d) Established additional protocols to monitor its website content.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n7\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n8\n\nThe Organisation admitted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA as it did not\n\nhave adequate policies and processes to exercise reasonable oversight over the\nvendor tasked with decommissioning the Portal. While the Organisation alluded to its\nown lack of technical expertise and reliance on the vendor to decommission the Portal,\nthe Organisation’s lack of technical expertise is not an adequate defence to the\nOrganisation’s failure to take the necessary steps in order to comply with its obligation\nunder section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n9\n\nThe Commission noted that in this case, the exercise of reasonable vendor\n\noversight did not require technical expertise. The Organisation could have exercised\nreasonable oversight by verifying with its vendor that the personal data previously\ncollected by the Organisation via the Portal had been properly deleted and was no\nlonger accessible following the decommissioning of the Portal. However, the\n\n\fOrganisation did not have the policies and processes in place to allow it to adequately\nsupervise the work carried out by its vendor.\n\n10\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\nFinancial Penalty\n\n11\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA, the Commission considered all relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected, the duration of and the nature of the\nOrganisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA.\n\n12\n\nThe Commission also considered the fact this is the second contravention of\n\nthe PDPA by the Organisation.\n\n13\n\nThe Commission considered the following mitigating factors:\n(a) The Organisation was cooperative during the course of our investigations;\nand\n(b) The Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure.\n\n14\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $10,000 within 30 days from the date of the relevant notices\n\n\faccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nDirections\n\n15\n\nIn addition, to ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the Protection\n\nObligation, the Organisation is directed to report to the Commission on the completion\nof the following remedial actions:\n(a) Create and maintain a personal data asset inventory for tracking of its\npersonal data assets;\n(b) Put in place a well-documented vendor management policy and relevant\nprocesses for effective management and supervision of its IT vendors;\n(c) Conduct a vulnerability assessment and/or penetration testing of its existing\nIT systems and to resolve any identified vulnerabilities; and\n(d) Prepare and submit to the Commission a written report of the completion of\nthe remediation actions directed above within 60 days from the date of the\nrelevant notices accompanying this decision.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\fThe following section(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the above\nSummary of The Decision:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

Hence, the Commission also initiated investigations to determine the\nOrganisation’s compliance with the PDPA in relation to Incident 2.\n\n1 The email addresses were “online-submission@case.org.sg” and “mediator1@case.org.sg”.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nThe Organisation requested for Incident 1 to be handled under the Expedited\n\nBreach Decision Procedure (“EDP”), which the Commission acceded to. After the\nCommission commenced its investigations into Incident 2, the Organisation likewise\nrequested for this incident to be handled under EDP, which the Commission also\nacceded to. To this end, the Organisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to all\nthe facts set out in this decision, and also to contraventions of sections 24 and 12(a)\nof the PDPA (as explained below).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation which aims to\n\npromote consumer interests, and fair and ethical trade practices. Amongst others, the\nOrganisation handles consumer-to-business disputes, where a consumer may engage\nthe Organisation to negotiate with the businesses with a view to reaching an amicable\nsettlement.\n\n6\n\nPersonal data in the Organisation’s possession or under the Organisation’s\n\ncontrol involved, amongst others, consumer complaints made to the Organisation.\nThese consumer complaints contained personal data such as the names, email\naddresses, contact numbers and complaint details.\n\nIncident 1 and Incident 2 (collectively, the “Incidents”)\n\nIncident 1\n\n7\n\nFor Incident 1, a total of 5,205 phishing emails were sent to 4,945 email\n\nrecipients from “online-submission@case.org.sg” and “mediator1@case.org.sg”\n(collectively, “the Affected Accounts”).\n\n3\n\n\f8\n\nOn 8 October 2022, some of the Organisation’s consumers received unsolicited\n\nemails from “online-submission@case.org.sg”, informing them that their complaints\nhad been escalated to the “collections and compensation department”, and that they\nwere eligible for a compensation payout. They were requested to click on a chat icon\nto fill in their banking details to complete the payment process. The account, “onlinesubmission@case.org.sg”, was utilised by the Organisation to communicate with\nconsumers who lodge complaints on the Organisation’s website (“Complaint” or\n“Complaints”).\n\n9\n\nSubsequently on\n\n“mediator1@case.org.sg”\n\n9 October 2022,\nto\n\nthe\n\nsimilar emails were sent\n\nOrganisation’s\n\nconsumers.\n\nThe\n\nfrom\n\naccount,\n\n“mediator1@case.org.sg”, was utilised by the Organisation to communicate with\nconsumers whose complaints were escalated to mediation.\n\n10\n\nThereafter, in January 2023 and February 2023, the Organisation received\n\ncomplaints of further phishing emails being sent to the Organisation’s consumers from\nemail addresses which did not originate from the Organisation’s domain. Based on the\ncircumstances, these affected consumers’ emails were likely harvested by the threat\nactor during the course of Incident 1. Further, based on the fact that the threat actor\nsent phishing emails to these consumers through external email addresses, the\nCommission considers that personal data relating to these consumers would have\nbeen exfiltrated.\n\n11\n\nIn connection with the above, 3 of the Organisation’s consumers informed the\n\nOrganisation that they had clicked on the chat icon embedded in the phishing emails,\nand had money withdrawn from their bank accounts. These individuals allegedly\nsuffered monetary losses of S$900, S$68,000 and S$149,000. The Organisation had\n4\n\n\fmade a police report, and was informed by the police to let them handle the\ninvestigations.\n\n12\n\nThe phishing emails sent in Incident 1 were generally of the same content and\n\nformat, did not contain any Complaint-specific details, and consisted of fictitious data.\n\n13\n\nThe Organisation engaged a private forensic expert (“PFE”) to ascertain the\n\ncause and extent of Incident 1. The PFE’s forensic investigations revealed that:\n\n(a)\n\nThe threat actor had successfully signed into the Affected Accounts\nusing the correct login credentials.\n\n(b)\n\nIt is likely that the correct login credentials were obtained from a\nsuccessful phishing attack on an employee of the Organisation.\n\n(c)\n\nBy gaining unauthorised access to the Affected Accounts, the threat\nactor was (1) able to harvest email addresses of the Organisation’s\nconsumers from emails in the Inbox and Sent mailboxes of these\naccounts; and (2) send phishing emails on behalf of the Organisation\nwith the Organisation’s verified domain name.\n\n(d) Further, some of the Organisation’s computers were running on end-oflife operating systems, and had vulnerable software with unapplied\nupgrades / security patches, which put the Organisation at risk of remote\ncode execution vulnerability.\n\n5\n\n\f14\n\nIn terms of the volume of personal data affected in Incident 1, the Commission\n\nnotes that:\n\n(a)\n\nThe compromising of the account “online-submission@case.org.sg”\nexposed up to 22,542 email addresses to harvesting by the threat actor.\nThis account was used to send system-generated acknowledgment\nemails to the Organisation’s consumers upon receipt of their Complaints\nthrough the Organisation’s website.\n\n(b)\n\nThe other compromised account, “mediator1@case.org.sg”, did not\ncontain any data.\n\n(c)\n\nBeyond these 22,542 email addresses, investigations did not reveal any\nfurther personal data that the threat actor had access to.\n\nIncident 2\n\n15\n\nOn 22 June 2023, in the course of investigating the circumstances surrounding\n\nIncident 1, the Commission received a complaint from a consumer of the Organisation.\nThe complainant had received a targeted phishing email sent by an email address\nwhich did not originate from the Organisation’s domain. The email was addressed to\nthe consumer, and reproduced the consumer’s Complaint submitted to the\nOrganisation.\n\n16\n\nSubsequently, the Organisation was informed of the occurrence of more of such\n\nsimilar incidents. In total, 28 individuals informed the Organisation that they received\nphishing emails (reflecting the same details they shared in their original Complaints to\nthe Organisation) from email addresses which did not originate from the Organisation’s\n\n6\n\n\fdomain. Since such data was contained within the Organisation’s systems, the\nunavoidable conclusion is that their personal data (at the very least, their email\naddresses and Complaints) had been exfiltrated from the Organisation’s systems.\n\n17\n\nWhilst the investigations did not yield a definitive conclusion regarding how the\n\ndata breach in Incident 2 actually occurred, the Commission concludes that based on\nthe circumstances set out below, Incident 2 likely occurred during a data migration\nexercise conducted by the Organisation.\n\n18\n\nAll of the 28 individuals had filed Complaints with the Organisation between 8\n\nJanuary 2019 to 19 December 2019. Investigations found that these Complaints were\nincluded as part of a data migration exercise the Organisation undertook when it\nchanged from a former vendor, Exabytes Network (Singapore) Pte Ltd, to a new\nvendor, Total eBiz Solutions Pte Ltd (“TES”) (collectively, the “Vendors”) sometime\nbetween 24 December 2019 to 1 January 2020 (the “Data Migration”). The\nOrganisation had contacted both Vendors, and there was no evidence of suspicious\nactivity during the weeks preceding the sending of the phishing emails. As such, the\nOrganisation indicated that it was likely that the data breach occurred during the Data\nMigration, which the Commission accepted.\n\n19\n\nThe Commission notes that the personal data of approximately 12,218\n\nindividuals involved in the Data Migration was put at risk of unauthorised access and\nexfiltration.\n\n7\n\n\f20\n\nThe following types of personal data were affected:\nTypes of personal data\n\nNumber of affected\nindividuals\nName, email address, contact number and 4,074\nComplaint details\nName, email address and contact number\n192\nName, contact number and Complaint details\n2,012\nName and contact number\n1,742\nName, email address and Complaint details\n155\nName and email address\n52\nContact number\n3,991\nTotal 12,218\n21\n\nThe Commission ascertained and was notified by the Organisation that none of\n\nthe affected individuals for Incident 2 suffered monetary losses.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n22\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\nActions to mitigate and contain Incident 1\n\n(a)\n\nEngaged a third party PFE to assist in investigations and perform a\nvulnerability assessment;\n\n(b)\n\nInformed email recipients who had received phishing emails from the\nAffected Accounts not to click on any links within the email;\n\n(c)\n\nPublished a media release, and alerts on the Organisation’s website and\nFacebook account to alert consumers to the phishing emails;\n\n(d)\n\nSuspended the Affected Accounts, and reset passwords of all\nadministrator accounts with increased complexity requirement; and\n\n8\n\n\f(e)\n\nAssembled a taskforce to manage the incident, conduct investigations,\nand provide recommendations to improve the cybersecurity of the\nOrganisation.\n\nActions to mitigate and contain Incident 2\n\n(a)\n\nInformed consumers not to click on phishing emails, and remained in\ncommunication with the 28 consumers who had informed the\nOrganisation of the phishing emails; and\n\n(b)\n\nPublished a media release, and alerts on the Organisation’s website and\nFacebook account to alert consumers to the phishing emails.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n\n(a)\n\nImplemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for all web-based\napplications including Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”)\nsoftware;\n\n(b)\n\nProcured a security package against malware, spams, and phishing\nemails;\n\n(c)\n\nImplemented enhanced password strength / complexity requirements,\nand mandatory password change for all mailboxes every 3 months;\n\n(d)\n\nReviewed and tightened access rights to system functions;\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented measures to ensure that contracts with all outsourced\nvendors include data protection clauses, and that vendors comply with\n\n9\n\n\fthe PDPA and the Organisation’s standard operating procedures for\nhandling personal data;\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented data protection training for all new staff, and annual\nrefresher training for all existing staff;\n\n(g)\n\nDecommissioned all end-of-life devices;\n\n(h)\n\nInstalled patch management software for security updates to be pushed\nthrough remotely;\n\n(i)\n\nArrangements are being made for the Organisation to obtain the Cyber\nEssentials Mark and subsequently the Data Protection Trust Mark; and\n\n(j)\n\nArranged to perform a penetration test to identify cybersecurity gaps\nafter the vulnerabilities identified by the PFE have been rectified.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n23\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incidents, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under Section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). Further, as the Organisation indicated that it did not have any\nInformation and Communications Technology (“ICT”) policies in place, the\n\n10\n\n\fOrganisation’s compliance with Section 12 of the PDPA (the “Accountability\nObligation”) was also investigated.\n\n24\n\nThe issues for determination are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n(b)\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under the\nAccountability Obligation.\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with its obligations under the Protection\nObligation\n\n25\n\nTo comply with the Protection Obligation, an organisation must implement\n\nsecurity arrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. This\nincludes a consideration of the nature of the personal data in the Organisation’s\npossession and control, as well as the potential impact that unauthorised disclosure\nof the personal data might have on the affected persons2.\n\nInadequate enforcement and formulation of password policies\n\n26\n\nPoor management of accounts and passwords are one of the most common\n\ncauses of data breaches. As a necessary measure of data protection, organisations\nmust adopt, implement, and enforce a strong and robust password policy3 to ensure\n\n2 See the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Revised 16 May 2022) at\n\n[17.2].\n3 See Cognita Asia Holdings Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPCS 14 at [7].\n\n11\n\n\fthat their IT systems are not vulnerable to common hacking attempts such as brute\nforce attacks4.\n\n27\n\nIn terms of basic practices, a password policy should include reasonable\n\npassword controls such as mandating a minimum level of password complexity and/or\nlength, and enforcing a maximum validity period for a password, the duration of which\nis in turn tied to the complexity of the password5. Having set an internal password\npolicy, it is incumbent on an organisation to enforce its password policy to ensure\ncompliance.\n\n28\n\nThe Commission takes the view that the Organisation’s password management\n\npolicy was manifestly insufficient to safeguard the personal data in its possession.\nFirst, the Organisation did not enforce its own password policy. Investigations\ndisclosed that the Organisation’s password policy required (i) a minimum length of 8\ncharacters for passwords; and (ii) a mixture of alphabets and numbers (the “Password\nComplexity Policy”). However, the password for one of the Affected Accounts was\n“olse432”, which has 7 characters and would not have satisfied the Organisation’s\nPassword Complexity Policy. Yet, this password was in use because the Organisation\ndid not system-enforce its Password Complexity Policy requirements.\n\n29\n\nSecond, the Organisation admitted that it failed to adopt and enforce a policy\n\non how frequently the passwords ought to be changed. The Affected Accounts were\ncreated in January 2019 and February 2019, and the passwords for both Affected\nAccounts had remained unchanged for almost 4 years prior to Incident 1. In the\nCommission’s view, if the Organisation had formulated a password policy setting out\n\n4 See LoveBonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3 at [18].\n5 See the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems.\n\n12\n\n\fhow long a password would remain valid and how frequently the password ought to\nbe changed as a result, it is unlikely that the period of 4 years would have been\ndeemed reasonable. The Organisation’s failure to adopt and enforce a password\npolicy that included the maximum validity period for a password was a serious lapse\nof its obligation to protect the personal data in its possession or control by adopting\nreasonable security arrangements.\n\n30\n\nAs a result of the above weaknesses, the threat actor successfully managed to\n\naccess the Affected Accounts, resulting in the data breach that occurred in Incident 1.\n\n31\n\nThe Organisation accepted that it had failed to (i) enforce its own Password\n\nComplexity Policy requiring the use of passwords of sufficient complexity, and (ii)\nadopt and enforce a password policy that requires the login passwords to be changed\nat a fixed duration.\n\n32\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admissions, the\n\nOrganisation is found to have breached the Protection Obligation by failing to\nimplement and enforce an adequate password policy to protect the personal data in\nits possession or under its control.\n\nFailure to stipulate clear security responsibilities in contracts with the\nOrganisation’s Vendors\n\n33\n\nThe Commission had highlighted in previous decisions the need for an\n\norganisation to put in place appropriate contractual provisions with its data\nintermediaries that set out the obligations and responsibilities of the data intermediary\nto protect the organisation’s personal data, and the parties’ respective roles to protect\n\n13\n\n\fthe personal data6. This applies to all cases where service providers / vendors process\npersonal data on behalf of a data controller.\n\n34\n\nFurther, in the Commission’s handbook on How to Guard against Common\n\nTypes of Data Breaches7, it is recommended that organisations establish clear\nresponsibility for ICT security. Where such responsibilities are to be carried out by a\nvendor, the scope of work and area of responsibilities ought to be clearly stated in the\ncontract.\n\n35\n\nAs highlighted at [18] above, Data Migration took place between the\n\nOrganisation’s Vendors between 24 December 2019 to 1 January 2020.\n\n36\n\nHowever, investigations revealed that the Organisation’s contract with one of\n\nthe Vendors involved did not stipulate clear security responsibilities in relation to its\nICT systems or data.\n\n37\n\nIn relation to TES, the Organisation indicated that it had engaged TES to\n\ndevelop a customised CRM solution based on off-the-shelf software. The Organisation\nindicated that TES was required to conduct proactive monitoring to identify possible\nunauthorised access or disclosure and inform the Organisation of any possible system\nbreach. However, the contract with TES did not contain any provisions for\ncybersecurity protection services and such security responsibilities were not expressly\nspecified in the contract between the Organisation and TES.\n\n6 See Re Singapore Health Services Pte Ltd & Ors [2019] SGPDPC 3 at [59]; Times Software Pte Ltd and\n\nothers [2020] SGPDPC 18 at [19] and Re Smiling Orchard (S) Pte Ltd and Ors [2016] SGPDPC 19 at [45].\n7 See the Commission’s handbook on How to Guard against Common Types of Data Breaches (at page\n\n13).\n\n14\n\n\f38\n\nOn this basis, the Organisation admits negligence in failing to manage its\n\nvendor closely.\n\n39\n\nWhilst the investigations did not definitively conclude how the threat actor\n\ngained unauthorised access to the affected personal data in Incident 2 during the Data\nMigration, the Organisation’s negligent vendor management put personal data under\nits control at risk of unauthorised access and disclosure.\n\n40\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admissions, the\n\nOrganisation is found to have breached the Protection Obligation by failing to stipulate\nclear security responsibilities in the contracts with the Vendors.\n\nFailure to conduct staff training\n\n41\n\nIn Tanah Merah Country Club [2021] SGPDPCS 16, the Commission had\n\nemphasised that staff training is a critical and necessary component to ensure that an\norganisation is well placed to protect the personal data in its possession and/or control.\nThe Protection Obligation extends to and includes the training of all employees who\nhave to handle personal data in the course of their work so that an organisation’s\nemployees can then successfully adopt and implement the policies and best practices\nnecessary to ensure the protection of personal data in an organisation’s possession\nand/or control8.\n\n42\n\nIn this regard, the Organisation admitted that it had failed to conduct regular\n\nsecurity awareness training for its staff. The Organisation had last conducted data\nprotection training in 2017, around 5 years before Incident 1. Since then, there had not\n\n8 See Tanah Merah Country Club [2021] SGPDPCS 16 at [13].\n\n15\n\n\fbeen any other training including but not limited to proper device usage or\ncybersecurity awareness. While the Organisation’s IT department would send out\nemail alerts to its staff from time to time to warn staff against phishing attacks, this\nalone, in the absence of regular security awareness training for its staff was\ninadequate.\n\n43\n\nThis lack of adequate staff training to address cybersecurity risks rendered the\n\nOrganisation more vulnerable to risks that target its staff, such as phishing attacks.\nIndeed, the Organisation admitted that the credentials for the Affected Accounts were\nlikely leaked by successful phishing attacks.\n\n44\n\nMore should have been done by the Organisation to build awareness and\n\neducate its staff on the potential cyber security risks, including risks of phishing\nattacks.\n\n45\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admissions, the\n\nOrganisation is found to have breached the Protection Obligation by failing to conduct\nadequate staff training.\n\nWhether the Organisation had complied with the Accountability Obligation\n\n46\n\nThe Accountability Obligation requires organisations to undertake measures in\n\norder to ensure that they meet their obligations under the PDPA and, importantly,\ndemonstrate that they can do so when required9. One such requirement is Section\n12(a) of the PDPA which requires an organisation to develop and implement policies\nand practices that are necessary to meet its obligations under the PDPA.\n9 See the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act\n\n(Revised 16 May 2022) at [21.2].\n\n16\n\n\f47\n\nDuring investigation, the Organisation confirmed that prior to Incident 1, it did\n\nnot have any ICT policies to cover critical aspects in IT security (including aspects of\napplying security patches / software updates). The Organisation admitted it had simply\n“relied on its IT staff to conduct maintenance and updates, as and when necessary”.\n\n48\n\nThis was manifestly inadequate. In Re Marshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd\n\n[2019] SGPDPC 34, the Commission had stressed that “relying solely on employees\nto perform their tasks diligently is not a sufficient reasonable security arrangement,\nand the organisation would need to take proactive steps to protect personal data”. 10\n\n49\n\nInvestigation also revealed that:\n\n(a)\n\nThere were insufficient email security measures. In this regard,\ninadequate email security solutions may fail to detect or prevent\nsuspicious login attempts or unauthorized access.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation did not have in place sufficient logging and monitoring\npractices to detect suspicious or unusual activities or unauthorized\naccess promptly.\n\n(c)\n\nThere were no controls internally to monitor the security of the\nOrganisation’s systems. The Organisation did not have a documented IT\nInfrastructure management plan or process for the protection and\nsecurity of its systems.\n\n10 See Re Marshall Cavendish Education Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 34 at [21].\n\n17\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had not performed any security reviews\nof its systems in the 3 years preceding Incident 1.\n\n50\n\nAs a result of the Organisation’s lack of such policies, it was discovered by the\n\nPFE that more than 30 out of the Organisation’s 45 computers had critical and highrisk vulnerabilities which put the Organisation at risk of threat actors compromising or\nexploiting the systems.\n\n51\n\nFor the above reasons, and by the Organisation’s own admission, the\n\nCommission finds that the Organisation has failed to meet its obligations under section\n12(a) of the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n52\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA\nwere considered.\n\n53\n\nIn terms of the type and nature of the personal data affected by the\n\nOrganisation’s non-compliance:\n\n(a)\n\nIn relation to Incident 1, the Commission notes that given the nature of\nthe usages of the Affected Accounts, the threat actor was confined to\naccessing and harvesting the email addresses of the Organisation’s\nconsumers contained in the emails in the Inbox and Sent mailboxes of\nthese accounts. In this regard, the threat actor was able to harvest up to\n22,542 email addresses.\n\n18\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn relation to Incident 2, the Commission notes that that the personal data\nof approximately 12,218 individuals was put at risk of unauthorised\naccess and exfiltration. The personal data affected included a\ncombination of names, email addresses, contact numbers and\nComplaint details. Some targeted phishing emails sent in Incident 2\naimed at causing financial losses to the affected individuals, and used\nthe relevant Complaint details exfiltrated to appear more convincing and\nlegitimate. This exposed the affected individuals to greater risks of actual\nfinancial losses.\n\n54\n\nIn terms of the nature, gravity and duration of the non-compliance by the\n\nOrganisation, the Organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation and\nAccountability Obligation in relation to both Incidents continued for a long duration of\nmore than three years. Additionally, there was a dearth of basic policies or security\nmeasures to safeguard the personal data in the Organisation’s possession and/or\ncontrol, and ensure compliance with the PDPA such an ICT policy to cover critical\naspects such as patching or proper staff training.\n\n55\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Commission recognises that in relation to both\n\nIncidents:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt actions after being alerted about the\nIncidents to mitigate the effects of the Incidents and to prevent a\nrecurrence;\n\n(b)\n\nInvestigations were handled under the EDP, under which the\nOrganisation admitted to the facts set out in this decision and to its\n\n19\n\n\fcontraventions\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nProtection\n\nObligation\n\nand\n\nAccountability\n\nObligation; and\n\n(c)\n\n56\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations.\n\nFurther, for the purposes of assessing what amount of financial penalty would\n\nbe effective to deter non-compliance with the PDPA, the Commission also took into\nconsideration the size of the Organisation’s annual turnover11.\n\n57\n\nBased on the above, the Commission determined that the Organisation should\n\npay a financial penalty of $20,000 within 30 days from the date of the notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n58\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, the Organisation is\n\nhereby directed to take the following actions:\n\n(a)\n\nReview and update policies relevant to personal data protection,\nincluding the Organisation’s ICT policy and password policy;\n\n(b)\n\nRectify all security gaps identified by the PFE by:\n\n(i)\n\nApplying all third-party patches and/or renewing the third-party\napplications with the most updated versions;\n\n11 See Re Fullerton Healthcare Group Pte Limited and Agape CP Holdings Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 5\n\nat [39].\n\n20\n\n\f(ii)\n\nApplying all Microsoft security and software patches to address the\nidentified vulnerabilities;\n\n(iii)\n\nEnabling all necessary security settings to protect endpoints; and\n\n(iv) Ensuring proper configuration of service paths and to align their\nsystem’s setup with the Organisation’s corporate IT policies; and\n\n(c)\n\nUpdate the Commission within 1 week from the completion of the above.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n21\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed and directions were issued to Academy of Medicine Singapore for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of current and former members of the institution.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Directions","Education","Ransomware","Vulnerability"],"date":"02 Aug 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_academy-of-medicine-singapore_10062024.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Academy of Medicine Singapore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/07/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-academy-of-medicine-singapore","timestamp":"2024-08-02","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2024] SGPDPCS 4\nCase No. DP-2308-C1326\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nAcademy of Medicine Singapore\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1\n\nAcademy of Medicine Singapore (the “Organisation”) is a professional\n\ninstitution providing postgraduate medical education and specialist training in\nSingapore. On 4 August 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) was informed about a data breach incident involving the\nOrganisation’s servers being infected by ransomware on or about 13 July 2023.\nConsequently, personal data of 6,574 individuals had been exfiltrated and posted on\nthe dark web (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for the investigation\n\nto proceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision.\n1\n\n\fIt also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation first discovered malware artifacts in its servers after reports\n\nby staff members of network connectivity issues on 13 July 2023. The Organisation\nimmediately disconnected the affected servers and sought an external IT forensic\ninvestigator to investigate the extent of the Incident and undertake remedial action.\n\n4\n\nInvestigations revealed that data from the Organisation had been uploaded on\n\nthe dark web (the “Leaked Data”), including full credit card information of over 1,000\nindividuals. Separately, a total of 4.4TB of files in the Organisation’s servers had been\nencrypted due to ransomware deployment.\n\n5\n\nFrom system event logs, upon gaining initial entry the threat actor accessed 6\n\nservers (the “Affected Servers”) and 1 staff computer using Remote Desktop Protocol\n(“RDP”) connections, then deployed malicious tools that could harvest credentials\nwithin folders and disarm antivirus and threat detection software. The investigation\nrevealed the following lapses which could have contributed to the Incident:\n(a) The Organisation’s firewall FortiOS had not been patched since July 2021\nand had been susceptible to a critical severity attack1 which could be\n\nCVE-2023-27997 is a critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Fortinet FortiOS’ SSL-VPN preauthentication component that is exploitable by attackers to execute arbitrary code.\n1\n\n2\n\n\fexploited at pre-authentication to allow a remote attacker to gain entry to\nsystems without using credentials.\n(b) Endpoint Detection and Response (“EDR”) applications installed on the\nAffected Servers and devices did not detect and prevent the execution of\nmalicious tools. The EDR Manager was compromised early and disabled by\nthe threat actor before executing ransomware and file encryption.\n(c) The Organisation’s environment was highly vulnerable to exploitations due to\noperating systems in 2 of the Affected Servers having reached End-of-Life\nstages in July 2015 and January 2020 respectively.\n(d) Critical hosts and staff computers had not been regularly scanned for\nvulnerabilities.\n(e) There had been a lack of essential threat detection solutions and proper logs\nretention as EDR applications installed in the Organisation’s environment\neither could not be supported by its operating systems or had outdated\nnetwork signatures2.\n(f) There had been a lack of documented robust processes implemented at the\ntime of the Incident to ensure regular patching and updates of important\nsoftware.\n\n2\n\nNetwork signatures match patterns of an attack that can crash applications or exploit the operating\nsystems on client computers. It can be changed to block or allow traffic.\n\n3\n\n\f6\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the exfiltrated data contained\n\npersonal data of 6,574 current and former members, participants of events, activities\nand/or in-training examinations organised/administered by the Organisation. The\ntypes of affected personal data are set out below. Not every affected individual had all\nof the personal data below in their personal data sets.\ni.\n\nName;\n\nii.\n\nAddress;\n\niii.\n\nPersonal email address;\n\niv.\n\nTelephone number;\n\nv.\n\nNRIC number;\n\nvi.\n\nPassport number;\n\nvii.\n\nPhotograph number;\n\nviii.\n\nPhotograph (ID photo);\n\nix.\n\nDate of birth; and\n\nx.\n\nFinancial information, including bank account details, partially redacted\n\ncredit card numbers, and credit card numbers with CVV and expiry date of\n1,083 individuals.\n\n4\n\n\f7\n\nThe Commission’s analysis of the Leaked Data by the threat actor found that it\n\nhad contained approximately 12.7GB of data from the Organisation. It was observed\nthat bank account details and credit card numbers with CVV and expiry dates had\nbeen stored in clear text without password protection or current standard file\nencryption. A list of login credentials to various online platforms used by the\nOrganisation could also be found within the Leaked Data, including credentials to its\nwebsite management system and passwords to various administrative emails.\n\nRemedial Action\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation promptly notified the affected\n\nindividuals about the Incident. The Organisation also took the following remedial\nactions:\n(a) Activated a Crisis Response Team to facilitate forensic investigations and\naddress queries related to the Incident;\n(b) Notified the relevant authorities i.e. Singapore Police Force, Cyber Security\nAgency of Singapore and Ministry of Health of the Incident;\n(c) Replaced its outdated firewall firmware to a newer version;\n(d) Tightened access controls by enabling geo-blocking on the firewall and VPN\nconfigured to only allow access to its networks via local IP addresses;\n(e) Installed and activated two-factor authentication for all staff members;\n\n5\n\n\f(f) Implemented Action 1 Patch Management that automated vulnerability\nremediation for operating systems and third-party applications, and\ncontinuous patch compliance for all servers;\n(g) Implemented monthly checks on system and software patches;\n(h) Conducted vulnerability scans on all staff-issued computers and devices;\n(i) Restored files from their tape backup and performed malware scans of the\nrestored files and all staff-issued laptops and devices; and\n(j) Engaged a third-party vendor to provide credit monitoring services to affected\nindividuals at no charges, whose financial information had been affected in\nthe Incident, to help detect any suspicious transactions that might affect the\naffected individuals’ credit reputation.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n9\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n10\n\nThe Organisation’s admissions amounted to the following breaches of section\n\n24 of the PDPA:\n6\n\n\f(a) Lack of sufficiently robust processes for updates or upgrades of important\nsoftware or firmware, which resulted in vulnerabilities that were not removed\nin the Organisation’s firewall and servers. The Organisation said that its IT\nvendor at the time of the Incident had only been onboarded in April 2023 and\nhad been focused on troubleshooting issues that arose in 2 events of system\ndowntime in May and June 2023. Prior to the system downtimes, the\nOrganisation also conducted an IT infrastructure review completed on 26\nJune 2023 that included identifying obsolete devices to remove and improving\nnetwork security. Hence, written procedures or policies on patch\nmanagement for software and firmware had yet to be developed and\nimplemented at the time. However, the Commission determined that these\ncircumstances did not mitigate the lack of sufficiently robust processes for\nupdating or upgrading important software and firmware that saw firewall\npatches not being carried out since July 2021 and servers with End-of-Life\n(“EOL”) operating systems not being upgraded.\n(b) Failure to have reasonable access control, in response to the need to\nenhance access control to the type of financial information in its possession\nor under its control. This financial information had included credit card\nnumbers with their security codes (CVVs). These had been stored in servers\nin plain text without password protection. Given the risk of harm due to the\nnature of this personal data, the Organisation could have considered\nadditional security options to enhance access controls to protect this data.\n7\n\n\fThe Commission highlighted in Re Tokyo Century Leasing (Singapore Pte\nLtd [2023] SGPDPC 9 in paragraph 11 that such data has a heightened risk\nof identity theft and/or financial loss, which called for a higher standard of\nsecurity arrangements. Examples may include separate password protection\nfor the server holding this data, encryption of the data, restrictions to the\nexport of this data, or, given the Organisation’s choice of endpoint security\nsolutions, real-time security monitoring of the data server.\n(c) Failure to stipulate data protection requirements or clear job specifications in\nthe contract of its IT vendor, specifically in the areas of the management and\nmaintenance of IT system security and the conduct of security reviews.\nWhere organisations rely on vendors to perform IT security maintenance and/\nor review, the scope of these services must be stipulated in the vendor\ncontract as part of the duty of a data controller under the Protection\nObligation.\n\n11\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n12\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA, the Commission considered all relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\n\n8\n\n\fdata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n13\n\nThe Commission considered that the personal data of 6,574 individuals had\n\nbeen affected as a result of the above breach. Further, the affected data included\nfinancial information comprising of bank account numbers and full credit card\ninformation of 1,083 individuals were leaked on the dark web.\n\n14\n\nThe Commission also considered the fact that for more than 3 years, the\n\nOrganisation had continued to deploy vulnerable servers with EOL operating systems\nfor which support and security updates had ceased since July 2015.\n\n15\n\nThe Commission considered the following mitigating factors:\n(a) The Organisation was cooperative during the course of our investigations;\n(b) The Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection Obligation\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c) This is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the PDPA.\n\n16\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $9,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n9\n\n\fDirections\n\n17\n\nIn addition, to ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the Protection\n\nObligation, the Organisation is directed to report to the Commission on the completion\nof the following remedial actions:\n(a) Assess the need for perimeter firewalls to restrict nonstandard outbound port\naccess as per its network requirements and configure said firewalls if needed;\n(b) Conduct a thorough security architecture review and assess the need to\nsegregate sections of its network that support primary processing of personal\ndata for its purposes from sections of the network that store personal data to\nreduce the risk of unauthorised access from within the network;\n(c) Assess the need to implement hardening for endpoints, servers and network\ndevices including password policies;\n(d) Identify the sensitive personal data stored in its environment and remove or\nencrypt the information according to data security best practices e.g. the\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standards for handling payment card\ndata;\n(e) Delete any stored CVV numbers and implement policy against storing CVV\nnumbers after the initial transaction authorisation;\n\n10\n\n\f(f) Implement annual periodic security reviews of IT policies, processes and\nprocedures to ensure compliance and alignment with security best practices;\nand\n(g) Prepare and submit to the Commissioner a written report of the completion of\nthe remediation actions directed above within 60 days.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the above summary\nof the Decision:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

Ltd. (“GLS”) and Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation Ltd\n(the “Organisation”) respectively about a data breach incident (the “Incident”)\ninvolving unauthorised access and exfiltration of personal data from servers belonging\nto GLS. One of the affected servers (the “Affected Server”) contained the personal\ndata of, amongst others, the Organisation’s employees, ex-employees, directors and\nshareholders (the “Personal Data”).\n\n2\n\nSubsequently, the Commission commenced investigations to determine\n\nwhether the circumstances relating to the Incident disclosed any breaches of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n3\n\nAfter carrying out preliminary investigations, on 27 February 2023, the\n\nCommission accepted a voluntary undertaking from GLS pursuant to section\n48(L)(1)(a) of the PDPA for GLS to implement enhanced security arrangements. No\nfurther enforcement action was taken against GLS.\n2\n\n\f4\n\nOn 2 March 2023, the Organisation requested for the investigation to proceed\n\nunder the Expedited Decision Procedure, which the Commission acceded to. To this\nend, the Organisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision, and to the Organisation’s breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\nRelationship between Organisation and GLS\n\n5\n\nAt the material time, the Organisation provided logistics and data centre\n\nservices, with operations across Asia Pacific and Europe.\n\n6\n\nPrior to 1 July 2022, the Organisation was the sole shareholder of Keppel\n\nLogistics Pte Ltd (which is now known as GLS). On 1 July 2022, the Organisation\ndivested then-Keppel Logistics Pte Ltd to Geodis International SAS, following which it\nwas renamed to GLS (the “Divestment”).\n\n7\n\nFor ease of reference, “GLS” is used to refer to both Keppel Logistics Pte Ltd\n\n(prior to 1 July 2022) and Geodis Logistics Singapore Pte Ltd (from 1 July 2022\nonwards).\n\nStoring of Personal Data on Affected Server\n\n8\n\nAt all material times, the Affected Server belonged to GLS. Prior to the\n\nDivestment, the Organisation and GLS utilised the Affected Server as a shared IT\nresource. Personal data of, amongst others, the Organisation and its affiliated entities’\nemployees, ex-employees, directors and shareholders was stored in the Affected\nServer.\n\n3\n\n\fMigration to Cloud in May 2020\n\n9\n\nIn or around May 2020, the Organisation, then the sole shareholder of GLS,\n\nmigrated its data (including the Personal Data stored on the Affected Server) (the\n“Migration”) to an entirely cloud-based storage solution (the “Cloud”). The Migration\nwas overseen by the Organisation’s IT department, which provided guidance to other\nstaff on the technical procedures for migrating their data to the Cloud. When briefing\nstaff about the Migration in late 2018, the Organisation did not give specific instructions\nto delete the Personal Data from the Affected Server after the Migration. The actual\ndata migration was not undertaken by the IT department because of IT access control\nrestrictions, and was left to the relevant staff to carry out themselves. The data\nmigration was also not supervised by the IT department because the staff were\nexpected to be responsible for their own data and files.\n\n10\n\nIn the circumstances, the Organisation’s staff did not delete the Personal Data\n\nfrom the Affected Server after copying the said data to the Cloud. The Personal Data\ntherefore continue to reside on the Affected Server post-Migration.\n\n11\n\nWhile the Organisation’s prevailing policies and practices provided for the\n\ndisposal / purging of data and decommissioning of systems that were no longer\nneeded by the Organisation, the Affected Server continued being used by GLS for its\nday-to-day operations post-Migration. The Affected Server was therefore not identified\nfor decommissioning and the Personal Data contained therein was therefore not\ndisposed / purged following the Migration. By the Organisation’s own admission, it\noverlooked that the Personal Data continued to reside in the Affected Server postMigration.\n\n4\n\n\fDivestment in July 2022\n\n12\n\nIn the lead up to the Divestment in July 2022, the Organisation’s IT department\n\nreminded staff in March 2022 to “transfer” files stored on the Affected Server to the\nCloud, because the Organisation would not be able to access the Affected Server\nfollowing the Divestment. However, it was again not made clear that the staff should\nalso delete the files after the transfer. As with the Migration in May 2020, the\nOrganisation did not delete the Personal Data from the Affected Server during the\nDivestment in July 2022. By the Organisation’s own admission, at the point of\nDivestment, it had once again overlooked that the Personal Data continued to reside\nin the Affected Server.\nThe Incident\n\n13\n\nOn or around 3 October 2022, the Organisation was alerted by a third-party\n\ncybersecurity consultant (engaged by a related entity of the Organisation) (the\n“Consultant”) of suspicious activities in relation to the Affected Server.\n\n14\n\nInvestigations revealed that an anonymous threat actor gained unauthorised\n\naccess to the Affected Server on 5 September 2022 through a compromised account\nof one of GLS’ vendors and accessed multiple files on the Affected Server between 1\nand 2 October 2022.\n\n15\n\nThere was also evidence of data exfiltration from the Affected Server. A\n\nransomware group published nine encrypted files on the dark web which it claimed\ncontained data from GLS, and one unencrypted file which it claimed was a list of the\nfiles contained within the nine encrypted files (the “File Listing”). The Organisation\nreviewed the File Listing and confirmed that it contained a subset of the files on the\n5\n\n\fAffected Server. However, the Organisation was unable to ascertain whether the\nencrypted files in fact contained the Personal Data stored in the Affected Server.\n\n16\n\nWhile it is therefore not definitively known what data was actually exfiltrated,\n\nthe Commission notes that the personal data of approximately 22,6591 individuals\n(“Affected Individuals”) was put at risk of unauthorised access and exfiltration, of\nwhich up to 7,1842 individuals’ personal data could have actually been exfiltrated.\n\n17\n\nThe Affected Individuals comprised employees and ex-employees of the\n\nOrganisation and its subsidiaries, the Organisation’s shareholders when it was listed\non the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST), and other\nindividuals relating to the Organisation’s finance departments or with whom the\nOrganisation, its subsidiaries or their respective employees had commercial or\nbusiness dealings.\n\n18\n\nIn terms of the types of personal data affected for each individual:\n(a)\n\nThe majority of the datasets (up to 19,752) comprised a combination of\nthe individual’s name, address, number of shares, and any of the\nfollowing: identity number, nationality, and country of origin.\n\n(b)\n\nA smaller number of datasets (up to 2,907) included a combination of the\nindividual’s name and one or more of the following: address, identity\nnumber, full image copy of the identity document, passport, passport\nphoto, email address, telephone number, signatures, bank account\n\n1 This is based on the Personal Data contained in the Affected Server.\n2 This is based on the File Listing.\n\n6\n\n\fnumber, date of birth, salary, nationality, educational qualifications,\nfamily information and images and/or information on re-entry permit.\n\nPartial notification of affected individuals\n\n19\n\nOn 19 December 2022, the Organisation sought a waiver of the requirement to\n\nnotify certain categories of overseas-based Affected Individuals3 of the occurrence of\nthe Incident under section 26D(7) of the PDPA, on the basis that the Organisation\ndoes not have contact information of these individuals and/or that the affected\nPersonal Data is historical salary information and out-dated, such that the Incident is\nunlikely to result in significant harm.\n\n20\n\nHaving considered the circumstances surrounding the Organisation’s request,\n\nthe Commission granted a waiver in respect of the individuals whose contact\ninformation the Organisation did not have and could not obtain after making\nreasonable enquiries.\n\n21\n\nHowever, the Commission refused to grant a waiver where the Organisation’s\n\nsole reason for seeking the waiver was that the affected Personal Data concerned outdated salary information as at 2018, because the Commission considered such\ninformation to be sufficiently recent such that there is still a likelihood of significant\nharm accruing as a result of the unauthorised disclosure of their personal data.\n\n22\n\nSave for those individuals whom the Commission has waived the notification\n\nrequirements for, the Organisation has notified all Affected Individuals whom it is\nrequired to notify under section 26(2) of the PDPA about the Incident.\n\n3 In total, the Organisation sought a waiver of the notification requirement in respect of 140 individuals.\n\n7\n\n\fRemedial actions\n\n23\n\nFollowing discovery of the Incident, the Organisation implemented the following\n\nremedial measures:\nActions to mitigate the effects of the Incident\n(a)\n\nWorked with the Consultant to ensure that measures were implemented\nto contain and/or prevent the risk of further breach in relation to the\nAffected Server;\n\n(b)\n\nConfirmed that GLS had disabled all accounts of the compromised GLS\nvendor and shut down the vendor’s remote access to the Affected\nServer;\n\n(c)\n\nRequested GLS to permanently purge all of the Personal Data from the\nAffected Server, which was done on 22 November 2022;\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the Incident or similar incidents\n(d)\n\nReviewed the May 2020 migration plan to verify that all data in local\nstorage had been deleted following the Migration;\n\n(e)\n\nConducted refresher training for all of the Organisation’s staff to ensure\nuser awareness and strict adherence to the Organisation’s policies,\nprocedures and processes; and\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented a standard operating procedure for IT and cyber due\ndiligence to address changes in ownership or possession and control of\nany IT assets.\n\n8\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation under section 24\nof the PDPA\n\n24\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident as set out above, the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation focused on whether the Organisation had breached its obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access,\ncollection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the\n“Protection Obligation”).\n\n25\n\nIn managing the risks of unauthorised access and/or disclosure, organisations\n\nmust be mindful of its security arrangements relating to the deletion and disposal of\npersonal data that is no longer necessary. Personal data that is no longer needed and\npersonal data contained in IT systems that are to be redeployed or sold should be\nproperly disposed, e.g. by secure deletion or purging of such personal data4.\n\n26\n\nFollowing the Migration of the Personal Data to the Cloud in May 2020, the\n\nOrganisation should have ensured that the Personal Data had been deleted from the\nAffected Server. However, the Organisation failed to do so. Instead, the Organisation\nleft the Migration to its staff without providing specific instructions to delete such data\nafter the Migration and without providing sufficient supervision.\n\n115 and 116 of the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA\n(https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/guidelines-and-consultation/2020/03/advisory-guidelines-on-key-concepts-in-thepersonal-data-protection-act) and page 14 of the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems\n(https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Other-Guides/Tech-Omnibus/Guide-to-Data-ProtectionPractices-for-ICT-Systems.ashx?la=en).\n4Pages\n\n9\n\n\f27\n\nThereafter, the Organisation had an opportunity to rectify the above failure\n\nduring the Divestment in July 2022, but again failed to do so. Similar to the Migration\nexercise in May 2020, the Organisation again did not make clear during the\nDivestment that staff should delete data from the Affected Server, and failed to\nimplement any measures to ensure that this had been done.\n\n28\n\nThe Organisation has admitted that its:\n\n(a)\n\nFailure to ensure the deletion of the Personal Data from the Affected\nServer post-Migration in May 2020; and\n\n(b)\n\nFailure to ensure the deletion of the Personal Data from the Affected\nServer prior to the Divestment in July 2022,\n\nconstituted a breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission accordingly finds that the Organisation negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by failing to ensure the deletion of the Personal Data from\nthe Affected Server for a period of more than 2 years after the Migration.\n\nObservations on other data protection practices\n\n30\n\nSeparate to the above finding, the Commission observes that had the\n\nOrganisation included the Personal Data stored on the Affected Server in its personal\ndata asset inventory, this would have facilitated earlier identification and deletion of\nthe Personal Data from the Affected Server. For the avoidance of doubt, these\nobservations are made solely to provide guidance, and (i) do not constitute additional\n\n10\n\n\ffindings of breaches of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation in this case; or\n(ii) factor in any way in the Commission’s final decision in this case.\n\n31\n\nThe creation and maintenance of a personal data asset inventory is an\n\nestablished security practice. Amongst other things, it enables an organisation to track\nits personal data assets and ensures that its periodic security reviews cover all of its\nthe personal data assets5.\n\n32\n\nIn the present case, the Organisation maintained an inventory of the data\n\nassets used for its business operations systems, which was reviewed periodically.\nHowever, this inventory did not include the Personal Data contained in the Affected\nServer. As such, despite its periodic reviews, the Organisation remained unaware that\nthe Personal Data continued to reside in the Affected Server for more than 2 years\nafter the Migration, and therefore failed to take steps to ensure its deletion.\n\n33\n\nThat said, it was not necessary for the Commission to make breach findings in\n\nrelation to the above data protection practice in this case.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n34\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA\nwere considered.\n\n35\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n5 Re Eatigo International Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 9 at [15] to [19], Re Management Corporation Strata Title\n\nPlan No. 3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [13]\n\n11\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt actions after being alerted about the\nIncident to mitigate the effects of the Incident and to prevent a\nrecurrence;\n\n(b)\n\nInvestigations were handled under the Expedited Decision Procedure,\nunder which the Organisation admitted to the facts set out in this decision\nand to its contraventions of the Protection Obligation; and\n\n(c)\n\n36\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations.\n\nHowever, in terms of the nature, gravity and duration of the non-compliance by\n\nthe Organisation, the Organisation’s breach of the Protection Obligation continued for\na duration of more than two years. This long period of non-compliance, coupled with\nthe Organisation’s failure to provide clear instructions and supervise its staff during the\nMigration and the Divestment processes, reveals systemic shortcomings in the\nOrganisation’s data protection processes.\n\n37\n\nThe Commission notes that there were approximately 22,659 Affected\n\nIndividuals, of which up to 7,184 individuals’ personal data could have been exfiltrated.\n\n38\n\nThe Commission further notes that some of the personal data affected included,\n\namongst other things, specimen signatures, full images of identification cards and/or\nbank account numbers. This exposed certain individuals to greater risks of identity\ntheft or actual financial losses.\n\n12\n\n\f39\n\nFinally, for the purposes of assessing what amount of financial penalty would\n\nbe effective to deter non-compliance with the PDPA, the Commission also took into\nconsideration the turnover of the Organisation6.\n\n40\n\nIn quantifying the financial penalty to be imposed in any given case, the\n\nCommission aims to strike a careful balance between an amount that is (i)\nproportionate to the circumstances and effect of the organisation’s non-compliance\nwith the PDPA but (ii) that remains effective as a deterrent when considering the\nmeans of the organisation. In the present case, upon a consideration of all the factors\nlisted under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, the Commission is of the view that a higher\nfinancial penalty is warranted to ensure that the financial penalty meted is\nproportionate in light of the Organisation’s long period of non-compliance with the\nProtection Obligation (including during the Migration exercise in May 2020 and again\nduring the Divestment in July 2022) and the type and nature of the personal data\naffected. A higher financial penalty is also warranted to ensure that the financial\npenalty meted will be effective in ensuring future compliance with the PDPA and to\nachieve the requisite deterrent effect.\n\n41\n\nBased on the above, the Commission determined that the Organisation should\n\npay a financial penalty of $120,000 within 30 days from the date of the notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n6 See e.g. Re Fullerton Healthcare Group Pte Limited and Agape CP Holdings Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPC 5 at\n\n[39], Re Autobahn Rent A Car Pte Ltd [2023] SGPDPCS 4 at [11], Re Century Evergreen Private Limited\n[2023] SGPDPCS 5 at [11]\n\n13\n\n\f42\n\nIn view of the remedial actions already been taken by the Organisation, no\n\nfurther directions need be issued to the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n14\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $18,000 was imposed on CH Offshore for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect customers' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Directions","Transport and Storage","Ransomware","Vulnerability"],"date":"04 Jul 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_ch-offshore-ltd_17042024.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by CH Offshore","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/06/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ch-offshore","timestamp":"2024-07-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\nCase No. DP-2304-C0872\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCH Offshore Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 18\n\n\fCH Offshore Ltd.\n\n[2024] SGPDPC 2\n\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2304-C0872\n17 April 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nCH Offshore Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is an owner-operator and ship manager\n\nof offshore support vessels for the offshore marine oil and gas sector. On 3 April 2023,\nthe Organisation filed a Data Breach Notification (“DBN”) to the Personal Data\nProtection Commission (the “Commission”) regarding a ransomware attack on its\nservers on or about 28 March 2023 that led to a loss of access to the Organisation’s\nshared drives and the encryption of files containing personal data (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nbelow; and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nPage 2 of 18\n\n\fFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation’s employees discovered that they could no longer access the\n\nfiles in the shared drives in the morning of 29 March 2023. Thereafter, the Organisation\nimmediately disconnected the affected servers and sought external IT forensics to\ninvestigate the extent of the Incident and undertake remedial action.\n\n4\n\nInvestigations revealed that the files had been encrypted by one ransomware-\n\nas-a-service (RaaS) threat known as “Alpha aka Blackcat” (the “Threat Actor”).\nInvestigations found that there were suspicious virtual private network (“VPN”)\nconnections over Remote Desktop Protocol at the time of the Incident, suggesting that\nthe Threat Actor likely gained access to the Organisation’s network using two VPN\naccounts that belonged to an employee and its outsourced IT vendor respectively.\n\n5\n\nEven though the investigation was unable to conclusively determine how the\n\nThreat Actor got hold of the credentials to the two VPN accounts, the investigation\nrevealed the following lapses which could have contributed to the Incident:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation’s firewall FortiOS had not been patched since its\ndeployment in December 2021 and had been exposed to multiple\nRemote Code Execution (“RCE”) attacks since December 2021.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation had a high-risk IT infrastructure without proper\nnetwork segmentation and access control measures to prevent\nunauthorised access within its network. All the servers, clients and\nPage 3 of 18\n\n\fother work devices were connected on a single network segment. The\nOrganisation’s network diagram indicated weak network configuration\nand segmentation.\n\n(c)\n\nRDP protocols were enabled on all servers and firewall rules were not\ntightened to only allow pre-defined legitimate traffic between network\nsegments.\n\n(d)\n\nThe password policy feature in the firewall was not enabled and applied\nto the affected Firewall user accounts.\n\n(e)\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (“MFA”) was not implemented for all remote\naccess VPNs, including for user accounts with high-level system\naccess.\n\n(f)\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops –\nenabling a user to install/uninstall applications without restriction.\n\n(g)\n\nUse of obsolete applications (Finance Management Accounting\nSystem) and devices should be avoided as they operate on old and\nvulnerable protocols and ciphers.\n\n(h)\n\nCritical hosts were not regularly scanned for vulnerabilities.\n\n(i)\n\nThe\n\nSymantec Endpoint Protection\n\n(“SEP”) installed on the\n\ncompromised machines did not detect and prevent the execution of\nPage 4 of 18\n\n\fmalicious software. The SEP Manager was compromised early and\ncould have been used to disable all agents.\n\n(j)\n\nThere was an absence of Managed Security Services / Managed\nDetection and Response to adequately detect anomaly behaviour in the\nservers and clients.\n\n6\n\nEvent logs showed that 2.38TB of data was transferred over suspicious VPN\n\nconnections at the time of the Incident. The sample files from the Threat Actor\ncontained 33 employee performance appraisal forms which showed that data\nexfiltration had most likely taken place.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that the affected servers contained\n\nthe following personal data of 5,906 employees, ex-employees, next-of-kin, board\ndirectors and stakeholders (with varying numbers for each affected type of personal\ndata):\n(a)\n\nName;\n\n(b)\n\nAddress;\n\n(c)\n\nDate of Birth;\n\n(d)\n\nEmail address;\n\n(e)\n\nNRIC number;\n\n(f)\n\nForeign ID number;\nPage 5 of 18\n\n\f(g)\n\nTelephone number;\n\n(h)\n\nPassport number;\n\n(i)\n\nPhotograph;\n\n(j)\n\nThumbprints;\n\n(k)\n\nHealth information, such as employed seamen’s medical reports,\nlaboratory test reports and vaccinations;\n\n(l)\n\nFinancial information, such as bank account numbers and pay slips;\n\n(m)\n\nEducational certificates of employed seamen; and\n\n(n)\n\nSeaman’s Book that would include name, date of birth, place of birth,\nnationality, sex, height, colour of eyes and hair, next of kin’s name and\naddress.\n\nRemedial Actions\n\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation promptly notified the affected\n\nindividuals about the Incident. The Organisation also took the following remedial\nactions:\n\n(a)\n\nEngaged a cybersecurity expert to review its IT infrastructure and\nimplement effective cybersecurity solutions;\n\nPage 6 of 18\n\n\f(b)\n\nEngaged a third party security company to conduct security traffic\nmonitoring, firewall rules review and vulnerability assessment; and\n\n(c)\n\nConducted a network wide scan to ensure there was no remaining\nmalware.\n\n9\n\nThe Organisation informed the Commission that it intended to conduct the\n\nfollowing remedial actions:\n\n(a)\n\nHarden its perimeter firewall e.g. by implementing 2FA for incoming\nVPN connections to prevent malicious traffic from gaining its internal\nnetwork;\n\n(b)\n\nConduct periodic vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, at\nleast annually or after major systems upgrade/enhancement;\n\n(c)\n\nTighten its identity and access management by amongst others,\nenforcing an enhanced password policy and implementing MFA for\nprivileged accounts and high-risk connections;\n\n(d)\n\nInstall Endpoint Detection and Response on all servers and clients and\nURL filtering measures;\n\n(e)\n\nEnhance its cybersecurity platform by implementing Managed\nDetection and Response and/or Managed Security Services;\n\nPage 7 of 18\n\n\f(f)\n\nEnsure that all active PCs and servers are updated with the latest\npatches, and updating/replacing outdated applications and operating\nsystem;\n\n(g)\n\nImplementing measures against lateral movements unauthorised\nchanges;\n\n(h)\n\nEducating all employees on how to apply strong encryption algorithm\nfor file/folder/disk encryption;\n\n(i)\n\nConduct end user awareness training such as phishing stimulation\nexercises to train employees and IT staff to identify phishing emails and\nspot signs of compromise; and\n\n(j)\n\nTo obtain the Cyber Essential certification.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n\n10\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nPage 8 of 18\n\n\f11\n\nThe Organisation admitted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA as it failed to\n\nhave reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal data in its\npossession or under its control:\n\n(a)\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops so that\nthey could work and receive IT support remotely. The administrator\nrights facilitated the Threat Actor in disabling the endpoint security\nsoftware in the Organisation’s employee laptops before ransomware\ndeployment.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation admitted that its firewall firmware was not patched\nsince December 2021.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it did not implement multi-factor\nauthentication for remote access VPN logins.\n\n12\n\nThe Commission finds that the Organisation has breached the Protection\n\nObligation as it failed to conduct reasonable periodic security reviews, and lacked\nsufficiently robust processes to protect personal data through regular patching,\nupdates, and/or upgrades of important software or firmware.\n\n13\n\nPeriodic security reviews would have allowed the Organisation the opportunity\n\nto detect the following security issues:\n\nPage 9 of 18\n\n\f(a)\n\nWith respect to the outdated firewall which had not been patched since\nDecember 2021, the Organisation could have introduced a patch\nmanagement process to keep the firewall reasonably updated and\nreducing its exposure to any vulnerabilities.\n\n(b)\n\nThe security implications of the Organisation’s IT infrastructure should\nhave been considered either before implementation or at least during\nperiodic security reviews.\n\n(c)\n\nReasonably conducted security reviews should have assessed the\nneed for better access control to the Organisation’s network that held\npersonal data. If the user accounts had required high-level system\naccess, an access control option would have been to introduce MFA\nfor remote access VPN logins.\n\n14\n\nThe Organisation explained that security maintenance had been outsourced to\n\nits then-IT vendor and it expected the vendor to conduct such periodic security reviews\nas part of the vendor’s IT services. However, organisations that rely on vendors to\nconduct security reviews must be able to show that they had stipulated such reviews\nas a job specification of the vendor. They must also exercise reasonable oversight of\nthe vendor’s delivery of the job specified. As the Commission previously highlighted at\n[51] in Re Smiling Orchid (S) Pte Ltd:1\n\n1 [2017] PDP Digest 133.\n\nPage 10 of 18\n\n\fData controllers that engage outsourced service providers have to be clear\nabout the nature and extent of services that the service provider is to provide.\nThere must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service\nprovider has agreed to undertake, and this should be properly documented.\nData controllers should follow through with the procedures to check that the\noutsourced provider is indeed delivering the services.\n\n15\n\nIn the present case, even though the Organisation had a contract with its IT\n\nvendor to perform “monthly maintenance for the IT systems”, including the firewalls,\nthe Organisation failed to exercise reasonable oversight to ensure that its IT vendor\ndid its part. The Organisation last conducted an audit of the vendor’s service delivery\nin 2021, which culminated in a one-time firewall firmware update completed in\nDecember 2021. When the Incident occurred, the audit cycle for the next review of the\nservice delivery had not yet commenced. The onus was on the Organisation to show\nthat this had been a reasonable oversight.\n\n16\n\nFurther, even though the Organisation had engaged an IT vendor, the\n\nOrganisation retained responsibility and decision-making over its IT infrastructure\nsetup and updating of important software/firmware. Ownership and responsibility for\nthese systemic issues therefore remained with the Organisation and the Organisation\nshould have been aware of the security risks from its lack of sufficiently robust\nprocesses for patching and/or upgrades of important software and firmware.\n\nPage 11 of 18\n\n\f17\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Organisation had contravened section 24\n\nof the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n18\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Organisation\n\nunder section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Organisation should be required to\npay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA were considered.\n\n19\n\nThe Commission considered that the personal data of 5,906 individuals was\n\naffected in this personal data breach. Further, the health information (comprising of\nthe medical records, laboratory test reports and vaccinations) and financial information\n(comprising of bank account numbers and pay slips) of 1,425 seamen who were\nemployed by the Organisation were at risk of unauthorised access.\n\n20\n\nThe Commission also considered the following mitigating factors:\n\n(a)\n\nThis is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation cooperated with the Commission in the course of its\ninvestigations and took prompt remedial actions to address the\nIncident.\n\nPage 12 of 18\n\n\f(c)\n\nThe Organisation had voluntarily accepted responsibility for the\nIncident, thus facilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of\nthis case through the Expedited Breach Procedure.\n\n21\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Deputy Commissioner made a preliminary decision\n\nto impose a financial penalty of $27,000 on the Organisation for its breach of the\nProtection Obligation.\n\n22\n\nIn addition, to ensure the Organisation’s compliance with the Protection\n\nObligation, the Deputy Commissioner also directed the Organisation, under section\n48I of the PDPA, to furnish a schedule and report to the Commission on the completion\nof the remedial actions outlined in paragraph 9 above and the following remedial\nactions:\n\n(a)\n\nReview and enhance its asset and patch management process;\n\n(b)\n\nEnhance its servers and infrastructure to CIS benchmarks;\n\n(c)\n\nImplement network segmentation and tighten access controls in its\nnetwork; and\n\n(d)\n\nImprove its logging capabilities with a centralised log server.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\nPage 13 of 18\n\n\f23\n\nThe Organisation was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the\n\nCommission’s letter dated 9 February 2024 and was invited to make representations.\nOn 23 February 2024, the Organisation made the following representations to the\nCommission seeking a reduction in the financial penalty:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation should not be penalised for failing to procure\nManaged Security Services (“MSS”) because this was not an express\nrequirement under the PDPA and should not be seen as a lapse that\nled to the Incident.\n\n(b)\n\nIt should not be penalised for failing to review endpoint security\napplications because the lack of such reviews would not have\nprevented the Incident.\n\n(c)\n\nIt had supervised its IT vendor to ensure that maintenance services for\nits IT system were performed. An audit on the IT vendor’s services was\nconducted in December 2021 and the Incident had occurred before the\nnext audit review had commenced. Thus, the Organisation sought the\nCommission’s consideration that it had review processes in place.\n\n(d)\n\nIt could not be conclusively determined if the Threat Actor had indeed\nexfiltrated any personal data.\n\n(e)\n\nThe financial penalty imposed is disproportionately high as compared\nto the financial penalty imposed by the Commission in other cases.\nPage 14 of 18\n\n\fRepresentations not accepted by the Commission\n\n24\n\nFirst, the Commission is unable to accept the Organisation’s representations\n\nthat the financial penalty should be reduced because MSS is not an express\nrequirement under the PDPA and that it had been penalised for not implementing such\nservices.\n\n25\n\nThe Commission had only pointed to the absence of Managed Security\n\nServices in paragraph [5] above as one of the lapses which could have contributed to\nthe Incident. The Commission’s finding that the Organisation had contravened the\nPDPA was not based on the absence of MSS but rather, the overall lack of robust\nprocesses in place to update important software and firmware, which led to personal\ndata in its possession being placed at risk. The Commission found the Organisation in\nbreach of the Protection Obligation as it ought to but failed to implement reasonable\nsecurity measures commensurate with the sensitivity of the personal data in its\npossession.\n\n26\n\nThe Organisation also made representations that it could not be conclusively\n\ndetermined if the Threat Actor had indeed exfiltrated any personal data. The\nOrganisation represented that based on the dark web scans conducted by its\ncybersecurity consultant, the sample files of the data relating to the Organisation did\nnot contain any sensitive personal data such as “NRIC numbers or bank details” and\nquestioned whether the hackers obtained any personal data.\n\nPage 15 of 18\n\n\f27\n\nThe Organisation’s representations in this regard are not accepted. Based on\n\nour investigations, the sample files uploaded on the dark web by the Threat Actor\ncontained 33 employee performance appraisal forms with the full names and work\nappraisals of the affected individuals, which suffice as evidence that data exfiltration\nhad most likely occurred at the time of the Incident. The Commission is also satisfied\nthat there was unauthorised access to files containing personal data because these\nfiles had been encrypted by ransomware.\n\n28\n\nFinally, the Commission is unable to accept the representations made by the\n\nOrganisation that the financial penalty imposed is disproportionately high as compared\nto the financial penalty imposed by the Commission in other cases. The financial\npenalty for each case is assessed based on a consideration of the different factors\nlisted under section 48J(6) of the PDPA, some of which may be present and weigh\nmore heavily in some cases as compared to others. In addition, the Commission is\nunable to justify a reduction to the financial penalty on the basis of the cases cited by\nthe Organisation, when these cases were decided some time before legislative\namendments to increase the maximum financial penalty under the PDPA came into\neffect on 1 October 2022.\n\nRepresentations accepted by the Commission\n29\n\nHaving said that however, the Commission was minded to accept the other\n\nrepresentations made by the Organisation and adjust the financial penalty amount\naccordingly.\nPage 16 of 18\n\n\f30\n\nThe Organisation represented that a review of the endpoint security application\n\nwould not have prevented the Incident, and the lack of such reviews did not cause the\nIncident. The central application managing endpoint security in its network had been\ncompromised early at the time of the Incident and gave the Threat Actor control to\ndisable endpoint security capabilities.\n\n31\n\nThe Commission accepts the Organisation’s representation that periodic review\n\nand updates to the endpoint security application, albeit a good preventive measure,\nwould not have detected the malware at all when it has been successfully infiltrated\nand then disabled.\n\n32\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor only\n\nhad a general stipulation for the vendor to perform monthly IT maintenance and secure\nits systems. The Organisation represented that it was dependent on the vendor to\nperform such services and it did have review processes on its part to check the\nvendor’s service delivery. The vendor was last reviewed in December 2021 in\naccordance with its audit cycle that occurs every two to three years, and the\nOrganisation was not yet due to commence its next audit before the Incident occurred\non or about 28 March 2023.\n\n33\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Commission accepts the Organisation’s\n\nrepresentations that the Organisation did exercise some degree of oversight on its IT\nvendor by way of audit processes, particularly since the last audit had been conducted\nslightly over a year before the Incident occurred. If the last audit had been conducted\nPage 17 of 18\n\n\fmuch earlier in time, the Commission would have been less inclined to accept the\nOrganisation’s representations that the Incident occurred before the next audit cycle\nwas due to commence.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n34\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, including the\n\nrepresentations successfully made by the Organisation, the Commission hereby\nrequires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $18,000. The Organisation is\nrequired to do so within 30 days from the date of the directions, failing which interest\nat the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall accrue\nand be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the financial\npenalty is paid in full.\n\n35\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation is also directed to:\n\n(a)\n\nFurnish a schedule for the completion of all the remedial actions set out\n\nin paragraphs 9 and 22 of this Decision within 30 days from the date of this\nDecision; and\n(b)\n\nTo report to the Commission upon the completion of all the remedial\n\nactions outlined above.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\nPage 18 of 18\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $7,000 was imposed on Tok Leng Leng t/a Top Mobile Gallery (BR) for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect against the unauthorised use of and access to customers’ personal data for registration of pre-paid SIM cards.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Wholesale and Retail Trade"],"date":"04 Jul 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_tok-leng-leng-(trading-as-top-mobile-gallery-(br))_01032024.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Tok Leng Leng t/a Top Mobile Gallery (BR)","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/06/protection-obligation-by-tok-leng-leng-ta-top-mobile-gallery","timestamp":"2024-07-04","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2024] SGPDPCS 1\nCase No. DP-2208-C0053\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTok Leng Leng (trading as Top Mobile Gallery (BR))\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nBetween the period December 2020 to April 2021, the Personal Data Protection\n\nCommission (“the Commission”) received 435 Do Not Call (“DNC”) complaints\nrelating to property messages, despite their numbers being registered with the DNC\nRegister. The complaints were traced to 44 M1 pre-paid SIM cards sold by Tok Leng\nLeng (trading as Top Mobile Gallery (BR)) (“Organisation”), located in a foreign\nworker dormitory at 2 Seletar North Link.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations into the Organisation for\n\nsuspected breaches under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n\fFacts of the Case\n\n3.\n\nThe 44 M1 pre-paid SIM cards were registered under 33 unique individuals who\n\nwere foreign workers. Investigations confirmed that these foreign workers lived in the\ndormitory at 2 Seletar North Link, and had purchased pre-paid SIM cards from the\nOrganisation. Additional pre-paid SIM cards were registered under their names even\nthough they had not in fact purchased these SIM cards (the “illicit SIM cards”).\n\n4.\n\nAs a retailer of M1 SIM cards, the Organisation used a terminal device issued\n\nby M1 for the purposes of SIM card registration. The SIM card registration process\nwith the M1 terminal device was as follows:\n\na.\n\nFirst, the customer’s identity document (e.g. identity card, passport, work\npass etc.) would be scanned using the terminal device, which is\nconnected directly to M1’s registration system. The system would\ncapture the customer’s particulars, and whether the customer had\nreached the limit of 3 pre-paid SIM cards.\n\nb.\n\nNext, the barcode of the SIM card(s) would be scanned so that they could\nbe tagged to the registered customer.\n\nc.\n\nFinally, the retailer would use a mobile application to load credit value to\nthe prepaid SIM card(s) to activate them for usage. This was done in the\nOrganisation’s premises. M1’s policy was for each prepaid M1 SIM card\nto have a zero-initial balance, and for retailers to load some or all the\nmoney paid by the customer.\n\n\f5.\n\nAt a certain point in time, the Organisation started registering M1 pre-paid SIM\n\ncards via a M1 mobile application on a mobile phone.\n\n6.\n\nAs the Organisation registered M1 pre-paid SIM cards by scanning the front\n\nand back of the affected individuals’ work permits, the following types of personal data\nwas affected:\n\na.\n\nName;\n\nb.\n\nSex;\n\nc.\n\nFIN / work permit number;\n\nd.\n\nDate of Birth;\n\ne.\n\nNationality; and\n\nf.\n\nName of employer.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n7.\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines an “organisation” to include “any individual,\n\ncompany, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”. The\nOrganisation is a sole proprietorship and has no separate legal personality from Tok\nLeng Leng (“TLL”). Accordingly, TLL (trading as Top Mobile Gallery (BR)) is an\norganisation for the purposes of the PDPA.\n\n\f8.\n\nBased on the circumstances set out above, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentered on whether the Organisation had breached the Protection Obligation under\nsection 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA\n\n9.\n\nUnder section 24(a) of the PDPA, organisations must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n10.\n\nDuring investigations, the Organisation admitted to a breach of section 24 of\n\nthe PDPA. TLL, the sole proprietor of Top Mobile Gallery (BR), accepted that she failed\nto have security arrangements in place to protect against the unauthorised use of and\naccess to customers’ personal data for registration of M1 pre-paid SIM cards:\n\na.\n\nFirst, TLL admitted that she could have but failed to maintain an inventory\nof M1 pre-paid SIM cards. TLL explained that in contrast to the SIM cards\nsold by other retailers such as Singtel or Starhub which came with a prepaid balance, M1 pre-paid SIM cards came with zero initial-balance. This\ncontributed to her omission to maintain an inventory. Furthermore, the\nM1 salesperson did not have a fixed schedule for delivering the pre-paid\nSIM cards to the Organisation and would deliver more pre-paid SIM\ncards to the Organisation sporadically, which her employees would then\nacknowledge receipt.\n\n\fb.\n\nSecond, TLL admitted that she failed to have processes in place that\nwould require the employees to account for each M1 pre-paid SIM card\nsold and to whom the pre-paid SIM card was registered. TLL admitted\nthat all her employees had equal access to the M1 pre-paid SIM cards.\nThe Deputy Commissioner notes that the Organisation could have\nmaintained a record of the name of the employee who sold each prepaid SIM card, the date, time and place of registration, and sufficient\nparticulars of the individual to whom the SIM card was sold and\nregistered to.\n\nc.\n\nThird, TLL alluded in her statements of how her employees enjoyed the\nsame “access” to register the pre-paid SIM cards. This was corroborated\nby an employee, who stated that the login credentials to the M1\napplication used for registration of pre-paid SIM cards was shared\namongst the employees, and that the employees would login to the M1\napplication on their personal mobile devices if the Organisation’s mobile\ndevice was not readily available. In the Deputy Commission’s view, the\nOrganisation’s failure to implement access control restrictions and to\nprohibit the sharing, amongst its employees, of the login credentials to\nthe M1 mobile application used to register pre-paid SIM cards made it\nmuch easier for the employees to turn rogue, as it became harder to\ndetect the errant employee.\n\nd.\n\nTLL also admitted that there was little or no supervision over the\nOrganisation’s employees regarding how they used or accessed the\ncustomers’ personal data. She was often not at the shop and left the\n\n\fshop to be managed by her employees. While there was CCTV footage\ninstalled at the Organisation, she did not review the CCTV footage often.\n\n11.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Deputy Commissioner finds the Organisation\n\nin breach of the Protection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA as there has been\na complete failure to adopt any security arrangements to protect the customers’\npersonal data from misuse.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n\n12.\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty,\nthe matters set out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the\nPDPA were taken into account.\n\n13.\n\nIn addition, the Deputy Commissioner also considered the following factors\n\nwhich would justify an increase or decrease in the financial penalty:\n\nFactors that justify an increase in the financial penalty\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation’s breaches of the PDPA had caused inconvenience to\nother innocent parties. The illicit SIM cards sold by the Organisation were\nused to send unsolicited messages to phone numbers that were\nregistered with the DNC Register.\n\nb.\n\nEven though TLL denied knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of her\nemployees, TLL has been the registered sole-proprietor of Top Mobile\nsince 2014. She ought to have been aware of the practice of registering\n\n\fillicit SIM cards. The Organisation’s lackadaisical attitude towards\npreventing the potential misuse of individuals’ personal data and failure\nto introduce reasonable safeguards displayed a higher level of\nculpability.\n\nFactors that justify a decrease in the financial penalty\n\nc.\n\nThe Organisation admitted to its contravention to the PDPA and cooperated fully with the investigation process.\n\nd.\n\n14.\n\nThis is the first incident of a personal data breach by the Organisation.\n\nHaving considered the above factors and circumstances, the Commission\n\npreliminarily determined that a financial penalty of $7,000 would be imposed in respect\nof the Organisation’s contravention of the Protection Obligation. On 23 November\n2023, the Organisation was notified of the Commission’s preliminary decision,\nincluding the full findings set out above, and given 14 days to make written\nrepresentations.\n\nRepresentations Made by the Organisation\n\n15.\n\nWhile the Organisation did not challenge the findings and bases of the\n\ncontravention, the Organisation made representations to the Commission seeking that\na financial penalty not be imposed, summarised as follows:\n\na.\n\nTLL, as the sole proprietor of Top Mobile Gallery (BR), admitted that as\nthe boss it was her fault in failing to realise that her staff had\nmisappropriated the information provided by the customers in time;\n\n\fb.\n\nThe Organisation had been in business since 2014 and had always\ncomplied with applicable laws and regulations. Effectively, this is the\nOrganisation’s first contravention of the PDPA;\n\nc.\n\n16.\n\nThe financial penalty of $7,000 is a hefty amount for the Organisation.\n\nThe Commission considered the representations made carefully but was\n\nunable to accept them for the following reasons:\n\na.\n\nThe Commission had already taken into account the first two factors\nraised by the Organisation, in arriving at the preliminary decision;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation had not substantiated to the Commission that it is\nexperiencing financial difficulties and would be unable to continue with\nits usual business activities following the imposition of the financial\npenalty.\n\n17.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the Commission\n\nhereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $7,000 within 30 days\nfrom the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision.\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the above Summary\nof the Decision:\nProtection of personal data\n24(a). An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or disposal, or similar risks.\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Cortina Watch for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Directions","Wholesale and Retail Trade","Ransomware","Access control"],"date":"23 May 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_cortina-watch-pte-ltd_280324.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Cortina Watch","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-cortina-watch","timestamp":"2024-05-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2024] SGPDPCS 3\nCase No.: DP-2306-C1102\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nCortina Watch Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nCortina Watch Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is mainly involved in the retail,\n\nimport, and export of timepieces, branded pens, and luxury accessories. On 5 June\n2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) received a Data\nBreach Notification (“DBN”) filed by the Organisation, regarding a ransomware attack\non its server (the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation subsequently confirmed that the personal data of 3,953\n\nindividuals had been accessed and exfiltrated in the Incident. The breakdown of the\ndifferent types of personal data affected for the individuals was as follows:\n\n1\n\n\fTypes of Personal Data Affected\n\nNo. of Affected Individuals\n\nFull Name + Contact Number\n\n1,380\n\nFull Name + Address + Any Other Details\n\n930\n\nFull Name + Email\n\n688\n\nFull Name + Date of Birth + Any Other Details\n\n645\n\nFull Name + NRIC/Passport Number + Any 234\nOther Details\nFull Name + Email + Any Other Details\n\n68\n\nFull Name + Bank Account Number + Any 8\nOther Details\n\n3.\n\nThe Commission acceded to the Organisation’s request for the matter to be\n\nhandled under the Commission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This\nmeans that the Organisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the\nfacts set out below and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n4.\n\nBased on the Commission’s own investigations and the efforts of an IT forensic\n\ninvestigation firm engaged by the Organisation, it was determined that the\nOrganisation had experienced multiple brute force attacks between 30 April to 4 June\n2023. On 27 May 2023, a Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) account which the\nOrganisation had been using to test VPN access to live environments was\ncompromised. The threat actor successfully accessed a password-protected master\npassword file, and thereafter moved laterally across the servers. The threat actor\nexfiltrated 5.82 GB of data and deployed the “Lockbit 3.0” ransomware to encrypt other\n\n2\n\n\ffiles on the Organisation’s servers. The personal data of the affected individuals was\nsubsequently posted on the dark web.\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na.\n\nAll the servers were taken offline between 4 to 9 June 2023;\n\nb.\n\nAn Endpoint Detection Response tool was deployed on all the servers\nand endpoints for security visibility;\n\nc.\n\nImplemented a centralised log management to forward the firewall logs\nto a centralised server;\n\nd.\n\nIntroduced certificate-based authentication for VPN users, in addition to\nTwo-Factor Authentication (“2FA”);\n\ne.\n\nImplemented firewall VPN access with 2FA control;\n\nf.\n\nDecommissioned all servers running on legacy Windows Server 2008\nR2 and recreated new domains with Windows 2019 servers;\n\ng.\n\nNew network environments were created and hardened with a\nmandatory password complexity requirement and account lockout after\n3 tries;\n\nh.\n\nAs the Organisation’s data was not secured with encryption, the\nOrganisation implemented a new folder/file encryption solution; and\n\n3\n\n\fi.\n\nProper backup was put in place with Managed Service Provider services\nfrom an IT Vendor.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation admitted to breaching section 24 of the PDPA by failing to\n\nhave reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal data in its\npossession/control. The Organisation admitted that there was a lack of “housekeeping” on its “test” VPN user accounts and that it failed to implement reasonable\naccess controls to its network through its “test” VPN user accounts.\n\n7.\n\nCompliance with the Protection Obligation required the Organisation to conduct\n\na security assessment of what would have amounted to reasonable access control to\nits network. After such an assessment, the Organisation could have considered\nadopting the following security arrangements which would have enhanced access\ncontrol to its network:\n\na.\n\nEnforcing rules against the use of easy-to-guess usernames. Apart from\nthe “test” VPN user account, the Organisation’s investigations revealed\nthat there were several other default account names such as\n“Administrator” and “Guest” being used on its systems. The use of default\naccount names makes it easier for a threat actor to target and mount an\nattack against these accounts.\n\nb.\n\nImplementing multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) for all VPN accounts,\nfirewall access and access to files holding passwords. The Organisation\nadmitted it could have but had neglected to do so.\n\n4\n\n\f8.\n\nIn its decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 published\n\non 19 May 2022 (i.e. before the Incident), the Commission made clear that MFA was\nto be implemented as a baseline requirement for privileged accounts with remote\naccess to confidential or sensitive personal data or large volumes of personal data:\n\n“Henceforth, the Commission adopts the following tiered approach:\n\na.\n\nFirst, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data:\nsee [46]-[47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach,\nunless the organisation can show that its omission is reasonable or\nimplementation of 2FA is disproportionate.\n\nb.\n\nSecond, remote access by privileged accounts to information\nsystems that host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large\nvolumes of personal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA /\nMFA. The risks concerning remote access are higher, thus the\nexpectation to implement 2FA / MFA will correspondingly increase.\n\nc.\n\nThird, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or\nsensitive personal data, or large volumes of personal data, are\nexpected to enable and configure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that\nis available out-of-the-box. Omission to do so may be considered an\naggravating factor.”1 (emphasis added in bold)\n\n1\n\nSee Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 at [51].\n5\n\n\f9.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to enforce a strong password policy (by\n\nrequiring a combination of alphanumeric characters in addition to its existing password\npolicy of a minimum password length of 8 characters). The Commission finds the\nOrganisation in breach of section 24 of the PDPA for failing to enforce a robust\npassword policy. In the Lovebonito decision, the Commission had stated at [18] and\n[19] as follows:\n\n“A robust password policy is a key security measure that an organisation must\nhave in place to ensure that its IT systems are not vulnerable to common\nhacking attempts such as brute force attacks. As noted in Re (1) The Cellar\nDoor Pte Ltd; (2) Global Interactive Works Pte. Ltd. [2016] SGPDPC 22 (at\n[30(d)]):\n\n“… The need to have a strong password is fundamental to the security of the\ndatabase system. Weak passwords increase the chances of an intruder\ncracking the password and gaining full access to the database system, and,\nmore importantly, the personal data stored therein.”\n\n10.\n\nIn our Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems (the “Guide”), the\n\nCommission has encouraged organisations to implement as a basic practice, a\nminimum level of password complexity (12 alphanumeric characters with a mix of\nuppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters) particularly where password\nchanges are only enforced after periods of 6 months or more. In addition, we have\nalso encouraged organisations to impose, as an enhanced practice, a limit on the\nnumber of failed logins to minimise brute force attacks.\n\n6\n\n\fThe Commission’s starting point in assessing the robustness of an\n\n11.\n\norganisation’s data protection practices, are the practices recommended in our Guide.\nThat said, it is always open to an organisation to show that its omission to implement\nany of the Guide’s recommended practices is reasonable, and/or that alternative and\nequivalent measures have been implemented.\n\nUltimately, it is an organisation’s responsibility to put reasonable security\n\n12.\n\narrangements in place to protect the personal data in its possession or control, the\ndesign and implementation of which should reflect the volume and sensitivity of the\ndata handled, the nature of business and the types of services offered. The\nCommission reiterates the importance of data protection by design and encourages\norganisations to design and implement the appropriate protection measures so as to\nmaintain good governance over its personal data and mitigate data breach risks.\n\nHaving considered the impact of the Incident, the Organisation’s prompt\n\n13.\n\nremedial actions, and its cooperation during the course of the investigation, the\nCommission considered it appropriate, in lieu of imposing a financial penalty, to direct\nthe Organisation to comply with the following:\n\n(a)\n\nTo engage a third-party cyber security vendor to conduct a targeted\nsecurity audit to enhance access control to personal data in its\npossession within the network; and\n\n(b)\n\nTo complete the above Direction within 60 days and to submit a\ncomprehensive report to PDPC within 7 days of its completion.\n\n7\n\n\fThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24(a). An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its\ncontrol by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, or similar risks.\n\n8\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $28,000 was imposed on Horizon Fast Ferry for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect its platform users' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Accountability","Financial Penalty","Arts, Entertainment and Recreation"],"date":"23 May 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_horizon-fast-ferry-pte-ltd_21022024.pdf","nature":"Protection, Accountability","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Horizon Fast Ferry","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/05/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-horizon-fast-ferry","timestamp":"2024-05-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2024] SGPDPC 1\n\nCase No. DP-2304-C0943\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nHorizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd.\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fHorizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd.\n\n[2024] SGPDPC 1\n\nDenise Wong, Deputy Commissioner - Case No. DP-2304-C0943\n\n21 February 2024\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 April 2023, Horizon Fast Ferry Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”), a\n\nSingapore-based ferry operator, that provides ferries between Singapore and Batam,\nIndonesia, notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nthat there had been unauthorised access and exfiltration of the personal data of\n108,488 individuals who booked tickets on the Organisation’s website from its server\n(the “Incident”).\n\n2.\n\nThe personal data affected included the individuals’ name, passport number,\n\ndate of birth, passport issue and expiry date, nationality, email address (if provided)\nand telephone number (if provided).\n\n3.\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to be\n\nhandled under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure. This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in\nthis Decision and that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\n2\n\n\f4.\n\nSection 24 of the PDPA requires an organisation to protect personal data in its\n\npossession or control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent\nunauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal, or\nsimilar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n5.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it does not have its own Information Technology\n\n(“IT”) department. The Organisation relied informally on the goodwill of a single\nindividual (the “IT Supervisor”) employed by an overseas IT vendor (the “IT Support\nVendor”) who had access to the Organisation’s IT systems to provide IT support.\n\n6.\n\nThe Organisation did not have any service contract with the IT Support Vendor.\n\nThe IT Support Vendor was in fact engaged by PT Prima Sembilan, the Organisation’s\nticket sales partner in Batam, to provide IT services.\n\n7.\n\nThe IT Supervisor also acted on the Organisation’s behalf to liaise with other\n\ncontractors engaged by the Organisation – first, PT Mareco Prima Mandiri\n(“Contractor I”) which was engaged in 2019 to set up the Organisation’s website, and\nsubsequently, PT Rintas Inovasi Indonesia (“PTRII”) (“Contractor II”) which was\nengaged from 1 June 2022 to maintain and service the Organisation’s website before\nthe termination of this contract on 22 November 2022. For clarity, the Commission\nshould add that the Organisation engaged Contractor II to maintain and service its\nwebsite as the key personnel from the Contractor I who had helped to set up the\nOrganisation’s website founded Contractor II.\n\n3\n\n\f8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the Incident occurred because valid credentials\n\nto its Ubuntu operating system root account (the “Root Account”), which is akin to a\nsuper-user account, had been misused to gain unauthorised access to the personal\ndata in the Organisation’s possession and/or control.\n\n9.\n\nAccess to the Root Account had initially been granted to Contractor I to set up\n\nthe Organisation’s website in 2019. When Contractor I claimed that the Root Account\nwas no longer accessible sometime in 2019, the IT Supervisor sought to verify this\nclaim and tried to login to the Root Account but was unable to do so. The IT Supervisor\nthen assumed that the Root Account was no longer accessible.\n\n10.\n\nWhen the Organisation terminated its website maintenance and servicing\n\ncontract with Contractor II on 22 November 2022, the IT Supervisor acted on the\nOrganisation’s behalf to acknowledge the receipt of certain items related to the project.\nHowever, as can be seen from the Incident, the user credentials of the Root Account\nremained active and was used to gain unauthorised access to the Organisation’s\nsystem. The IT Supervisor was once again not able to verify if the credentials for the\nRoot Account had been disabled or reassigned to him.\n\n11.\n\nIt is also relevant to add that after the termination of its contract with Contractor\n\nII, the Organisation did not have any contract in force with any other IT vendor from\n22 November 2022 till the time of the Incident.\n\n12.\n\nFrom 19 March 2023 onwards, the Organisation received several ransomware\n\nemails which revealed that personal data of the Organisation’s customers had been\nexfiltrated. The threat actor demanded payment in exchange for fixing the vulnerability\nin the Organisation’s system. The Organisation’s internal investigations revealed that\n4\n\n\fvalid credentials for the Root Account had been used to gain unauthorised access to\nthe Organisation’s server. Upon making this discovery on 29 March 2023, the IT\nSupervisor promptly changed the credentials for the Root Account on the same day.\n\n13.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that the IT Supervisor’s lack of familiarity with the\n\nUbuntu operating system led the latter to mistakenly believe Contractor I’s claim that\nthe Root Account was no longer active, and that the Contractors involved had only\nbeen able to login to the Organisation’s system through a different customer account.\n\nRemedial Action\n\n14.\n\nAfter the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na.\n\nEngaged a cyber incident response vendor to perform digital forensics\ninvestigations and implemented all the recommendations made by the\nvendor to improve its cybersecurity;\n\nb.\n\nEngaged a vendor to develop a new website; and\n\nc.\n\nConducted penetration testing on the new website and rectified all the\nvulnerabilities identified before the website’s launch.\n\n15.\n\nThe Organisation also informed the Commission that it would take the following\n\nremedial actions:\n\na.\n\nTrain its managers on the obligations and requirements of the PDPA.\nThe IT Support Vendor and the current web development vendor will also\nbe invited to attend the training;\n5\n\n\fb.\n\nEnter into a written agreement with the IT Support Vendor for the access\nand management of the Organisation’s systems and website. The\nOrganisation will require the IT Support Vendor to designate a staff\nmember with the relevant IT knowledge required;\n\nc.\n\nEnhance its internal guidelines on data protection; and\n\nd.\n\nDevelop guidelines and protocols for its vendors, outlining the\nprocedures for handling personal data and establishing processes for\naccess, password management and other security measures.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n16.\n\nAs the Organisation is in possession of the personal data of its customers, the\n\nOrganisation is required to comply with all the data protection obligations under the\nPDPA, including making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised\naccess, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal, or similar risks,\npursuant to section 24 of the PDPA. This is regardless of whether the Organisation\nengaged a data intermediary as defined under the PDPA or an external IT vendor.\n\n17.\n\nFor completeness, we would add that based on the admissions made by the\n\nOrganisation, the IT Support Vendor and the Contractors involved did not carry out\nany processing activities with regards to personal data on the Organisation’s behalf\nsuch that they would fall within the definition of a “data intermediary” under section\n2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\f18.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Deputy Commissioner determines that the\n\nOrganisation failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the\npersonal data in its possession and/or control, thus acting in breach of section 24 of\nthe PDPA. In particular, the Organisation failed to:\n\na.\n\nEnsure the proper management of the IT Support Vendor by having\nwritten policies and procedures for vendor management;\n\nb.\n\nImplement an Information and Communications Technology (“ICT”)\npolicy that covers the critical aspects of IT security; and\n\nc.\n\nEnsure that security solutions were implemented for its web server.\n\nPoor Vendor Management\n\n19.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it did not have any written policies and\n\nprocedures for vendor management or policies relating to how outsourced vendors\nshould ensure the protection of personal data when handling personal data.\n\n20.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that even though it relied on the IT Support Vendor\n\nto provide IT support and to act on its behalf when liaising with external vendors such\nas the Contractors involved, the Organisation failed to define and capture the job\nscope, responsibilities and competencies required of key personnel through a formal\ncontractual agreement with the IT Support Vendor.\n\n7\n\n\f21.\n\nThe importance of clarifying the obligations of an organisation and a service\n\nprovider had been made by the Commission in several cases. In Re Smiling Orchid\n(S) Pte Ltd1, the Deputy Commissioner stated at [51] of the decision as follows:\n\n“Data controllers that engaged outsourced service providers have to be clear\nabout the nature and extent of services that the service provider is to provide.\nThere must be a clear meeting of minds as to the services that the service\nprovider has agreed to undertake, and this should be properly documented.\nData controllers should follow through with the procedures to check that the\noutsourced provider is indeed delivering the services.”\n\n22.\n\nIn the handbook titled How to Guard against Common Types of Data Breaches\n\nissued by the Commission in May 20212, the Commission had identified the failure\namong organisations to establish clear responsibility for ICT security as one of the top\nfive most common gaps leading to a data breach based on an analysis of past cases.\nIn the handbook, the Commission recommended that organisations should establish\nclear responsibility for ICT security to either an assigned person or team. Further,\nwhere ICT security is to be performed by a vendor, the scope of work and areas of\nresponsibilities should be clearly stated in a contract.\n\n23.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to ensure that the IT Support Vendor\n\nhad personnel who were sufficiently familiar with the Ubuntu operating system so that\nthey could perform basic system administrator functions like access management. As\na result, the Organisation was not aware at the time of the Incident that the Root\n\n1 [2017] PDP Digest 133.\n2 Available at https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/news-and-events/announcements/2021/05/handbook-on-how-\n\nto-guard-against-common-types-of-data-breaches-now-available (as at 14 December 2023).\n8\n\n\fAccount had remained active. Competent vendor administration of the Organisation’s\nUbuntu operating system would have reasonably reduced the risk of the Incident\noccurring.\n\nFailure to implement an ICT policy that covers critical aspects of IT security\n\n24.\n\nThe Organisation also admitted that it did not have any ICT policy at the time\n\nof the Incident. In its Checklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches,\nthe Commission recommends at page 6 that organisations, as a basic practice,\n“develop an ICT policy that covers the critical aspects in IT security such as account\nand access control, password, email, IT risk management, asset and configuration,\nbackup and recovery, hardening and patching”.\n\nFailure to implement security solutions on its web server\n\n25.\n\nThe Organisation further admitted that it had not implemented any security\n\nsolutions on its web server at the time of the Incident. As stated in the Commission’s\nChecklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches at page 10,\norganisations should, as a basic practice, equip networks with defence devices such\nas firewalls to protect computer networks connected to the Internet.\n\n26.\n\nExamples of security solutions that the Organisation could have implemented\n\nincludes web application scanning, which might have reduced the likelihood of the\nIncident occuring. However, the Organisation simply assumed that the Contractor II\nwould conduct regular web application scanning despite this not being specified in\ntheir contract with Contractor II. In any case, the contract had already been terminated\n\n9\n\n\fa few months before the Incident, and the Organisation did not have any contract in\nforce with any IT vendor to do so at the material time.\n\n27.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Organisation is found to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation under section 24 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n28.\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on the Organisation\n\npursuant to section 48J(1) of the PDPA, and if so, the amount of such financial penalty,\nthe Commission considered the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA.\n\n29.\n\nThe Commission considered that the data breach affected 108,488 individuals\n\nand that the type of personal data affected included the passport details.\n\nThe\n\nOrganisation’s non-compliance with section 24 of the PDPA was also serious as the\nOrganisation had failed to implement basic levels of data protection policies and\npractices.\n\n30.\n\nFurthermore, this was not the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance\n\nwith the PDPA. A financial penalty of $54,000 had previously been meted on the\nOrganisation in the Commission’s decision dated 25 July 2019 for a personal data\nbreach on the Organisation’s website. More recently, the Commission issued a\nwarning to the Organisation on 16 October 2020 for failing to have reasonable security\narrangements to protect the personal data in the Organisation’s email account.\n\n31.\n\nThe Commission nevertheless recognises the following mitigating factors:\n\n10\n\n\fa.\n\nThe Organisation cooperated with the Commission in the course of its\ninvestigations and took prompt remedial actions to address the Incident.\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily accepted responsibility for the Incident, thus\nfacilitating the expeditious investigation and resolution of this case\nthrough the Expedited Breach Procedure.\n\n32.\n\nHaving considered all the factors listed above, the Deputy Commissioner\n\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and directs the Organisation to pay a financial\npenalty of S$28,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date of this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgement debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n33.\n\nThe Organisation is also directed to provide written confirmation to the\n\nCommission that it has implemented the remedial measures described at paragraphs\n15(a) to 15(d) above, by 31 March 2024.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $74,000 was imposed on PPLingo for (i) failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control; and (ii) not appointing any individual to ensure its compliance with PDPA.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Education"],"date":"23 May 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_pplingo-pte-ltd-(revised)_241023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Accountability and Protection Obligations by PPLingo","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/05/breach-of-the-accountability-and-protection-obligations-by-pplingo","timestamp":"2024-05-23","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 12\n\nCase No. DP-2205-B9761\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nPPLingo Pte Ltd\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 19\n\n\fPPLingo Pte. Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case No. DP-2205-B9761\n24 October 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 8 May 2022, PPLingo Pte Ltd (the “Organisation”) notified the Personal\n\nData Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a data breach incident involving\nunauthorised access to personal data contained within the Organisation’s online\neducation platform (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s\n\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the\nIncident.\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation requested for this matter to be handled under the Expedited\n\nBreach Decision Procedure, which the Commission acceded to. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to all the facts set out in this\ndecision, and also to contraventions of Sections 11(3) and 24 of the PDPA (as\nexplained below).\n\nPage 2 of 19\n\n\fFacts of the Case\n4\n\nThe Organisation is a company incorporated in Singapore and operates an\n\nonline Chinese and English language learning platform that offers virtual classes to its\nstudents aged 4 to 15 years old globally (“LingoAce”).\n\n5\n\nThe LingoAce platform incorporates an operations support system (“OPS\n\nSystem”) which provides teacher management, student management and class\nscheduling management functions. The personal data of the Organisation’s students,\nparents, teachers and other staff (including teachers and staff formerly employed by\nthe Organisation) (“Users”) was stored in the OPS System.\n\n6\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had in place a written data\n\nprotection policy and had implemented certain security measures for the LingoAce\nplatform, including network access control measures, and firewall protection for the\nOPS System. The Organisation had also organised two rounds of internal security\nawareness training for its IT development team in April 2022, one month before the\nIncident.\n\nThe Incident\n7\n\nThe Organisation engaged a private forensic expert (“PFE”) to ascertain the\n\ncause and extent of the Incident. The PFE’s forensic investigations revealed that\nsometime between 26 April 2022 to 27 April 2022, the threat actor obtained the\npassword of an administrator account of the Organisation’s OPS System\n\nPage 3 of 19\n\n\f(“Compromised Admin Account”) via brute force attacks1. The password of the\nCompromised Admin Account was “lingoace123”.\n\n8\n\nUsing the Compromised Admin Account, the threat actor created several new\n\naccounts with administrator privileges to the OPS System, and used these newly\ncreated accounts to access the personal data of the Users.\n\n9\n\nA total number of 557,144 Users were assessed to be affected by the Incident.\n\nThe breakdown of the volume and type of personal data accessed by the threat actor\nis set out in the table below:\nCategory of\n\nNumber of\n\nIndividuals\n\nIndividuals\n\nStudents\n\n303,238\n\nTypes of Personal Data Affected\n\nName, date of birth, gender, avatar link\n(including photos, where provided), native\nlanguage, learning experience & skills\n\nParents\n\n244,021\n\nName, username, mobile phone number, email\naddress, nationality, country & region, residing\ncountry, avatar link (including photos, where\nprovided), Whatsapp/Wechat ID, account class\ncredit balance, address\n\n1 Brute force attacks also include dictionary attacks.\n\nPage 4 of 19\n\n\fTeachers\n\n9,395\n\nName, username, mobile phone number, email\n\n(including ex-\n\naddress, nationality, gender, photo (where\n\nteachers)\n\nprovided), country of residence, date of birth,\nteacher ID, salary, bank name and account\nnumber, signature, Chinese resident identity\ncard number, labour agreement or independent\ncontractor agreement, Whatsapp/Wechat ID,\neducational background\n\nOther Staff\n\n490\n\n(including ex-\n\nName, username, mobile phone number, email\naddress, Wechat ID\n\nstaff)\nTotal\n\n10\n\n557,144\n\nAlthough the threat actor had accessed the personal data of the Users, there\n\nwas no evidence of any data modification or exfiltration.\n\n11\n\nOn 5 May 2022, the threat actor gained unauthorised access to email accounts\n\nof the Organisation’s employees through unidentified means. The threat actor\naccessed an email account belonging to one of the Organisation’s employees and\nsent an email to the Organisation (“Email”). In the Email, the threat actor informed that\nhe had accessed LingoAce platform’s systems and set out the personal data of a few\n\nPage 5 of 19\n\n\fUsers in the text to prove this. Nonetheless, the threat actor did not follow up with any\nfurther communication or make any subsequent demands to the Organisation.\n\nRemedial actions\n12\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\nActions to mitigate and contain the Incident\n(a)\n\nEngaged a third party PFE to assist in investigations and remedial\nmeasures;\n\n(b)\n\nInspected the servers related to the OPS System to detect any further\nintrusion;\n\n(c)\n\nReset\n\npasswords of\n\nall\n\nadministrator accounts\n\nand\n\nremoved\n\nunnecessary administrator accounts;\n(d)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication for all accounts accessing the\nOPS System;\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented enhanced password strength/complexity requirements for\naccounts accessing the OPS System;\n\n(f)\n\nAppointed a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”); and\n\n(g)\n\nNotified all the affected Users.\n\nPage 6 of 19\n\n\fActions to prevent recurrence or similar incidents\n(a)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication for all email accounts of the\nOrganisation;\n\n(b)\n\nSigned up for services of a third-party platform to test for bugs of the\nOPS System and improve bug discovery capabilities;\n\n(c)\n\nAdopted Data Full Life Cycle Security Specifications relating to the\ncollection, transmission, storage, usage and destruction of data;\n\n(d)\n\nCarried out audits and monitoring of the OPS System and enhanced the\nprotection of the application firewall;\n\n(e)\n\nReset passwords to strengthen the passwords or implementing twofactor authentication for other related systems connected to the\nLingoAce platform; and\n\n(f)\n\nEnhanced the Organisation’s internal security and data protection\ntraining programme, and increased the frequency of security and data\nprotection training for the Organisation’s staff.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n13\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incident, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether the Organisation had breached its obligations under Section 24 of\nthe PDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\n\nPage 7 of 19\n\n\fdisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”).\n\n14\n\nAs the Organisation indicated that it had not appointed a DPO when notifying\n\nthe Commission of the Incident, the Organisation’s compliance with Section 11(3) of\nthe PDPA (the “Accountability Obligation”) was also investigated.\n\nBreach of the Protection Obligation by the Organisation\n\n15\n\nTo comply with the Protection Obligation, an organisation must implement\n\nsecurity arrangements that are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. This\nincludes the nature of the personal data in the Organisation’s possession and control,\nas well as the potential impact that unauthorised disclosure of the personal data might\nhave on the affected persons2.\n\n16\n\nGiven the high volume and sensitivity of the personal data contained in the OPS\n\nSystem (including financial information such as bank name and account number and\nstudents/minors), the onus was on the Organisation to implement an appropriately\nrobust level of security arrangements to discharge its obligation under the Protection\nObligation.\n\n2 See the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Revised 16 May 2022),\n\nat [17.2].\n\nPage 8 of 19\n\n\fInadequate password policy\n\n17\n\nAs a necessary measure of data protection, organisations must adopt,\n\nimplement, and enforce a strong password policy3. A password policy that mandates\na minimum level of password complexity, and a fixed period of password validity or\nregular change of passwords, amongst others, are basic practices of proper\nauthentication and authorisation processes4. This can include implementing password\ncontrols such as (i) requiring a change of password upon first logon, (ii) minimum\npassword length, (iii) restricting reuse of previous passwords, and (iv) mandating a\nminimum level of password complexity. A robust password policy is a key security\nmeasure that an organisation must have in place to ensure that its IT systems are not\nvulnerable to common hacking attempts such as brute force attacks5.\n\n18\n\nInvestigations disclosed that the Organisation did not have any password policy\n\nfor the Compromised Admin Account, other than requiring a minimum length of 8\ncharacters for passwords. Given the Compromised Admin Account granted privileged\naccess to the Organisation’s OPS System, this was an inadequate security\narrangement to safeguard the personal data contained in the OPS System.\n\ni. No expiry / requirement to change passwords\n19\n\nThe use of the OPS system commenced in March 2020. The password\n\n3 See Congita Asia Holdings Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPCS 14.\n4 See the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems.\n5 See LoveBonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3, at [18].\n\nPage 9 of 19\n\n\f“lingoace123” was in use since then and remained unchanged for more than 2 years\nprior to the Incident.\n\n20\n\nThis was a serious lapse in the Organisation’s password management\n\npractices, which failed to provide for a fixed period of password validity or require\nregular change of passwords to mitigate risks of unauthorised access. The absence\nof such security arrangements meant that the OPS System was vulnerable to brute\nforce attacks.\n\nii. No requirements on password complexity\n21\n\nFurther, the Organisation failed to implement requirements to provide for an\n\nadequate level of password complexity. This would have contributed to the ease of\nbrute force attempts by the threat actor to gain access to the Compromised Admin\nAccount.\n\n22\n\nThe PFE’s forensic investigations support the Commission’s findings, as it\n\nidentified that the password for the Compromised Admin Account did not meet typical\nindustry best practices for password strength, in terms of appropriate length, and\ncombination of numbers, symbols, and/or uppercase and lowercase characters.\n\nPage 10 of 19\n\n\fGuessable phrases / components in the password\n23\n\nThe password “lingoace123” was also a weak password due to its incorporation\n\nof both the Organisation’s name and a common sequence of numbers (i.e. “123”).\nSuch a password would be vulnerable to brute force attacks by threat actors.\n\n24\n\nIn Re Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPCR 1, the password “Chi!zzle@2018”\n\nwhich complied with the organisation’s password complexity rules was nevertheless\nheld to be a weak password as it incorporated the organisation’s name as well as the\nyear “2018”. The same concern has been repeated in the Commission’s Guide to Data\nProtection Practices for ICT systems (“Guide”), stating that the use of an\norganisation’s name as a component of the password is not recommended because it\nis not difficult to guess and be cracked by hackers.\n\n25\n\nThe Organisation accepted that the password was a weak one, which left the\n\nOPS system vulnerable to brute force attacks.\n\n26\n\nAs a result of the above weaknesses, the threat actor successfully obtained the\n\npassword of the Compromised Admin Account of the OPS System, via brute force\nattacks.\n\n27\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation is found to have negligently breached\n\nthe Protection Obligation by failing to implement adequate security arrangements in\nrespect of the Compromised Admin Account.\n\nPage 11 of 19\n\n\fTwo-factor / multi-factor authentication (\"2FA / MFA”)\n28\n\nAt the time of the Incident, the Organisation had not implemented a password\n\npolicy requiring two-factor (“2FA”) or multi-factor authentication (“MFA\") in respect of\nthe Compromised Admin Account. As the Incident happened shortly before the\nCommission’s decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 3\n(“Lovebonito”) was published, this will not be taken into account as a basis for breach\nof the Protection Obligation in this case. However, the baseline standard described by\nthe Commission at [51] of Lovebonito bears repeating:\n“(a)\n\nFirst, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\n\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data: see\n[46]-[47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach, unless the\norganisation can show that its omission is reasonable or implementation of 2FA\nis disproportionate.\n(b)\n\nSecond, remote access by privileged accounts to information\n\nsystems that host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large\nvolumes of personal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA / MFA. The\nrisks concerning remote access are higher, thus the expectation to implement\n2FA / MFA will correspondingly increase.\n(c)\n\nThird, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or sensitive\n\npersonal data, or large volumes of personal data, are expected to enable and\n\nPage 12 of 19\n\n\fconfigure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that is available out-of-the-box.\nOmission to do so may be considered an aggravating factor.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n29\n\nAs 2FA / MFA becomes more readily available at lower cost, organisations\n\nshould expect the baseline standard described in Lovebonito to rise. An organisation\nchoosing not to implement 2FA / MFA will have to explain why this is reasonable,\nconsidering for example, costs, the organisation’s circumstances, and the level of data\nprotection risks.\n\nOther enhanced data protection practices\n30\n\nThe Commission’s Guide recommends two tiers of (i) basic and (ii) enhanced\n\ndata protection practices for organisations to adopt in different circumstances.\n\n31\n\nWhile the Organisation is not faulted for not implementing enhanced data\n\nprotection practices (and this has not been taken into account in determining the\nenforcement action in this case), it is observed that implementing the other enhanced\ndata protection practices in the Commission’s handbook on How to Guard against\nCommon Types of Data Breaches6 could have prevented or slowed down brute force\nattacks. For example, the Compromised Admin Account could have been locked after\n\n6 See the Commission’s recent release of the handbook on common causes of data breaches in How\n\nto Guard against Common Types of Data Breaches published on 24 May 2021 (at page 13).\n\nPage 13 of 19\n\n\fa pre-defined number of failed login attempts, or CAPTCHAs could have been\nimplemented to deter automated login attempts.\n32\n\nIn any event, organisations must assess whether enhanced data protection\n\npractices should be implemented7 in respect of their security arrangements to protect\nthe personal data (having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such personal data\nand the possible impact of a data breach) in their possession or control.\n\nBreach of the Accountability Obligation by the Organisation\n33\n\nInvestigations revealed that the Organisation did not appoint a DPO since its\n\nincorporation in 2016.\n\n34\n\nUnder Section 11(3) of the PDPA, all organisations are required to designate\n\nan individual to be responsible for compliance with the PDPA. Appointing a DPO is a\nbasic requirement of the PDPA.\n\n35\n\nAs emphasised in previous decisions of the Commission8, a DPO plays a vital\n\nrole in ensuring an organisation’s compliance with the PDPA, and the proper\nimplementation of an organisation’s data protection policies and practices. The\nresponsibilities of a DPO include, but are not limited to:\n(a)\n\nEnsuring compliance with the PDPA when developing and implementing\n\npolicies and processes for handling personal data;\n\n7\n\nSee the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT systems (at page 8).\n\n8 Re AgcDesign Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC at [5] & Re M Stars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd\n\n[2017] SGPDPC 15 at [31] to [37].\n\nPage 14 of 19\n\n\f(b)\n\nFostering a data protection culture and accountability among employees\n\nand communicating personal data protection policies to stakeholders;\n(c)\n\nHandling and managing personal data protection related queries and\n\ncomplaints from the public;\n(d)\n\nAlerting management to any risks that might arise with regard to\n\npersonal data; and\n(e)\n\n36\n\nLiaising with the Commission on data protection matters, if necessary.\n\nA DPO was appointed after the Incident on 18 May 2022, more than 5 years\n\nafter the Organisation’s incorporation.\n\n37\n\nIn the circumstances, it is determined that the Organisation had negligently\n\nbreached the Accountability Obligation for failing to designate a DPO to be responsible\nfor ensuring that the Organisation complies with the PDPA.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n38\n\nIn determining whether to give directions (if any) to the Organisation pursuant\n\nto Section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether to impose a financial penalty pursuant to\nSection 48J of the PDPA, the Commission took into account the relevant facts and\ncircumstances of the case and the factors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 15 of 19\n\n\f39\n\nThe Commission noted that the Organisation had been negligent in not\n\ncomplying with its obligations under the PDPA, namely the Protection Obligation and\nthe Accountability Obligation.\n\n40\n\nThe Commission also noted that the Incident involved a high volume of\n\npersonal data, which affected 557,144 individuals. The type of datasets affected were\nof a higher sensitivity, including personal data of a financial nature and approximately\n303,238 minors.\n\n41\n\nThe Commission nonetheless recognised the following mitigating factors:\n(a)\n\nThere was no evidence of any exfiltration or misuse of the personal data\nof the Users;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions in response to the\nIncident, including notifying the affected Users;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted that it had breached the\nAccountability Obligation and the Protection Obligation; and\n\n(d)\n\n42\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during investigations.\n\nThe Organisation’s early admission of liability for its breaches of the\n\nAccountability Obligation and Protection Obligation was considered a significant\nmitigating factor. An organisation that voluntarily accepts responsibility for its noncompliance with the PDPA is an organisation that demonstrates its commitment to its\n\nPage 16 of 19\n\n\fobligations under the PDPA and shows that it can be responsible for the personal data\nin its possession or under its control9.\n\n43\n\nHaving considered the above factors and circumstances, the Commissioner\n\npreliminarily determined that a financial penalty of $74,000 would be imposed in\nrespect of the Organisation’s negligent contraventions of the Accountability Obligation\nand Protection Obligation. On 27 July 2023, the Organisation was notified of the\nCommissioner’s preliminary decision, including the full findings set out above, and\ngiven 14 days to make written representations.\n\nRepresentations by the Organisation\n44\n\nWhile the Organisation did not challenge the findings and bases of both\n\ncontraventions, the Organisation made representations seeking that a financial\npenalty of not more than $35,000 be imposed, for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation had spent significant capital on its remedial actions\n\nand wanted to implement further improvements of IT systems and processes.\nAny reduction of the financial penalty could be used to fund these further\nimprovements;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation, in full compliance with its obligations globally, had\n\nmade voluntary notifications regarding the Incident to other data protection\nauthorities in over 40 other affected locations. These other data protection\nauthorities may also impose financial penalties on the Organisation. To avoid\n\n9 See Section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\nPage 17 of 19\n\n\f“double counting”, the Commission should only consider the Singapore-based\nindividuals when assessing the total number of affected individuals rather than\nthe global figures;\n(c)\n\nLower financial penalties had been imposed in previous enforcement\n\ndecisions10 involving similarly high volumes of personal data.\n\n45\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Organisation’s representations were not\n\naccepted for the reasons outlined below:\n(a)\n\nUnder Section 11(2) of the PDPA, the Organisation is responsible for all\n\npersonal data in its possession or under its control. This is not limited to the\npersonal data of affected individuals / data subjects located within Singapore;\n(b)\n\nThe Commission’s enforcement jurisdiction is not fettered by potential\n\nenforcement proceedings abroad by other data protection authorities. In any\nevent, the Organisation has not shown how or any evidence that there would\nbe any “double counting”; In any event, as a matter of principle, claiming that\nthe amount that goes towards payment of a financial penalty could be spent on\nfurther improvements is not a relevant factor;\n(c)\n\nEvery case is decided on its specific facts and circumstances. In this\n\ncase, the Organisation had committed two contraventions of the PDPA, and a\nlarge volume of minors’ personal data was affected which distinguished it from\nthe cases cited.\n\n10 GeniusU [2022] SGPDPC 1, Eatigo International Pte Ltd [2022] SGPDPC 9, and Redmart Limited\n\n[2022] SGPDPC 8.\n\nPage 18 of 19\n\n\f46\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires the Organisation to pay a financial penalty of $74,000\nwithin 30 days from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing\nwhich interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts\nshall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until\nthe financial penalty is paid in full.\n\n47\n\nNo further directions are necessary on account of the remedial measures\n\nalready taken by the Organisation.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 19 of 19\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $4,000 was imposed on Payroll2U for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect its client’s employees' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Employment","Ransomware"],"date":"22 Apr 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_payroll2u-pte-ltd_070324.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Payroll2U","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/04/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-payroll2u","timestamp":"2024-04-22","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2024] SGPDPCS 2\n\nCase No. DP-2303-C0848\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nPayroll2U Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n1.\n\nPayroll2U Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a payroll service provider that offers\n\npayroll outsourcing services and online payroll Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions.\n\n2.\n\nOn 27 March 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by the Organisation that the personal data of its client’s\nemployees had been posted on a ransomware leak site. The leak arose from a\nransomware attack on the servers of the Organisation around 29 December 2022 (the\n“Incident”).\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 January 2023, the Organisation received extortion emails from a threat\n\nactor identified as a LockBit affiliate. The Organisation immediately conducted an\n\n\finternal investigation and engaged an external forensics investigator to investigate the\nIncident and undertake remedial actions. Upon further investigations, it was\ndetermined that a total of 81.95 GB of data had been exfiltrated in the Incident and\nposted on the dark web. The personal data of 5,640 employees from the\nOrganisation’s client was affected, including their full name, bank account number,\nsalary information, NRIC number, address, date of birth and email address.\n\n4.\n\nInvestigations revealed that unauthorised activity had occurred from 29\n\nDecember 2022 to 16 January 2023, with a single compromised account used for\nRemote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to five servers on the Organisation’s AWS\nenvironment. Once connected to the working network, the threat actor gained\nunauthorised access to the developer’s drive and the company’s shared drive that\nwere both mapped to the compromised account. These drives gave access to the\naffected personal data.\n\n5.\n\nWhile the investigations were unable to conclusively determine how the threat\n\nactor obtained the credentials to the compromised user account, the investigation\nrevealed the following lapses that could have contributed to the Incident:\n\na.\n\nEmployees were given local administrator rights on their laptops, thus\nenabling a user to install/uninstall applications without restriction. The\nOrganisation confirmed that the compromised user had reformatted his\nlaptop and installed an unlicensed Windows Operating System that\nmight have downloaded ransomware and removed the Symantec\nPage 2 of 7\n\n\fEndpoint Protection. In addition, the compromised user also left the\ncomputer powered and web connected, allowing the threat actor to use\nthe account to login to the Remote Desktop Servers.\n\nb.\n\nMulti-Factor\n\nAuthentication\n\n(“MFA”)\n\nwas\n\nnot\n\nimplemented\n\nfor\n\nadministrator accounts and non-administrative accounts with access to\npersonal data.\n\nc.\n\nThere was an absence of tools to detect and remove the download of\nunauthorised software on company-issued laptops.\n\nd.\n\nThere was an absence of effective incident response and management\ncontrol, enabling the threat actor’s presence and activity within the\nOrganisation’s network to remain undetected between 29 December\n2022 to 16 January 2023.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n\na.\n\nDeactivated the compromised user account and forced change\npassword for all users accessing the network.\n\nb.\n\nImplemented MFA for users accessing internal and remotely accessible\nresources and environments.\n\nPage 3 of 7\n\n\fc.\n\nImplemented documentation and quarterly review of Windows network\ndrives and folder access. Collected log details and log reviews on a\nmonthly basis.\n\nd.\n\nConducted checks on all workstations to ensure they are equipped with\nSentinelOne and Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP).\n\ne.\n\nImplemented host-checking for SSL VPN users vis FortiClient to verify\nthat the SentinelOne and SEP processes are running before granting the\ndevice access.\n\nf.\n\nReviewed firewall configurations and rules. Fine-tuned web-filtering\nusing Fortinet UTM. Implemented secured file transfer for inbound and\noutbound traffic. Block sharing over cloud storage and whitelisted URLs\nbased on need to use basis.\n\ng.\n\nPerformed regular service account reviews to validate that all active\naccounts are authorised.\n\n7.\n\nThe Organisation requested for the matter to be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that the\nOrganisation voluntarily provided and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out\nbelow; and admitted that it was in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data Protection\nAct 2012 (the “PDPA”).\n\nPage 4 of 7\n\n\f8.\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to implement reasonable access\n\ncontrol. While the investigation noted and acknowledged the existence of proactive\ncybersecurity controls, the Organisation also admitted to storing the affected personal\ndata sets that included the bank account numbers and salary information on\nunsecured internal shared drives. Given both the volume and types of personal data\nhandled, the Organisation ought to have adopted additional access control beyond the\nbaseline of password protection.\n\n9.\n\nThe Organisation had the option of either frontend access control or other\n\noptions that focused on the backend. Frontend access control included MFA, at least\nfor users with remote access to the more sensitive data mentioned. Backend access\ncontrol included, for example, restrictive allocation according to the user’s need for\nadministrator-level rights that would impact personal data security as well as network\nsegmentation. Sensitive personal data could have been stored in segments of the\nnetwork that allowed access only on the basis of need.\n\n10.\n\nAs stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\n\nSystems (the “Guide”)1, access control privileges should be restricted and defined\nbased on the user roles/rights to data. Users should not be able to see information\nthat they do not need to know, and this should be reflected in an organisation’s access\ncontrol policy. In the present case, the Organisation should have assessed whether\n\n1\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fthe developer in question needed account access rights to personal data of the type\naffected in the Incident.\n\n11.\n\nAnother backend access control option recommended in our Guide was\n\ndisallowing non-administrator employees from installing software and/or changing\nsecurity settings and restricting the right to do so to specific administrator accounts.\nThe Organisation failed to do so and non-administrative accounts were able to\ndownload unauthorised software on issued devices without being detected.\n\n12.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n13.\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, the Commission\nconsidered that a financial penalty was appropriate given the role of the Organisation\nas a payroll service provider and the types of personal data handled. In deciding the\nappropriate financial penalty amount, the Commission first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n14.\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, the\n\nCommission also considered the Organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\fwould be a proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter noncompliance with the PDPA. The Commission also considered the following mitigating\nfactors, which led to a further reduction in the financial penalty:\n\na.\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\ninvestigations;\n\nb.\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to a breach of the Protection\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n\nc.\n\nThis is the Organisation’s first instance of non-compliance with the\nPDPA.\n\n15.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Commission hereby requires the Organisation to\n\npay a financial penalty of $4,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notice\naccompanying this decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of\nCourt in respect of judgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding\namount of such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $9,000 was imposed on Whiz Communications for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect customers' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Information and Communications"],"date":"21 Mar 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_whiz-communications-pte-ltd_20122023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Whiz Communications","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/03/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-whiz-communications","timestamp":"2024-03-21","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 7\n\nCase No. DP-2304-C0935\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nWhiz Communications Pte. Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nWhiz Communications Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”) is a Singapore\n\ntelecommunications service provider offering broadband internet access, local and\nlong-distance digital IP telephony, prepaid and postpaid calling plans.\n\n2\n\nOn 22 April 2023, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was alerted by the Singapore Police Force of a personal data breach\nincident involving the Organisation (the “Incident”), which the Organisation confirmed\non 24 April 2023.\n\n\f3\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision\nand to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA. Section\n24 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) requires an organisation to\nprotect personal data in its possession or control by making reasonable security\narrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,\nmodification or disposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\nFacts of the Incident\n4\n\nThe Organisation’s customer management system (“CMS”) was designed and\n\ndeveloped in 2016 by an external vendor. This external vendor did not process\npersonal data on behalf of the Organisation and was not the Organisation’s data\nintermediary. The Protection Obligation in respect of customer personal data\nprocessed by the CMS therefore fell solely on the Organisation.\n\n5\n\nThe CMS from its initial design accepted any Python script requests that could\n\nbe exploited for unauthorised exfiltration of customer personal data. This failure to\nblock or manage scripts posed a data security risk and was a design flaw.\n\n6\n\nPost-Incident, the Organisation established through tracing web services and\n\ndatabased logs that Python scripts had indeed been used by the threat actor (“TA”) to\nextract .jpg files from the CMS. 29,903 attempts from 8 overseas IP addresses were\nmade over 5 days in March and April 2023, with 24,323 successful extractions of the\npersonal data of 24,323 individuals.\n\n\f7\n\nThe types of personal data exfiltrated were the front and back images of\n\nidentification documents (i.e., NRIC, passport, student pass and dependent pass) and\nother supporting documents such as tenancy agreements and letters of approval for\nwork permits issued by the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore.\n\n8\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n(a)\n\nRejected and denied all Python requests to the CMS;\n\n(b)\n\nRestricted overseas IP addresses from connecting to the Organisation’s\n\nnetwork;\n(c)\n\nImplemented two-factor authentication and enhanced the password\n\ncomplexity requirement for the CMS’ admin users via web access; and\n(d)\n\nConducted a penetration test on the CMS.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n9\n\nAs a Singapore telecommunications service provider, the Organisation had\n\nhigher-level security needs. This extended to the Organisation’s CMS that contained\nthe personal data of individuals who subscribed to the telecommunications services\nprovided by the Organisation.\n\n10\n\nFirst, the Organisation admitted it has breached the Protection Obligation under\n\nthe PDPA as it failed to provide any security requirements to the CMS IT vendor, in\nparticular, requirements that would have adequately addressed the data security risks\nposed by Python scripts.\n\n\f11\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it failed to stipulate clear job specifications and\n\nsecurity requirements to the IT vendor who developed the CMS. There was also no\ncontractual obligation on the IT vendor to ensure that personal data would be\nprotected. In SAP Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 6, the Commission had reiterated the\nneed for organisations to provide clear job specifications and include data protection\nrequirements when engaging IT vendors. Thereafter, organisations are also expected\nto ensure that the IT vendor has satisfied the job specifications and data protection\nrequirements stipulated.\n\n12\n\nSecondly, the Organisation admitted that it was in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the PDPA as it neither had a sufficiently complex password policy\nnor enforced one. In the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT\nSystems1, the Commission recommended a minimum of 12 alphanumeric characters\nwith a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. We also\nrecommended using phrases or paraphrase, combined with numbers and uppercase,\nlowercase and special characters, as these characteristics will make a password\nstronger and harder to decode.\n\n13\n\nPrior to the Incident, the Organisation’s CMS admin user password complexity\n\nrequired only 9 alphanumeric characters with at least one uppercase, which clearly fell\nshort of PDPC’s recommended password complexity. We urge organisations to meet\nPDPC’s recommended best practices relating to passwords, especially for privileged\naccess accounts such as admin accounts.\n\n1 PDPC’s Guide to Data Protection Practices for ICT Systems, page 15. Accessible at\n\nhttps://www.pdpc.gov.sg/help-and-resources/2021/08/data-protection-practices-for-ict-systems.\n\n\f14\n\nThird, the Organisation also admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation\n\nof the PDPA as it failed to ensure reasonable access control to its CMS. Given the\nnature of personal data the Organisation was in possession and control of, the\nOrganisation should have enhanced the access control to its CMS beyond the\nbaseline of password protection. This could have taken the form of implementing multifactor authentication for its CMS admin accounts, restricting access from overseas IP\naddresses to its CMS, and, last but not least, having an up-to-date web application\nfirewall to defend against typical web application attacks.\n\n15\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n16\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate given the Organisation involved and the nature of\nthe personal data affected in the Incident.\n\n17\n\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the\n\nrelevant factors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the\npersonal data breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n\f18\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the Organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and to deter noncompliance with the PDPA.\n\n19\n\nFinally, I considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\n\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n20\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $9,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n\fThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24.

The Commission subsequently commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the circumstances disclosed any breaches by the Respondent of the Personal\nData Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\n2\n\nBased on the Commission’s investigations, the facts disclose a straightforward\n\nbreach of the PDPA. In particular, the Respondent admits to committing the infringing\nacts. The Commission has accordingly found the Respondent in breach of sections 13\nand 20 of the PDPA.\n\nFacts of the Case\n\n3\n\nThe Respondent is a registered salesperson under the Estate Agents Act 2010.\n\nHe is appointed by ERA Realty Network Pte Ltd (“ERA”) to engage in estate agency\nwork and to otherwise promote the business of servicing the public in real estate\ntransactions.\n\n2\n\n\f4\n\nAt all material times, the Respondent is and was an independent agent of ERA\n\nwho receives commissions in respect of real estate services or transactions entered\ninto between customers and ERA.\n\n5\n\nThe Respondent was upfront in admitting that he has been purchasing personal\n\ndata from unknown third parties for telemarketing purposes for approximately 10 years\nfrom 2013.\n\n6\n\nIn the course of 2021, the Respondent purchased 5 sets of personal data\n\namounting to about 420,000 records (the “Purchased Data”) from an individual with\na foreign phone number known to the Respondent only as “Ali” (the “Seller”). The\nRespondent came to know of the Seller through social media and would communicate\nwith the Seller over Whatsapp, following which the Seller would e-mail the Purchased\nData to the Respondent in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. The Respondent\npaid the Seller a total of about S$1,200 for the Purchased Data.\n\n7\n\nThe Purchased Data comprised the following:\n\nNumber of affected individuals\nTypes of personal data\n\n8\n\n~420,000\n• Name\n• E-mail address\n• Contact number\n• Address (either residential or office,\nbut not both)\n• Partial credit card number, i.e., the\nlast 4 digits (for some entries)\n\nAfter receiving each set of Purchased Data, the Respondent would sort through\n\nit for names, e-mail addresses, contact numbers, and residential addresses, and use\n\n3\n\n\fthis personal data to send targeted marketing e-mails and SMSes to the individuals\nconcerned. For example, if the Respondent saw that an individual was living in a\ncertain area of Singapore, he would send an e-mail or SMS to that individual informing\nhim or her of the property transaction prices in that area. The Respondent did not send\nmarketing communications to all the affected individuals as he estimated that about\n75% of the Purchased Data contained business-related information and not residential\ninformation.\n\n9\n\nThe Respondent stated that he did not use the Purchased Data for any other\n\npurpose, and that he included an unsubscribe function in his marketing emails. The\nlatter enabled him to delete the personal data of any individuals who used this\nunsubscribe function. He also stated that he would first check the contact numbers\nagainst the Do Not Call (“DNC”) Registry and would not send marketing SMSes to any\nDNC-registered contact numbers.\n\n10\n\nThe Commission found no evidence to contradict these statements. In\n\nparticular, the Commission has not received any DNC-related complaints involving the\nRespondent. There was also no evidence that the Respondent ever re-sold the\nPurchased Data, or that he was involved in the Seller’s business in any capacity other\nthan as a buyer (e.g., as an accomplice).\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\nPreliminary Issues\n\n4\n\n\f11\n\nAt the outset, the Respondent was bound by the data protection obligations in\n\nParts 3 to 6A of the PDPA as he had operated as an “organisation” in respect of his\ncollection and use of the Purchased Data1:\n(a)\n\nThe definition of “organisation” in section 2(1) of the PDPA includes\nindividuals.\n\n(b)\n\nSection 4(1)(a) of the PDPA provides that Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA do\nnot impose any obligation on any individual acting in a personal or\ndomestic capacity. However, the Respondent was not acting in a\npersonal or domestic capacity in respect of his purchase of the\nPurchased Data from the Seller and subsequent use for telemarketing\npurposes. These actions were done for profit, in furtherance of the\nRespondent’s business as a real estate salesperson.\n\n(c)\n\nSection 4(1)(b) of the PDPA provides that Parts 3 to 6A of the PDPA do\nnot impose any obligation on any employee acting in the course of his or\nher employment with an organization. However, as mentioned at [4]\nabove, the Respondent was not in an employee-employer relationship\nwith ERA. He acted at all material times as an independent agent.\n\nThe Consent and Notification Obligations under the PDPA\n\n12\n\nThe relevant data protection obligations applicable to the Respondent’s\n\ncollection and use of personal data are:\n\n1 The Commission has in earlier cases also determined that individuals fall within the definition of\n\n“organisation” under the PDPA, and that individuals are subject to the obligations in Parts 3 to 6A of the\nPDPA insofar as they are not acting in a personal or domestic capacity (see for example Re Sharon\nAssya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at [9] to [12]) and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi\nMobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12 (at [8])).\n\n5\n\n\f(a)\n\nthe obligation, before collecting, using or disclosing the personal data, to\ninform the individual(s) in question of the purposes for which such\npersonal data is being collected, used or disclosed (the “Notification\nObligation”)2; and\n\n(b)\n\nthe obligation to first obtain the consent of the individual(s) in question to\nthe collection, use or disclosure of the personal data for such purposes3\n(an individual cannot be said to have given consent unless he or she has\nbeen provided with the information required under the Notification\nObligation, and has provided consent for the stated purposes4) (the\n“Consent Obligation”).\n\n13\n\nThe central issue in this case is whether the Respondent breached the Consent\n\nObligation and/or the Notification Obligation under the PDPA.\n\nWhether the Respondent breached the Consent Obligation\n\n14\n\nOn the facts of this case, the Respondent breached the Consent Obligation by\n\nfailing to ascertain that the consent of the individuals concerned had been obtained\nbefore purchasing their personal data from the Seller and subsequently sending\nunsolicited telemarketing communications to them.\n\n15\n\nThe fact that the Respondent purchased the Purchased Data from a third party\n\n(i.e. the Seller) does not derogate from the Commission’s breach finding. The\nCommission has in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 (at [13]) and\n\n2 Section 20 of the PDPA.\n3 Section 13 of the PDPA.\n4 Section 14 of the PDPA.\n\n6\n\n\fRe Amicus Solutions Pte. Ltd. & Anor. [2019] SGPDPC 33 (at [26] and [47]) observed\nthat purchasing personal data from a third-party seller constitutes the collection of\npersonal data under the PDPA, notwithstanding that such personal data was not\ncollected directly from the individuals concerned themselves.\n\n16\n\nThe fact of this “indirect” collection does not exempt data buyers from their data\n\nprotection obligations in relation to the collection or subsequent use or disclosure of\nthe collected personal data. The required standard was articulated in Re Amicus\nSolutions (at [48] and [49]), quoting in turn the UK Information Commissioner’s Office\n(“ICO”)’s decision in The Data Supply Company:\n\n“48 … The ICO issued a monetary penalty of £20,000 and gave the following\nguidance in the Monetary Penalty Notice (at [22] to [25]):\n\nData controllers buying marketing lists from third parties must\nmake rigorous checks to satisfy themselves that the third party\nobtained the personal data fairly and lawfully, that the individuals\nunderstood their details would be passed on for marketing\npurposes, and that they have the necessary consent.\n\nData controllers must take extra care if buying or selling a list that is to\nbe used to send marketing texts, emails or automated calls. The Privacy\nand Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 specifically require\nthat the recipient of such communications has notified the sender that\nthey consent to receive direct marketing messages from them. Indirect\nconsent (ie consent originally given to another organisation) may be valid\nif that organisation sending the marketing message was specifically\n7\n\n\fnamed. But more generic consent (eg marketing ‘from selected third\nparties’) will not demonstrate valid consent to marketing calls, texts or\nemails.\n\nData controllers buying in lists must check how and when consent\nwas obtained, by whom, and what the customer was told. It is not\nacceptable to rely on assurances of indirect consent without\nundertaking proper due diligence. Such due diligence might, for\nexample, include checking the following:\n•\n\nHow and when was consent obtained?\n\n•\n\nWho obtained it and in what context?\n\n•\n\nWhat method was used – eg was it opt-in or opt-out?\n\n•\n\nWas the information provided clear and intelligible? How was it\nprovided – eg behind a link, in a footnote, in a pop-up box, in a clear\nstatement next to the opt-in box?\n\n•\n\nDid it specifically mention texts, emails or automated calls?\n\n•\n\nDid it list organisations by name, by description, or was the consent\nfor disclosure to any third party?\n\n•\n\nIs the seller a member of a professional body or accredited in some\nway?\n\n…\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n8\n\n\f49 While there is no uniform industry standard in relation to how a buyer should\nverify whether the seller has obtained the consent of the individuals, the\npositions articulated by the ICO must be right. A reasonable person would likely\nundertake proper due diligence, such as seeking written confirmation that the\npersonal data sold was actually obtained via legal sources or means, or inquire\nfurther as to whether the individuals had provided their consent and were\nnotified of the disclosure, and if so, obtain a sample of such consent and\nnotification.”\n\n17\n\nThe Respondent has fallen short of the standard set out in Re Amicus Solutions\n\nPte. Ltd. by failing to perform the required due diligence to ensure that the individuals’\nconsent had been obtained for the sale of the Purchased Data by the Seller to the\nRespondent, or for the Respondent’s subsequent use for the purposes of\ntelemarketing. During the Commission’s investigations, the Respondent admitted that\nhe did not know whether the Seller had obtained the consent of the individuals in\nrelation to the sale of the Purchased Data, and that he did not perform any additional\nverification checks or question the Seller as to how he had obtained the Purchased\nData. There is no evidence that the Respondent contacted the individuals directly to\nobtain their consent. The Respondent also stated that he was not aware of whether\nthe Purchased Data originated from any data breaches5.\n\n18\n\nThe Respondent was negligent in purchasing and using the Purchased Data\n\nfrom an unknown online seller without performing any due diligence in relation to the\nprovenance of the Purchased Data or whether the individuals concerned had been\n\n5 Based on the Commission’s investigations, the Purchased Data may have originated from the data\n\nbreach incident involving RedMart Limited (see Re RedMart Limited [2022] SGPDPC 8).\n\n9\n\n\fnotified of or given their consent for its collection and use. He therefore did not take\nsufficient steps to discharge the requirements under the Consent Obligation. As stated\nat [9] and [10] above, the Commission accepts that the Respondent had provided an\nopt-out option in his telemarketing e-mails, took pains to ensure compliance with the\nDNC provisions under the PDPA, and had breached the PDPA out of ignorance\ntowards his data protection obligations. Nevertheless, ignorance is not a legitimate\nexcuse for breaching the Consent Obligation. Accordingly, the Respondent was found\nto have negligently breached the Consent Obligation in relation to both his collection\nand use of the Purchased Data.\n\nWhether the Respondent breached the Notification Obligation\n\n19\n\nThe Commission applied the same standards set out at [18] above to its\n\nassessment of whether the Respondent breached the Notification Obligation. In this\nregard, the Respondent also did not perform the required due diligence to ensure that\nthe individuals had been informed of the purposes for which their personal data was\nsubsequently collected, used and/or disclosed by the Respondent and the Seller, and\nthere is likewise no evidence that the Respondent contacted the individuals directly to\ninform them of this. The Respondent has accordingly also negligently breached the\nNotification Obligation in relation to both his collection and use of the Purchased Data.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n\n20\n\nIn determining whether any directions should be imposed on the Respondent\n\nunder section 48I of the PDPA, and/or whether the Respondent should be required to\npay a financial penalty under section 48J of the PDPA, the factors listed at section\n48J(6) of the PDPA were considered, including the following mitigating factors:\n10\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent was highly cooperative during the Commission’s\ninvestigations. In particular, the Respondent candidly admitted to the\ninfringing acts at first instance and co-operated fully with the investigation\nprocess.\n\n(b)\n\n21\n\nThe Respondent is a first-time offender.\n\nThe Commission considers that there are compelling policy reasons in favour\n\nof taking a strong stance against the unauthorised buying of personal data. Some of\nthese policy reasons have been enumerated in Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang (at\n[30]), in the context of the unauthorised sale of personal data:\n\n“The Commissioner likewise takes a serious view of such breaches under the\nPDPA. There are strong policy reasons for taking a hard stance against the\nunauthorised sale of personal data. Amongst these policy reasons are the need\nto protect the interests of the individual and safeguard against any harm to the\nindividual, such as identity theft or nuisance calls. Additionally, there is a need\nto prevent abuse by organisations in profiting from the sale of the individual’s\npersonal data at the individual’s expense. It is indeed such cases of potential\nmisuse or abuse by organisations of the individual’s personal data which the\nPDPA seeks to safeguard against. In this regard, the Commissioner is prepared\nto take such stern action against organisations for the unauthorised sale of\npersonal data.”\n\n22\n\nAlthough the Commission’s investigations did not disclose that the Respondent\n\nre-sold the Purchased Data, the demand generated by buyers such as the\n11\n\n\fRespondent incentivises sellers to engage in the unauthorised sale of personal data,\ncontributing to the market for the unauthorised buying and selling of personal data.\nThere are strong policy reasons to deter would-be participants of such a market as its\nexistence significantly increases the risk of potential misuse or abuse of personal data.\n\nThe Respondent’s Representations\n\n23\n\nOn 20 October 2023, the Respondent was notified of the Commission’s\n\nPreliminary Decision, which sets out:\n(a)\n\nthe Commission’s findings on the Respondent’s breaches of the Consent\nObligation and the Notification Obligation (as set out above);\n\n(b)\n\nthe Commission’s intention to impose a financial penalty of S$28,000;\nand\n\n(c)\n\nthe Commission’s intention to give certain directions on the Respondent\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA.\n\n24\n\nOn 1 November 2023, the Respondent submitted written representations on\n\nthe amount of the financial penalty to be imposed. These representations included the\nfollowing:\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent stated that while he had made sure not to send any\nmarketing SMSes to any DNC-registered contact numbers, he was\nunaware that using e-mail addresses for telemarketing purposes was\nalso a violation of the PDPA;\n\n12\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe Respondent had no malicious intentions in using the Purchased\nData and was only seeking to provide for his family; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent’s financial situation was extremely challenging. The\nfinancial penalty imposed would exacerbate his financial difficulties. In\nparticular, the Respondent stated that he was already struggling to meet\nhis ongoing expenses, including medical expenses for a family member’s\ntreatment.\n\nDecision\n\n25\n\nThe Commission is unable to accept the Respondent’s representations at\n\n[24(a)] and [24(b)] above:\n(a)\n\nAs stated at [18] above, ignorance is not a legitimate excuse for\nbreaching the PDPA. To the Respondent’s credit, he has in his\nrepresentations accepted that ignorance does not excuse his actions,\nand stated that he had only raised this point to provide context.\n\n(b)\n\nNotwithstanding the Respondent’s personal motivations in this regard,\nthe Respondent’s actions were ultimately still done for profit, in\nfurtherance of his business as a real estate salesperson.\n\nAdditionally, the Commission has already taken the Respondent’s self-confessed\nignorance about his data protection obligations and his personal motivations into\naccount when it determined that the Respondent had negligently breached the\nConsent and Notification Obligations: see [18-19] above.\n\n13\n\n\f26\n\nHowever, the Commission accepts and takes into account the Respondent’s\n\nrepresentation at [24(c)] above. When imposing financial penalties, the Commission\nmay take into consideration the personal and financial circumstances of the\norganisation / individual, bearing in mind that financial penalties should not impose a\ncrushing burden or cause undue hardship6. The Commission has given due\nconsideration to the Respondent’s financial situation based on the evidence furnished\nby the Respondent and accepts that the imposition of a high financial penalty would\ncause substantial hardship to the Respondent.\n\n27\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors in this case, including the\n\nRespondent’s representations, the Commission hereby imposes a reduced financial\npenalty of S$16,800. This decision is made on the basis of the exceptional financial\ncircumstances demonstrated by the Respondent, and should not be taken as setting\nany precedent for future cases. The Commission requires the Respondent to pay the\nfinancial penalty of S$16,800 in accordance with the notice accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nDirections\n\n28\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors of this case, including the fact that\n\nthe Purchased Data is still in the Respondent’s possession, the Commission also\ndetermines that the following directions should be imposed on the Respondent under\n\n6 See Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC 12 (at [21]).\n\n14\n\n\fsection 48I of the PDPA, in order to ensure the Respondent’s compliance with the\nConsent Obligation and the Notification Obligation:\n(a)\n\nthe Respondent is to cease his use of all of the Purchased Data\nimmediately;\n\n(b)\n\nthe Respondent is to cease the retention of all of the Purchased Data\nwithin 7 days from the date of this Decision; and\n\n(c)\n\nthe Respondent is to inform the Commission within 7 days from the date\nof this Decision of the completion of the steps directed above.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n15\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A warning was administered to a financial advisor for: (i) using dictionary attack methods to generate telephone numbers;  (ii) failing to obtain clear and unambiguous consent; and  (iii) failing to check the DNC Register, before making marketing calls to DNC-registered individuals.","tags":["Do Not Call Provisions","Warning","Finance and Insurance","Telemarketing"],"date":"22 Feb 2024","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_kenny-lin_20102023.pdf","nature":"Do Not Call Provisions","title":"Breach of Do-Not-Call (\"DNC\") Provisions by a Financial Advisor","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2024/02/breach-of-do-not-call-dnc-provisions-by-a-financial-advisor","timestamp":"2024-02-22","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPCS 6\n\nCase No. ENF-DNC-230119-0007 & Others\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nLin DaoWen Kenny\n\n… Person\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1.\n\nThe Do Not Call Registry (“DNC Registry”) is a national database kept and\n\nmaintained by the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\npursuant to section 39 of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). Persons\nmay register their Singapore telephone numbers with the DNC Registry so as to not\nreceive unsolicited telemarketing calls and messages. The DNC Registry comprises\nof 3 separate registers (i) the No Text Message Register, (ii) the No Voice Call\nRegister, and (iii) the No Fax Message Register.\n\n2.\n\nFrom January 2023 to July 2023, the Commission received twelve (12)\n\ncomplaints arising from unsolicited telemarketing calls made by Lin DaoWen Kenny\n\n\f(the “Individual”) to telephone numbers registered on the No Voice Call Register of\nthe DNC Registry (the “Complaints”).\n\n3.\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether there had\n\nbeen any breaches of the “Do Not Call” provisions in Parts 9 and 9A of the PDPA\n(“DNC Provisions”). This case also illustrates how the employment of online tools to\ngenerate Singapore telephone numbers to market products or services may lead to a\nbreach of section 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\n4.\n\nThe Individual is a financial advisor. In order to generate leads, he used an\n\nExcel spreadsheet formula (“randbetween”) to generate a list of all numbers upon\nentering the extreme ends on a numerical spectrum. The Individual generated 1000\nnumbers (the “Phone List”) with the intention of finding Singapore telephone numbers\nto market his financial advisory services.\n\n5.\n\nOf the 1,000 numbers generated on the Phone List, 384 corresponded to\n\nSingapore telephone numbers that were registered with the No Voice Call Register of\nthe DNC Registry.\n\n6.\n\nThe Individual engaged a telemarketer to make marketing calls to the numbers\n\non the Phone List to promote his financial advisory services. The Individual admitted\nthat he failed to check if the telephone numbers were registered with the Do Not Call\nRegistry before providing the Phone List to the telemarketer. Given the means by\nwhich the Individual generated the Singapore telephone numbers, the Individual was\nalso unable to provide any evidence (written or otherwise) that he had obtained clear\nand unambiguous consent from the subscribers of the 384 DNC-registered numbers\n\n\fbefore making the marketing calls. In light of above, the Individuals has negligently\ncontravened section 43(1) of the PDPA.\n\n7.\n\nFurther, by generating the 384 Singapore telephone numbers through the Excel\n\nspreadsheet formula mentioned above and engaging a telemarketer to make\nmarketing calls to promote his financial advisory services, the Individual has also\ncontravened section 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8.\n\nThe Individual claimed to have inadvertently overlooked screening the numbers\n\non the Phone List on this occasion. The Assistant Commissioner considered that the\nIndividual had a previous compliance record of screening telephone numbers to\nascertain if they were on the DNC Registry. Further, the Individual immediately ceased\nthe telemarketing calls and promptly purchased more credits that can be used to\nscreen if the telephone numbers were registered on the DNC Registry so as to ensure\ncompliance with the DNC Provisions of the PDPA. Upon careful consideration of these\nfacts, the Assistant Commissioner issued a warning to the Individual for contravening\nsections 43(1) and 48B(1) of the PDPA.\n\nThe following section(s) of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in\nthe above summary:\nDuty to check register\n43.—(1) Subject to section 48(2), a person must not send a specified message\naddressed to a Singapore telephone number unless the person has, at the time the\nperson sends the specified message, valid confirmation that the Singapore telephone\nnumber is not listed in the relevant register.\nProhibition on use of dictionary attacks and address-harvesting software\n48B.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a person must not send, cause\nto be sent or authorise the sending of an applicable message.\n\n\f(2) Subsection (1) does not apply to an employee (P) who sends, causes to be\nsent or authorises the sending of an applicable message in good faith —\n(a)\n\nin the course of P’s employment; or\n\n(b)\nin accordance with instructions given to P by or on behalf of P’s employer in the\ncourse of P’s employment.\n(3) However, subsection (2) does not apply to a person (P) who, at the time\nthe applicable message was sent, was an officer or a partner of the sender and it is\nproved that —\n(a)\nP knew or ought reasonably to have known that the telephone number is an\napplicable telephone number; and\n(b)\nthe applicable message was sent with P’s consent or connivance, or the\nsending of the applicable message was attributable to any neglect on P’s part.\n\n\f","decision":"Warning"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $58,000 was imposed on Carousell for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data of its platform users in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\n\fCarousell Pte. Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner — Case Numbers. DP-2209-C0166 and DP-2210C0312\n\n28 December 2023\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nCarousell Pte. Ltd. (“Carousell”) runs an online marketplace website and\n\nmobile application for the buying and selling of new and second-hand goods and\nservices (the “Platform”). In recent years, the Platform has expanded to include\nproperty listings. The Platform is available to users in several markets, including\nSingapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Indonesia.\n\n2\n\nIn 2022, Carousell notified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) of two data breach incidents:\n\n(a)\n\nOn 5 September 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of a data\n\nbreach incident involving the unauthorised disclosure of the personal data of\n44,477 individuals across Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and the\nPhilippines using Carousell’s Platform (the “1st Incident”).\n\n2\n\n\f(b)\n\nOn 17 October 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of a separate\n\nand unrelated incident involving the sale of the personal data of at least 2.6\nmillion1 individuals using Carousell’s Platform (the “2nd Incident”) (collectively,\nthe “Incidents”).\n\n3\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine Carousell’s\n\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) in relation to the\nIncidents. On 13 February 2023, Carousell requested for the investigations into the\nIncidents to be handled under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure\n(“EDP”), which the Commission acceded to. To this end, Carousell voluntarily and\nunequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision and to its contravention of\nSection 24 of the PDPA in respect of the Incidents.\n\nFacts of the 1st Incident\n\n4\n\nCarousell’s Platform includes a chat function allowing potential buyers to send\n\nand receive messages to and from listing owners on the Platform. This chat function\nwas available for use by both individuals who had registered accounts with the\nPlatform (“Registered Users”) and by individuals who did not register accounts with\nthe Platform (“Guest Users”). The chat function served all categories of listings on the\nPlatform, including property listings in different countries.\n\n1\n\nCarousell was unable to confirm the exact number of individuals affected. Carousell had estimated that\napproximately 3.389 million individuals may have been affected. However, the threat actor’s listing on the online\nforum claimed to consist of the personal data of approximately 2.6 million individuals.\n\n3\n\n\f5\n\nOn 13 July 2022, Carousell implemented changes to the chat function. The\n\nchange was intended to be limited to users in Philippines responding to property\nlistings. Where such users had provided their prior consent, their first name (if the user\nwas a Registered User), email address and phone number would be automatically\nappended to the message sent to the owner of the property listing.\n\n6\n\nHowever, due to human error, the changes caused the chat function to\n\nautomatically append the email addresses and names of Guest Users to messages to\nlisting owners of all categories in all markets (the “July 2022 Bug”). For Guest Users\nin the Philippines, their telephone numbers were also appended to the messages.\n\n7\n\nOn 18 August 2022, having not identified the July 2022 Bug, Carousell\n\nimplemented a fix to resolve an unrelated issue with the pre-fill functionality of the chat\nfunction (“August 2022 Bug”). However, these changes caused the chat function to\nautomatically append the email addresses and names of Registered Users to\nmessages to listing owners of all categories in all markets as well, expanding the effect\nof the July 2022 Bug. For Registered and Guests Users in the Philippines, their\ntelephone numbers were also appended.\n\n8\n\nCarousell was eventually made aware of the August 2022 Bug via a user report\n\nsent on 18 August 2022. On 24 August 2022, Carousell implemented a fix which\nresolved both the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs.\n\n9\n\nAs a result of the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs, the personal data of 44,477\n\nindividuals comprising email addresses of all affected users and mobile phone\n\n4\n\n\fnumbers of users in the Philippines were disclosed without their consent. Although the\nnames associated with users’ accounts were also disclosed, the Commission accepts\nCarousell’s explanation that these names were not necessarily indicative of actual\nnames of the users, and are voluntarily disclosed by users on his/her own public\nprofiles. As such, the Commission did not consider disclosure of these names relevant\nfor assessing the breaches of the PDPA in the Incidents.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n10\n\nFollowing the 1st Incident, Carousell took the following remedial actions:\nActions to mitigate the effects of the 1st Incident\n(a)\n\nDeleted all affected personal data disclosed in the chat function by 3\nSeptember 2022; and\n\n(b)\n\nNotified users who had written to Carousell about the 1 st Incident by 6\nSeptember 2022.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the 1st Incident or similar incidents\n(c)\n\nConducted an exercise to identify corrective and preventive measures to\nguard against the possible recurrence of similar incidents;\n\n(d)\n\nRevised its Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) policy such that personal\ndata\n\nissue\n\nreports\n\nare\n\nmarked\n\nas\n\n“Severity-1”\n\nto be resolved within 8 hours. Additionally, alerts of SLA breaches will\nnow trigger over the weekends to shorten the turnaround time for breach\ndetection and response;\n\n5\n\n\f(e)\n\nImplemented an automated unit test which automatically runs on every\nbuild of the Platform to ensure that the Platform does not erroneously\nappend any personal data in chat messages; and\n\n(f)\n\nImplemented requirement for additional approval from the Quality / Test\nengineers in each team prior to implementation of new features involving\nusers’ personal data.\n\n11\n\nThe Commission notes that Carousell did not notify all users affected by the 1st\n\nIncident as it assessed that the 1st Incident was unlikely to result in significant harm\ngiven that the disclosure was limited to basic contact information (telephone number,\nemail address).\n\nFacts of the 2nd Incident\n\n12\n\nOn 15 January 2022, Carousell launched a public-facing Application\n\nProgramming Interface (“API”) during a system migration process. However,\nCarousell inadvertently omitted to apply a filter on that API, resulting in a vulnerability\nwhich was eventually exploited by a threat actor (the “API Bug”).\n\n13\n\nThe API’s original intended function was to retrieve the personal data of users\n\n(“Following/Follower Users”) followed by or following a particular Carousell user\n(\"Subject User”). A filter applied to the API would have ensured that only publicly\navailable personal data of the Following/Follower Users - user name, name and profile\nimage – would be called up. However, due to an inadvertent omission of the filter, the\n\n6\n\n\fAPI was able to call up non-public personal data of Following/Follower Users. These\ncomprised their email addresses, telephone numbers and dates of birth.\n\n14\n\nA threat actor (“TA”) was able to exploit this vulnerability by scraping the\n\naccounts of 46 Subject Users with large numbers of associated Following/Follower\nUsers, thereby obtaining the personal data of these Following/Follower Users.\nForensic investigation revealed that the scraping of non-public data of various users\noccurred between 7 May 2022 and 13 May 2022, and then on 25 June 2022.\n\n15\n\nCarousell’s internal engineering team discovered the API Bug on 15 September\n\n2022 and deployed a patch on the same day. Carousell conducted internal\ninvestigations to determine whether there had been unauthorised access to its users’\npersonal data in the 60-day period prior to 15 September 2022, but did not detect any\nanomalies within that period. They therefore remained unaware of the exploitation by\nthe TA until 13 October 2022.\n\n16\n\nOn 13 October 2022, Carousell was alerted by the Commission that an\n\nindividual was offering the personal data of approximately 2.6 million Carousell users\nfor sale on an online forum. Carousell conducted investigations and confirmed that the\ndata had been exfiltrated as a result of the vulnerabilities caused by the API Bug. On\n17 October 2022, Carousell notified the Commission of the data breach.\n\nRemedial actions\n\n17\n\nFollowing the 2nd Incident, Carousell took the following remedial actions:\n\n7\n\n\fActions to mitigate the effects of the 2nd Incident\n\n(a)\n\nDeployed a fix on 15 September 2022, the same day on which the API\nBug was discovered;\n\n(b)\n\nCompiled a list of users who were following a large number of other users\nto identify any risk of data abuse;\n\n(c)\n\nIdentified and blocked the TA’s account on 13 October 2022, the same\nday on which Carousell was informed of the exploitation;\n\n(d)\n\nNotified all affected individuals by email.\n\nActions to prevent recurrence of the 2nd Incident or similar incidents\n\n(e)\n\nConfigured its GitHub repository to scan for and generate alerts for data\nleakage;\n\n(f)\n\nConducted a security audit for all existing APIs and implemented a\nsystemic regular audit;\n\n(g)\n\nImplemented an automated security audit process for API rollouts. Alerts\nare generated for all API code changes which involve personal data,\nwhich would result in those code changes being reviewed by the relevant\nteams;\n\n(h)\n\nImplemented rate limiting follow and batch-follow APIs to prevent\npotential abuse by users who follow other users;\n\n8\n\n\f(i)\n\nCompiled a list of users following large numbers of users a day and\nidentifying potential risks of data abuse, with the view to banning users\nwho attempted abuse;\n\n(j)\n\nActively monitored API requests for abnormal behaviour;\n\n(k)\n\nImposed stricter IP address rate limits;\n\n(l)\n\nExplored third-party anomalous API access solutions; and\n\n(m)\n\nImplemented annual penetration tests for customer-facing applications.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n\n18\n\nBased on the circumstances of the Incidents, the Commission’s investigation\n\nfocused on whether Carousell had breached its obligation under section 24 of the\nPDPA to protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use,\ndisclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks (the “Protection\nObligation”). Carousell was determined to have breached the Protection Obligation\nin two respects.\n\nFailure to conduct reasonably scoped pre-launch testing\n\n19\n\nProper pre-launch testing is necessary to identify data protection risks and\n\ndefects before new and updated IT features are deployed in live environments. This\n\n9\n\n\fhas been expressly stated in the Commission’s prior decisions2 and in guidance\npublished by the Commission.\n\n20\n\nThe importance of properly scoped code review was highlighted in the\n\nCommission’s previous decision of Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No.\n3400 [2020] SGPDPC 10 at [9]:\n\n“…[O]rganisations should conduct code reviews and pre-launch testing before\nnew IT features or changes to IT systems are deployed. These processes allow\norganisations to pick up and rectify errors and/or flaws in the new IT features\nand/or systems prior to deployment. There have been a number of cases where\nerrors in the application code resulted in the unintended disclosure of personal\ndata or unintended access to personal data …”\n\n21\n\nAs stated at page 5 of the PDPC’s Handbook on How to Guard Against\n\nCommon Types of Data Breaches (“PDPC’s Handbook”), organisations should\nensure that applications are subjected to comprehensive testing such as unit testing,\nregression testing, security testing, and User Acceptance Testing (“UAT”) before\ndeployment. A comprehensive UAT should ensure good test coverage of scenarios\nincluding possible user journeys and exception handling, which should match realworld usage. PDPC’s Checklist to Guard Against Common Data Breaches (“PDPC’s\nChecklist”) also recommends a test suite encompassing functional and non-functional\nrequirements and security testing.\n\n2 SAP Asia Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 6, Grabcar Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPC 14\n\n10\n\n\f22\n\nAdequate pre-launch testing includes implementing reasonable code review.\n\nAs the Commission has stated at page 3 of the PDPC’s Checklist, organisations\nshould ““[c]onduct code review and rigorous unit testing which includes complete\ntesting of functional requirements to verify the compliance to the requirements specs\nat early stage in system development lifecycle.”\n\n23\n\nIn respect of the 1st Incident, Carousell failed to conduct reasonable pre-launch\n\ntesting upon implementing its changes to the Platform’s chat function on 13 July 2022\nand 18 August 2022. Specifically, Carousell admitted that, since changes were only\nintended to impact Registered Users in a specific category of listings (i.e. property\nlistings in the Philippines market), testing was not undertaken to check how the\nchanges may have affected other users and listings outside the intended category.\nGiven that the same chat function served all categories of listings, Carousell should\nhave conducted pre-launch testing on categories other than property listings in the\nPhilippines market. Reasonable code reviews and testing would have detected the\nJuly 2022 and August 2022 Bugs before the changes went “live”.\n\n24\n\nIn respect of the 2nd Incident, Carousell had selectively performed code reviews\n\nand tests during its system migration, only for certain purposes and on certain APIs.\nSince the function of the API relevant to the 2nd Incident was to retrieve personal data,\nCarousell should have identified this API and tested it for data security risks. Carousell\nfailed to do so. Carousell admitted that prior to the 2 nd Incident, it did not mandate\ncomprehensive code reviews for security issues.\n\n11\n\n\fFailure to adequately document software functional and technical specifications\n\n25\n\nMaintaining\n\nreliable\n\ndocumentation\n\non\n\nthe\n\nfunctional\n\nand\n\ntechnical\n\nspecifications of an application helps an organisation keep track of issues over time.\nIt can help to provide context to historical changes and reasons why changes were\nmade in a certain way, which would be especially important where new personnel are\nexpected to take over work on the application. In this regard, page 5 of the PDPC’s\nHandbook recommends organisations to:\n\n“Invest effort to document all software functional and technical\nspecifications (e.g. program specifications, system specifications and\ndatabase specifications). The usefulness of this documentation will become\neven more apparent over time as the original developers move on from the\nproject and new developers take over the software maintenance and upgrading.\nWithout proper documentation, developers often have no references to fall back\non, and may end up making assumptions about code logic that could produce\nincorrect results.”\n\n26\n\nIn respect of the 1st Incident, lack of proper documentation contributed to the\n\nerror which resulted in the data breaches. Carousell’s Platform’s chat function, which\nwas essentially a chat widget and data form, served multiple purposes which were not\nlimited to facilitating property listings in the Philippines market. Depending on the\nuser’s purposes, different form fields would be visible to the user within the chat\nfunction. The engineer who implemented the changes to the chat function on its\nPlatform was not the original author of the function, and did not have the context\n\n12\n\n\fnecessary to know that such changes would affect messages regarding other users\nand listing categories.\n\n27\n\nCarousell admitted that, while its handover process (at the time of the Incidents)\n\nincluded a document of the key features supported by the outgoing engineer, such\nprocess was otherwise undocumented and/or not directly communicated to the\nincoming engineer by the outgoing engineer. With regard to the 1st Incident\nspecifically, Carousell admitted that while the handover documentation pertained to\nthe chat function’s technical aspects, it did not address how Carousell uses the\nfunction for different purposes or how changes would affect specific groups of users.\n\n28\n\nIn respect of the 2nd Incident, the APIs involved in the system migration were\n\nbuilt in 2016 and did not have proper documentation. Carousell admitted that, as a\nresult, the personnel involved in the system migration may not have been aware of the\nneed to apply the filter to the relevant API post-migration.\n\n29\n\nIn the circumstances, it is determined that the Organisation negligently\n\nbreached the Protection Obligation in the Incidents by failing to conduct adequately\nscoped pre-launch testing, and by failing to adequately document functional and\ntechnical specifications of its software.\n\n13\n\n\fThe Commissioner’s Decision\n\n30\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on Carousell pursuant to\n\ns 48J of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty, the factors listed at\ns48J(6) of the PDPA were taken into account.\n\n31\n\nThe Commission recognises that:\n\n(a)\n\nCarousell was cooperative with the Commission’s investigations;\n\n(b)\n\nCarousell took prompt and effective remediation actions upon discovery\nof the July 2022 and August 2022 Bugs in the 1st Incident, and the API\nBug and the data exfiltration in the 2nd Incident; and\n\n(c)\n\n32\n\nCarousell has not previously contravened the PDPA.\n\nThe Commission also recognises that the TA in the 2nd Incident was particularly\n\nsophisticated in avoiding the security measures Carousell had implemented. Carousell\nhad, prior to the 2nd Incident, put in place API processes and security measures, such\nas rate-limiting and traffic monitoring against API vulnerabilities. Carousell’s security\nmeasures in respect of detecting anomalies and/or abuse of its APIs were found to be\nadequate in general. Despite these measures, the TA took actions to remain\nundetected.\n\n33\n\nThe Commission’s investigations were handled under the EDP, under which\n\nCarousell admitted to the facts set out in this decision and to its contraventions of the\n\n14\n\n\fProtection Obligation in the context of the Incidents. The Organisation’s early\nadmission of liability for its breaches of the Protection Obligation is considered a\nsignificant mitigating factor. An organisation that voluntarily admits to its noncompliance with the PDPA and takes measures to correct such non-compliance is an\norganisation that demonstrates that it can be responsible for the personal data in its\npossession or under its control3.\n\n34\n\nBased on the above assessment, the Commission determines that a financial\n\npenalty of $58,000 should be imposed on Carousell.\n\nDirections\n\n35\n\nWhile Carousell implemented technical measures to correct specific issues that\n\nresulted in the Incidents, it should also review its internal processes for software\ntesting and documentation to address the failures identified above.\n\n36\n\nAccordingly, the Commission hereby directs Carousell to carry out the following\n\nwithin 90 days:\n\n(a)\n\nReview its software testing procedures;\n\n(b)\n\nReview its processes and procedures for documenting functional and\ntechnical specifications of software;\n\n(c)\n\nRectify any gaps identified from the reviews above; and\n\n3 See Section 11(2) of the PDPA.\n\n15\n\n\f(d)\n\nFurnish to the Commission a report of the reviews and rectification\nactions taken in response.\n\nDENISE WONG\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n16\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $48,000 was imposed on Koh Wei Ming @ Muhammad Amin Koh (trading as Mobile Chat) for using his customers’ personal data to register for additional prepaid SIM cards without their consent.

It has\noperated since 2015 from a shop located in Geylang. As a retailer of M1 SIM cards,\n\n1\n\nUnder Section 43 of the PDPA, a person is not allowed to send specified messages to a Singapore telephone number registered\nwith the DNC register unless the person has, at the time where he sends the specified message, valid confirmation that the\nSingapore telephone number is not listed in the DNC register.\n\nPage 2 of 11\n\n\fKWM was provided a terminal device by M1 installed at the Organisation’s premises\nfor the purposes of SIM card registration (the “M1 Terminal Device”). The M1\nTerminal Device was used for registration of SIM cards prior to December 2021. SIM\ncard registration had to be carried out in accordance with the conditions of M1’s\ntelecommunications licence granted under Section 5 of the Telecommunications Act\n(Chapter 323).2 The typical SIM card registration process would be as follows:\n(a)\n\nFirst, the customer’s identity document (e.g. identity card, passport, work\n\npass etc.) would be scanned using the M1 Terminal Device, which is connected\ndirectly to M1’s registration system. The system would capture the customer’s\npersonal data, and state whether the customer had reached the permitted limit\nof 3 prepaid SIM cards.\n(b)\n\nNext, the barcode of the SIM card(s) would be scanned so that they\n\ncould be tagged to the registered customer.\n(c)\n\nFinally, a mobile application would be used to load credit value to the\n\nprepaid SIM card(s) to activate them for usage. This was done in the\nOrganisation’s premises. M1’s policy was for each prepaid M1 SIM card to have\na zero-initial balance, and for retailers to load some or all of the money paid by\nthe customer.\n\n4\n\nThe Commission’s investigations revealed that KWM exploited the above\n\nregistration process in order to use his customers’ personal data without consent to\n\n2\n\nThe version of the Telecommunications Act 1999 which was in force at the time\n\nPage 3 of 11\n\n\fregister for additional prepaid M1 SIM cards that his customers did not intend to\npurchase. To do so, KWM would employ one of two methods:\n(a)\n\nMethod 1 (Duplicate Scanning) – After scanning a customer’s identity\n\ndocuments via the M1 Terminal Device to register the SIM card they wished to\npurchase, KWM would scan the identity documents a second time to register a\nsecond SIM card to the same customer without their knowledge. KWM would\nthen hand over only one SIM card to the customer, and keep the other to sell\nto unauthorised purchasers.\n(b)\n\nMethod 2 (Incomplete Transactions) – Occasionally, customers who\n\nhad completed the registration process would not want to continue with their\npurchase after learning that the credit value of the SIM card would have to be\nseparately loaded. At this juncture, instead of cancelling or reversing the\nregistration process, KWM would keep the SIM card(s) and activate them\nwithout the customer’s knowledge, and thereafter offer them for sale to other\nunauthorised purchasers.\n\n5\n\nDuring investigations, KWM admitted that the purpose of the above two\n\nmethods was to earn extra money from the unauthorised sale of the preregistered SIM\ncards. In his 4 years of selling such SIM cards to anonymous purchasers, KWM\nestimated that he made a profit of approximately $35,000 (i.e. around 250 illicit SIM\ncards per year at a profit of $35 per card).\n\nPage 4 of 11\n\n\f6\n\nThe affected personal data collected and used by KWM to register the illicit SIM\n\ncards include the following personal data of 73 individuals (used to register 95 SIM\ncards):\n\n7\n\n(a)\n\nThe customers’ names;\n\n(b)\n\nThe customers’ addresses; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe customers’ NRIC / FIN / passport numbers.\n\nHowever, it is likely that the personal data of many more individuals\n\n(approximately 1,000) was affected, based on KWM’s admission that he sold an\naverage of 250 prepaid SIM cards annually over 4 years.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n8\n\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA defines an “organisation” to include “any individual,\n\ncompany, association or body of persons, corporate or unincorporated”. The\nOrganisation is a sole proprietorship and has no separate legal personality from KWM.\nFurther, KWM was acting in a business capacity in selling the illicit SIM cards to make\na profit, and not a domestic capacity (which ordinarily would have excluded him from\nbeing bound by the PDPA).3 Accordingly, KWM (trading as the Organisation) is an\norganisation for the purposes of the PDPA.\n\nSee also Re Sharon Assya Qadriyah Tang [2018] SGPDPC 1 at [9] – [10] and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile)\n[2021] PDPC 12 at [8]\n3\n\nPage 5 of 11\n\n\f9\n\nBased on the circumstances set out above, the Commission’s investigation\n\ncentred on whether KWM had breached:\n(a)\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of the PDPA.\n\nThe Consent Obligation under section 13 of the PDPA\n10\n\nUnder Section 13 of the PDPA, organisations are prohibited from collecting,\n\nusing or disclosing an individual’s personal data unless the individual gives, or is\ndeemed to have given, his consent, unless otherwise authorised under the PDPA or\nany other written law (the “Consent Obligation”).\n\n11\n\nKWM breached the Consent Obligation by using his customers’ personal data\n\nwithout their consent:\n(a)\n\nIn the case of Method 1 (Duplicate Scanning), KWM’s customers\n\nconsented to the collection and use of their personal data only for the purpose\nof registering the number of SIM card(s) they had requested. They did not\nprovide consent to KWM to use their personal data for any other purpose,\nincluding the registration of additional SIM cards.\n(b)\n\nIn the case of Method 2 (Incomplete Transactions), the customers had\n\nwithdrawn their consent to the use of their personal data at the point where they\nfound that the credit value of the SIM card would have to be separately loaded.\nThe correct action for KWM to take would have been to cancel the SIM card\nregistration and not use the customers’ personal data any further. Instead,\nPage 6 of 11\n\n\fKWM proceeded to keep the registered SIM card and activated them\nseparately, thereby continuing with the use of customers’ personal data for\npurposes they had not consented to.\n\n12\n\nIn the premises, KWM breached the Consent Obligation.\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under Section 18 of the PDPA\n13\n\nUnder Section 18 of the PDPA, an organisation may collect, use or disclose\n\npersonal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would\nconsider appropriate in the circumstances, and where that individual has been\ninformed of the said purposes under Section 20 of the PDPA (the “Purpose Limitation\nObligation”). As set out in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in\nthe PDPA:4\n“The main objective of the Purpose Limitation Obligation is to ensure that\norganisations collect, use and disclose personal data that are relevant for the\npurposes, and only for purposes that are reasonable.\nFor the purposes of section 18 (and as stated in that section), whether a\npurpose is reasonable depends on whether a reasonable person would\nconsider it appropriate in the circumstances. Hence the particular\ncircumstances involved need to be taken into account in determining whether\nthe purpose of such collection, use or disclosure is reasonable. For example,\na purpose that is in violation of a law or which would be harmful to the\n\n4\n\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the PDPA (Rev 16 May 2022) at [13.3] – [13.4]\n\nPage 7 of 11\n\n\findividual concerned is unlikely to be considered appropriate by a reasonable\nperson.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n14\n\nThe Purpose Limitation Obligation limits the use of personal data to the\n\npurposes for which the data subject had been notified and consented to, unless an\nexception to the consent requirement is applicable. The purpose for processing is\nsubject to a backstop, in that it must be reasonable in the circumstances.5 In\nconsidering whether the Purpose Limitation Obligation was breached, it is obvious that\nthe data subject did not give his consent for his or her personal data to be used for\nregistering SIM cards that were to be sold to other purchasers. The purpose that the\ndata subjects had consented to were for registration of SIM cards that they were\npurchasing.\n\n15\n\nIn the present case, KWM admitted that his purpose for using his customers’\n\npersonal data was to register illicit SIM cards in order to sell them to third parties and\nthereby make a profit. KWM also admitted that he knew this was wrong and illegal.\nSuch use of personal data is clearly not a reasonable purpose under any\ncircumstances, as KWM’s customers could not have reasonably intended for their\npersonal data to be used to register illicit SIM cards for KWM’s financial gain.\n\n5\n\nSee Re AIA Singapore Pte Ltd [2016] SGPDPC 10 at [18] and Re Neo Yong Xiang (trading as Yoshi Mobile) [2021] SGPDPC\n12 at [15]\n\nPage 8 of 11\n\n\f16\n\nIn the premises, KWM has breached the Purpose Limitation Obligation.\n\nThe Commissioner’s Preliminary Decision\n17\n\nIn determining whether to impose a financial penalty on KWM pursuant to\n\nsection 48J(1) of the PDPA, and the amount of any such financial penalty, the matters\nset out at section 48J(1) and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were\ntaken into account, including the following aggravating and mitigating factors:\nAggravating Factors\n(a)\n\nKWM’s breaches of the PDPA were difficult to detect as they did not\n\ncome to light until the customers’ numbers and personal data had been misused\nto send marketing messages. The Commission notes that prepaid SIM cards\nare frequently used to further criminal activities; accordingly, a supplier of\nprepaid SIM cards who breaches the PDPA must be dealt with severely for\ndeterrence purposes;\n(b)\n\nKWM’s actions were intentional and took place over a long period of 4\n\nyears;\n(c)\n\nKWM’s breaches of the PDPA caused inconvenience to innocent\n\nparties, as the illicit SIM cards sold by him were used to send unsolicited\nmessages to phone numbers that were registered with the DNC Register;\n(d)\n\nThrough the sale of the illicit SIM cards for approximately 4 years, KWM\n\nfinancially gained approximately $35,000 through the misuse of his customers’\npersonal data; and\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\n\fMitigating Factors\n(e)\n\nKWM admitted to liability early in the investigation process, thus reducing\n\nthe time and resources expended on investigations.\n\n18\n\nKWM was notified of the preliminary decision by way of the Commission’s letter\n\ndated 16 May 2023 and was invited to make representations on the same.\n\nRepresentations Made by KWM\n19\n\nOn 17 May 2023, KWM made the following representations to the Commission\n\nseeking that a financial penalty not be imposed:\n(a)\n\nHe is the sole breadwinner of his family. However, he is likely to have a\n\nperiod without any income as he had been charged with committing an offence\nunder Section 5(1) (read with Section 11A) of the Computer Misuse Act (Cap.\n50A, Rev. Ed. 2007) for unauthorised use of computer material, and was likely\nto be sentenced to an imprisonment term. The Commission notes that on 14\nSeptember 2023, he was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment for the said\noffence; and\n(b)\n\nHe was seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) for\n\nmental health issues.\n\n20\n\nKWM’s representations are not accepted for the following reasons:\n(a)\n\nDespite the Commission’s repeated requests for him to adequately\n\nsubstantiate his assertions of personal and financial hardship, he did not do so.\nPage 10 of 11\n\n\f(b)\n\nThe fact that he was charged and sentenced for a criminal offence,\n\narising from the same set of actions as those which caused the breaches of the\nPDPA, is not in and of itself relevant to any enforcement action taken by the\nCommission.\n(c)\n\nThe fact that he was seeking treatment at the IMH is not, in and of itself,\n\na mitigating factor – especially when he was unable to provide further\ninformation about (i) the condition(s) for which he was seeking treatment and\n(ii) how such condition(s) were related to his breaches of the PDPA.\n\n21\n\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances of this case, the\n\nCommissioner hereby requires KWM to pay a financial penalty of $48,000 within 30\ndays from the date of the relevant notice accompanying this decision, failing which\ninterest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of judgment debts shall\naccrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such financial penalty until the\nfinancial penalty is paid in full.\n\n22\n\nNo further directions are required given that the Organisation has ceased the\n\nunauthorised sale of preregistered SIM cards.\n\nWONG HUIWEN DENISE\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR COMMISSIONER FOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\nPage 11 of 11\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"Directions were issued to Tipros for failing to use or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate.","tags":["Consent","Notification","Purpose Limitation","Directions","Others"],"date":"14 Dec 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_tipros_080623.pdf","nature":"Consent, Notification, Purpose Limitation","title":"Breach of the Purpose Limitation Obligation by Tipros","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/12/breach-of-the-purpose-limitation-obligation-by-tipros","timestamp":"2023-12-14","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n[2023] SGPDPC 7\nCase No. DP-2207-C0019\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\nAnd\nTipros\n\n… Organisation\n\nDECISION\n\nPage 1 of 8\n\n\fTipros\nYeong Zee Kin, Deputy Commissioner — Case No. DP-2207-C0019\n8 June 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1. On 21 July 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”)\nreceived a complaint that Tipros (the “Organisation”), a sole proprietorship in the\nwholesale of and repair of electrical appliances, had unreasonably disclosed the\npersonal data of the complainant when responding to the complainant’s review on\nthe Organisation’s Google reviews page (the “Incident”).\n\n2. The Commission commenced investigations to determine the Organisation’s\ncompliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (“PDPA”) and for\nsuspected breaches of the same.\n\nFacts of the Case\n3. The complainant had engaged the Organisation to repair a refrigerator. Following\nthe repairs made, the complainant gave a “1-star” review on a Google reviews page\n“24hr fridge refrigerator #1 Quick repair service Trusted in Singapore”, which has\nsince been renamed “Tipros.sg”.\n\n4. The Organisation promptly responded to the complainant’s review. What is\nproblematic was that the Organisation included the complainant’s personal data,\nincluding the complainant’s residential address and mobile number in their\nPage 2 of 8\n\n\fresponse. The complainant filed a complaint with the Commission as the\ncomplainant was of the view that there was no reason for the Organisation to\ndisclose her personal data in the course of responding to the review she left on the\nOrganisation’s Google reviews page.\n\n5. Apart from the Organisation’s response to the complainant’s review, the\nCommission found 13 other responses on the Organisation’s Google reviews page\nwhich disclosed, in a similar fashion, the personal data of other customers who had\ngiven reviews.\n\nOur Investigations\n\n6. The Commission commenced investigations. In the course of investigations, it was\nascertained that the Organisation’s place of business was vacant and its registered\noffice was occupied by another business which was not related to the Organisation.\nThus, a Notice to Produce Documents and Information for Investigation (“NTP”)\nwas delivered by hand on 25 October 2022 to the residential address belonging to\nthe Organisation’s sole proprietress, one Er Lee Cheng @ Angela Er Wei Leng\n(“Angela”). The Organisation failed to respond by the stated deadline.\n\n7. Thereafter, the Commission issued three further notices to Angela to attend\ninterviews, which were delivered by hand to Angela’s residential address on 8\nNovember 2022, 15 December 2022, and 10 January 2023.\n\nPage 3 of 8\n\n\f8. Following these notices, an individual claiming to be Angela contacted the\nCommission through an unlisted number on various occasions, namely 11\nNovember 2022, 17 November 2022, and 27 December 2022, and declined our\nrequest to attend an interview, or to schedule any other alternative dates for an\ninterview.\n\n9. The Commission is satisfied that the Organisation had received due notice of our\ninvestigative proceedings. Given the Organisation’s refusal to respond to our NTP\nand our notices to attend an interview, the Commission proceeded with its\ninvestigations based on the evidence available to it.\n\n10. The Commission is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the Organisation’s\nresponses which disclosed the complainant’s personal data had been posted by\nthe Organisation for the following reasons: First, The Google reviews page reflects\nthe name of the Organisation; and second, the Organisation has a direct and\nmaterial interest in the reviews given by the complainant and other individuals on\nthe Organisation’s Google reviews page.\n\nFindings and Basis for Determination\n11. Based on the circumstances disclosed above, the Commission’s investigations\ncentered on whether the Organisation had breached the Purpose Limitation\nObligation under section 18 of the PDPA.\n\nPage 4 of 8\n\n\fThe Purpose Limitation Obligation under section 18 of the PDPA\n12. Under section 18(a) of the PDPA, organisations may collect, use or disclose\npersonal data for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate\nin the circumstances and — under section 18(b) — that the individual had been\ninformed prior to the intended collection, use or disclosure (the “Purpose\nLimitation Obligation”).\n\n13. I had previously discussed the ambit of when it would be acceptable for an\norganisation to disclose personal data when responding to public comments in M\nStars Movers & Logistics Specialist Pte Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 15 and in Big Bubble\nCentre [2018] SGPDPC 25. In Re M Stars Movers, I stated at [18] and [19] as\nfollows:\n“The Deputy Commissioner advises caution in disclosing personal data when\nresponding to public comments. An organisation should not be prevented or\nhampered from responding to comments about it using the same mode of\ncommunications that its interlocutor has selected. In some situations, it may be\nreasonable or even necessary to disclose personal data in order to advance an\nexplanation. … An individual who makes false or exaggerated allegations\nagainst an organisation in a public forum may not be able to rely on the PDPA\nto prevent the organisation from using material and relevant personal data of\nthe individual to explain the organisation’s position on the allegations through\nthe same public forum.\n\nThe following observations may be made in this context about the approach\nthat the Commission adopts. First, the Commission will not engage in weighing\nPage 5 of 8\n\n\fallegations and responses on golden scales in order to establish proportionality.\nThe better approach is to act against disclosures that are clearly\ndisproportionate on an objective standard before the Commission intervenes in\nwhat is essentially a private dispute…”\n\n14. When an individual chooses a public platform to pass comments about an\norganisation, the organisation is fully entitled to respond on the same platform in a\nproportionate and reasonable manner. In such circumstances, the individual had\ninitiated the communication and selected the public platform. The nature of the\nindividual’s comments will determine whether a response from the organisation is\nnecessary. Where the nature of the individual’s comments invites a response for\nthe purpose of advancing an explanation, such a purpose is considered reasonable\nin the circumstances under section 18(a). In advancing an explanation, it may be\nnecessary to use or disclose relevant facts in order for the explanation to be\neffective. Such disclosure is reasonable in the circumstances provided that the\nextent of disclosure is proportionate.\n\n15. Further, the requirement under section 18(b) read with section 20(1)(b) that the\nindividual be informed of the purpose prior to use or disclosure is also met in these\ncircumstances. The raison d’être for this requirement is to keep the individual\ninformed of the purposes for which his or her personal data is to be used or\ndisclosed, unless such use or disclosure is for purposes that are authorised by law.\nIn cases such as the present, the individual initiated the communication and the\nnature of his or her comments shapes the organisation’s response. As long as the\norganisation’s response is for a reasonable purpose that is a natural consequence\nPage 6 of 8\n\n\fof the individual’s comments, the individual is deemed to have been informed of\nsuch purpose. Thus, where an individual makes a complaint on a public platform\nin relation to an interaction with the organisation, it is natural that the organisation\nresponds on the same platform for the purpose of providing an explanation. And if\nuse or disclosure of personal data is necessary for such a purpose, the individual\nis deemed to have been informed prior to such user or disclosure since it is the\nindividual’s earlier actions that had elicited the response.\n\n16. In the present case, I am of the view that the Organisation’s disclosure of the\ncomplainant’s personal data was unreasonable and disproportionate. The\ncomplaint related to the poor standard of service that the Organisation delivered.\n\n17. The complainant alleged that two weeks after the Organisation repaired his or her\nrefrigerator, the refrigerator stopped working. The complainant was aggrieved that\nthe Organisation sought a payment of $80 ($20 transport fees and $60 checking\nfees) to check on the refrigerator two weeks after the Organisation fixed the\nrefrigerator, and that the Organisation’s technician was supposedly not available\nover the weekend when the complainant had only engaged the Organisation\nbecause the Organisation had supposedly advertised itself as providing round-theclock service. Given the grievances flagged in the complainant’s review, there was\nno issue about the location for delivery of the service. Thus, it was unnecessary for\nthe Organisation to disclose the complainant’s residential address. In the same\nvein, I do not see how disclosure of the complainant’s mobile number was\nnecessary to advance an explanation in response to the complaint.\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\n\fThe Commission’s Decision\n18. Based on the facts established, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach\nof its obligation under section 18(a) of the PDPA. The Organisation’s failure to\nrespond to NTP and refusal to attend for an interview are duly considered as\naggravating factors. As the Organisation had not taken any action to remove or\namend its response to the complaint, there is no mitigating factors to speak of.\n\n19. In the circumstances, I hereby direct the Organisation to:\n(a) Remove the disclosure of the complainant’s residential address and mobile\nnumber in its response to the complainant’s comments on the Organisation’s\nGoogle reviews page; and\n(b) Review the 13 other responses on the Organisation’s Google reviews page\nwhere it had also disclosed personal data of other customers in response to their\nreviews, and to remove disclosure of personal data if such disclosure is not\nreasonable or proportionate in order for the Organisation to respond to the Google\nreviews.\nThe Organisation is given 30 days to comply with these directions.\n\nYEONG ZEE KIN\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER\nFOR PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\nPage 8 of 8\n\n\f","decision":"Directions"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $10,000 was imposed on Ascentis for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect individuals' personal data in its possession or under its control.","tags":["Protection","Financial Penalty","Admin and Support Services"],"date":"10 Nov 2023","pdf-url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/files/pdpc/pdf-files/commissions-decisions/gd_ascentis_12092023.pdf","nature":"Protection","title":"Breach of the Protection Obligation by Ascentis","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/all-commissions-decisions/2023/10/breach-of-the-protection-obligation-by-ascentis","timestamp":"2023-11-10","pdf-content":"PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION COMMISSION\n\n[2023] SGPDPC 10\n\nCase No. DP-2209-C0193 / DP-2209-C0217\n\nIn the matter of an investigation under section 50(1) of the\nPersonal Data Protection Act 2012\n\nAnd\n\nAscentis Pte.

Ltd.\nWong Huiwen Denise, Deputy Commissioner - Case No. DP-2209-C0193 / DP2209-C0217\n12 September 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn 13 September 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team\nthat the personal data of 332,774 individuals had been exfiltrated from an eCommerce\nplatform (the “Platform”) owned by Starbucks Coffee Singapore Pte Ltd (“Starbucks\nSG”) and offered for sale online (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Commission commenced investigations to determine whether the\n\ncircumstances of the Incident disclosed any contraventions of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”). For the reasons set out below, the Commission\ndetermined that the developer of the Platform, Ascentis Pte Ltd (“the Organisation”)\nhad contravened section 24 of the PDPA (“the Protection Obligation”) in the context\nof the Incident.\n\n3\n\nThe Organisation requested and agreed for the investigation to be handled\n\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure, and voluntarily\nprovided and admitted to the facts set out below. The Organisation also admitted that\n2\n\n\fit had failed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal\ndata exfiltrated during the Incident, in breach of the Protection Obligation.\n\n4\n\nThe Commission also accepted a voluntary undertaking from Starbucks SG\n\npursuant to section 48L(1)(a) of the PDPA for Starbucks SG to implement enhanced\nsecurity arrangements to improve its compliance with the PDPA1. No further\nenforcement action was taken against Starbucks SG.\n\nFacts of the Case\nThe CRM System and CRM Database\n5\n\nThe Organisation is in the business of developing, providing and integrating\n\nsoftware solutions for Customer Relationship Management and eCommerce.\n\n6\n\nOn 19 December 2014, Starbucks SG engaged the Organisation to develop,\n\nimplement, support, and host a Customer Relationship Management system (the\n“CRM System”) to support Starbucks SG’s “My Starbucks Rewards” loyalty program\n(the “Rewards Program”).\n\n7\n\nWhen an individual signed up as a member of the Rewards Program, their\n\npersonal data including name, email address, telephone number, and birth date was\ncollected and stored on a cloud database (the “CRM Database”).\n\n1\n\nA copy of Starbucks SG’s voluntary undertaking is available at https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Undertakings.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Project for development of the Platform\n8\n\nOn 14 September 2020, Starbucks SG engaged the Organisation to separately\n\ndevelop and provide, as well as render ongoing technical support for, the Platform, an\nonline store for the sale and purchase of products offered by Starbucks SG (“the\nProject”).\n\n9\n\nIn turn, on 1 January 2021, the Organisation engaged one Kyanon Digital Co.\n\nLtd (“Kyanon”), a company based in Vietnam in the business of software development\nand provision, to provide additional manpower and software development support to\nthe Organisation for its execution of the Project.\n\n10\n\nOne of Starbucks SG’s requirements for the Project was for a Rewards Program\n\nmember’s personal data to be auto-completed in electronic forms on the Platform,\nsuch that the member would not have to manually key in his/her personal data to\ncomplete a transaction on the Platform.\n\n11\n\nThe personal data of Rewards Program members was originally only stored on\n\nthe CRM Database (and not on the Platform). In order to make it more convenient for\nmembers to use the Platform, the Organisation implemented a process to\nautomatically synchronise a member’s personal data from the CRM Database to the\nPlatform whenever an individual logged in as a member on the Starbucks SG website\nand then visited the Platform. This synchronisation occurred in real-time. Once the\n4\n\n\fsynchronisation was complete, the member’s personal data would exist separately in\na database within the Platform. Both the CRM Database and the database within the\nPlatform were hosted and operated independently.\n\nKyanon’s involvement in the Project\n12\n\nDespite Kyanon’s engagement, the Organisation maintained control and\n\nmanagement of, and had direct involvement in, the Project. The leader of the team\ndelivering the Project (the “Project Team”), was an employee of the Organisation,\nwhile the remaining personnel comprising the Project Team were employees of\nKyanon (the “Kyanon Employees”)\n\n13\n\nThe Kyanon Employees were provided with accounts to the Platform with full\n\nadministrative privileges (the “Admin Accounts”). These enabled the Kyanon\nEmployees to support, check and perform configuration of the Platform, troubleshoot\nany technical problems, and check if data received on the Platform had been\nsynchronised correctly. The Admin Accounts also granted rights to Kyanon Employees\nto export data from the Platform (the significance of which is discussed below). Prior\nto the Incident, the Admin Accounts did not require multi-factor authentication (“MFA”).\n\n14\n\nOne of the Kyanon Employees, “Peter”, left the employ of Kyanon in May 2022.\n\nHe handed over the credentials to his Admin Account (“Peter’s Admin Account”) to\nthe remaining members of the Project Team via a shared Google Sheet. Despite the\ncessation of Peter’s employment with Kyanon, Peter’s Admin Account was not\n5\n\n\fdisabled. Rather, the Kyanon Employees changed the password of Peter’s Admin\nAccount to “Kyanon@123456”, updated the shared Google Sheet with the new\npassword, and continued using Peter’s Admin Account among themselves.\n\nThe Incident\n15\n\nSometime between 10 and 13 September 2022, a malicious actor used Peter’s\n\nAdmin Account to gain access to the Platform, where the personal data of those\nRewards Program members who had previously logged into the Platform was stored.\nThe Organisation was not able to determine the exact method by which the malicious\nactor gained access to Peter’s Admin Account; it was possibly through the\nabovementioned shared Google Sheet. The malicious actor granted other accounts\nadministrative privileges, performed data gathering, and exported the gathered data\nto an external email address.\n\n16\n\nIn total, the personal data of 332,774 individuals stored in the Platform\n\ncomprising names, email addresses, dates of birth, membership details relating to the\nRewards Program, last login dates to the Platform, the physical addresses of 181,875\nindividuals, and the telephone numbers of 310,560 individuals (“Subject Data”) was\nexfiltrated in the Incident.\n\n17\n\nThe Subject Data was subsequently advertised for sale on an online forum on\n\nthe dark web. The Commission was notified of the same by the Singapore Computer\nEmergency Response Team on 13 September 2022. Starbucks SG and the\n6\n\n\fOrganisation submitted data breach notifications to the Commission on 15 and 16\nSeptember 2022, respectively.\n\nRemedial Actions\n18\n\nAfter being notified of the Incident, the Organisation took remedial actions which\n\nincluded:\n(a)\n\nActivating an emergency response team and establishing an investigation\nteam (including an external cybersecurity firm) to investigate the Incident;\n\n(b)\n\nDisabling access to the Platform by all accounts, validating all Platform\naccounts, and resetting all administrator accounts;\n\n(c)\n\nBlocking the malicious actor’s IP address in the Platform firewall;\n\n(d)\n\nMandating that all vendors, including Kyanon, perform full anti-virus and\nmalware scans, and provide reports of these scans to the Organisation\nbefore resuming work; and\n\n(e)\n\nImplemented MFA for all its accounts.\n\n7\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n19\n\nUnder the Protection Obligation, an organisation must protect personal data in\n\nits possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks.\n\n20\n\nThe Protection Obligation also applies to data intermediaries2. A data\n\nintermediary is defined under section 2(1) of the PDPA as “an organisation which\nprocesses personal data on behalf of another organisation but does not include an\nemployee of that other organisation”. In turn, the “processing” of personal data is\ndefined as:\n“in relation to personal data, means the carrying out of any operation or set of\noperations in relation to the personal data, and includes any of the following:\n\n2\n3\n\n(a)\n\nrecording;\n\n(b)\n\nholding;\n\n(c)\n\norganisation, adaptation or alteration;\n\n(d)\n\nretrieval;\n\n(e)\n\ncombination;\n\n(f)\n\ntransmission;\n\n(g)\n\nerasure or destruction;”3\n\nSection 4(2) of the PDPA.\nSection 2(1) of the PDPA.\n\n8\n\n\f21\n\nAs the developer and host of the CRM System and the Platform, the Organisation\n\nprocessed personal data (including the Subject Data) in the CRM Database and the\nPlatform on Starbucks SG’s behalf. Accordingly the Organisation was a data\nintermediary of Starbucks SG and was subject to the Protection Obligation in respect\nof the Subject Data.\n\n22\n\nThe reasonableness of an organisation’s security arrangements would be\n\nassessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such personal data and the\npossible impact of a data breach. As stated in the Commission’s Advisory Guidelines\non Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 16 May 2022)\n(“Advisory Guidelines”) at paragraphs 17.3(a) and (b), an organisation should:\n\n“a) design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n…\nc) implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of security\n…”\n\n23\n\nAdditionally, as stated in the Commission’s Guide to Data Protection Practices\n\nfor ICT Systems (“ICT Systems Guide”) at page 8:\n\n9\n\n\f“For organisations that hold large quantities of different types of personal data or\ndata that might be more sensitive to the individuals or the organisations, they\nshould additionally implement the relevant enhanced practices suggested in\neach section. The design and implementation of these protection measures\nshould always take into consideration the extent of the sensitivity of the data\nbased on the nature of business and types of services offered.”\n\n24\n\nIn the present case, having regard to the large volume of personal data hosted\n\nin the Platform, reasonable security arrangements to protect the Subject Data were\nnot implemented. The Commission sets out the reasons for this finding in the\nparagraphs below. In particular, the Organisation failed to disable Peter’s Admin\nAccount after he was no longer working on the Project.\n\n25\n\nIn the ICT Systems Guide, the Commission recommends at page 15 that\n\norganisations should, as a basic practice, conduct “Regular review of user accounts\nto ensure that all the accounts are active and the rights assigned are necessary (i.e.\nremove user accounts when a user has left the organisation or update the user’s\nrights when he/she has changed his/her role within the organisation).” (emphasis\nadded in bold).\n\n26\n\nIn this case however, the Organisation did not disable Peter’s Admin Account\n\nafter he left the employ of Kyanon but permitted its continued use by Kyanon\nEmployees. While Peter was an ex-employee of Kyanon and not of the Organisation,\n10\n\n\fit was nevertheless (by the Organisation’s own admission) the Organisation itself\nwhich retained responsibility for the development and management of the Platform,\nincluding the creation and management of administrator accounts. The Organisation\nadmitted that the failure to disable Peter’s Admin Account was a “lapse” on its part,\nand further admitted that it failed to create new accounts for the Kyanon Employees\nwho took over Peter’s duties.\n\n27\n\nThe failure to disable Peter’s Admin Account was exacerbated by the fact that\n\nthe account was not protected with a sufficiently complex password. Having taken over\nPeter’s Admin Account, the Kyanon Employees changed the password to\n“Kyanon@123456” (the “New Password”). The Organisation informed the\nCommission that the New Password met the Platform’s password complexity\nrequirements, namely that passwords be at least 8 characters in length, have at least\n1 upper and 1 lower case letter, at least 1 special character, and not be a repeat of\nthe account’s previous 5 passwords.\n\n28\n\nThe Commission has made clear in previous enforcement decisions that mere\n\ntechnical compliance with password complexity requirements is not good enough if\nthe password remains guessable4. Although the New Password complied with the\nPlatform’s password complexity requirements, it incorporated the name “Kyanon” and\n\n4\n\nRe Chizzle Pte Ltd [2020] SGPDPR 1 at [5(d)].\n\n11\n\n\fa sequential series of digits (“123456”). This made the New Password easily\nguessable and insecure.\n\n29\n\nFurther, the sharing of credentials for Peter’s Admin Account via a shared\n\nGoogle Sheet meant that anyone who obtained access to the said Google Sheet could\ngain access to Peter’s Admin Account. As the Commission has stated in the ICT\nSystems Guide at page 16, an organisation should “[h]ave clear policies that prohibit\nthe sharing of passwords such as admin credentials”. Such sharing posed a\nheightened risk of unauthorised access especially if a malicious actor was familiar with\nPeter’s user ID.\n\n30\n\nThe Organisation stressed to the Commission that passwords for accounts to the\n\nPlatform were hashed, and that the Organisation was unaware of the New Password.\nFurther, the Organisation stated that Peter’s Admin Account was used by Kyanon\nEmployees and not the Organisation’s employees, and that the New Password was\nset by the Kyanon Employees using Peter’s Admin Account.\n\n31\n\nWhile the immediate cause for the weak New Password and insecure sharing of\n\nthe credentials for Peter’s Admin Account may have been the Kyanon Employees, the\nOrganisation could have managed this better by specifying clearer data protection\nrequirements to Kyanon as part of its involvement in the Project, including in relation\nto account management.\n\n12\n\n\f32\n\nWhile the Master Services Agreement between the Organisation and Kyanon\n\ndated 1 January 2021 did impose broad data protection obligations on Kyanon, it did\nnot mandate any specific measures in relation to account management, beyond\nstating that “secure authentication and authorisation processes” were to be\nimplemented.\n\n33\n\nIn addition, Kyanon had provided the Organisation with a signed Letter of\n\nUndertaking in which Kyanon undertook to comply with “the standards in relation to\npersonal data protection, including those required under the Personal Data Protection\nAct (No. 26 of 2012) of Singapore (the “PDPA Policy”)”, the Organisation’s Security\nand Services Guide, and the Organisation’s Personal Data Handling and Measures.\nHowever, these documents did not specify any specific requirements for the disabling\nof ex-employee accounts.\n\n34\n\nTaking into consideration the above, the Commission finds the Organisation in\n\nbreach of the Protection Obligation for failing to disable Peter’s Admin Account after\nPeter was no longer a Kyanon employee.\n\nObservations on other data protection practices\n35\n\nSeparate to the above finding (which the Organisation admitted to), the\n\nCommission sets out observations on two other data protection practices which, if\nimplemented, could have prevented the unauthorised disclosure of personal data in\nthe Incident even if Peter’s Admin Account had not been disabled. For the avoidance\n13\n\n\fof doubt, these observations are made solely to provide guidance, and (i) do not\nconstitute additional findings of breaches of the Protection Obligation by the\nOrganisation in this case, or (ii) factor in any way in the Commission’s final decision in\nthis case.\n\nScoping of rights assigned to Admin Accounts\n36\n\nAll Admin Accounts assigned to Kyanon Employees were granted rights to\n\nexport data from the Platform, even though such rights may not have been necessary\nfor their work on the Project.\n\n37\n\nAs stated in the ICT Systems Guide (page 15) and paragraph 25 above, the\n\nCommission recommends regular review of user accounts to ensure that only the\nnecessary rights are assigned. The Commission has previously found organisations\nin breach for failing to carry out such review.5\n\nImplementation of MFA for Admin Accounts\n38\n\nThe level of privileges granted to all Admin Accounts created a heightened risk\n\nthat large volumes of personal data could be exfiltrated from the Platform if an Admin\nAccount was compromised. This risk was exacerbated by the fact that the Admin\nAccount did not require MFA. In Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3,\nthe Commission made clear that MFA should be implemented as a baseline\n\n5\n\nRedMart Limited [2022] SGPDPC 8 at [19].\n\n14\n\n\frequirement for administrative accounts with access to confidential or sensitive\npersonal data or large volumes of personal data.6\n\n39\n\nIn this case, the Organisation explained that while it had plans to implement\n\nMFA for the Admin Accounts (as part of unified access controls), these plans were\ndelayed due to manpower shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n40\n\nWhile the Commission recognises the business difficulties brought on by the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, implementation of MFA for the Admin Accounts could\nnevertheless have been given greater priority considering the volume of personal data\naccessible from the Platform, and the associated heightened data protection risks.\n\n41\n\nIt was not necessary for the Commission to make breach findings in relation to\n\nthe above two data protection practices in this case. However, the Commission will\nnot hesitate to find organisations in future enforcement cases in breach of the\nProtection Obligation for failing to implement the same – particularly in cases involving\nunauthorised use of administrative accounts with access to sensitive or large volumes\nof personal data.\n\n6\n\nLovebonito Singapore Pte.

Ltd.\nLew Chuen Hong, Commissioner - Case No. DP-2206-B9897\n4 September 2023\n\nIntroduction\n1\n\nOn\n\n14\n\nJune\n\n2022, the Personal Data\n\nProtection\n\nCommission\n\n(the\n\n“Commission”) was notified by Tokyo Century Leasing (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (the\n“Organisation”) of a ransomware attack which resulted in the encryption of the\npersonal data of 141,412 individuals (“Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation requested that the investigation be handled under the\n\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure. The Organisation voluntarily\nprovided and admitted to the facts set out below, and admitted that it had failed to\nimplement reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data accessed\nand encrypted during the Incident, in breach of section 24 of the Personal Data\nProtection Act 2012 (“PDPA”).\n\nFacts of the Case\n3\n\nThe Organisation is in the leasing and hire-purchase business. It operates a\n\nwebsite through which existing or potential customers may submit applications to enter\ninto hire-purchase or leasing agreements.\n\nPage 2 of 14\n\n\f4\n\nOn 12 June 2022, the Organisation was notified by a customer that he was\n\nunable to submit an online application. The Organisation conducted an internal\ninvestigation and discovered that 7 servers and 6 employee computers had been\ninfected with ransomware, resulting in the encryption of the personal data of 141,412\nindividuals, comprising:\n\na)\n\n111,156 customers whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number,\ndate of birth, address, contact number, income statement, email address,\nemployer information, bank account, and additionally for foreign customers,\ntheir passport numbers and employment pass numbers;\n\nb)\n\n30,220 guarantors whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number,\ndate of birth, address, contact number, income statement, email address,\nemployer information, and bank account; and\n\nc)\n\n36 employees whose personal data consisted of name, NRIC number, date\nof birth, address, contact number, email address, bank account, resume\ninformation, and medical check-up information.\n\n(collectively the “Subject Data”)\n\n5\n\nThe Subject Data was encrypted by a virus with the extension “.myghost”. The\n\nOrganisation also discovered a ransom note instructing the Organisation to contact\n“apichai[@]keemail.me” or “teeraanu[@]tuta.io” to obtain the decryption key, failing\n\nPage 3 of 14\n\n\fwhich the Subject Data would be leaked. The ransom note did not specify a ransom\namount. The Organisation did not respond to the ransom note.\n\n6\n\nThe Organisation notified the Commission of the Incident on 14 June 2022. On\n\n8 July 2022, the Organisation requested that the investigation be handled under the\nCommission’s Expedited Breach Decision Procedure, and in a statement by its\nManaging Director dated 29 July 2022, admitted to a breach of section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n7\n\nInvestigations were conducted between 14 June 2022 and October 2022,\n\ncomprising the efforts of an IT forensic investigation firm engaged by the\nOrganisation’s parent organisation, and the Commission’s own investigations. The\ninvestigations revealed that:\n\na)\n\nA malicious encryption programme “Stager.exe” had been executed on at\nleast 3 servers by a compromised administrator account through Remote\nDesktop Connections;1\n\nb)\n\nThe IP address of each of the Remote Desktop Connections was generated\nby a FortiGate 100E Virtual Private Network (“VPN”) and firewall device\n(“Device”) in use by the Organisation since September 2019;\n\nc)\n\nThe software installed on the Device was the outdated version 6.0.4 of\nFortiOS and had a known vulnerability CVE-2018-13379 (“Vulnerability”).2\n\n1\n\nA Remote Desktop Connection refers to the connection and control by a user to a target device (such as a computer) remotely\nthrough the internet or other network.\n2\nThis is the same vulnerability that may have been exploited in the data breach incident which is the subject of the Commission’s\ndecision in The Law Society of Singapore [2023] SGPDPC 4.\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\fThe effect of the Vulnerability was that a malicious actor could, via the\ninternet, remotely access system files on the Device, specifically\n“sslvpn_websession”, containing the username and password of a VPN\nsession. With such details, the malicious actor would be able to gain access\nto the VPN to which the target’s (in this case, the Organisation) devices\nwere connected;\n\nd)\n\nThe most likely cause of the Incident was that malicious actor(s) exploited\nthe Vulnerability, thereby gaining access to the Organisation’s VPN. The\nmalicious actor(s) in turn compromised one of the Organisation’s\nadministrator accounts, gaining access to the Subject Data stored on the\nOrganisations servers and computers. However, no evidence was\ndiscovered to indicate that the Subject Data had been exfiltrated;\n\ne)\n\nThe Device’s manufacturer released a patch in May 2019 to address the\nVulnerability,3 but the patch had not been installed by the time of the\nIncident. The Organisation informed the Commission that while its IT\nvendor had the responsibility of upgrading the Organisation’s firewall, such\nupgrading / patching was only triggered upon request by the Organisation.\nHowever, the Organisation was unaware of the patch, did not have\nprocesses in place to manage software patches, and therefore did not\nrequest its IT vendor to patch the Vulnerability; and\n\nFortinet, Inc, “FortiOS system file leak through SSL VPN via specially crafted HTTP resource requests” (FortiGuard Labs, 24\nMay 2019) <https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-384> accessed 23 March 2023.\n3\n\nPage 5 of 14\n\n\ff)\n\nThe Organisation had not implemented Multi-Factor Authentication (“MFA”)\nfor its administrator accounts at the time of the Incident.\n\nRemedial Action\n8\n\nAfter the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial actions:\n\na)\n\nReported the Incident to the Singapore Police Force and the Commission,\nwithin 72 hours of the discovery by the Organisation of the same;\n\nb)\n\nPublished a notice of the Incident on its website, and engaged an external\ncall centre to provide hotline services to affected customers;\n\nc)\n\nConducted anti-virus scans on all its computers;\n\nd)\n\nEngaged an IT forensic investigation firm to scan and monitor the internet\nfor the Subject Data. The IT forensic investigation firm did not detect any\ndisclosure of the same on the internet;\n\ne)\n\nPatched the Vulnerability and its Windows systems;\n\nf)\n\nChanged the passwords for its administrator accounts for all its servers and\ncritical network equipment; and\n\ng)\n\nImplemented MFA for access to its VPN.\n\nPage 6 of 14\n\n\fFindings and Basis for Determination\nWhether the Organisation had contravened the Protection Obligation\n9\n\nUnder section 24 of the PDPA an organisation must protect personal data in its\n\npossession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to\nprevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or\ndisposal, or similar risks (the “Protection Obligation”).\n\n10\n\nThe reasonableness of an organisation’s security arrangements to protect\n\npersonal data would be assessed having regard to the volume and sensitivity of such\npersonal data and the possible impact of a data breach. As stated in the Commission’s\nAdvisory Guidelines on Key Concepts in the Personal Data Protection Act (revised 17\nMay 2022) (“Advisory Guidelines”) at paragraphs 17.3(a) and (b), an organisation\nshould:\n\n“a) design and organise its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal\ndata held by the organisation and the possible harm that might result from a\nsecurity breach;\n…\nc) implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of\nsecurity for personal data of varying levels of security\n…”\n\n11\n\nIn the present case, the Subject Data comprised a large volume of sensitive\n\npersonal data affecting 141,412 individuals. Such data included names, NRIC\nnumbers, bank account information and income statements. Given the nature of such\nPage 7 of 14\n\n\fpersonal data, there was a heightened risk of identity theft and/or financial loss, which\ncalled for a higher standard of security arrangements.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons set out below the Commission determines that the Organisation\n\nfailed to implement reasonable security arrangements to protect the Subject Data, in\nbreach of the Protection Obligation. In particular, the Organisation failed to:\n\na)\n\nConduct regular monitoring for software patches;\n\nb)\n\nImplement processes to manage software patches and upgrades; and\n\nc)\n\nImplement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\nFailure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches\n13\n\nThe importance of conducting regular monitoring for software patches, and more\n\ngenerally testing the vulnerability of info-communications and technology (“ICT”)\nsystems, has been stressed repeatedly by the Commission.\n\n14\n\nIn Commeasure Pte Ltd [2021] SGPDPC 11, the Commission highlighted at\n\nparagraph 14 that it was necessary for organisations to conduct regular reviews and\nmonitoring of their ICT systems, which would include monitoring for software patches\nand updates.\n\n15\n\nThe Commission has also made clear at page 27 of its Guide to Data Protection\n\nPractices for ICT Systems, that as a basic measure, organisations ought to “conduct\nPage 8 of 14\n\n\fregular ICT monitoring, alerts, security audits, scan and tests to detect vulnerabilities\nand non-compliance with organisational standards.”\n\n16\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to conduct regular monitoring for software\n\npatches for the software on the Device. The Device (with the Vulnerability) had been\nin use by the Organisation since September 2019, more than 3 months since the\nDevice’s manufacturer had released the patch in May 2019. The Vulnerability\nremained un-patched for a period of almost 3 years thereafter until the Incident\noccurred. The Organisation admitted that it was unaware of the patch until after the\nIncident and that it did not conduct regular monitoring for software patches. Had the\nOrganisation conducted regular monitoring for software patches, it would have learned\nof the patch for the Vulnerability.\n\n17\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches to the\nsoftware on the Device.\n\nFailure to implement processes to manage software patches and upgrades\n18\n\nThe Organisation’s failure to conduct regular monitoring for software patches\n\nunderscores the importance for organisations to implement processes to manage the\nsame.\n\n19\n\nAs noted at paragraph 7(e) above, software patching was done on an ad-hoc\n\nbasis by the Organisation’s IT vendor on the instructions of the Organisation. However,\nas the Organisation failed to monitor for software patches, it was unaware of the\nPage 9 of 14\n\n\favailable patch for the Vulnerability, and did not instruct the IT vendor to install the\npatch.\n\n20\n\nBased on the Organisation’s clarifications to the Commission, it is likely that the\n\nOrganisation assumed that its IT vendor would monitor for software patches even\nthough the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor did not contain any requirements\nfor the IT vendor to conduct regular monitoring. The Organisation failed to properly\napply its mind to the issue of regular monitoring, as this was not contained in the\ncontract between the Organisation and its IT vendor.\n\n21\n\nIn its Checklists to Guard Against Common Types of Data Breaches, the\n\nCommission recommends at page 6 that organisations should, as a basic practice,\n“Develop an ICT policy that covers the critical aspects in IT security such as account\nand access control, password, email, IT risk management, asset and configuration,\nbackup and recovery, hardening and patching.”\n\n22\n\nWhile the Commission does not prescribe the specific terms of such ICT\n\npolicies and/or processes, the Organisation could, for example, have implemented\nprocesses by which the Organisation or its IT vendors were automatically notified of\navailable software patches, or reminded on a periodic basis to conduct checks for\nsoftware patches. Further, the contract between the Organisation and its IT vendor\ncould have specifically included an obligation for the IT vendor to conduct regular\nmonitoring for patches, without the need for the Organisation to request patching on\nan ad-hoc basis. However, the Organisation failed to implement any such processes\nto manage software patches and upgrades.\nPage 10 of 14\n\n\f23\n\nFor completeness, the Organisation provided the Commission with copies of its\n\nInternal Data Protection Policy and its Compliance Handbook. However, neither\ndocument sets out any processes to manage software patches and upgrades.\n24\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement processes to manage software patches and\nupgrades.\n\nFailure to implement MFA for administrator accounts\n25\n\nThe Organisation also failed to implement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\n26\n\nIn its decision in Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 published\n\non 19 May 2022 (i.e. before the Incident), the Commission made clear that MFA was\nto be implemented as a baseline requirement for accounts with access to confidential\nor sensitive personal data or large volumes of personal data:\n\n“Henceforth, the Commission adopts the following tiered approach:\n\n(a) First, 2FA / MFA should be implemented as a baseline requirement for\nadministrative accounts to systems that hold personal data of a\nconfidential or sensitive nature, or large volumes of personal data: see [46][47] above. Failure to do so can ipso facto amount to a breach, unless the\norganisation can show that its omission is reasonable or implementation of 2FA\nis disproportionate.\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\f(b) Second, remote access by privileged accounts to information systems\nthat host confidential or sensitive personal data, or large volumes of\npersonal data, should a fortiori be secured by 2FA / MFA. The risks\nconcerning remote access are higher, thus the expectation to implement 2FA /\nMFA will correspondingly increase.\n\n(c) Third, organisations using IT systems to host confidential or sensitive\npersonal data, or large volumes of personal data, are expected to enable\nand configure 2FA / MFA, if this is a feature that is available out-of-the-box.\nOmission to do so may be considered an aggravating factor.”4 (emphasis added\nin bold)\n\n27\n\nHowever, the Organisation failed to implement MFA for its administrator\n\naccounts despite these accounts having access to confidential and sensitive personal\ndata.5 The Organisation did not furnish any explanation as to why such failure was\nreasonable or that the implementation of MFA would have been disproportionate.\n\n28\n\nAccordingly, the Commission finds the Organisation in breach of the Protection\n\nObligation for its failure to implement MFA for its administrator accounts.\n\n29\n\nThe Commission notes that the present case and the first tier of the approach\n\nin Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 (reproduced at paragraph 25\nabove) deal specifically with administrator accounts. However, where an account is\n\n4\n\nSee Lovebonito Singapore Pte. Ltd. [2022] SGPDPC 3 at [51].\n“Sensitive” personal data includes, but is not limited to, NRIC/Passport numbers, financial information, and medical information.\nSee the Commission’s previous decisions in Aviva Ltd [2017] SGPDPC 14 at [17] and in Genki Sushi Singapore Pte. Ltd.

On 11 December 2022, the Personal Data Protection Commission (the\n“Commission”) received a complaint against Century Evergreen Private Limited\n(the “Organisation”) that images of identification documents (which includes the\nNational Registration Identity Card) submitted by jobseekers to the Organisation\nwere publicly accessible on the Organisation’s website (“Incident”). The\nOrganisation is a manpower contracting services company and required\njobseekers to submit their identification documents to verify the identity of and\nsuitability of the jobseeker in question.\n\n2. Following the complaint received, the Commission commenced investigations to\ndetermine the Organisation’s compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act\n2012 (“PDPA”). The Organisation requested that the investigation be handled\nunder the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure (“EDP”). This means that\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\fthe Organisation voluntarily provided and admitted to the facts set out in this\ndecision. The Organisation also admitted that it failed to implement reasonable\nsecurity arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession and control,\nand was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n3. The Organisation admitted that the Insecure Direct Object References (“IDOR”)\nvulnerability on its website, which allowed the complainant to manipulate the URL\nhad existed from the time the website was launched on 9 November 2015. As a\nresult of this vulnerability, 96,889 images of identification documents belonging to\n23,940 individuals were downloaded from the Organisation’s website from 10 to 12\nDecember 2022.\n\n4. The Organisation admitted that it was in breach of section 24(a) of the PDPA as it\nfailed to include any security requirements to protect personal data in its contract\nwith the vendor who first developed and subsequently maintained the website. In\nthis regard, even though the Organisation had engaged an IT vendor from the time\nthe website was developed and launched, the Organisation remained solely\nresponsible for protecting the personal data in its possession and control at all\nmaterial times.\n\n5. What is expected from organisations who engage professional services to build\ntheir websites and other online portals is explained in the Commission’s Guide on\nBuilding Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) (the “Guide”). The Commission\nhad consistently advised organisations of the need to emphasise the protection of\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\fpersonal data to their IT vendors, by making it part of their contractual terms.1 The\ncontract should clearly state the responsibilities of the IT vendor with respect to the\nPDPA. In this regard, the Commission noted that there was a glaring omission of\nclauses to protect personal data in the Organisation’s contract with its IT vendor.\n\n6. The Organisation also admitted that apart from conducting functionality testing\nwhen the website was first launched, the Organisation had no arrangements with\nits IT vendor to conduct any security tests prior to the launch of the website, or\nthereafter. The Organisation had also failed to impose any security requirements\non the IT vendor to protect personal data, via contract.\n\n7. In view of the above, the Deputy Commissioner found that the Organisation had\ncontravened section 24(a) of the PDPA.\n\n8. In deciding the appropriate outcome in this case, the Commission considered that\na financial penalty ought to be imposed as the personal data affected included not\njust the identification numbers, but the images of the identification documents.\nFurthermore, there was a long period of non-compliance. The vulnerability was not\naddressed since 2015.\n\n9. In deciding on the appropriate amount of financial penalty, the circumstances set\nout above and the factors listed at section 48J(6) of the PDPA were considered,\nspecifically the impact of the personal data breach on the individuals affected and\nthe nature of the Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA. In the\ncircumstances, this was not an insignificant breach given the number of individuals\n\n1\n\nSee Guide on Building Websites for SMEs (revised 10 July 2018) at [4.2.1] and Re EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019]\nSGPDPC 38.\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\faffected (ie 23,940) and the nature of personal data exfiltrated: 96,889 images of\nidentification documents.\n10. The Organisation’s non-compliance with the PDPA was also not simply one of\nmere negligence but that of gross negligence. There was a long period of noncompliance on the facts of this case. As set out above, the Commission had issued\nthe Guide to assist SMEs, and consistently cautioned the need for organisations\nto ensure compliance with the PDPA even when they engage an IT vendor in our\nprevious decisions.2\n\n11. In deciding on the appropriate amount of the financial penalty, the following factors\nwere considered – the Organisation’s turnover and profitability, its cooperation\nthroughout the investigation, its voluntary admission of breach of the Protection\nObligation under the EDP, and the prompt remedial actions taken after the\nOrganisation became aware of the IDOR vulnerability. This included rectifying the\nIDOR vulnerability, making server configuration changes to improve security,\nimplementing vulnerability scans, migrating its backup server to an encrypted\nremote server, deploying additional security software and subscription to security\nservices, and securing a new contract with its vendor to manage the security of its\nwebsite. In addition to its prompt remedial actions, its poor performance in the most\nrecent financial year was also taken into consideration. Finally, the organisation\nhad admitted to its culpability at an early stage and elected to proceed under the\nEDP.\n\n2\n\nRe EU Holidays Pte Ltd [2019] SGPDPC 38 and Re Vhive Pte Ltd (Case No. DP-2013-B8138).\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\f12. For the reasons above, the Deputy Commissioner for Personal Data Protection\nhereby finds the Organisation in breach and directs the Organisation to pay a\nfinancial penalty of S$9,000 within 30 days from the notice accompanying date of\nthis decision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in\nrespect of judgement debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount\nof such financial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nThe following section of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 had been cited in the\nabove summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation shall protect personal data in its possession or under its control\nby making reasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or\nsimilar risks; and\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty"},{"description":"A financial penalty of $3,000 was imposed on Autobahn Rent A Car for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect the personal data in its possession or under its control.

Ltd.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE DECISION\n\n1\n\nOn 21 October 2022, Autobahn Rent A Car Pte. Ltd. (the “Organisation”)\n\nnotified the Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) of a personal\ndata breach (the “Incident”).\n\n2\n\nThe Organisation operates a car-sharing service, Shariot, in Singapore. On 24\n\nSeptember 2022, the Organisation received customer feedback that a photograph on\nits mobile application had been replaced with a pornographic photograph. The\nOrganisation discovered that the pornographic photograph had been uploaded\nthrough an unrevoked administrator account belonging to an ex-employee, who had\nPage 1 of 6\n\n\fleft the Organisation in May 2022. The ex-employee received an email from an\nunknown sender on 10 September 2022 stating that his personal laptop had been\nhacked and demanding Bitcoins as ransom payment. The threat actor was able to log\ninto the Shariot’s mobile application administrator portal through the administrator\naccount belonging to the ex-employee, and used the export CSV function to download\na copy of the Shariot’s users personal data.\n\n3\n\nSubsequently, on 21 October 2022, a cybersecurity solutions provider alerted\n\nthe Organisation of a cybercrime forum post offering the sale of a Shariot database\ncontaining personal data. The Commission commenced investigations to determine\nwhether the Incident disclosed any breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012\n(“PDPA”) by the Organisation.\n\n4\n\nThe Organisation requested, and the Commission agreed, for this matter to\n\nproceed under the Expedited Decision Breach Procedure. To this end, the\nOrganisation voluntarily and unequivocally admitted to the facts set out in this decision.\nIt admitted to a breach of the Protection Obligation under Section 24 of the PDPA.\n\n5\n\nThe Organisation’s internal investigations discovered that compromise of the\n\ndormant administrator account credentials enabled the unauthorised access to Shariot\nbackend admin web portal, leading to the exfiltration of 53,000 personal data sets of\nShariot users. The personal data that were affected in the Incident included names,\n\nPage 2 of 6\n\n\femail addresses, mobile phone numbers, NRIC numbers and general location data\n(e.g. Bishan, Toa Payoh or Orchard).\n\n6\n\nFollowing the Incident, the Organisation took the following remedial action:\n(a)\n\nImmediately conducted an internal audit of its administrator accounts to\n\nensure that any employee access that was not required was revoked;\n(b)\n\nEnhanced its software code and admin panel user interface to mask\n\ndisplayed or exported NRIC numbers to show only the last 4 characters; and\n(c)\n\nConducted cyber hygiene and awareness training for all staff handling\n\npersonal data.\n\n7\n\nThe Organisation admitted that it had failed to ensure it had reasonable security\n\narrangements in place to prevent the unauthorized access or disclosure of the\npersonal data in its possession or control, as it failed to implement and ensure\nreasonable access control to its backend admin web portal. First, the Organisation\nfailed to revoke the login credentials of an administrator account belonging to an exemployee once the employment relationship came to an end in May 2022. As a result,\nthe ex-employee’s administrator login credentials remained active, which – when\ncompromised – enabled the malicious actor access into its network.\n\n8\n\nSecond, the Organisation also admitted that the Incident would not have\n\nhappened if it had implemented multi-factor authentication (“MFA”) as an additional\nPage 3 of 6\n\n\faccess control for its administrator accounts that had access to its sizeable user\ndatabase. In Re Lovebonito [2022] SGPDPC 3, the Commission had highlighted the\nneed for organisations to strengthen access control, through the use of a one-time\npassword (“OTP”) or 2FA/MFA, to such accounts. Indeed, regardless of whether an\naccount is an administrative account, once an account is granted access rights to a\ndatabase containing sensitive personal data records or a significant volume of\npersonal data that would adversely impact the affected individuals in the event of a\npersonal data breach, we would encourage organisations to consider implementing\nenhanced access controls to the account such as through the use of a OTP or\n2FA/MFA to better safeguard the personal data.\n\n9\n\nFor the above reasons, the Organisation was determined to have breached the\n\nProtection Obligation.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner’s Decision\n10\n\nIn determining whether the Organisation should be required to pay a financial\n\npenalty under Section 48J of the PDPA or if directions would suffice, I considered that\na financial penalty was appropriate as the personal data breach was not insignificant.\nIn deciding the appropriate financial penalty amount, I first considered all the relevant\nfactors listed at Section 48J(6) of the PDPA, in particular, the impact of the personal\ndata breach on the individuals affected and the nature of Organisation’s noncompliance with the PDPA. In this regard, while the NRIC numbers and general\n\nPage 4 of 6\n\n\flocation data was affected, this is less serious than if the NRIC images and specific\nGPS location had been disclosed.\n\n11\n\nIn deciding what would be the appropriate financial penalty amount, I also\n\nconsidered the organisation’s turnover to arrive at a figure that would, in my mind, be\na proportionate and effective amount, to ensure compliance and deter non-compliance\nwith the PDPA. On the facts of this particular case, the organisation’s turnover has\nbeen taken into consideration to arrive at a proportionate and effective financial\npenalty. I also considered the following mitigating factors, which led to a further\nreduction in the financial penalty:\n(a)\n\nThe Organisation was cooperative during the course of our\n\ninvestigations;\n(b)\n\nThe Organisation voluntarily admitted to breach of the Protection\n\nObligation under the Commission’s Expedited Decision Procedure; and\n(c)\n\nThe Organisation took prompt remedial actions following discovery of\n\nthe Incident.\n\n12\n\nFor the reasons above, I hereby require the Organisation to pay a financial\n\npenalty of $3,000 within 30 days of the date of the relevant notices accompanying this\ndecision, failing which interest at the rate specified in the Rules of Court in respect of\njudgment debts shall accrue and be payable on the outstanding amount of such\nfinancial penalty until the financial penalty is paid in full.\n\nPage 5 of 6\n\n\f13\n\nIn addition to the financial penalty imposed, the Organisation is also directed to\n\ndo the following:\n(a)\n\nImplement processes for systems and applications revocation within a\n\nreasonable window of cessation of need for access by an employee;\n(b)\n\nStrengthen access controls measures to administrator accounts with\n\naccess to databases holding personal data;\n(c)\n\nConduct reasonable security review of technical and administrative\n\narrangements for the protection of personal data in possession or under control\nof the Organisation within 60 days of the date of this Direction;\n(d)\n\nRectify any security gaps identified in the security review directed above;\n\nand\n(e)\n\nInform the Commission within 1 week of the completion on the steps\n\ndirected above.\n\nThe following are the provision of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 cited in the above summary:\nProtection of personal data\n24. An organisation must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making\nreasonable security arrangements to prevent –\n(a) unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification or disposal or similar risks\nand;\n(b) the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.\n\nPage 6 of 6\n\n\f","decision":"Financial Penalty, Directions"}]
