The server hosting the VPN had not been patched, and the same credentials were used to access both the File Server and the VPN .  \nRemedial Actions\nAfter the incident, as part of a remediation plan, DLIAP :\n(a) Implemented multi-factor authentication to strengthen VPN login; \n(b) Implemented different user accounts for VPN and File Server access;\n(c) Implemented a virtual desktop for its IT vendor with activity monitoring;\n(d) Engaged a security consultant to review its current IT infrastructure and propose enhancements; \n(e) Implemented additional security monitoring by a different IT vendor;\n(f) Improved patch update & management processes;\n(g) Established thorough file management rules for cloud storage of data;\n(h) Implemented email rules including password rules for attachments; and\n(i) Implemented compliance training for DLIAP’s employees;\nUndertaking\nThe Commission recognises that DLIAP has made efforts to address the concerns raised in this case and to improve its personal data protection practices. Having considered the circumstances of the case, the Commission accepted an undertaking from DLIAP to improve its compliance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012. The undertaking was executed on 22 December 2020 (the “Undertaking”). \nThe Undertaking provided that DLIAP was to complete implementation of its remediation plan by reviewing its internal policies relating to the handling of personal information.\nDLIAP has since updated the Commission that implementation of its remediation plan has been completed.

Of these 456,868 individuals, 165 had\npreviously requested for their account to be terminated\n\n2.\n\nThe incident was attributed to human error by an employee who had\nerroneously made the wrong selection in the Organisation’s system.\n\n6\n\n\fSCHEDULE B\n\n7\n\n\fMeasure\n\nStatus/ Owner\n/ Timeline\nRoot Cause 1: Human error in the Campaign setup – “dispatch method” on Vendor’s Platform was erroneously changed by a\nZALORA employee. The employee also (i) failed to ensure the correct audience subset was selected; and (ii) failed to double check\nthe dispatch method settings when an alert message appeared informing her that changes to the dispatch method settings had been\nmade.\n1\n\nRemediation\n\nDescription\n\nEnhance Vendor’s Platform user SOP Enhancements\nand training.\n Updates to SOPs arising from Measures 2 - 4 below\nNote: After the incident, the Head of\nCRM decided to reevaluate whether  Reminding and offering refresher courses to all team\nthe current SOP and Training is\nmembers\nsufficient.\nAll previous training material is readily available, and senior\nAs the SOP and Training for Vendor’s members of the team are well equipped to train and guide\nPlatform was evaluated to already be junior members.\nrigorous and effective, minimal\nenhancements were made.\nExisting SOP and Training prior to incident:\nAll Vendor’s Platform users at ZALORA need to complete:\n\n\nVendor’s Platform courses (platform training courses to\nfamiliarize themselves with key features of the platform)\n\n\n\nFive 3-hour training sessions with senior members to\nunderstand the purpose of the function and function\nspecific setup requirements.\n\n\n\nA short exercise that tests new members’ comprehension\nof topics taught at the end of every session.\n\nAfter completion of these 3 points, the following takes place as\nthe new joiners are getting familiar with their roles:\n\n8\n\nStatus: Done\non 10\nSeptember\n2021.\nOwner: CRM\n\n\f2\n\nCustom code nested in email HTML\n\n\n\nTraining SOP and materials are shared with all members\nas a form of reference.\n\n\n\nSenior members vet through campaigns created by junior\nmembers until they are able to execute them\nindependently.\n\n\n\nKey information is reiterated throughout the training and\nonboarding process. This includes:\n Ensuring proof test sends are only sent to internal\nusers\n Testing all communication before actual roll-out\n Checking through all parts of the campaign setup on\nVendor’s Platform before launch\n Ensuring no roll-outs of any magnitude on any day\nbefore a period of long breaks (e.g. Friday, eve of\npublic holidays) so that any errors can be picked up\nand rectified in a timely manner\n Actively monitoring campaign send size and live\nemails post launch\n\nChanges in processes are also updated in individual functions’\nSOP and all relevant team members are informed\nThis custom code restricts email templates to be used only\nfor:\n- Users from specific countries\n- Activated via a specific delivery method\nThis bypasses the limitation of the Vendor’s platform\nguardrails. If an email template was selected for the user of\nanother country (e.g. Malaysia) outside the intended country\n(e.g. Singapore) or delivery method, the email cannot be\nsent. This would mitigate the risk of another mass sending of\nemails to databases of all countries.\n\n9\n\nStatus: Done\non 13\nSeptember\n2021\nOwner: CRM\n\n\f3\n\n4\n\nSend rate throttling – limiting number\nof emails per hour by campaign type\n\nCustom alert sent to CRM chat group\non Vendor’s Platform when campaign\nchanges are made on Vendor’s\nPlatform\n\nThis was applied to all email types for good measure.\nAn individual setting for each campaign was implemented to\ncap the number of emails that can be sent per hour.\nCampaigns such as “Account Registration” would not have\nhigh volumes per hour. Thus if ZALORA detects abnormal\nactivity, we will be able to stem the issue and limit the\naffected\naudiences.\nThis was applied to all email types for good measure.\nThis custom alert was created by ZALORA to extract\ninformation from Vendor’s Platform when a campaign change\nis made.\nThis alert system (which is a dedicated CRM chat group on\nVendor’s Platform) is available to the CRM team to check\nwhich campaigns have undergone a change, and the CRM\nteam can intervene when an unintended change appears to\nhave been made.\n\n5\n\nVendor platform enhancement\nrequests\n\nMade 4 key system enhancement requests to Vendor’s\nPlatform. However, this is subject to discussion and\ndevelopment dependency on the part of Vendor’s Platform.\n\n10\n\nStatus: Done\non 20\nSeptember\n2021\nOwner: CRM\n\nStatus: Done\non 13\nSeptember\n2021\nOwner: CRM\n\nZALORA has\nreached out\nto Vendor with\nproposed\nimprovements,\nand this has\nbeen escalated\nto their HQ.\n\n\fRoot Cause 2: Accidental retention of 165 individuals’ email addresses on ZALORA’s backend system (out of which 18 belong to\nour Singapore database) - This occurred due to a technical error in the implementation of the Data Anonymisation feature for\nZALORA’s backend system in May 2020 to capture and anonymise 1 database table containing email addresses.\n1\n\nReview and fix Data Anonymisation\nZALORA’s Tech team conducted a comprehensive review of\nfeature on ZALORA’s backend system the Data Anonymisation feature on ZALORA’s backend\nsystem and its downstream systems. In particular to:\n Investigate to identify if there are any discrepancies in\nZALORA’s backend system and downstream systems to\nensure that the anonymisation is effective.\n In case of mismatch or any redundant data found, clean\nup the said data and set up an automated cleanup job.\nWe have confirmed that:\na) the root cause was the single database table within\nZALORA’s backend system which inadvertently fell\noutside the scope of the Data Anonymisation feature,\nand once this technical error has been rectified there will\nnot be any discrepancy in downstream systems as the\nanonymization methodology is effective;\nb) all anonymisation action taken on ZALORA’s backend\nsystem prior to adoption of new feature in May 2020 was\nproperly implemented; and\nc) this issue has now been fully rectified and all account\ndeletion requests will be properly attended to by way of\nthe Data Anonymisation feature on ZALORA’s backend\nsystem.\n\nStatus: Fix of\nData\nAnonymisation\nfeature\ncompleted on\n22 Sept\n2021. This is\nnow rectified\nand fully\nresolved.\nOwner: Tech\n\nRoot Cause 3: Retention of email addresses of individuals who had unsubscribed to our newsletter and do not have a Customer\naccount with ZALORA - These email addresses were retained by ZALORA for business purposes, but ZALORA acknowledges the\nrisks arising out of such retention and has re-evaluated the need to retain such email addresses on a nonanonymised basis\n\n11\n\n\f1\n\nCRM, CS and Tech will work together\nto manually anonymise on ZALORA’s\nbackend system the\nemail addresses of Unsubscribed\nUsers who fulfill the following criteria:\n1) have unsubscribed from\nNewsletter;\n2) do not have a Customer account\nwith ZALORA; and\n3) have been on unsubscribed status\nfor 30 days.\n\nAll email addresses belonging to Unsubscribed Users who\nfulfil the criteria with:\n(a) ZALORA Singapore have been anonymized manually by\nCRM, CS and Tech team as at 21 October 2021; and\n(b) ZALORA regionally (other than Singapore) will be\nanonymised manually by CRM, CS and Tech team by the\nend of October 2021.\nWith the anonymisation of such email addresses, we are\nof the view that the retention risk has and will be\nsignificantly mitigated.\n\nStatus: This\nprocess has\nbeen\nimplemented\nfor ZALORA\nSingapore on\n21 October\n2021 and will\nbe\nimplemented\nfor ZALORA\nregionally\n(other than\nSingapore) by\nthe end of\nOctober 2021.\nThis process\nwill continue\nmanually until\nthe automated\nprocess (see\nmeasure 2) is\nin place\n\n2\n\nOwner: CRM x\nCS x Tech\nTech will develop and implement an This automated feature to be developed and implemented will Owner: Tech\nautomated feature and process in the remove the need for a manual process (see measure 1) and\nZALORA’s backend system to trigger mitigate any missed emails or human error.\nTimeline: To\nthe\ndevelop and\nanonymisation of email addresses\nimplement\nbelonging to Unsubscribed Users\nautomated\nwho fulfil the following criteria:\n\n12\n\n\fprocess by end\nof Q1 2022\n\n1) have unsubscribed from\nNewsletter;\n2) do not have a Customer account\nwith ZALORA; and\n3) have been on unsubscribed status\nfor 30 days.\n\n13\n\n\f"},{"id":"17","organisation":"Singhealth Polyclinics","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Undertakings/Undertaking-by-SingHealth-Polyclinics","timestamp":"2022-06-16","raw-description":"<div class=\"rte\">\r\n                <h3>Background </h3>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) was notified by Singhealth Polyclinics (“SHP”) on 31 May 2021 that its courier service provider had misplaced a package containing the GIRO applications forms submitted by its patients.

The lost package, intended to be delivered to a bank\non, contained GIRO application forms submitted to the Organisation for\nprocessing.\n\n2.\n\nThe Organisation did not discover the loss promptly due to inadequate\nprocesses to confirm completion of package deliveries with its courier service\nprovider. The incident was only discovered 3 weeks when the Organisation\nchecked with the bank on the status of the GIRO applications.\n\n3.\n\nAs a result of the loss of the package, the personal data of the Organisation’s\n87 individuals including their name, telephone number, NRIC number, bank\naccount number and transaction payment limits were compromised.\n\nPage 5 of 7\n\n\fSCHEDULE B\n1\n\nCauses of Incident\n\nRemediation Plan\n\nSHP does not\nrequire any explicit\nconfirmation for\nsuccessful deliveries\nof all packages.\n\nA process review had been conducted and with\neffect from 30 June 2021, all packages with\nconfidential information (including personal data) will\nrequire the use of [type of courier companies\nredacted for confidentiality] courier companies that\nutilise an online tracking system. Approved courier\ncompanies would have entered into Master\nAgreements for the delivery of the relevant courier\nservices, which would include relevant obligations\non the service provider to comply with personal data\nprotection obligations.\nAll SHP departmental representatives were briefed\non the new workflow with a walkthrough of the\nonline tracking system used by the approved courier\ncompanies. The confirmation of delivery will be\nalmost in real time where SHP users can determine\nthe delivery status of the dispatched packages\nonline.\n\nThe incident was also shared with all SHP\ndepartments and their PDPA coordinators for\nawareness and learning.\n2\n\nVroom’s internal\nverification process\nwas not robust as\nthey implemented\nmanual tracking of\nconsignment notes.\nThe window for the\ndiscovery of lost\nparcels was also too\nlong, with SHP only\nreceiving\nconfirmation three\n(3) weeks after the\nincident.\n\nTarget\nCompletion\nProcess review\ncompleted as of\n30 June 2021.\nUse of [type of\ncourier\ncompanies\nredacted for\nconfidentiality]\ncourier\ncompanies that\nutilise an online\ntracking system\n– ongoing.\nPost-review\nfollow-up\nsession with\nSHP\ndepartmental\nrepresentatives\non courier\ncompanies\nscheduled for\nSeptember\n2021.\nCompleted as of\n1 July 2021.\n\nSHP has rolled out [business process redacted for\nconfidentiality] at its clinics, which eliminates the\nneed to courier patients’ or their next-of-kin’s [type of\ndocument redacted for confidentiality], thereby\nremoving the risk of such loss. In this regard, it will\nnot be necessary to engage courier companies to\ndeliver parcels with personal data.\nSHP has plans to roll out [business process\nredacted for confidentiality] at all clinics. This can\nfurther reduce the risk of losing the hardcopy\ndocuments during transmission.\n\nCompleted as of\n31 May 2021.\n\nIn situations where [business process redacted for\nconfidentiality] is inapplicable, SHP will engage\ncourier companies with a more robust verification\nprocess for the delivery of parcels that contain\npersonal data.\n\nProcess review\ncompleted as of\n30 June 2021.\n\nOngoing – by\nend 1st half of\n2022.\n\nUse of [type of\ncourier\ncompanies\nredacted for\n\nPage 6 of 7\n\n\fAs stated in Item (1) above, SHP will only engage\n[type of courier companies redacted for\nconfidentiality] courier companies that implement an\nelectronic / online tracking system that allows for an\nalmost real-time status update for the confirmation of\npackage deliveries on the same day.\n\nTo enhance the follow-up confirmation process,\nSHP worked with [name of financial institution\nredacted for confidentiality] such that [name of\nfinancial institution redacted for confidentiality] has\nto provide written acknowledgement of receipt of\nany SHP parcel within the next working day.\n\nconfidentiality]\ncourier\ncompanies that\nutilise an online\ntracking system\n– ongoing.\nPost-review\nfollow-up\nsession with\nSHP\ndepartmental\nrepresentatives\non courier\ncompanies\nscheduled for\nSeptember\n2021.\nCompleted as of\n11 June 2021.\n\nPage 7 of 7\n\n\f"},{"id":"18","organisation":"HSL Constructor Pte Ltd","url":"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Undertakings/Undertaking%20by%20HSL%20Constructor%20Pte%20Ltd","timestamp":"2022-07-14","raw-description":"<div class=\"rte\">\r\n                <h3>Background </h3>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Personal Data Protection Commission (the “Commission”) was notified by HSL Constructor Pte Ltd (“HSL”) on 7 October 2021 that it was subject to ransomware attack on 30 September 2021.

As a result, the personal data of 87,824 customers including their name,\naddress, email address, telephone number, and transaction information was\nencrypted. In addition, the data of another 128 employees, including their\nname, business email address, and user ID and password for internal\nsoftware accounts was also encrypted. There was no evidence of any\nexfiltration of personal data.\n3.

(“i-vic).</p>\n<p>Investigations revealed that an employee of i-vic had most likely fallen prey to a phishing attack. As a result, a malicious actor successfully downloaded the personal data belonging to 31,002 individuals, from 2 email accounts belonging to the i-vic employee (the “Incident”).The personal data affected included the individuals’ partial or full NRIC, date of birth, telephone number, email address, residential address, highest qualification, and employment details.</p>\nFurther investigations found that i-vic had reasonable security measures in place to protect the personal data that it processes on behalf of e2i. i-vic had anti-virus protection, anti-phishing protection, regular anti-virus scans, security audits and conducted regular patches for its IT system.

Ltd. on 25 March 2021 of a personal data breach involving its contact centre and data intermediary, i-vic International Pte. Ltd. (“i-vic).\nInvestigations revealed that an employee of i-vic had most likely fallen prey to a phishing attack. As a result, a malicious actor successfully downloaded the personal data belonging to 31,002 individuals, from 2 email accounts belonging to the i-vic employee (the “Incident”).The personal data affected included the individuals’ partial or full NRIC, date of birth, telephone number, email address, residential address, highest qualification, and employment details.\nFurther investigations found that i-vic had reasonable security measures in place to protect the personal data that it processes on behalf of e2i. i-vic had anti-virus protection, anti-phishing protection, regular anti-virus scans, security audits and conducted regular patches for its IT system. In fact, i-vic had existing anti-malware software which should have been able to detect the particular malware used in the Incident, but somehow failed to do so. After the Incident, i-vic purchased and deployed additional anti-malware software. Finally, the Commission found that i-vic had comprehensive policies and guidelines in place to protect personal data.\nWhile i-vic had reasonable security arrangements in place to protect the personal data it processes, the Commission established that this was entirely on i-vic’s account and not because of e2i’s bidding. e2i had failed to stipulate any specific data protection requirements on i-vic in their contract. e2i also lacked sufficiently robust processes to protect the personal data in its possession or control. i-vic produced evidence of several occasions where e2i’s employees had sent personal data to i-vic without any encryption or protection, which was against e2i’s standard operating procedures.\nCase No. DP-2106-B8424\nA complainant alerted the Commission of a personal data breach involving e2i’s website on 21 June 2021. e2i's website had been designed in such a way that it would automatically populate and display all the data fields e2i had of an individual in its possession without the need for further authentication once an individual's NRIC number is keyed in to access e2i's website and register for a course, talk, or event.

Ltd. (\"e2i\"). When an\nindividual registers for a course, talk or event organised by e2i on e2i’s website,\nthe website would automatically populate and display an individual’s personal\ndata once an individual’s NRIC number is inserted into the website. If an\nindividual uses the person’s NRIC number on e2i’s website, there would be the\nrisk of unauthorised disclosure of personal data by e2i if such use had not been\nduly authorised.\n\n2.\n\nAs a result, the personal data of 102,151 individuals’ was at risk of a potential\npersonal data breach. The types of personal data affected included the\nfollowing:\ni) Name\nii) Citizenship\niii) Union member status\niv) Gender\nv) Race\nvi) Highest education level\nvii) Unemployed since\nviii) Unemployment duration (months)\nix) Reason for unemployment\nx) Education level detail (field of study, qualification name/title, institution, date\nof completion)\nxi) Work experience (From, to, company name, industry, job title, job duties,\nmasked last drawn salary/month)\nxii) Background and health (Ex-offender, bankruptcy, color blindness, medical\nillness, drug abuse)\nxiii) Partially masked NRIC\nxiv) Partially masked date of birth\nxv) Partially masked email address\nxvi) Partially masked postal code\nxvii) Partially masked contact number (Home/HP)\n\n3.\n\nThe PDPC notes that there was no evidence of exfiltration of the personal data.\n\n6\n\n\fDP-2103-B8132\n1.\n\nOn 25 March 2021, the PDPC received a data breach notification from e2i,\nwhich involved its outsourced contact centre, i-vic International Pte. Ltd. (“ivic”). Personal data from 2 email accounts of an i-vic employee was\ndownloaded by a malicious actor. It was found that i-vic had put in place\nreasonable security arrangements despite the data breach.\n\n2.\n\nHowever, it was found that e2i had failed to stipulate reasonable data protection\nrequirements when selecting i-vic as its data intermediary, and in its contract\nwith i-vic. It was also found that e2i lacked sufficiently robust processes to\nprotect personal data during transmission. There were at least 18 occasions\nwhere e2i’s employees had sent large volumes of personal data to i-vic without\nprotection.\n\n3.\n\nThe personal data of 31,002 individuals’ was downloaded by a malicious actor\nin the incident. The types of personal data affected included the following:\ni)\nNRIC\nii)\nPartial NRIC Number\niii)\nDate of Birth\niv)\nMobile Number\nv)\nLandline\nvi)\nEmail Address\nvii)\nResidential Address\nviii)\nHighest Qualification\nix)\nEmployment Details – containing salary, employment status, occupation\nor company name\n\n7\n\n\fSCHEDULE B\n\n8\n\n\fREMEDIATION PLAN\nA.
