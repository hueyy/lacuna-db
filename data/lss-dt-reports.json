Following the dissolution of the Complainant’s marriage, the Respondent filed a summons to vary the divorce order (the Variation Summons). The Respondent failed to attend the scheduled Case Conference for the Variation Summons. As a result, the Variation Summons never proceeded to any further hearing, and the divorce order was never varied. Thereafter, the Complainant appointed a new set of solicitors (the new solicitors) to take over conduct of the matter from the Respondent’s firm. The new solicitors wrote to the Respondent’s firm seeking an urgent handover of documents in the Respondent’s possession. Despite repeated reminders, the Respondent’s firm failed to handover any documents to the new solicitors, leading to the new solicitors filing an Originating Summons seeking orders for the Respondent to deliver up to the Complainant all information and documents.

The DT found that the Second Charge had been made out in that the Respondent’s conduct was in breach of Rules 5(2)(c) and 5(2)(e) of the PCR, and amounted to improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) of the Act, and there was cause for sufficient gravity The DT was satisfied that the Third Charge was made out, and that the Respondent’s conduct was in breach of Rules 5(2)(e), 5(2)(f) and/or 7(2) of the PCR amounting to improper conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Act, and there was cause for sufficient gravity. The DT also ordered the Respondent to pay costs to the Law Society fixed at $8,000 plus reasonable disbursements.\n\nCourt of Three Judges\n\nThe Court of Three Judges ordered that the Respondent be suspended from practice for a period of four years commencing immediately after the conclusion of the Respondent’s six-month suspension ordered in C3J/OA 1/2023, and for the Respondent to pay costs and disbursements to the Law Society in the sum of S$20,500.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n\n\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jan_25_Johnny_Seah_DT_report_compressed.pdf","pdf-content":"DT 16 OF 2022\nIN THE MATTER OF SEAH CHOON HUAT JOHNNY,\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n(CHAPTER 161)\n\nDECISION OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal\nMr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC – President\nMr G Radakrishnan – Member\n\nCounsel for the Law Society\n\nCounsel for the Respondent\n\nMs Jill Ann Koh\nWongPartnership LLP\n12 Marina Boulevard Level 28\nMarina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3\nSingapore 018982\n\nRespondent acting in person\n\nDated this27thday of April 2023\n\n\fDT 16/2022\n\nBetween\n\nTHE LAW SOCIETY OF SINGAPORE\n(No ID Exists)\n… Applicant\nAnd\n\nSEAH CHOON HUAT JOHNNY\n… Respondent\n\nTHE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL’S DECISION\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nOn 25 March 2021, Mdm Tan Hong Kiang (“Mdm Tan”) lodged a complaint under\n\nSection 85(1) of the Legal Profession Act 1996 (“LPA”) with the Applicant, The Law Society\nof Singapore. Mdm Tan’s complaint (“Complaint”) was against her former solicitor, the\nRespondent, Mr Seah Choon Huat Johnny, who acted for Mdm Tan in her divorce\nproceedings. At all material times, the Respondent practiced as a sole proprietor under the\nlaw firm Seah & Co. The Respondent, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, was called to the Singapore Bar on 14 January 1981.\n\n2.\n\nOn 22 July 2022, the present Disciplinary Tribunal was appointed. Based on the\n\nComplaint, the Applicant brought 3 main charges against the Respondent. The 3 main charges\nare reproduced below:\n\n2\n\n\fa)\n\nThe First Charge:\n“You, Seah Choon Huat Johnny, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of Singapore, are charged that you did act in breach of Rule 5(2)(c), Rule\n5(2)(e), Rule 5(2)(f) and/or Rule 5(2)(h) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015, in that you had failed to act timeously on the instructions\nof your client, one Mdm Tan Hong Kiang (the “Complainant”) to vary the Order\nof Court in FC/ORC 13/2015 (“ORC 13”), and to keep the Complainant\nreasonably informed of the progress of her application to vary ORC 13, and\nyou are thereby guilty of grossly improper conduct or improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act 1966.”\n\nb)\n\nThe Second Charge:\n\n“You, Seah Choon Huat Johnny, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of Singapore, are charged that you did act in breach of Rule 5(2)(c)\nand/or Rule 5(2)(e) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015,\nin that you had failed to attend the Case Conference for FC/SUM 4075/2016 in\nD 1079/2013 on 22 December 2016 10 January 2017 without reasonable\njustification or notice to the Complainant, and you are thereby guilty of grossly\nimproper conduct or improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor\nunder Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1966.” [as amended]\n\nc)\n\nThe Third Charge:\n\n“You, Seah Choon Huat Johnny, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of Singapore, are charged that you did act in breach of Rule 5(2)(c), Rule\n3\n\n\f5(2)(e), Rule 5(2)(f) and/or Rule 7(2) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015, in that you had failed to respond to and/or comply with\nTan, Oei & Oei LLC’s repeated requests to take over conduct of D 1079/2013,\nand you are thereby guilty of grossly improper conduct or improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act 1966.”\n\n3.\n\nFor each of the above 3 main charges, the Applicant brought 3 respective alternative\n\ncharges reflecting the substance of the misconduct alleged in the main charges, save that the\nalternative charges were framed for the same alleged misconduct under another subsection,\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA. Section 83(2)(h) concerns conduct that is “unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession”.\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 November 2022, by consent, the Tribunal allowed the Applicant’s amendment of\n\nthe Second Charge (and the second alternative charge), to change the date of the Case\nConference the Respondent allegedly failed to attend, from 22 December 2016 to 10 January\n2017. To that end, the Applicant filed its Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) dated 3\nNovember 2022 containing the amended second main and alternative charge.\n\n5.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, a full day evidentiary hearing (“Hearing”) was conducted. The\n\nApplicant’s sole witness was the complainant Mdm Tan, while the Respondent’s sole witness\nwas himself.\n\n6.\n\nAt the time of the Hearing, Mdm Tan was an Associate in Mizuho Bank’s treasury\n\ndepartment. Her highest qualification was GCE “O” Levels.\n\nBackground facts\n\n4\n\n\f7.\n\nThe solicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and Mdm Tan began in 2013.\n\nIn that year, Mdm Tan appointed the Respondent, through his law firm Seah & Co., to act for\nher in her divorce proceedings in D 1079/2013 (“Divorce Suit”) against her ex-husband, Mr\nSng Leong Chye (“Mr Sng”).1\n\n8.\n\nOn 23 August 2013, Mdm Tan obtained interim judgment (“Interim Judgment”)\n\nagainst Mr Sng in the Divorce Suit under which, the Subordinate Courts dissolved the marriage\nbetween Mdm Tan and Mr Sng. This paved the way for Mdm Tan and Mr Sng to deal with the\nancillary matters relating to their divorce, which included, among other matters, the issue of\nthe division of their matrimonial Housing Development Board (“HDB”) flat at Block 97 Geylang\nBahru, #08-3178, Singapore 330097 (“Flat”).\n\n9.\n\nThe proceeds from the sale of the Flat forms the foundation of Mdm Tan’s Complaint\n\nagainst the Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nBy an Order of Court No. FC/ORC 13/2015 (“ORC 13”) dated 28 November 2014,2 the\n\nFamily Justice Courts (“FJC”) made the following orders for division of the Flat. First, under\nparagraph 3(e) of the order, within 9 months of the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment,\nMr Sng was to transfer all his rights, title and interest in the Flat to Mdm Tan upon payment by\nMdm Tan to Mr Sng of a sum equivalent to 7% of the net value of the Flat. Second, under\nparagraph 3(f) of the order, in the event the said transfer was not made within 9 months of the\ndate of the Certificate of Final Judgment, the Flat should be sold in the open market to the\nhighest bidder within the next 9 months. In which event, the FJC also ordered that (at\nparagraph 3(f)):\n\na)\n\n“The net sale proceeds… shall be divided in the proportion of 93% (ninety-three\nper cent) to [Mdm Tan] and 7% (seven per cent) to [Mr Sng]”;\n\n5\n\n\fb)\n\n“From their share of the net sale proceeds, the parties shall refund to his [sic]\nCPF account all the monies utilized for the purchase of the flat together with\naccrued interest”; and\n\nc)\n\n11.\n\n“The Plaintiff shall have sole conduct of sale of the matrimonial flat”.\n\nOn 13 January 2015, the FJC issued the Certificate of Final Judgment making the\n\nInterim Judgment granted on 23 July 2013 final.3\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent, through Seah & Co., acted for Mdm Tan in the sale of the Flat. The\n\nFlat was eventually sold on the open market for S$448,000. The net proceeds from the sale\namounted to S$436,162.80, after deduction of the agent’s fee and legal costs.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with ORC 13, both Mdm Tan and Mr Sng were required, from their share\n\nof the sale proceeds, to refund to their respective Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts all\nmonies utilised for the purchase of Flat plus accrued interest on those monies.\n\n14.\n\nIn terms of entitlement to the sale proceeds based on the proportion ordered in ORC\n\n13, Mr Sng was to receive only the sum of S$30,531.40, being 7% of the net sale proceeds of\nS$436,162.80. Mdm Tan was to receive the remaining amount.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, in the process of the sale of the Flat, an issue arose in respect of the amount\n\nMr Sng had to refund to his CPF account for the CPF monies he had used for the purchase\nof the Flat plus accrued interest. HDB informed the parties that the amount Mr Sng had to\nrefund to his CPF account was significantly more than his entitlement to the net sale proceeds\naccording to ORC 13.\n\n16.\n\nIn the period between August 2015 to December 2015, numerous letters were\n\n6\n\n\fexchanged between Seah & Co. and HDB, and Seah & Co. and the CPF Board (“CPFB”),\nregarding the sale of the Flat. We highlight the salient letters which touch on the issue of Mr\nSng’s entitled proceeds (according to ORC 13) being far less than the amount he had to return\nto his CPF account:\n\na)\n\nBy a letter dated 3 November 2015,4 Seah & Co. wrote to HDB with copy to\nCPFB stating, among other things, that Mr Sng’s entire share of S$30,531.40\nwould be refunded to his CPF account, as it was “less than his CPF monies\nused” to purchase the Flat;\n\nb)\n\nBy a letter dated 13 November 2015,5 HDB wrote to Seah & Co. stating that\nwithout CPFB’s written agreement for a partial refund to Mr Sng’s CPF account,\na full refund to Mr Sng’s CPF account would be required to lift CPFB’s charge\non the Flat;\n\nc)\n\nBy a letter dated 17 November 2015,6 Seah & Co. wrote to CPFB requesting,\nin effect, their agreement to a partial refund;\n\nd)\n\nBy a letter dated 20 November 2015,7 HDB wrote to Seah & Co. providing a\ncompletion account which provided, among other things, that there was a full\nrefund required to Mr Sng’s CPF account in the sum of S$116,732.32 (“Full\nRefund”);\n\ne)\n\nBy a letter dated 23 November 2015,8 Seah & Co. again wrote to CPFB pointing\nout that Mdm Tan and Mr Sng had agreed to sell their Flat and were required\nby law to complete the sale by 4 December 2015. Seah & Co. again sought\nCPFB’s agreement to a partial refund to Mr Sng’s CPF account. To that end,\nSeah & Co. proposed that instead of paying the balance sum of S$85,372.32\n7\n\n\f(being the Full Refund amount minus the proposed partial refund amount of\nS$30,531.40) to Mdm Tan in cash, Mdm Tan was agreeable for that sum to be\ncredited to her CPF account instead. Seah & Co. also stated that Mdm Tan\nwould apply to Court to “award” ORC 13 accordingly. The use of the word\n“award” was a typographical error, and the Respondent confirmed during the\nHearing that he meant “amend”.9 While the letter referred to an enclosure\ncontaining Seah & Co.’s proposed amended ORC 13, it was not clear whether\nthere was in fact such an enclosure; and\n\nf)\n\nBy a letter dated 1 December 2015,10 CPFB responded to Seah & Co. stating\nin effect that a Full Refund to Mr Sng’s CPF account was required for the sale\nof the Flat to proceed. However, CPFB would have no objection to the transfer\nthe sum of approximately S$85,372.32 of Mr Sng’s CPF monies to Mdm Tan’s\nCPF account, if the Court made an order to that effect. In that letter, CPFB even\nreferred Seah & Co. to the suggested clauses on the FJC’s website for such\ntransfers of monies between CPF accounts, and also sought from Seah & Co.\nthe draft order for variation before parties filed it in court, so as to provide\ncomments, if any.\n\n17.\n\nHowever, the completion of the sale of the Flat proceeded on 4 December 2015,\n\nwithout any variation of ORC 13. The completion account for the sale was prepared by Seah\n& Co. (“Completion Account”),11 which recorded a Full Refund to Mr Sng’s CPF account, in\nthe sum of S$116,732.32. In other words, the sum of S$85,372.32 which Mdm Tan was\nbeneficially entitled to vis-à-vis Mr Sng, based on the terms of ORC 13, was also refunded to\nMr Sng’s CPF account to enable Mr Sng to fulfil his duty of a Full Refund to his CPF account.\n\n18.\n\nAlmost 1 year later, on 25 November 2016, Seah & Co. filed on behalf of Mdm Tan a\n\nsummons No. FC/SUM 4075/2016 (“SUM 4075”) in the Divorce Suit to vary ORC 13. SUM\n8\n\n\f4075 enclosed the draft amended ORC 13 which provided that CPFB shall transfer “the\nordered amount from the monies standing to the credit of [Mr Sng’s] CPF account into [Mdm\nTan’s] CPF account pursuant to s. 112 of the Women's Charter (Cap. 353) and subject to the\nprovisions of the CPF Act”.12\n\n19.\n\nIn support of SUM 4075, Seah & Co. filed Mdm Tan’s affidavit on 25 November 2016\n\n(“Mdm Tan’s Affidavit”)13, which was strangely affirmed earlier on 18 August 2016. It is not\ndisputed that this affidavit was drafted by the Respondent.14 Mdm Tan’s Affidavit briefly\nrecounted the facts surrounding the sale of the Flat and that vis-à-vis Mr Sng, she was\nbeneficially entitled to the sum of S$86,200 (instead of the sum of S$85,372.32 as appearing\nin the Completion Account narrated at paragraph 17 above).\n\n20.\n\nThe first Case Conference for SUM 4075 was fixed before the FJC on 22 December\n\n2016. The Respondent attended this Case Conference on behalf of Mdm Tan. SUM 4075 was\nnot yet served on Mr Sng, who did not attend. This Case Conference was adjourned to 10\nJanuary 2017 at 10:30 am.\n\n21.\n\nAt the scheduled Case Conference on 10 January 2017 at 10:30 am, no one attended\n\nthat Case Conference. The FJC’s Registry then wrote a letter on the same day to Seah & Co.\nand Mr Sng seeking an explanation in writing from the said parties for failing to attend the\nCase Conference on that same date. The FJC directed that no court date would be fixed for\nSUM 4075 failing an explanation in writing within 7 days.15\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent readily admitted during the Hearing that he did not attend the Case\n\nConference on 10 January 2017. The Respondent also did not provide any explanation to the\nFJC for his failure to attend. SUM 4075 therefore never proceeded to any further hearing, and\nby that token, ORC 13 was never varied.\n\n9\n\n\f23.\n\nThe picture after 10 January 2017 was far less clear. The Tribunal was left to rely on\n\nthe testimony of Mdm Tan and the Respondent, which at times contradicted each other. The\nTribunal will elaborate on its findings on this when discussing the Respondent’s liability below.\n\n24.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, Mr Sng passed away. Apart from the 2 sons Mr Sng had with Mdm\n\nTan during their marriage, Mr Sng had another child from a subsequent marriage.16\n\n25.\n\nOn or around 12 October 2020, Mdm Tan’s 2 sons received letters from the Public\n\nTrustee stating that they would be receiving monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account.\n\n26.\n\nOn or around 19 January 2021, Mdm Tan’s 2 sons received their share of the monies\n\nfrom Mr Sng’s CPF account. They told their mother Mdm Tan about this. It appeared that Mr\nSng had other beneficiaries who received their respective shares of Mr Sng’s CPF monies,\nnamely his wife and child from his subsequent marriage. Thus, by this time, all monies in Mr\nSng’s CPF account had been distributed.\n\n27.\n\nIn the period between 15 to 25 January 2021, there were a series of WhatsApp\n\nmessages between Mdm Tan and the Respondent. Mdm Tan appeared genuinely concerned\nabout the balance sum of S$86,200 due to her from Mr Sng’s CPF account and sought that\nthe Respondent take urgent action. The Respondent promised to take some action, but none\nwas taken.\n\n28.\n\nSometime in presumably late January 2021, Mdm Tan appointed the law firm Tan, Oei\n\n& Oei LLC (“TOO LLC”) to take over conduct from Seah & Co. for the recovery of monies from\nMr Sng’s CPF account. In that regard, on 28 January 2021, TOO LLC wrote to Seah & Co.\nand sought an urgent handover of the documents in Seah & Co.’s possession.17\n\n29.\n\nBy a 2nd letter dated 8 February 2021,18 TOO LLC reminded Seah & Co. to comply with\n\n10\n\n\fthe request for the handover of documents. This letter referred to a telephone conversation\nbetween the Respondent and TOO LLC’s lawyer Ms Anna Oei (“Ms Oei”) in which the\nRespondent said to her that he would respond to TOO LLC in 2 days, but did not do so.\n\n30.\n\nBy a 3rd letter dated 3 March 2021,19 TOO LLC again reminded Seah & Co. to comply\n\nwith the request for the handover of documents. As more than a month had passed by this\ntime, TOO LLC intimated that it would “take further action to ensure handover of the matter” if\nthe documents were not received by 4:00 pm on 8 March 2021.\n\n31.\n\nBy a 4th letter dated 12 March 2021,20 TOO LLC once again reminded Seah & Co. to\n\ncomply with the request for the handover of documents.\n\n32.\n\nOn 25 March 2021, Mdm Tan filed the Complaint to the Applicant.21 By this time, Seah\n\n& Co. had still not handed over any documents to TOO LLC.\n\n33.\n\nOn 9 December 2021, TOO LLC filed on behalf of Mdm Tan a Writ of Summons No.\n\nDC/DC 2582/2021 (“Suit 2582”) against the Respondent in the State Courts of Singapore.22\nSuit 2582 contained an Endorsement of Claim, which particularised a claim for the\nRespondent’s alleged breach of duty and negligence, in respect of, among other things, the\ntransfer of the Flat, the Divorce Suit including the variation application in SUM 4075, and the\nintended transfer of monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s. Mdm Tan sought\ndamages, costs and interest against the Respondent.\n\n34.\n\nOn the same day on 9 December 2021, TOO LLC also filed on behalf of Mdm Tan an\n\nOriginating Summons No. HC/OS 1258/2021 (“OS 1258”), seeking orders for the Respondent\nto deliver up to Mdm Tan all information and documents relating to, among other things, the\ntransfer of the Flat and the Divorce Suit including the variation application in SUM 4075.23 In\nsupport of OS 1258, TOO LLC filed Mdm Tan’s affidavit dated 1 December 2021.24\n\n11\n\n\f35.\n\nOn 15 February 2022, the Respondent filed a reply affidavit in OS 1258.25 In this reply\n\naffidavit, the Respondent provided several reasons why he had not handed over the\ndocuments requested by Mdm Tan. In gist, the Respondent’s position was that OS 1258 was\nfrivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of the court as Mdm Tan had all\nthe documents in her possession.\n\n36.\n\nOn or around 15 March 2022, the Respondent handed over some documents in its\n\npossession to TOO LLC. The documents handed over, which are contained in the Applicant’s\nSupplementary Bundle of Documents (marked LSBOD II), comprised of around 53 documents\nspanning 113 pages.\n\n37.\n\nOn 21 April 2022, the Respondent filed a further affidavit in OS 1258.26 He claimed\n\nthat he had on 15 March 2022 handed over all the documents in his possession relating to the\nsale of the Flat and the variation application in SUM 4075 to TOO LLC. However, as for the\nDivorce Suit, the Respondent claimed that most documents had been destroyed as the matter\nconcluded following the extraction of the Certificate of Final Judgment in January 2015.\n\n38.\n\nBy a letter dated 29 April 2022, TOO LLC disputed the Respondent’s claims in his\n\nfurther affidavit dated 21 April 2022.27\n\n39.\n\nHowever, it appears that no order was made in OS 1258. It is not clear whether parties\n\nsettled the matter without a hearing or that OS 1258 was heard and that no orders were\ndeemed necessary.\n\n40.\n\nOn 15 August 2022, Mdm Tan filed her Statement of Claim in Suit 2582 against the\n\nRespondent.28\n\n12\n\n\f41.\n\nOn 12 September 2022, interlocutory default judgment for liability was entered in Suit\n\n2582 against the Respondent, with damages to be assessed, as the Respondent did not serve\nhis defence.29\n\n42.\n\nAt the Hearing of these proceedings, we were updated by the Respondent that he\n\nreached a settlement with Mdm Tan on the judgment in respect of Suit 2582. To be clear, the\nTribunal did not inquire into the terms of the settlement. The Respondent however offered\ninformation on this, without any objection by the Applicant’s counsel or Mdm Tan. The\nRespondent informed the Tribunal that he had agreed to pay Mdm Tan the sum of S$86,00030\nand he was seeking this fact to be considered for the purpose of mitigation in case the Tribunal\nfound against him.31\n\nThe charges\n\n43.\n\nThe first main charge against the Respondent, which in the Tribunal’s view is the most\n\nserious, is that he failed to act timeously on his client, Mdm Tan’s instruction to vary ORC 13,\nand keep Mdm Tan reasonably informed of the progress of her application to vary ORC 13. It\nis most serious because it concerns the Respondent’s alleged actions which ultimately led to\nMdm Tan’s loss of the S$86,000 due from Mr Sng’s CPF account, and that it allegedly took\nMdm Tan 4 years to discover her loss. The Respondent is alleged to be in breach of Rules\n5(2)(c), 5(2)(e), 5(2)(f) and/or 5(2)(h) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n2015 (“PCR”). Those rules are reproduced below:\n\n5.-“(2) A legal practitioner must —\n…\n(c) act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to the\nclient;\n…\n13\n\n\f(e) keep the client reasonably informed of the progress of the client’s matter;\n…\n(f) where practicable, promptly respond to the client’s communications;\n…\n(h) provide timely advice to the client;”\n\n44.\n\nThe second main charge against the Respondent is that he failed to attend the Case\n\nConference in SUM 4075 on 10 January 2017 without reasonable justification or notice to\nMdm Tan. This is alleged to be in breach of Rules 5(2)(c) and 5(2)(e) of the PCR, which have\nbeen reproduced in paragraph 43 above.\n\n45.\n\nThe third main charge against the Respondent is that he failed to respond and/or\n\ncomply with TOO LLC’s repeated requests to take over conduct of the Divorce Suit. This is\nalleged to be in breach of Rules 5(2)(e), 5(2)(f) and/or 7(2) of the PCR. The former 2 rules\nhave been reproduced in paragraph 43 above. Rule 7(2) of the PCR is reproduced below:\n7.-“(2) A legal practitioner must treat other legal practitioners with courtesy and\nfairness.”\n\n46.\n\nAs mentioned, each of the 3 main charges have a corresponding alternative charge\n\nfor the same alleged misconduct under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\nThe Respondent’s defence\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent filed his Defence on 6 September 2022 (“Defence”).\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal had difficulty piecing together the Respondent’s defences from the\n\nDefence alone. In the usual course, a party should be confined to its pleaded position, as it\n14\n\n\fappears in his defence. In seeking to understand his defence in full, the Tribunal extended\nsome latitude to the Respondent by considering his defences in his Affidavit of Evidence-inChief dated 22 November 2022 (“Respondent’s AEIC”) and the evidence at the Hearing.\nHowever, the Tribunal did exercise caution in accepting matters not appearing in the\nRespondent’s pleaded Defence.\n\n(a)\n\nFirst Main Charge\n\n49.\n\nIn respect of the first main charge on failing to act timeously to vary ORC 13, the\n\nRespondent’s main defence was that he was not acting for Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13 to obtain\nan order for the transfer of CPF monies from Mr Sng’s to Mdm Tan’s CPF account. While he\ndid file SUM 4075 for Mdm Tan on 25 November 2016 to vary ORC 13, which was almost 1\nyear after the Completion of the sale of Flat, this was purely to help Mdm Tan gratuitously. He\nhad not charged Mdm Tan any fees or disbursements for filing SUM 4075, or for that matter\nany work related to varying ORC 13. However, he claimed that SUM 4075 “got stuck” because\nfirst, Mr Sng’s then solicitors refused to accept service of SUM 4075 and second, Mr Sng was\nout of jurisdiction and could not be served. Further, Mdm Tan “was not prepared to give formal\ninstructions to pursue the matter and incur the costs of substituted service”. As such, the\nRespondent “left the matter as it is”. We elaborate on how we arrived at the Respondent’s\ndefences.\n\n50.\n\nIn his Defence, the Respondent pleaded that the Divorce Suit was concluded in or\n\naround January 2015. Thereafter, there were no further instructions from Mdm Tan on the\nDivorce Suit matter and/or any instructions to “appeal” against ORC 13 (i.e. the ancillary order\nfor division and distribution of the proceeds of sale of the Flat).32 The Respondent pleaded\nthat he indeed acted for Mdm Tan in the sale of the Flat, in the course of which, the issue of\nthe Full Refund of CPF monies arose. The Respondent further pleaded that “[Mdm Tan]\nrequested us to assist her to amend the said Order”, but the “issue of our costs was therefore\n15\n\n\f[sic] not discussed”. To the Tribunal, “request” must mean instructions. It is clear that “us”\nrefers to Seah & Co. and the Respondent, and the “Order” refers to ORC 13. The Defence\nwent on to state that Mdm Tan “was not prepared to incur the costs of the substituted service\non him”, and the word “him” we understand referred to Mr Sng.\n\n51.\n\nIn the Respondent’s AEIC, flesh was added to the Respondent’s defences. He stated\n\nthat there were no instructions to act for Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13. He nevertheless “tried to\nhelp” Mdm Tan by filing SUM 4075 to vary ORC 13. However, SUM 4075 “got stuck” because\nit could not be served on Mr Sng. For clarity, we reproduce paragraphs 6 and 7 of the\nRespondent’s AEIC:\n\n“6. There was no instructions to act for the Complainant to apply for variation of the\nAncillary Order of Court save that it was made known that the CPF Board required the\nComplainant’s Husband’s CPF monies used to be refunded to his CPF account, I tried\nto help the Complainant by taking out an application for the variation of the Order of\nCourt of 28 November 2014 and got the Complainant to affirm an Affidavit. No costs\nor any disbursements were collected from the Complainant for the said application.\n\n7. The application got stuck as the Defendant could not be served as the Complainant’s\nHusband’s solicitors refused to accept service and the Defendant is out of jurisdiction.\nMadam Tan was not prepared to give formal instructions to pursue the matter and incur\nthe costs of substituted service. As such, I therefore did not follow up on 10 January\n2017 and left the matter as it is.”\n\n52.\n\nIn the course of being cross-examined at the Hearing, the Respondent led more\n\nevidence on his defence. He claimed that:\n\na)\n\nBecause 1 year had passed (unclear from when), an application to vary ORC\n16\n\n\f13 had to be personally served on Mr Sng, who was resident in Hong Kong;\n\nb)\n\nIn 2016, the Respondent did not have Mr Sng’s address. and neither did Mdm\nTan. Thus, Mr Sng could not be personally served. Mr Sng’s then lawyers Tan\nKim Seng & Partners had no instructions to accept service of the variation\napplication on behalf of Mr Sng. As such, the variation application could not be\nfiled;33\n\nc)\n\nIn 2016, the Respondent had advised Mdm Tan on the above issues relating\nto service and had informed her that she required Mr Sng’s address.34 He also\nadvised Mdm Tan that it was possible to file an application for substituted\nservice to advertise the variation application in a newspaper in Hong Kong, but\nMdm Tan did not wish to incur the costs for advertising;35\n\nd)\n\nNonetheless, without the address of Mr Sng or instructions on substituted\nservice, due to Mdm Tan’s pressure to file the application to vary ORC 13, the\nRespondent proceeded to file the variation application SUM 4075 on 25\nNovember 2016 hoping that Mdm Tan would find Mr Sng’s address in time;36\nand\n\ne)\n\nAs Mdm Tan was unable to provide the Respondent with any address for Mr\nSng, he left the matter as it is. The Respondent was all along waiting for Mdm\nTan to respond to him on the address of Mr Sng.37\n\n(b)\n\nSecond Main Charge\n\n53.\n\nIn respect of the second main charge which concerns the Respondent’s failure to\n\nattend the Case Conference in SUM 4075 on 10 January 2017, the Respondent’s Defence\n17\n\n\fwas silent.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent’s AEIC did not directly raise any defence as to why he failed to attend\n\nthe said Case Conference. The AEIC simply stated that because Mr Sng could not be served\nwith SUM 4075, the application stalled, and “[a]s such, [he] therefore did not follow up on 10\nJanuary 2017 and left the matter as it is”.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent’s Closing Submissions dated 31 January 2023 (“Respondent’s\n\nClosing Submissions”) brought some belated clarity. The Respondent explained at\nparagraph 5 that as Mdm Tan did not wish to incur the costs of substituted service of SUM\n4075 by way of an advertisement, and there was no address for service on Mr Sng, the\nRespondent did not attend the Case Conference on 10 January 2017.\n\n(c)\n\nThird Main Charge\n\n56.\n\nIn respect of the third main charge which concerns the Respondent’s failure to respond\n\nto and/or comply with TOO LLC’s repeated requests to take over conduct of the Divorce Suit,\nthe Respondent’s defence was that copies of the Interim Judgment, Ancillary Order of Court\n(i.e. ORC 13) and Certificate of Final Judgment in the Divorce Suit were given to Mdm Tan in\nJanuary 2015 before the file was closed. The rest of the documents relating to the Divorce\nSuit were subsequently disposed of by the Respondent.\n\n57.\n\nIn his Defence, the Respondent referred to the 2 affidavits he filed in OS 1258 (i.e.\n\nMdm Tan’s application against the Respondent to compel the handover of documents) – see\nparagraphs 35 and 37 above. In those 2 affidavits, the Respondent’s evidence (which he\nappeared to adopt as his defence by incorporation), was that:\n\nRespondent’s Affidavit dated 15 February 2022 at [4]\n18\n\n\fa)\n\nOn an unspecified date, the Respondent received a telephone call from Ms Oei\nof TOO LLC for copies of Mdm Tan’s divorce documents. As the Respondent\nwas unwell, he requested for time. He also needed time because the matter\nwas completed in November 2014, and the file was either in storage or not\naround;\n\nb)\n\nIn any event, during the course of the Divorce Suit, Mdm Tan was given\n“documents/copy letters from time to time when she attended at [the\nRespondent’s] office to give instructions and to sign Affidavits/documents”;\n\nRespondent’s Affidavit dated 21 April 2022 at [3]-[4]\n\nc)\n\nAll documents relating to the Divorce Suit in Seah & Co.’s records (except the\nInterim Judgment, Ancillary Order of Court (i.e. ORC 13) and Certificate of Final\nJudgment in the Divorce Suit) had been destroyed as the matter concluded in\nJanuary 2015 upon the extraction of the Certificate of Final Judgment; and\n\nd)\n\nA new file was opened in Seah & Co.’s records in or around November 2015\nfor the sale of the Flat and this file included documents relating to SUM 4075.\nDocuments in this new file were given to TOO LLC on or around 15 March\n2022.\n\nIssues for Tribunal’s determination\n\n58.\n\nReading the charges framed by the Applicant against the defences raised by the\n\nRespondent, the following issues arise for the Tribunal’s determination:\n\n19\n\n\fFirst Charge\n\na)\n\nWhether and when the Respondent was acting for Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13\nfor the transfer of monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s;\n\nb)\n\nIf so, whether the Respondent failed to act timeously on Mdm Tan’s instructions\nto vary ORC 13;\n\nc)\n\nWhether the Respondent failed to keep Mdm Tan reasonably informed of the\nprogress of her application in SUM 4075 filed on 25 November 2016 to vary\nORC 13;\n\nd)\n\nWhether there were issues of service and substituted service of SUM 4075 on\nMr Sng, and if so, whether the Respondent had reasonably advised and/or\nupdated Mdm Tan on those issues;\n\nSecond Charge\n\ne)\n\nWhether the Respondent advised and/or updated Mdm Tan on his failure to\nattend the Case Conference in SUM 4075 on 10 January 2017, and whether\nthe Respondent had any justification for not attending that Case Conference;\nand\n\nThird Charge\n\nf)\n\nWhether the Respondent failed to respond to and/or comply with TOO LLC’s\nrequests between January and March 2021 to take over conduct of the Divorce\nSuit by handing over documents related to it in Seah & Co.’s possession to\n20\n\n\fTOO LLC which led to OS 1258 dated 9 December 2021, and whether there\nwas any justification for this failure.\n\nTribunal’s findings on the issues and determination on the charges\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal’s findings on the 3 main charges are presented sequentially.\n\nFirst Charge\n\na)\n\nWhether and when the Respondent was acting for Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13 for the\ntransfer of monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s\n\n60.\n\nIn our view, there is compelling evidence that the Respondent was for all intents and\n\npurposes acting for Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13 to secure the transfer of the sum of S$86,200\nfrom Mr Sng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s, such that there was an implied retainer between\nthe Respondent and Mdm Tan for this purpose. The Respondent’s defence arguing otherwise\nis without merit and was disingenuously raised.\n\n61.\n\nIt was common ground that there was no express contractual retainer, given the\n\nabsence of a written agreement between the Respondent/Seah & Co. and Mdm Tan in relation\nspecifically to this task. The key question was therefore whether there was nevertheless an\nimplied retainer.\n\n62.\n\nWhether an implied retainer exists between a lawyer and a client depends on the\n\nfactual matrix concerned: ([64] of Law Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani\n[2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 (“Ahmad Khalis”).38 The perspective to take is an objective one, as to\nhow a reasonable person in the shoes of the lawyer and client would characterise the\nrelationship, such that “a contractual relationship ought fairly and properly to be imputed to all\n21\n\n\fthe parties” ([66] of Ahmad Khalis citing Cordery on Solicitors (Anthony Holland gen ed)\n(LexisNexis UK, 9th Ed, 1995, 2004 release)39.\n\n63.\n\nIn Ahmad Khalis, the Court of Three Judges (“C3J”) had no difficulty in finding that the\n\nlawyer concerned was in fact acting for the beneficiaries. The most relevant indicia which\npointed to this retainer relationship, included, among other things, that the lawyer had provided\nexpress advice to the beneficiaries to the extent of informing them on the additional costs and\ndelay in having a co-administrator, and sought to allay their fears about appointing the putative\nadministrator.\n\n64.\n\nIn Anwar Patrick and another v Ng Chong & Hue LLC and another [2014] 3 SLR 761\n\n(“Anwar Patrick”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”), even in the absence of any advice given by the\nlawyer concerned to the putative client, readily found an implied retainer. This was on the\nbasis that the lawyer signed off on security documents for a mortgage as “solicitor for the\nmortgagors” and signed off on the Certificate of Correctness which was (and is) a highly\nimportant document for registration of a mortgage given its statutory implications. The CA\nreasoned that from the lawyer’s perspective, he must have thought that he had authority to\nact for the client. The CA’s reasoning why the absence of advice alone did not mean there\nwas no implied retainer was particularly instructive (at [52]):40\n\n“…However, the fact that the solicitor did not give advice cannot give rise to the\nconverse inference. The absence of any proof of advice given could equally be\nevidence of a breach of an implied retainer if the other objective evidence points\ntowards the existence of an implied retainer. Therefore, in circumstances such as\nthese where the allegation is that the solicitor ought to have given advice directly to\nthe Appellants because there was an implied retainer, it would be putting the cart\nbefore the horse to rely solely on the fact that no advice was provided.”\n\n22\n\n\f65.\n\nThe recent decision of the CA in Law Society of Singapore v Lee Suet Fern [2020] 5\n\nSLR 1151 (“Lee Suet Fern”), at [64] and [68],41 reiterated the point made at [64] of Ahmad\nKhalis that contractual legal formalities are not required for a retainer to exist. Lee Suet Fern\nalso laid down a list of non-exhaustive factors to consider in determining whether a retainer\nrelationship should be attributed to the putative lawyer and putative client. Amongst which, the\nmost relevant for the purposes of the present case include: (a) “who is providing instructions”;\n(b) “whether a contractual relationship existed between the putative solicitor and the putative\nclient in the past”; (c) “whether express advice was given by the putative solicitor, and if so,\nwhether such advice was relied upon by the putative client”; (d) “the nature of such advice”;\n(e) “whether the putative solicitor asked the putative client to seek independent advice”; and\n(f) “whether any advice by the putative solicitor was rendered without qualification”.\n\n66.\n\nIn the present case, we also consider the following factor to be especially relevant in\n\nour analysis, namely, how the putative solicitor represented or characterised the relationship\nwith the putative client as it concerned third parties. This finds support in the case of Anwar\nPatrick (at [54]-[55]), where the fact the solicitor signed off on a formal legal record as a solicitor\nacting for the client, was key in the CA’s finding of an implied retainer. In application to the\nfacts, Anwar Patrick at [58] held that:42\n\n“…From any objective standpoint, he must have thought that he had the authority to\nact for the Appellants, and that he was their agent. In fact, he was their solicitor for\nthe mortgage; there is no other way of characterising it. …”\n\n67.\n\nOn application to the facts, we begin by considering the prior retainer relationship\n\nbetween the Respondent and Mdm Tan. The Respondent acted for Mdm Tan in her Divorce\nSuit in 2014, in which ORC 13 was made for the sale of the Flat and distribution of the\nproceeds. While the issue of a Full Refund to Mr Sng’s CPF account was not live at that time\n\n23\n\n\fwhen ORC 13 was made in November 2014, it soon became a live issue when Mdm Tan was\nselling the Flat in or around November 2015. This issue was directly connected to both the\nDivorce Suit and the sale of the Flat. In both matters, the Respondent acted for Mdm Tan.\n\n68.\n\nIt is also relevant to understand how the Respondent came to act for Mdm Tan in the\n\nsale of the Flat. In early November 2015, HDB had declined to act for the sellers Mdm Tan\nand Mr Sng, for the very reason that the refund required to Mr Sng’s CPF account exceeded\nthe amount he was entitled to under ORC 13. By an email dated 5 November 2015 from HDB’s\nMs Cindy Low Szu Szu’s to Seah & Co., she informed Seah & Co. that HDB was unable to\nact in the CPF refund for the sellers. After HDB refused to act for Mdm Tan and Mr Sng, the\nRespondent accepted the retainer to act for Mdm Tan in the sale of the Flat.\n\n69.\n\nIn the course of the sale of the Flat while acting for Mdm Tan, the Respondent sent a\n\nletter to CPFB dated 23 November 2015, requesting CPFB’s approval for a partial refund to\nMr Sng’s CPF account, as according to ORC 13, Mdm Tan was entitled to the balance sum.\nThe Respondent confirmed during the Hearing that he wrote this letter as Mdm Tan’s lawyer\nand had her authority to do so.43 The contents of this letter are telling. Seah & Co. proposed\nthat instead of paying the balance sum of S$85,372.32 (being the Full Refund amount minus\nthe proposed partial refund amount) to Mdm Tan in cash, Mdm Tan was agreeable for the\nsum to be credited to her CPF account instead. Seah & Co. also stated that Mdm Tan would\napply to court to amend ORC 13 accordingly.\n\n70.\n\nDuring cross-examination, the Respondent initially tried to explain away this letter by\n\nsaying that he had no instructions and the proposed variation of ORC 13 was his own initiative\nto try to “help” Mdm Tan as he was acting for her in the sale of the Flat.44 Subsequently, he\nadmitted that he did have instructions from Mdm Tan in relation to the contents of this letter to\nthe CPFB.45\n\n24\n\n\f71.\n\nWe accept Mdm Tan’s evidence that it was around this time on 23 November 2015\n\nthat she had instructed the Respondent to vary ORC 13 if need be.46 This was supported by\nSeah & Co.’s letter to CPFB dated 23 November 2015 informing them that Mdm Tan intended\nto apply to Court to amend ORC 13 for the CPF monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account to be\ntransferred to Mdm Tan’s, in the event CPFB did not agree to a transfer of cash to Mdm Tan.\nThe fact that Mdm Tan had instructed the Respondent to vary ORC 13 was also consistent\nwith the Respondent’s admission in his Defence, at [4], where he stated that “[Mdm Tan]\nrequested us to assist her to amend the said [Order]”. In the course of cross-examination\nregarding the sale of the flat in November 2015, the Respondent also confirmed that he did\nreceive instructions from Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13 to enable the transfer of monies from Mr\nSng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s.47\n\n72.\n\nBy a letter dated 1 December 2015, CPFB responded to Seah & Co. stating that they\n\nwould have no objection to the transfer of Mr Sng’s CPF monies to Mdm Tan’s CPF account,\nif the Court made an order to that effect. The Respondent accepted during cross-examination\nthat this was also his understanding of the CPFB’s letter of 1 December 2015.48 At that point,\nthe Respondent and Mdm Tan’s focus was to ensure the completion of the sale of the Flat on\nthe scheduled completion date of 4 December 2015, as time was of the essence.49\n\n73.\n\nWe also accept Mdm Tan’s evidence that the Respondent’s advice to her was to\n\nproceed to complete the sale on 4 December 2015, and he would thereafter apply to vary\nORC 13.50 This was consistent with the said correspondence between Seah & Co. and CPFB,\nas well as the Respondent’s own evidence that time was of the essence for the sale to be\ncompleted by 4 December 2015.\n\n74.\n\nWe find on the evidence as set out above that Mdm Tan had first instructed the\n\nRespondent to communicate to CPFB that she was prepared to vary ORC 13 sometime\naround 23 November 2015, and that she subsequently instructed him to proceed with the\n25\n\n\fapplication to vary ORC 13 at or around the time of the completion of the sale of the Flat on 4\nDecember 2015.\n\n75.\n\nThe fact which puts the question of an implied retainer beyond doubt is that Seah &\n\nCo. did eventually file an application in SUM 4075 in the Divorce Suit on 25 November 2016,\nalmost a year later. The Respondent admitted that he had personally drafted Mdm Tan’s\nAffidavit, affirmed and dated on 18 August 2016, filed in support of SUM 4075. In that affidavit,\nMdm Tan recounted the facts surrounding the sale of the Flat and how she was beneficially\nentitled to the sum of S$86,200 vis-à-vis Mr Sng that remained in Mr Sng’s CPF account. It is\ndifficult to understand how the Respondent can maintain his defence that he had not acted for\nMdm Tan to vary ORC 13, when SUM 4075 was filed by his law firm Seah & Co. as solicitors\nfor Mdm Tan, and significantly, that the solicitor in charge was stated as “SEAH CHOON HUAT\nJOHNNY”.\n\n76.\n\nThis bears some similarity to the situation in Anwar Patrick, with the evidence in the\n\npresent case being even clearer. In Anwar Patrick, the lawyer signed off as solicitor on highly\nimportant documents for registration of a mortgage. The CA reasoned that from the lawyer’s\nperspective, he must have thought that he had authority to act for the client. Likewise, by the\nRespondent filing an important Court document such as SUM 4075 with the specific\nrepresentation that his firm Seah & Co. acts for Mdm Tan and that he is the solicitor in charge,\nit raises the implication that he had authority and instructions to do so. There must be an\nimplied retainer. When confronted with this fact during cross-examination, the Respondent\naccepted not only that he was acting for Mdm Tan but also that she was following his advice.\nWe reproduce the Respondent’s testimony on this:51\n\n3\n\nAdvocate: And so you did inform her that you’re going to file this\n\n4\n\napplication.\n\n5\n\nWitness: Yes, yes. We did, we did. We did file the application.\n\n26\n\n\f77.\n\n6\n\nAdvocate: And she said, “Okay, go ahead with it.”\n\n7\n\nWitness: Yes, that’s why she signed an affidavit, yes.\n\n8\n\nAdvocate: Yes, so in that sense, she’s giving you instructions, right, your\n\n9\n\ntaking your advice and agreeing to it?\n\n10\n\nWitness: Okay, okay. Yes, maybe then I shouldn’t---I shouldn’t\n\n11\n\ndifferentiate.\n\n12\n\nAdvocate: Yes. So yes, thank you.\n\nThe Respondent claimed that he did not charge Mdm Tan any fees or disbursements\n\nfor filing SUM 4075, or for that matter any work related to varying ORC 13. In our view, this\nper se does not negate an implied retainer. We can do no better than to cite the CA’s prescient\nobservation at [68] of Lee Suet Fern that “a lawyer who acts pro bono with no expectation of\nreceiving any fee is nonetheless plainly in a solicitor-client relationship even though there is\nno consideration moving from the client”.\n\n78.\n\nIf the Respondent genuinely believed that he was not acting for Mdm Tan to vary ORC\n\n13, he would have informed her as such in writing, informed her to seek independent legal\nadvice, and would certainly not have agreed to take any steps to helping her achieve that end\nby corresponding with CPFB or filing SUM 4075 without qualification.\n\n79.\n\nIn sum, there is compelling evidence of an implied retainer between the Respondent\n\nand Mdm Tan, the scope of which was to secure the transfer of S$86,200 from Mr Sng’s CPF\naccount to Mdm Tan’s, which required a variation of ORC 13. A reasonable person in the\nshoes of the Respondent and Mdm Tan would without doubt characterise their relationship as\nsolicitor and client. In any case, implied retainer was pleaded by Mdm Tan in Suit 2582, in the\nEndorsed Claim52 and in the Statement of Claim at [16]-[18].53. No defence or denial of an\nimplied retainer was put in response by the Respondent. No defence to Suit 2582 was filed\nresulting in default judgment.\n27\n\n\fb)\n\nWhether the Respondent failed to act timeously on Mdm Tan’s instructions to vary\nORC 13\n\n80.\n\nWhile the Respondent had agreed to vary ORC 13 shortly after the Completion on 4\n\nDecember 2015, the application to vary in SUM 4075 was only filed almost 1 year later, on 25\nNovember 2016.\n\n81.\n\nThis was a significant delay for an application that was clearly uncomplicated, and\n\nwhen the merits for a transfer of CPF monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s were\nin Mdm Tan’s favour. There was a clear order in ORC 13 for Mdm Tan to receive 93% of the\nnet proceeds from the sale of the Flat.\n\n82.\n\nIt was even more troubling that Mdm Tan’s supporting affidavit in SUM 4075 was in\n\nfact affirmed on 18 August 2016, more than 3 months before SUM 4075 was eventually filed\non 25 November 2016. The Respondent could not provide any explanation for the delay.54\n\n83.\n\nThere is thus a prima facie case against the Respondent for failing to act timeously on\n\nMdm Tan’s instructions, considering the almost 1-year delay in filing the application to vary\nORC 13. There was no evidence whatsoever, in the form of correspondence, which one would\nexpect between a solicitor and client, to show that the Respondent took any steps in this period\nto further Mdm Tan’s cause in obtaining a transfer of the CPF monies from Mr Sng’s CPF\naccount to Mdm Tan’s.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent admitted that in this 1-year period, Mdm Tan did in fact send various\n\nchasers and reminders to follow up with him.55 She also tried contacting him on WhatsApp,\nthrough phone calls to his office, and even occasionally appeared at the Respondent’s office\nto chase him to further her matter.56\n\n28\n\n\f85.\n\nThis is an apposite juncture to consider the Respondent’s defence. He claimed that\n\nbecause 1 year had passed from the cessation of the Divorce Suit, he had to personally serve\nany application to vary on Mr Sng who was based in Hong Kong. However, he did not have\nMr Sng’s address for service and neither did Mdm Tan.\n\n86.\n\nWhile the Respondent was unable to explain the legal basis for the 1-year timeline he\n\nmentioned,57 the Tribunal did find that the law indeed provided for this. Rule 91 of the Family\nJustice Rules 2014 (version in force as at 1 April 2015) (“FJR 2014”) provides that an\napplication to vary an order made in proceedings for ancillary relief (which is what ORC 13 is),\nif made 1 year from the date of the final order on ancillary relief, must be served personally on\nevery other party in accordance with Rules 48 or 49 of FJR 2014. It was common ground that\nMr Sng was out of jurisdiction. Under Rule 49, which applied to service out of jurisdiction, Mr\nSng was to be served personally, or by registered post with the added requirement of an\nacknowledgment of service signed by the party served. Rule 50 of the FJR 2014 applies to\nsubstituted service, for an application that needed to be served out of jurisdiction to be instead\nserved by another effective mode of service or a notice by advertisement on the Court’s leave\n(“Substituted Service”).\n\n87.\n\nThe possibility of obtaining Substituted Service was something which the Respondent\n\ncould easily have advised Mdm Tan on and carried out. The Respondent claimed that he was\nall along alive to the possibility of Substituted Service, in particular notice by advertisement in\nHong Kong. He also claimed that he had advised Mdm Tan on it but Mdm Tan was not willing\nto bear the costs of an advertisement. As such, he had to wait for her to obtain an address for\nMr Sng, thereby explaining the delay. The Tribunal’s difficulty with accepting the Respondent’s\ndefence was that apart from his mere assertions, there was simply no evidence put before the\nTribunal to substantiate the assertions. We believe Mdm Tan’s evidence that she was never\nadvised about the possibility of Substituted Service or its associated costs.\n29\n\n\f88.\n\nIf there was indeed any advice from the Respondent to Mdm Tan on this issue, there\n\nwould have been some correspondence between them to this effect or at least an attendance\nnote taken by the Respondent. The Respondent claimed that he always communicated with\nMdm Tan through WhatsApp but no messages were produced by him.58 The Respondent\nclaimed that the phone which stored those messages was spoilt and he was therefore unable\nto retrieve them.59 During the Hearing, the Tribunal offered the Respondent the opportunity to\nengage a forensic expert to try and retrieve the messages on the basis of the Respondent’s\nclaim that there was advice on substituted service recorded on his phone.60 The Respondent\nwas directed to write to the Secretariat by 7 December 2022 to inform whether he was going\nto engage a forensic expert to retrieve the messages, and to provide those messages to the\nApplicant for consideration by 14 December 2022. It was telling that the Respondent did\nneither, and only raised in his Closing Submissions on 31 January 2023 that he could not\nsuccessfully do so.\n\n89.\n\nFurther, the Respondent’s evidence was that the cost for an advertisement in an\n\noverseas newspaper was around US$2,000 and he had experience doing this before.61 This\ndid not seem prohibitively expense for a person like Mdm Tan, especially when juxtaposed\nagainst the sum of S$86,200 in CPF monies she would benefit from if ORC 13 was varied.\nMdm Tan’s evidence, which was more believable, was that the Respondent did not advise her\nof the possibility or need for Substituted Service nor the potential costs involved.62 The\ncomplete absence of any reference to Substituted Service or its costs in the WhatsApp\nexchanges or correspondence over the years between 2015 to 2021 seems to bear this out.\nWe also accept Mdm Tan’s evidence that if properly advised, she would certainly have been\nwilling to incur the costs for Substituted Service given the significantly larger sum at stake.63\n\n90.\n\nIn the Applicant’s Closing Submissions, it submits that an adverse inference should be\n\ndrawn against the Respondent’s defence for his failure to keep and produce any\n30\n\n\fcontemporaneous records of his communications with Mdm Tan. We recognise that the C3J\nhas on a number of occasions emphasised the importance for lawyers to maintain attendance\nnotes and correspondence with their clients, failing which, an adverse inference may be drawn\nagainst them on assertions they make in support of their defence (see [82] of In Law Society\nof Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang [2007] 3 SLR(R) 47764 and [70] of Law Society of Singapore\nv Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju [2013] 3 SLR 875)65. We would characterise this more as a\npresumption of fact, built on a lawyer’s duty and standard practice to reasonably maintain\nattendance notes and correspondence with his client recording his advice and the client’s\ninstructions. In any event, we do not have to go so far as to rely on this presumption of fact. It\nis the Respondent’s burden of proof to produce evidence to support his assertion that he\nadvised Mdm Tan on Substituted Service and that Mdm Tan had not agreed to it. He failed to\ndischarge that burden. Moreover, having heard the parties, we rather believe Mdm Tan that\nshe did not receive any advice from the Respondent on Substituted Service nor its associated\ncosts.\n\n(c)\n\nWhether the Respondent failed to keep Mdm Tan reasonably informed of the progress\nof her application in SUM 4075 filed on 25 November 2016 to vary ORC 13\n\n91.\n\nAfter SUM 4075 was filed on 25 November 2016, a Case Conference was fixed before\n\nthe FJC on 22 December 2016. The Respondent’s evidence, which we had no reason to\ndoubt, was that he attended the Case Conference and the Court informed him that it could not\nmake any order on SUM 4075 unless it was served on Mr Sng.66 The Case Conference was\nadjourned to 10 January 2017.\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent admitted that he indeed did not attend the Case Conference on 10\n\nJanuary 2017. This precipitated the letter dated 10 January 2017 from the FJC’s Registry to\nSeah & Co. and Mr Sng seeking an explanation in writing within 7 days from the said parties\nfor failing to attend the Case Conference. The FJC directed that no Court date would be fixed\n31\n\n\ffor SUM 4075 failing an explanation in writing within 7 days. The Respondent also admitted\nthat he did not respond to the FJC’s Registry’s letter of 10 January 2017.\n\n93.\n\nWe will consider the Respondent’s failure to attend the Case Conference on 10\n\nJanuary 2017 in more detail when we state our findings on the second charge. Unlike the\nsecond charge, the first charge is concerned only with whether he kept Mdm Tan updated.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent’s candid evidence was that he never gave Mdm Tan a copy of the\n\nFJC’s letter of 10 January 2017, and he did not inform her that he was required to respond to\nthe FJC to explain his non-attendance, failing which SUM 4075 would lapse.67\n\n95.\n\nIt was more appalling to hear the Respondent’s evidence that he never at any point\n\ninformed Mdm Tan that SUM 4075 had lapsed and that a new application would be required.68\nAll along until early 2021, as we explain at paragraph 98 below, Mdm Tan was under the\nmisconceived notion that SUM 4075 was still alive.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent’s evidence was that after the first Case Conference on 22 December\n\n2016, he did inform Mdm Tan that the Court would not grant the variation in SUM 4075 unless\nit was served on Mr Sng. As Mdm Tan was unable to provide him with any address for Mr\nSng, the Respondent told Mdm Tan that there was no point for him to attend Court for SUM\n4075 until such time she could provide him with a lead.69 We do not believe the Respondent’s\nevidence on this point. We rather believe Mdm Tan that she was not aware of what was\nhappening to SUM 4075.\n\n97.\n\nThere appeared no justification for the Respondent’s failure to update Mdm Tan on the\n\ndevelopments in SUM 4075 and the FJC’s letter on 10 January 2017, nor his failure to respond\nto the FJC to explain his absence on 10 January 2017.\n\n32\n\n\f98.\n\nFollowing the events in January 2017, the next 2 periods of relevance was in March\n\n2018 and January 2021 where there was evidence from emails and WhatsApp\ncorrespondence produced by Mdm Tan of her exchanges with the Respondent. In those\ncorrespondence, it documented her requests to the Respondent to do something about her\nCPF monies and his response to those requests:\n\na)\n\nIn March 2018, there was an email exchange between the Respondent and\nMdm Tan.70 We also note that this was the only evidence of correspondence\nbetween the Respondent and Mdm Tan that was produced for the period 2018\nand before. It showed that the Respondent was working on trying to find Mr\nSng’s company details in Hong Kong. The Respondent admitted that at this\npoint, he had still not told Mdm Tan that SUM 4075 had lapsed.71 His feeble\nexcuses, which the Tribunal did not accept, was that (a) he had already told\nMdm Tan on 22 December 2016 that he would not be following up on the\nmatter;72 and (b) he did not need to tell her because he could always file a new\napplication.73\n\nb)\n\nIn January 2021, there was a WhatsApp exchange between Mdm Tan and the\nRespondent.74 Mdm Tan’s messages showed that she was still harbouring\nunder the misconception that the Respondent was assisting her to secure the\ntransfer of monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account to hers. On 15 January 2021,\nshe said “Hi hi..Mr Seah , is there any news about the CPF?” to which the\nRespondent replied that he would call her next week. Mdm Tan’s response was\nthat: “Tot u hv good news for me [sad emoji]”. On 20 January 2021, Mdm Tan\nchased the Respondent asking him to reply to her on whether he had attended\nto her matter, whether any action was taken, and what the status of her case\nwas. To which, the Respondent replied saying that “Send you letter tonight as\nI’m working on it still ok”. The next day, the Respondent said he was sending\n33\n\n\fout letters at around 10:00 am. There were no letters sent out by the\nRespondent. Mdm Tan continued to chase the Respondent and the tone of her\nmessages showed her serious concern about losing the CPF funds if they were\ndistributed to Mr Sng’s beneficiaries.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent’s conduct in January 2021 showed his patent disregard for his client,\n\nMdm Tan’s interest and plight. His evidence, which the Tribunal was shocked to receive, was\nthat he simply grew tired of the matter and did not want to do anything on it:\n\nPg. 196, ln 24-26 of Transcript\n24\n\nWitness: So I got tired of it. I just didn’t want to do anything, because it\n\n25\n\nshould have been done earlier, but she keep on not providing me\n\n26\n\nwith any lead.\n\nPg. 197, ln 13-23 of Transcript\n\n100.\n\n13\n\nWitness: You see, because between 2016 or so until now, she keep on\n\n14\n\ntelling me she will give me answers, I mean, provide me some\n\n15\n\nlead. And I’ve informed Your Honour, after a while, I just get\n\n16\n\ntired. I don’t know really what to do with her. So then she came\n\n17\n\nback in 2019. So sometimes, when I see it, and then I’ll tell\n\n18\n\nher---I’ll just send her, “Okay. I will do, let you back---know\n\n19\n\ntomorrow.” So that was my problem, because I got too tired after\n\n20\n\n2 years not giving any lead. And then I don’t know whether she\n\n21\n\nunderstands or not. She keep on telling me, “I’ll try to give you\n\n22\n\nsome address.” And then after that, she comes back again and\n\n23\n\nask me, “How about my CPF?”\n\nIt was also disappointing that on 20 January 2021, the Respondent had represented\n34\n\n\fto Mdm Tan that he would be writing to CPFB and that he was in the midst of working on the\nletter. However, we now know this was in fact untrue. His response to her gave her the\nwrongful impression that he was taking some action to obtain the transfer of CPF monies.\n\n101.\n\nThe Applicant’s Closing Submissions dated 10 January 2023 alleged at [36], in the\n\ncontext of the WhatsApp messages, that the Respondent “continued to mislead [Mdm Tan]\ninto thinking that he was taking steps to help her”. Given the seriousness of this allegation, we\nscrutinised the evidence on this point more closely. On 20 January 2021 (at 1:34 am), the\nRespondent messaged Mdm Tan that “I’ll write to CPF tomorrow”. On 20 January 2021 (at\n8.02 pm), he messaged Mdm Tan that “Send you letter tonight as I’m working on it still ok.”\nOn 21 January 2021 (8:52 am), the Respondent messaged Mdm Tan that he was “Sending\nout the letters around 10am”. These messages showed that the Respondent was leading Mdm\nTan to believe that he was doing something about her case, in particular writing to CPFB,\nwhen in truth, he was not doing anything about it because he “got too tired”.75 It was clear to\nus that the Respondent was misleading Mdm Tan, and that the Applicant’s Closing\nSubmissions on this point were justified. Misleading a client per se will constitute an\naggravating factor to the first charge. However, as misleading Mdm Tan was not part of the\ncharge, we need not say more.\n\n102.\n\nReturning to the issue of an implied retainer, we also find that those WhatsApp\n\nmessages in January 2021 support our earlier findings that there was in fact a retainer\nbetween the Respondent and Mdm Tan to vary ORC 13. These messages also presented a\ncoherent picture that Mdm Tan was not earlier advised on Substituted Service or that having\nbeen advised of it, she did not agree to pay for the costs of Substituted Service. We formed\nthese inferences against the Respondent because if what the Respondent said were true, one\nwould have reasonably expected that statements on Substituted Service and related costs\nwould have appeared in one of these messages.\n\n35\n\n\f103.\n\nBased on all the evidence, we came to the conclusion that Mdm Tan was indeed kept\n\nin the dark that SUM 4075 had lapsed for a significant period of 4 years between January\n2017 to around March 2021. TOO LLC took over conduct of the matter on behalf of Mdm Tan\nin late January 2021 and they filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors in the Divorce Suit on 12\nMarch 2021. Upon getting access to the case file, they realised from the FJC’s Registry’s letter\ndated 10 January 2017 that the Respondent had failed to attend the Case Conference on that\ndate nor respond to the said letter to explain his absence.76 The matter was dormant following\nthe said letter.\n\n104.\n\nTo conclude with our determination on the first charge, despite clear instructions from\n\nhis client, the Respondent sat on his hands for close to 1 year before filing SUM 4075 on 25\nNovember 2016. This delay was egregious and showed a patent lack of diligence and\ncompetence on the part of the Respondent. There was no basis for this delay. The\nRespondent instead put Mdm Tan in the invidious position of having to continuously chase\nhim through 2016 to take action to have the CPF monies transferred. Moreover, the\nRespondent failed to advise Mdm Tan of the possibility of Substituted Service of SUM 4075\non Mr Sng and its costs. This fell short of the level of competence expected of a solicitor. When\nSUM 4075 was eventually filed on 25 November 2016, the Respondent was comfortable\nleaving Mdm Tan in the dark about the fact that he had intentionally failed to attend the Case\nConference on 10 January 2017, ignored the FJC’s Registry’s letter on 10 January 2017 to\nexplain his absence, and worst of all, allowed SUM 4075 to lapse. This pattern of keeping\nMdm Tan in the dark over the progress of SUM 4075 continued for a pronounced period of\nsome four years.\n\n105.\n\nWe find that the first charge is made out in that the Respondent’s conduct was in\n\nbreach of Rules 5(2)(c), 5(2)(e), 5(2)(f) and/or 5(2)(h) of the PCR amounting to grossly\nimproper conduct or improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under Section\n83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n36\n\n\fSecond Charge\n\n106.\n\nWe have found that the Respondent indeed failed to attend the Case Conference for\n\nSUM 4075 causing it to lapse, and he failed to advise or update Mdm Tan on his failure to\nattend. We will not repeat those findings. Thus, a prima facie case is established against the\nRespondent on the second charge.\n\n107.\n\nIn his Defence, the Respondent did not plead any defence to this charge nor explain\n\nwhy he failed to attend the Case Conference.\n\n108.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Respondent gave his excuses as to why he failed to attend.\n\nHe repeated this in his Closing Submissions at paragraph 5, where he stated that as Mdm\nTan did not wish to incur the costs of Substituted Service of SUM 4075 by way of an\nadvertisement, and as there was no proper address for Mr Sng, the Respondent did not see\nthe purpose of attending the Case Conference on 10 January 2017. This was effectively the\nsame excuse the Respondent raised to explain his delay in filing SUM 4075 for Mdm Tan, and\nwhy he failed to keep her reasonably informed of the progress of the application. As we have\nalready found, the Respondent did not in fact provide any advice to Mdm Tan on Substituted\nService of SUM 4075 or its costs.\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent’s conduct raised a separate point on the degree of his respect for the\n\nadministration of justice. It was alarming that the Respondent, being an officer of the court,\nshowed an utter disregard for the court and its processes. The Respondent absented himself\nfrom the Case Conference on 10 January 2017, and failed to respond to the FJC’s Registry’s\nletter dated 10 January 2017 despite being directed to do so. Even if the Respondent could\nnot obtain the order he sought because SUM 4075 could not be served, this did not excuse\nthe Respondent to absent himself from a Case Conference he was to attend. The\n37\n\n\fRespondent’s lack of respect for the court and its processes came across clearly in his\nevidence:\n\n110.\n\n3\n\nWitness: Yes, my apologies, Your Honour. The---the reason why I didn’t\n\n4\n\nattend Court---actually, it’s not that I didn’t attend Court, I was\n\n5\n\nlate. But actually I didn’t want to attend. Then I decided to\n\n6\n\nattend. I didn’t just inform---to me, it’s---I informed client on the\n\n7\n\n22nd after I came back, say it’s adjourned to this date and the\n\n8\n\nCourt wants us to serve on him, you’ve got to give me an address,\n\n9\n\notherwise no purpose for me to attend Court. I---I---I said all\n\n10\n\nthese, it’s correct. Of course, I---I did try to attend Court. I was\n\n11\n\nreluctant to attend because I thought I didn’t go and get the order\n\n12\n\nand the Judge will scold me “You don’t have an address, what\n\n13\n\ndo you want me to do”---withdraw the order. So I thought\n\n14\n\nmaybe, if I don’t attend, if she can comes back with it, I can write\n\n15\n\nto the Court to respond. It is---maybe, it’s a bad working by me\n\n16\n\nbut that was the reason.\n\nThere was an obvious risk to his client that SUM 4075 would lapse by reason of the\n\nRespondent’s non-attendance, but the Respondent appeared ready to take this risk to the\nprejudice of Mdm Tan.\n\n111.\n\nTo conclude with our determination on the second charge, it was troubling that the\n\nRespondent as a senior advocate and solicitor failed to attend the Case Conference on 10\nJanuary 2017 without good reason. Apart from doing a disservice to his client, this fell short of\nthe conduct expected of an officer of the court. He also chose not to inform Mdm Tan of his\nnon-attendance, nor of the FJC’s Registry’s letter seeking an explanation from the parties, and\nthe possibility that SUM 4075 would lapse. This fell far short of the standards of diligence and\n\n38\n\n\fcompetence expected of a solicitor, whose very role is to look after his client’s interest.\n\n112.\n\nIn our view, the second charge is also made out in that the Respondent’s conduct was\n\nin breach of Rules 5(2)(c) and 5(2)(e) of the PCR amounting to grossly improper conduct or\nimproper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\nThird Charge\n\n113.\n\nSometime in January 2021, Mdm Tan appointed the law firm TOO LLC to take over\n\nconduct from Seah & Co. for the recovery of monies from Mr Sng’s CPF account.77\n\n114.\n\nIn the space of 3 months, TOO LLC sent Seah & Co. four letters, on 28 January 2021,\n\n8 February 2021, 3 March 2021 and 12 March 2021 seeking an urgent handover of the\ndocuments related to the Divorce Suit, among other documents. TOO LLC’s 2nd letter dated 8\nFebruary 2021 reminding Seah & Co. to comply with the request referred to a telephone\nconversation between the Respondent and TOO LLC’s lawyer Ms Anna Oei in which the\nRespondent mentioned that he will respond to TOO LLC in 2 days.\n\n115.\n\nThe evidence shows that the Respondent ignored the 4 letters requesting for a\n\nhandover. The Respondent did not dispute this.\n\n116.\n\nInstead, the Respondent sought to justify his conduct on the basis that he was\n\nundergoing chemotherapy at that point and could not attend to the request.78 While anyone\nwould instinctively sympathise with the Respondent’s medical issues and wish him a speedy\nrecovery, his explanation of the medical issues unfortunately did not sit well with the\nchronology of dates when they were closely scrutinised.\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent’s oral evidence was that he had an emergency operation in October\n39\n\n\f2021,79 and thereafter, he had been undergoing chemotherapy from November 2021 to June\n2022.80 But these medical procedures took place long after TOO LLC’s requests made\nbetween January to March 2021. When confronted with this difference in time periods, the\nRespondent accepted that at the time of TOO LLC’s requests, he did not know he had cancer\nbut was simply trying to “cut down [his] practice” and “wanted to shift office”. These new\nexcuses do not in any way justify the Respondent’s failure of handing over the documents\nrelating to the Divorce Suit and responding to TOO LLC.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent also suggested that Mdm Tan already had copies of the Interim\n\nJudgment, Ancillary Order of Court (i.e., ORC 13) and Certificate of Final Judgment in the\nDivorce Suit, which was given to Mdm Tan in January 2015 before the file in Seah & Co.’s\nrecords were closed. The rest of the documents were subsequently disposed by the\nRespondent. As the charge brought by the Applicant does not allege that there was any wrong\ncommitted by the Respondent in disposing the Divorce Suit file, we make no finding in relation\nto it. We however hold that even if a client was in possession of documents, it does not excuse\na solicitor from handing over the client’s documents in his possession to the solicitors taking\nover the file. The basis for this is clear. A solicitor is expected to maintain a proper, complete,\nand secure record of the client’s documents and would be in a better position than his client\nto provide a handover of all documents to allow the new solicitors to effectively take over\nconduct. The law and practice does not expect a lay client to keep a complete set of papers\nin order to instruct the new solicitors.\n\n119.\n\nIt was only after Mdm Tan filed OS 1258 on 9 December 2021 to compel the\n\nRespondent to deliver up documents to effectively take over conduct of the Divorce Suit that\non or around 15 March 2022, the Respondent finally gave a handover of documents in Seah\n& Co.’s possession. The documents handed over, which are contained in the Applicant’s\nSupplementary Bundle of Documents, comprised of around 53 documents spanning 113\npages. The handover was more than 1 full year after TOO LLC’s initial request in January\n40\n\n\f2021, which was totally unacceptable.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent’s initial approach to OS 1258 raises a separate cause for concern.\n\nHe filed a reply affidavit on 15 February 2022 contesting the application on the basis that Mdm\nTan had already been given copies of all documents, and the application in OS 1258 was\ntherefore “frivolous, vexatious and otherwise an abuse of process”. If anything, it was the\nRespondent’s own conduct in not timeously responding to TOO LLC that was reprehensible.\n\n121.\n\nIn the course of cross-examination, the Respondent gave an excuse that when he\n\nreceived TOO LLC’s letters, he instructed his secretary Ms Chan Cheng Yee (“Ms Yee”) to\nlook for the files for handover but she had failed to do so, and the Respondent did not then\nfollow up with Ms Yee.81 This defence of passing the buck, so to speak, to his secretary was\nneither pleaded in the Respondent’s Defence nor stated in the Respondent’s AEIC. In any\nevent, the Respondent orally accepted during the Hearing that it was his personal\nresponsibility to carry out the handover and it was unfair to shift the blame to his secretary Ms\nYee who was under his supervision.82 Further, Ms Yee was not called as a witness to\ncorroborate the Respondent’s bare assertion. We therefore cannot and do not accept this\nexcuse.\n\n122.\n\nThe Applicant’s Closing Submissions made a more serious insinuation that the\n\nRespondent deliberately failed to handover critical documents, suggesting an attempt to\nconceal evidence, conduct which would be dishonest and fraudulent. The Tribunal therefore\npaid closer attention to the evidence.\n\n123.\n\nThe missing documents allegedly included: (a) those relating to SUM 4075 to vary\n\nORC 13 (including SUM 4075, Mdm Tan’s Affidavit, and the FJC’s Registry’s letter dated 10\nJanuary 2017) (referred to in this decision as “Category A”); and (b) Seah & Co.’s letter to\nCPFB dated 23 November 2015 and CPFB’s reply letter dated 1 December 2015 (referred to\n41\n\n\fin this decision as “Category B”). Apart from the fact that these documents were important for\na proper handover as they were the most relevant to the issue of transfer of CPF monies from\nMr Sng’s CPF account to Mdm Tan’s, these documents also formed critical evidence which\nthe Tribunal has relied on to establish the Respondent’s liability in respect of the first and most\nserious charge.\n\n124.\n\nIn respect of the Category A documents, TOO LLC’s letter to Seah & Co. dated 29\n\nApril 2022, after the handover, recorded that “[i]nsofar as Paragraph 4 suggests that file (Ref.:\n141/15C) contains documents relating to FC/SUM 4075/2016 and Affidavits relating to the\namendment of the Order of Court of 28 November 2014, please that we have perused the\ndocuments in the file handed to our firm and have found NO DOCUMENTS relating to FC/SUM\n4075/2016 in the file”. There was no evidence that Seah & Co. responded to this letter.\n\n125.\n\nIn respect of the Category B documents, the 2 letters which related to the sale of the\n\nFlat bore the exact same file reference no. “141/15C” as the office file maintained by Seah &\nCo. in respect of the sale of the Flat. It was this office file bearing file reference no. “141/15C”\nthat was handed over by Seah & Co. to TOO LLC. We should add that the office file appeared\nto contain all documents, even the most ordinary, in respect of the sale of the Flat.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent’s case, which was not contradicted by the Applicant, was that he was\n\nnot involved in the preparation of the file for handover. This was done by his secretary Ms Yee\nbased on his instructions to hand the entire file over to TOO LLC. 83 He did not know why the\nCategory A and Category B documents were missing from the file handed over, assuming\nthey were missing, but maintained that he was not involved in preparing the file.84\n\n127.\n\nWhile there appears some basis for the Applicant to suspect that the Category A and\n\nCategory B documents were deliberately omitted in the course of the handover, or worse still\nthat the Respondent had concealed or destroyed those documents, given the seriousness of\n42\n\n\fthe allegation, a high degree of proof is required. On scrutiny of the evidence, we are not\nprepared to conclude that the Applicant has discharged its burden of proof on this point. Our\nreasons are as follows:\n\na)\n\nFirst and most importantly, the third charge does not expressly allege that the\nRespondent was in any way dishonest in the handover, but rather that he\nsimply failed to respond and/or comply with TOO LLC’s request for a handover.\nFor such a serious allegation that the Respondent had deliberately withheld\ndocuments at the handover, the charge should be appropriately framed so that\nthe Respondent has fair notice of a more serious case to answer;\n\nb)\n\nSecond, the Respondent’s secretary Ms Yee who prepared the file for the\nhandover was also not called as a witness to give evidence on the instructions\nshe received from the Respondent, and how she prepared the file for the\nhandover. In fairness to the Applicant, the fact of Ms Yee’s involvement was\nonly brought up in the course of the cross-examination of the Respondent at\nthe Hearing. The Applicant could have sought a further hearing date to call Ms\nYee as a witness to give evidence, but did not make such a request; and\n\nc)\n\nLastly, while TOO LLC’s letter to Seah & Co. dated 29 April 2022 did indeed\nrecord that the Category A documents were missing from the file, this was not\nsufficient to prove the contents of the letter. Ms Oei was not called as a witness\nto give evidence on the process of the handover and how the documents were\ndealt with upon receipt. More importantly, the Respondent was not given an\nopportunity to cross-examine Ms Oei on the handover.\n\n43\n\n\f128.\n\nTo conclude with our determination on the third charge, the Respondent’s conduct in\n\nfailing to respond to and comply with TOO LLC’s request for a handover of documents relating\nto the Divorce Suit was egregious. Despite various requests between January to March 2021,\nthe Respondent simply ignored them to the prejudice of his client. The Respondent finally took\nmore than 1 full year to handover a file of some documents to TOO LLC in March 2022. All\nlawyers have an ethical duty to assist their client’s new solicitors to take over the matter\npromptly and effectively. But in this case, rather than assisting, the Respondent took the\nopposite course by becoming an obstacle, challenging the request for documents as being\nfrivolous and vexatious. The Respondent by his conduct has displayed a lack of courtesy and\nfairness to TOO LLC who were trying to help Mdm Tan urgently, in a problem that the\nRespondent could have averted had he acted properly for his client in the first place.\n\n129.\n\nIn our view, the third charge is made out in that the Respondent’s conduct was in\n\nbreach of Rules 5(2)(e), 5(2)(f) and/or 7(2) of the PCR amounting to grossly improper conduct\nor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(b) of the\nLPA.\n\nAncillary issue on solicitor interference during cross-examination\n\n130.\n\nBefore the Hearing commenced, the Applicant sought the Tribunal’s leave for Ms Oei\n\nof TOO LLC, Mdm Tan’s present solicitor, to sit in and observe the proceedings. The\nRespondent informed the Tribunal that he had no objection to this and thus, the Tribunal\nallowed Ms Oei to sit in.85\n\n131.\n\nIn the course of the Respondent’s cross-examination of Mdm Tan in the morning of\n\nthe Hearing, the Tribunal had difficulties following Mdm Tan’s evidence because she was at\ntimes not listening to the questions, not answering questions directly, or at times taking too\nlong to answer. To be clear, this did not affect the credibility of her evidence. However, it was\n44\n\n\fdisruptive to the proceedings. Before adjourning for lunch, the Tribunal directed the Applicant’s\ncounsel, Ms Jill Ann Koh (“Ms Koh”) to advise Mdm Tan to answer the questions directly and\npromptly, so that the proceedings could move along efficiently.86 Mdm Tan was still under oath\nas her cross-examination and re-examination had not been completed.\n\n132.\n\nWhen the Hearing resumed after lunch, the Respondent raised an ancillary issue that\n\nMs Oei (instead of Ms Koh) had spoken to Mdm Tan. He recounted that this conversation\nhappened in his presence.87 He then raised an objection to Ms Oei’s continued presence in\nthe proceedings.\n\n133.\n\nThere might have been a misunderstanding on whether it was to be Ms Koh or Ms Oei\n\nto advise Mdm Tan to listen to the questions and answer directly. We did not think there was\nany prejudice to the Respondent by this apparent misunderstanding. Ms Oei only spoke to\nMdm Tan in the Respondent and Ms Koh’s presence.88 There was no suggestion that Ms Oei\ndiscussed the substance of Mdm Tan’s evidence with her.89 Ms Koh, who was also part of the\nconversation, confirmed that the contents of Mdm Tan’s evidence was not discussed.90 The\nRespondent did not dispute this. However, given that the proceedings are confidential in\nnature and that the Respondent was objecting to Ms Oei’s continued presence in the\nproceedings, the Tribunal invited Ms Oei to leave the proceedings.\n\nTribunal’s determination on cause of sufficient gravity\n\n134.\n\nUnder Section 93(1) of the LPA, the Tribunal shall record its findings in relation to the\n\nfacts of the case and according to those facts shall determine whether:\n\na)\n\nNo cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83 of\nthe LPA;\n\n45\n\n\fb)\n\nWhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section\n83 of the LPA, the lawyer should be sanctioned with a (i) penalty; (ii) reprimand;\n(iii) order to comply with one or more remedial measures; or (iii) subjected to\nthe measure in (iii) in addition to the measures in either (i) or (ii); or\n\nc)\n\nCause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83 of the\nLPA.\n\n135.\n\nOn the question of whether due cause has been shown, the Tribunal is guided by the\n\nApplicant’s submissions based on the following authorities, which are most relevant to the\npresent case:\n\na)\n\nIn Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2020] 4 SLR 1171,91 the\nsolicitor concerned was found to have failed to attend a hearing on 11 April\n2017 or make any arrangements to obtain an adjournment. By such conduct,\nthe C3J found that he “held little regard for his client’s interests, illustrated by\nhis total inaction over a period of 14 months”. Further, the solicitor ignored his\nrespondent’s persistent attempts to contact him. On the totality of the facts,\nthese were circumstances the C3J found to be due cause for disciplinary\naction; and\n\nb)\n\nIn the recent case of Law Society of Singapore v Ooi Oon Tat [2022] SGHC\n185,92 despite an interlocutory judgment on liability in his client’s favour, the\nsolicitor concerned inexplicably failed to take steps to comply with or advise his\nclient on the requests and an unless order for production of documents\npertaining to assessment of damages. This was even though the solicitor had\npossession of those documents and had been reminded by his client to\nexpedite the matter. This ultimately resulted in the client’s suit being struck off,\n46\n\n\fand it could not be recommenced because it was time-barred. Such misconduct\nwas over a prolonged period of around 5 months, from August 2016 to January\n2017. Further, the solicitor neglected to keep his client informed of these\nsignificant developments in his case. These were circumstances the C3J found\nto be due cause for disciplinary action.\n\n136.\n\nIn the Tribunal’s view, all 3 main charges of misconduct against the Respondent\n\namounting to (a) grossly improper conduct; or (b) improper conduct or practice as an advocate\nand solicitor, within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, have been proven. The\nTribunal also finds that the alternative 3 charges of amounting to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor in the discharge of his professional duty as an officer of the Supreme\nCourt or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of\nthe LPA, have also been made out. Due cause has therefore been shown under Section 83(2)\nof the LPA, and in respect of all 3 main charges, the Tribunal finds that pursuant to Section\n93(1) of the LPA that there is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section\n83 of the LPA.\n\n137.\n\nHaving found that the charges against the Respondent are established and there is\n\ndue cause, we proceed to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors present in this case\nwhich would be relevant to the question of the sanction to be eventually imposed on the\nRespondent.\n\n138.\n\nThere were several aggravating factors present in this case which deserve\n\nhighlighting:\n\na)\n\nThe Respondent is a very senior lawyer. At the time he first began acting for\nMdm Tan in 2013, he was a lawyer of 32 years’ standing and in 2021, he was\nof 40 years’ standing;\n47\n\n\fb)\n\nDespite there being compelling evidence of a retainer relationship between the\nRespondent and Mdm Tan, the Respondent raised the patently unmeritorious\ndefence that there was no retainer. While the Respondent is free to raise any\ndefence, the fact that he challenged the retainer relationship without basis was\nreflective of his lack of contrition for the plight he had put Mdm Tan in;\n\nc)\n\nThe period of delay of close to 1 year the Respondent took to file SUM 4075\nwas unacceptably long;\n\nd)\n\nMdm Tan was kept in the dark about SUM 4075 lapsing for a pronounced\nperiod of 4 years, until Mdm Tan finally sought a change of solicitors. Even\nthen, in January 2021, the Respondent misled Mdm Tan into thinking that he\nwas in fact taking some action when he was in fact doing nothing about it;\n\ne)\n\nThe Respondent was alive to the risk that SUM 4075 would lapse by his\nconduct in failing to attend the Case Conference on 10 January 2017 but he\ndid not mind putting his client in such an invidious position; and\n\nf)\n\nThe Respondent acted antithetical to his client’s interest for an urgent handover\nof documents to her new solicitors, knowing that the CPF monies from Mr Sng’s\naccount was in the process of or had already been disbursed to his\nbeneficiaries, to the detriment of Mdm Tan.\n\n139.\n\nAt the close of the Hearing, without prejudging the matter, we directed the Respondent\n\nto include in his Closing Submissions any mitigating factors he wished to rely on in the event\nhe was found guilty.93 Alternatively, we gave the Respondent the right to request for a further\nhearing to mitigate, if necessary, in the event he was found guilty. The Respondent informed\n\n48\n\n\fthe Tribunal that he did not require a further hearing.94\n\n140.\n\nIn the Respondent’s 2-page Closing Submissions, he stated at [7] and [8] that:\n\n7. Having gone through the hearing, the observations made by the Honourable\nMembers of the Disciplinary Tribunal, your Respondent has reflected on the\nmatter and accept his short-comings.\n\n8. Your Respondent has settled the Complainant's claim out of his own pocket\nprior to the hearing and await the decision and punishment for his shortcomings.\n\n141.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent’s acceptance of his shortcomings\n\nhas come a bit too late.\n\n142.\n\nSecond, the evidence led in the Hearing showed that the Respondent entered into a\n\nsettlement with Mdm Tan to compensate her the sum of around S$86,000. This is positive in\nterms of vindication for Mdm Tan. However, there is no evidence as to whether the\nRespondent has actually made payment of the agreed compensation sum to Mdm Tan other\nthan his statement at paragraph 8 of his Closing Submission (see [140] above). The Applicant\nhas not rebutted this. Assuming that he has made full payment, the mitigatory effect of this\nfact is of little value because the Respondent had only agreed to settle the claim by Mdm Tan\nin Suit 2582 on the day of the Hearing of this matter after default judgment had already been\nobtained on 12 September 202295. The Respondent forced Mdm Tan to jump through several\nhoops, by filing a claim in Suit 2582 on 9 December 2021 to claim damages for negligence\nand breach of duty, by filing OS 1258 on 9 December 2021 to compel the Respondent’s\nhandover of documents, and by filing the Complaint on 25 March 2021 with the Applicant in\nrespect of the Respondent’s conduct. The Respondent’s compensation was hardly timely and\n49\n\n\fvoluntary in nature (see [62] of Gan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor [2019] 4 SLR 838)96.\nHe had after all a judgment against him in Suit 2582 to make good the damages suffered by\nMdm Tan.\n\nCosts\n\n143.\n\nUnder Section 93(2) of the LPA, the Tribunal has the power to make an order for the\n\npayment of costs where it finds cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action:\n\nWhere a Disciplinary Tribunal makes a determination under subsection (1)(b)(i),\n(ii) or (iv) or (c), the Disciplinary Tribunal may make an order for payment by any\nparty of costs, and may, in such order, specify the amount of those costs or direct\nthat the amount be taxed by the Registrar.\n\n144.\n\nThe Applicant sought a sum of S$8,000 plus reasonable disbursements. The sum of\n\nS$8,000 included an uplift component of $2,000 for the Respondent’s dilatory conduct in the\nproceedings. The Respondent did not make any submissions on costs.\n\n145.\n\nIn consideration of the work done by the Applicant, the Tribunal is of the view that the\n\namount sought by the Applicant is fair and reasonable, and accordingly orders pursuant to\nSection 93(2) of the LPA that the Respondent pay the Applicant costs of the proceedings fixed\nat $8,000 plus reasonable disbursements.\n\n146.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal agrees with the Applicant’s submission of an uplift of S$2,000 in\n\ncosts (which is included in the S$8,000 amount submitted). The Respondent was indeed\ndilatory in his conduct in these proceedings, and displayed a sense of disregard for the\ndisciplinary process:\n\n50\n\n\fa)\n\nHe twice failed to comply with the Tribunal’s directions to file his Defence (first\nby 11 August 2022 and second by 31 August 2022), eventually filing it on 6\nSeptember 2022;\n\nb)\n\nHe failed to comply with the Tribunal’s directions to file his AEIC, Bundle of\nDocuments and Bundle of Authorities (by 7 October 2022), eventually filing only\nhis AEIC on 22 November 2022;\n\nc)\n\nHe did not file any Opening Statement, despite being directed by the Tribunal\nto do so by 25 November 2022; and\n\nd)\n\nHe failed to comply with the Tribunal’s direction to file his Closing Submissions\nby 2 January 2023, which was subsequently extended to 10 January 2023 on\nthe Applicant’s request for an extension of time. The Respondent sought a\nfurther extension of time to 31 January 2023, on which he finally filed his\nClosing Submissions.\n\nDated this 27th day of April 2023\n\nMr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC\n\nMr G Radakrishnan\n\n(President)\n\n(Member)\n\n51\n\n\f1 [4] of Mdm Tan’s AEIC;

The following main charges, referencing section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (the Act) for improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty as an advocate and solicitor, were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nFirst Charge – For charging the Complainant fees which were in excess and disproportionate to what he was fairly entitled to charge for the services rendered, thereby breaching Rule 17(7) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (PCR).\n\nSecond Charge – For failing to properly and periodically advise the Complainant of the anticipated legal fee that might be incurred in representing the Company in the three lawsuits, failing to properly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant whether any consequence of the matters involving the Complainant and/or the Company justified the expense of, or the risk involved in, pursuing the matters in litigation throughout the Material Time, and failed to properly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant the use of alternative dispute resolution processes throughout the Material Time, and despite such failures, proceeded to bill the Company a total of $423,880.96 (including GST and disbursements), thereby breaching Rule 17(2)(e) of the PCR.\n\nThird Charge – For failing to properly and periodically advise the Complainant of the relevant legal issues in the three lawsuits throughout the Material Time, such that the Complainant was able to make an informed decision about how to act in those matters at the Material Time, thereby breaching Rule 17(2)(f) of the PCR.\n\nFourth Charge – For failing to inform the Complainant in writing in or around February 2017 of the Complainant’s right to apply to court to have all of the Respondent’s invoices taxed, when the Complainant raised questions and/or dispute on the Respondent’s invoices, thereby breaching Rule 17(5) of the PCR.\n\nFifth Charge – For failing to inform the Complainant in writing in or around January 2019 of the Complainant’s right to apply to court to have all of the Respondent’s invoices taxed, when the Complainant raised questions and/or dispute on the Respondent’s invoices, thereby breaching Rule 17(5) of the PCR.\n\nSixth Charge – for failing to properly advise the Complainant of the anticipated legal fee that might be incurred in representing the Company in the three lawsuits throughout the Material Time, and/or properly and periodically advise the Complainant of the relevant legal issues in the three lawsuits throughout the Material Time such that the Complainant was able to make an informed decision about how to act in those matters at the Material Time, and/or (iii) to evaluate properly and periodically with the Complainant throughout the Material Time whether any consequence of the matters involving the Complainant and/or the Company justified the expense of, or the risk involved in, pursuing the matters in litigation, and/or (iv) properly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant the use of alternative dispute resolution processes throughout the Material Time, and/or failed to keep accurate timesheets for the work done in the three lawsuits, such that the said total bill can be justified, and despite such failures, proceeded to bill the Company a total of $423,880.96 (including GST and disbursements), thereby breaching Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.\n\nFindings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (DT)\n\nThe DT directed that the hearing of the First Charge would be stayed until the disputed fees were taxed and the Law Society applies to proceed with the First Charge. The DT found that the Second and Third Charges were made out and there was cause for sufficient gravity. The DT found that the Fourth and Fifth Charges were not made out. As the Law Society had taken the position that it would not proceed with the Sixth Charge if the Second and Third Charges were found to be made out, the Sixth Charge was deemed to be withdrawn by the Law Society.\n\nCourt of Three Judges\n\nThe Court of Three Judges found that due cause for disciplinary action was established for the Second and the Third Charges, and ordered that the Respondent be suspended from practice for a period of nine months. The Respondent was also ordered to pay costs and disbursements to the Law Society in the sum of S$32,000.00.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n\n\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jan_25_Andrew_Hanam_DT_Report_compressed.pdf","pdf-content":"DT/03/2021\n\nIN THE MATTER OF ANDREW JOHN HANAM\nAND\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROCESSION ACT 1966\n\nREPORT OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal\nMr Lee Eng Beng, SC – President\nMr Wong Siew Hong – Advocate & Solicitor\n\nCounsel for the Law Society\nMs Shobna Chandran,\nMr Muhammad Taufiq bin Suraidi\nand Ms Phoebe Tan\n(Tan Rajah & Cheah)\n\nDated this\n\nRespondent in Person\n\n27th\n\nday of May 2022\n\n1\n\n\fA.\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\nThe Charges against the Respondent arise out of his conduct of 3 sets of legal\nproceedings for P&P Engineering & Construction Pte Ltd (“P&P”), namely, High\nCourt Suit 1255 of 2016 (“Suit 1255”); District Court Suit 1043 of 2018 (“DC 1043”)\nand High Court Suit 1167 of 2017 (“Suit 1167”). The Complaint is Mr Krisnamoorthy\nPugazendhi, the director of P&P.\n2.\nThe Charges are set out in full in the Appendix. The 1st Charge (and Alternative\n1st Charge) have been stayed (for reasons set out in our Interim Report dated 24 May\n2021), and the hearing proceeded for the 2nd to 6th Charges (and their respective\nAlternative Charges). The 2nd to 6th Charges relate to the Respondent’s conduct in the\nlegal proceedings between 25 November 2016 and 24 August 2019. Appendix A also\nincludes a proposed 7th Charge and a proposed Alternative 7th Charge which were\nunsuccessfully sought to be introduced by the Law Society after the filing of closing\nand reply submissions.\n3.\n\nIn substance, the complaints against the Respondent are as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent breached rule 17(2)(e) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015 in failing to properly and periodically evaluate with the\nComplaint whether the steps taken in the legal proceedings justified the expense\nof, or the risk in pursuing the litigation, and whether alternative dispute\nresolution processes should be used.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent breached rule 17(2)(f) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015 in failing to advise P&P on the relevant legal issues in the\nlegal proceedings, to enable P&P to make an informed decision about how to\nact in the legal proceedings.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent breached rule 17(5) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015 in or around February 2017, and in or around January\n2019, in failing to inform the Complainant in writing of his right to apply to\ncourt to have all of the Respondent’s invoices taxed, when the Complainant\nraised questions and/or disputes on the Respondent’s invoices.\n\nB.\n\nBackground Facts\n\n4.\nTo understand the parties’ respective cases in context, it is necessary to first set\nout a chronological narrative of the material key events leading to and during the\nRespondent’s conduct of Suit 1255, DC 1043 and Suit 1167 on behalf of P&P. It should\nbe noted that, apart from what is set out below, there was a significant number of other\ncourt applications which were made in the course of the 3 sets of legal proceedings.\n5.\nP&P had disputes with a company called Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd (“Kori”)\narising out of 2 sub-contracts for the construction of the Marina Bay MRT Station. The\nfirst contract was for the provision of manpower (the “Manpower Sub-Contract”) and\n\n2\n\n\fthe second was for the supply of steel fabrication works (the “Steel Fabrication SubContract”).\n6.\nIn mid-November 2016, the Complainant approached the Respondent for\nadvice as Kori owed P&P close to $1.5 million under the Sub-Contracts. On 25\nNovember 2016, the Complainant signed a Warrant to Act to appoint the Respondent\nto represent P&P in the recovery of the sums due from Kori under the Sub-Contracts.\n7.\nOn 25 November 2016, Suit 1255 was commenced by P&P against Kori for\npayment of $376,344.93 under the Manpower Sub-Contract and $893,273.66 under the\nSteel Fabrication Sub-Contract. The claim was based only on invoices that had fallen\ndue in November 2016. Further invoices which fell due in December 2016 were not\nincluded in Suit 1255.\n8.\nOn 30 January 2017, Kori filed Summons 431 of 2017 (“SUM 431”) in Suit\n1255 to compel P&P to produce certain documents referred to in its Reply and Defence\nto Counterclaim. P&P was unable to produce these documents. P&P accordingly failed\nto resist SUM 431 before the Assistant Registrar and was ordered to pay costs of $3,200.\nOn 17 February 2017, P&P filed Registrar’s Appeal 44 of 2017 (“RA 44”) against the\ndecision of the Assistant Registrar. At the hearing of RA 44, P&P was ordered to amend\nits pleadings and pay costs of $2,000.\n9.\nOn 17 October 2017, the first day of the trial of Suit 1255, P&P and Kori agreed\non a settlement for the claim under the Manpower Sub-Contract (the “Suit 1255\nSettlement”). Under the Suit 1255 Settlement, Kori agreed to pay P&P the sum of\n$236,731.48, subject to a reduction of $543.73 on account of Kori’s counterclaim\nagainst P&P. However, Kori did not pay P&P the agreed sum under the Suit 1255\nSettlement. Kori took the position that the sum was not immediately payable, but would\nbecome payable only at the conclusion of Suit 1255.\n10.\nMeanwhile, the trial of Suit 1255 continued on P&P’s claim under the Steel\nFabrication Sub-Contract. The first tranche of trial ended on 20 October 2017. On 15\nNovember 2017, P&P filed Summons 5237 of 2021 (“SUM 5237”) for third-party\ndiscovery against Taisei Corporation (“Taisei”), specifically, for the production of eyescan records of P&P workers entering the project site. Taisei then asked for significant\ncosts to review its records and identify the relevant documents. As a result, P&P\nwithdrew SUM 5237 on 1 December 2017 and was ordered to pay costs of $500 to Kori\nand $2,300 to Taisei.\n11.\nOn 7 December 2017, P&P further filed Summons 5616 of 2017 (“SUM 5616”)\nfor leave to call 4 additional witnesses at the trial of Suit 1255. SUM 5616 was\ndismissed with costs of $6,000 ordered against P&P.\n12.\nOn 11 December 2017, P&P filed Suit 1167 against Kori for the payment of the\nsum of $342,821.05 under invoices which had fallen due in December 2016.\n\n3\n\n\f13.\nThe last day of trial for Suit 1255 was 18 March 2018. At this time, Kori still\nhad not made payment of the agreed sum under the Suit 1255 Settlement. On 23 March\n2018, P&P filed Summons 1394 of 2018 (“SUM 1394”) in Suit 1255 to apply for\njudgment on the Suit 1255 Settlement based on an admission of fact. On 9 April 2018,\nSUM 1394 was dismissed and costs of $3,700 were ordered against P&P.\n14.\nOn the same day, 9 April 2018, P&P filed DC 1043 against Kori for the payment\nof the agreed sum under the Suit 1255 Settlement. Kori issued an Offer To Settle in\nDC 1043 on 27 July 2018. P&P did not respond.\n15.\nOn 31 December 2018, the High Court found largely in favour of P&P in Suit\n1255. On 21 January 2019, the High Court also decided Suit 1167 in favour of P&P\nand ordered Kori to pay P&P a total sum of $416,434.69.\n16.\nBy the end of January 2019, the agreed sum under the Suit 1255 Settlement had\nbeen paid by Kori to P&P and the only outstanding issue in DC 1043 was interest of\n$9,588.19 and costs.\n17.\nOn 30 January 2019, Kori issued a second Offer To Settle in DC 1043 offering\nto pay half of the interest, with each party bearing its own costs. P&P did not accept\nand proceeded with the trial of DC 1043 on the basis that it was entitled to interest of\n$9,588.19.\n18.\nOn 16 August 2019, the District Court rejected P&P’s claim in DC 1043 and\nawarded costs of about $20,000 to Kori, including indemnity costs for the costs incurred\nafter the issue of Kori’s second Offer To Settle.\n19.\n\nIn or around August 2019, P&P discharged the Respondent.\n\n20.\nThe Respondent billed P&P a total of $423,880.96 (including GST and\ndisbursements) for the work done on the 3 sets of legal proceedings. The net amount\nrecovered by P&P from Kori in Suit 1255 and Suit 1167 was $185,757.26, after\ndeductions on account of the Respondent’s bills and the payment of costs ordered by\nthe Court.\nC.\n\nThe 2nd And 3rd Charges\n\n21.\nThe 2nd and 3rd Charges (and their respective Alternative Charges) asserted\nbreaches by the Respondent of, respectively, Rules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (“PCR 2015”).\n22.\n\nThe 2nd Charge alleged that the Respondent had failed to:\n\n(a)\n\nproperly and periodically advise the Complainant of the anticipated legal fee\nthat might be incurred in representing P&P in the 3 sets of legal proceedings;\n\n4\n\n\f(b)\n\nproperly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant whether any\nconsequence of the matters involving the Complainant and/or P&P justified the\nexpense of, or the risk involved in, pursuing the matters in litigation; and\n\n(c)\n\nfailed to properly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant the use of\nalternative dispute resolution processes.\n\n23.\nThe 2nd Charge added that, despite these failures, the Respondent proceeded to\nbill P&P a total of $423,880.96 (including GST and disbursements).\n24.\nWe are of the view that the drafting of the 2nd Charge is unsatisfactory. Rule\n17(2)(e) of the PCR 2015 is not a provision that directly deals with the legal fees that a\nsolicitor charges or might charge a client, or imposes a duty on a solicitor to advise the\nclient of anticipated legal fees. These are matters which are more properly covered by\nrules 17(3), 17(7) and 17(8) of the PCR 2015. It should further be noted that the 1st\nCharge in these proceedings, which alleged overcharging and a breach of rule 17(7) of\nthe PCR 2015, has been stayed.\n25.\nAccordingly, we do not think that the allegation set out in paragraph 22(a) above\nand the fact that the Respondent billed P&P the sum of $423,880.96 are relevant to the\ninquiry of whether there was a breach of rule 17(2)(e) of the PCR 2015. We confine\nour consideration of the facts and evidence to the allegations set out in paragraph 22(b)\nand 22(c) above, which materially track the language of rule 17(2)(e) of the PCR 2015.\n26.\nThe drafting of the 3rd Charge does not suffer from a similar defect. It simply\nalleged that the Respondent failed to properly and periodically advise the Complainant\nof the relevant legal issues in the 3 sets of legal proceedings, such that the Complainant\nwas able to make an informed decision about how to act in those matters. This\nmaterially tracks the language of rule 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n27.\nIn his closing and reply submissions, the Respondent objected to the 2nd and 3rd\nCharges on the basis that they were vague and did not contain sufficient particulars of\nthe alleged failures on his part. The Respondent argued that the specific allegations\npursued by the Law Society became apparent only when the Complainant’s AEIC was\nserved. The Respondent further argued that the specific allegations took advantage of\nthe absence of attendance notes of meetings during which he gave verbal advice to the\nComplainant.\n28.\nWe have some sympathy with this submission in that it does appear to us that\nthe 2nd and 3rd Charges were lacking in the particulars of the alleged failures of the\nRespondent to give the required advice. They referred to the 3 sets of legal proceedings\ngenerally but did not set out the specific matters arising in those legal proceedings on\nwhich the Respondent was required to advise under rules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the\nPCR 2015 but failed to do so. Neither did the Law Society’s Statement of Case offer\nany additional significant particulars. Ideally, the 2nd and 3rd Charges should have\nspecified the instances in the 3 sets of proceedings in which the relevant rules were\nbreached.\n\n5\n\n\f29.\n\nHowever, we reject the Respondent’s submission.\n\n30.\nIt was too late for the Respondent to raise the objection in his closing and reply\nsubmissions. The Law Society applied to introduce the 2nd and 3rd Charges on 29 April\n2021. On 3 May 2021, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that he accepted that the\nLaw Society could proffer new charges under s 89(4) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap\n161) (“Legal Profession Act”). He did not raise any objections to the wording of the\n2nd and 3rd Charges.\n31.\nThe Complainant’s AEIC, which gave evidence of the various instances in\nwhich the Respondent allegedly failed to advise in accordance with rules 17(2)(e) and\n17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015, was served on the Respondent on 2 August 2021, and the\nevidential hearing was conducted on 4 days from 17 – 20 August 2021. The\nRespondent cross-examined the Complainant on his AEIC for almost 2 days.\n32.\nOn 20 August 2021, the final day of the evidential hearing, the Law Society\napplied to make a further amendment to the 2nd Charge so that it explicitly stated that\nthe Respondent “failed to properly and periodically evaluate with the Complainant the\nuse of alternative dispute resolution processes”. The Respondent stated that he had no\nobjections to this amendment.\n33.\nThe Respondent did not at any time before the completion of the evidential\nhearing challenge the lack of particularity in the 2nd and 3rd Charges, apply for leave to\nfile a further AEIC, or provide additional documentary evidence. He objected to the\nlack of particulars only in his closing and reply submissions filed on 22 September 2021\nand 8 October 2021 respectively. In our view, the Respondent should have raised his\nchallenge before the start of the evidential hearing or, at the latest, before crossexamining the Complainant. The Respondent did not give any reason why he did not\nraise the objections earlier. In the circumstances, it would be unfairly prejudicial to the\nLaw Society if the Tribunal were to consider a challenge of this nature only after the\nevidential hearing was completed and the closing and reply submissions were being\nexchanged.\n34.\nThe Tribunal is also of the view that no prejudice was caused to the Respondent.\nThe Respondent was given adequate notice of the specific allegations made by the\nComplainant in his AEIC and, indeed, he accepted in his reply submissions that the real\nallegations made by the Law Society surfaced in the Complainant’s AEIC. The\nRespondent is an experienced advocate and solicitor and must be taken to know what\nrules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 required of him in the conduct of the 3 sets\nof legal proceedings. As pointed out above, he had the opportunity to seek leave to\nproduce further documentary evidence and to file an additional AEIC, but did not do\nso.\n35.\nUnder cross-examination, the Respondent testified that he had not breached\nrules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 and, in so far as the relevant advice was\nnot recorded in documentary evidence, it was given during physical meetings with the\n\n6\n\n\fComplainant. It is not apparent to the Tribunal what he would have done differently if\nthe 2nd and 3rd Charges had contained more particulars. In his closing and reply\nsubmissions, the Respondent did not explain how he had been prejudiced and what\nother courses of action he might have taken if the 2nd and 3rd Charges had been more\ncomprehensive. His submission, which we reject, was that the 2nd and 3rd Charges were\nintroduced after the discovery process showed that he did not keep attendance notes of\nhis physical meetings with the Complainant, and were based on evidence manufactured\nby the Complainant.\n36.\nIn the Tribunal’s view, the Law Society’s case was ultimately not unduly vague,\noverly wide nor unfocussed. There was no attempt by the Law Society to deliberately\ntake advantage of the generality of the 2nd and 3rd Charges. In its closing and reply\nsubmissions, the Law Society relied on breaches of rules 17(2) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR\n2015 in what it termed “significant stages” in the 3 sets of legal proceedings. The\nevidence as to what transpired at these stages was also largely undisputed. It appears\nto the Tribunal that there was no real risk that the Respondent could have been caught\noff-guard by an allegation.\n37.\nWe further bear in mind the remarks of the Court of Three Judges in Law Society\nof Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [50]-[58]. It is\nincontrovertible that a solicitor must be given proper notice of all allegations against\nhim such that he has a reasonable opportunity to deal with any complaint levelled\nagainst him. However, this requirement of notice should not be assessed rigidly or\nmechanically, and a lack of notice should not vitiate the proceedings where it is more\ntechnical than real.\nD.\n\nThe Absence Of Attendance Notes Of Meetings\n\n38.\nAt the most rudimentary level, Charges 2 and 3 were directed at the alleged\nfailures of the Respondent to give proper advice to the Complainant on the benefits and\nrisks of pursuing the 3 sets of legal proceedings, the use of alternative dispute resolution\nprocesses, and the relevant legal issues in the proceedings. It was clear from the\ndocumentary evidence before the Tribunal that the advice given by the Respondent to\nthe Complainant in writing fell significantly short of the advice that was required by\nrules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015. Therefore, one of the central questions\nwas whether, apart from advice in writing, the Respondent also gave advice to the\nComplainant verbally.\n39.\nThe Complainant testified that, apart from the meeting on 25 November 2016,\nhe received little verbal advice from the Respondent. The Complainant gave evidence\nthat the primary mode of communication between P&P and the Respondent was by way\nof email. The Respondent did not communicate with the Complainant by telephone or\ntext messages. Physical meetings were few and far between, and were short and brief.\nThe Complainant also testified that from December 2016 to February 2017, the\nRespondent met the Complainant 2 to 3 times per month, but the Respondent met the\nComplainant only about 10 times after February 2017. As for the numerous visits made\n\n7\n\n\fby the Complainant to the Respondent’s office to affirm affidavits, he did not meet the\nRespondent personally except on 2 or 3 occasions.\n40.\nThis was disputed by the Respondent. The Respondent’s evidence under crossexamination was that he had numerous meetings with the Complainant during which\nadvice on various issues was given to the Complainant. He testified that he met the\nComplainant 3 to 4 times per month in 2017 and 2018 and a few times in 2019, and that\noverall, he had close to 100 meetings with the Complainant. Depending on the matters\nthat were discussed, some meetings were short while others were long. He also testified\nthat he updated the Complainant by telephone.\n41.\nHowever, the Respondent admitted that he did not keep any timesheets nor\nattendance notes of any of the meetings and discussions he had with the Complainant.\nNeither did his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) deal specifically with any\nmeetings or discussions he had with the Complainant, apart from the meeting on 25\nNovember 2016 when the Complainant signed the Warrant To Act.\n42.\nThis raised an important issue in these proceedings as the Respondent relied\nsubstantially on his meetings with the Complainant and the advice given in such\nmeetings. He asserted that he had advised the Complainant on the relevant legal issues\nand evaluated with the Complainant the risks and benefits of pursuing certain courses\nof action at such meetings. In many instances, where advice or communications on a\nparticular issue in the legal proceedings was not documented, the Respondent testified\nthat the issue must have been discussed at a meeting with the Complainant.\n43.\nThe Law Society submitted that, in the circumstances, an adverse inference\nshould be drawn against the Respondent due to his failure to keep attendance notes or\ncontemporaneous written records of his meetings with the Respondent. Reference was\nmade to the decisions of the Court of Three Judges in Law Society v Udeh Kumar s/o\nSethuraju [2013] 3 SLR 875 at [70] and Law Society of Singapore v Lau See Jin Jeffrey\n[2017] 4 SLR 148 at [21]. Both cases endorse the reasoning in the earlier decision of\nthe Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Tan Puay Khiang [2007] 3\nSLR(R) 477, which settled the law in this regard. It should be noted that all these cases\nwere considering the position prior to the PCR 2015 coming into force. The proposition\naccepted in these cases that a legal practitioner’s failure to maintain attendance notes\nof dealings with clients did not per se render him in breach of his professional duties\nhas to be qualified. This is because rule 5(2)(k) of the PCR 2015 now requires a legal\npractitioner to keep proper contemporaneous records of all instructions received from,\nand all advice rendered to, the client (emphasis ours).\n44.\nThe other relevant principles laid down by these decisions remain authoritative,\nand the parties did not raise any serious challenge in this regard. A legal practitioner’s\nfailure to maintain attendance notes does not per se deprive the solicitor’s testimony of\nall credibility, but such failure may in appropriate circumstances provide the context in\nwhich the court may draw an adverse inference against the solicitor. The failure to\nmaintain attendance notes may also make it more difficult for the legal practitioner to\nconvincingly persuade the court that his recollection of events is accurate and relates to\n\n8\n\n\fthe case at hand, and not a convenient reconstruction of events or testimony of the legal\npractitioner’s general practice.\n45.\nThe disagreement between the parties was over whether the circumstances of\nthis case, when considered together with the failure of the Respondent to maintain\nattendance notes of his meetings with the Complainant, warranted the drawing of an\nadverse inference against the Respondent. Having reviewed all the facts and evidence,\nwe are of the view that this question should be answered in the affirmative.\n46.\nFirst, based on the number of physical meetings the Respondent asserted that\nhe had with the Complainant and the nature of the alleged discussions at these meetings,\nit is difficult to understand why the Respondent did not maintain attendance notes or\nother contemporaneous records. The Respondent alleged that he must have had close\nto 100 physical meetings with the Complainant, all of which were not accompanied by\nattendance notes. It was during these alleged meetings that the Respondent gave advice\nto the Complainant and evaluated with the Complainant the courses of action which\ncould be taken in the 3 sets of legal proceedings. However, the Respondent did not\ngive any reason why he did not keep any attendance notes of so many meetings during\nwhich substantive and important discussions were conducted with the Complainant.\nNeither were there any follow-up emails recording the discussions that had taken place\nat the meetings.\n47.\nWe are of the view that the importance and prudence of keeping attendance\nnotes of these physical meetings could not have been lost on the Respondent. There\nhave been more than enough exhortations both by the courts and the Law Society that\nsolicitors should maintain attendance notes of their meetings and communications with\nclients. The rationale has been repeatedly explained and applies with the most force in\nrelation to meetings and communications where advice is given to the client. In Law\nSociety of Singapore v Leong Pek Gan [2016] 5 SLR 1091 at [48], in response to a\nsolicitor’s explanation that it was not her practice to record what she explained to her\nclients, the Court of Three Judges remarked that this was particularly troubling in light\nof repeated judicial pronouncements that a solicitor has a duty to keep contemporaneous\nnotes and diligently document each stage of the transaction which the solicitor is\nhandling, especially any significant advice rendered to the client.\n48.\nSecond, the Respondent gave evidence of his physical meetings with the\nComplainant belatedly. The Law Society’s Statement of Case and the 2nd, 3rd and 6th\nCharges (as well as their respective Alternative Charges) made clear allegations that\nthe Respondent had failed to advise on and evaluate with the Complainant various\nissues in relation to the conduct of the 3 sets of legal proceedings. However, in his\nDefence, the Respondent did not refer to the numerous physical meetings he allegedly\nhad with the Complainant. The Respondent’s AEIC also did not refer to the alleged\nnumerous physical meetings or what transpired at them (apart from the meeting on 25\nNovember 2016). It was only under cross-examination that the Respondent gave\nevidence that he must have had close to 100 meetings with the Complainant, during\nwhich he advised and evaluated with the Complainant the issues arising in the course\nof the 3 sets of legal proceedings.\n\n9\n\n\f49.\nThird, there was no objective evidence supporting the Respondent’s evidence\nof the physical meetings with the Complainant. On the contrary, the objective evidence\npointed to the absence of such meetings. In the course of his engagement for the 3 sets\nof legal proceedings, the Respondent did send a number of emails to update the\nComplainant, advise him, or seek or confirm his instructions. In none of these emails\nwere there specific references to the alleged physical meetings between the Respondent\nand the Complainant nor did these emails state what the advice had been given.\n50.\nAs such, we draw an adverse inference against the Respondent. In the instances\nwhere the only evidence proffered by the Respondent is his own testimony, we are not\npersuaded that the alleged numerous physical meetings between the Respondent and\nthe Complainant took place, or that the communications described by the Respondent\ntook place at such meetings. We emphasise, however, that this adverse inference does\nnot extend to physical meetings and communications which are not disputed by the\nComplainant, or which are corroborated by other evidence.\nE.\n\nSuit 1255\n\n51.\nIn relation to Suit 1255, the Law Society contended that the Respondent failed\nto advise the Complainant as required by rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015\nin relation to the following issues:\n(a)\n\nthe commencement of Suit 1255;\n\n(b)\n\na Notice to Produce issued by Kori against P&P on 30 December 2016 and\nKori’s subsequent application in HC/SUM 431/2017;\n\n(c)\n\na settlement agreement between Kori and P&P for part of the sum in dispute in\nSuit 1255 and P&P’s application in HC/SUM 1394/2018 to enforce the\nsettlement agreement; and\n\n(d)\n\nP&P’s applications for discovery of eye-scan records against a third party,\nTaisei Corporation, and for leave to call 4 additional witnesses in HC/SUM\n5237/2017 and HC/SUM 5616/2017 respectively.\n\n52.\nThe Law Society further contended that the Respondent failed to evaluate with\nthe Complainant the use of alternative dispute resolution processes, as required by rule\n17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR 2015 in an appropriate case, at the outset of the Respondent’s\nengagement as well as in the course of Suit 1255.\nThe commencement of Suit 1255\n53.\nThe undisputed facts were that the Complainant met the Respondent on 21 or\n25 November 2016 about P&P’s claim against Kori. A letter of demand earlier issued\nby the Respondent against Kori had not elicited any payment from Kori and the\n\n10\n\n\fRespondent drew a flowchart and explained to him that the next step would be for P&P\nto commence legal proceedings in the High Court.\n54.\nOn 25 November 2016, the Complainant executed a Warrant to Act to appoint\nthe Respondent’s firm to act for him. On the same day, the Respondent emailed a draft\nStatement of Claim to the Complainant, and the Complainant instructed the Respondent\nto proceed. The Respondent separately emailed a letter to the Complainant confirming\nthat the Complainant had instructed the filing of a claim against Kori. Also on the same\nday, Suit 1255 was filed.\n55.\nWhat is disputed is whether the Respondent properly advised the Complainant\nin 4 respects before the commencement of Suit 1255.\n56.\nFirst, the Law Society submitted that the Respondent failed to advise the\nComplainant in relation to the Warrant to Act executed by the Complainant. It was\npointed out that the Respondent did not discuss or explain the terms of the Warrant to\nAct with the Complainant, and that the Complainant had a limited ability to read and\nunderstand English. This was a breach of rule 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n57.\nWe reject this submission as we do not see the basis for applying rule 17(2)(f)\nof the PCR 2015 on the facts. The rule generally requires a legal practitioner to advise\na client on the relevant legal issues in a matter to enable the client to make an informed\ndecision about how to act in the matter. The evidence does not suggest that the\nComplainant was not agreeable to any of the terms of the Warrant to Act or was not\nmaking an informed decision in executing the Warrant to Act. We do not see any\nrelevant legal issues on which rule 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 would have required the\nRespondent to advise the Complainant.\n58.\nThe Law Society next contended that the Respondent did not explain to the\nComplainant the steps and timelines involved in the commencement of the suit or the\npossibility of parties commencing numerous interlocutory applications. The\nRespondent also did not tell him that P&P might have to pay costs to Kori if it was\nunsuccessful in the suit or any interlocutory applications. Neither did the Respondent\nadvise the Complainant of the anticipated legal costs that could be incurred up to the\nconclusion of the suit.\n59.\nThe Tribunal does not think that these allegations are made out. The flowchart\ndrawn by the Respondent at the meeting on 21 or 25 November 2016 was not given to\nthe Complainant and was not adduced in evidence before the Tribunal. Under crossexamination, the Complainant stated that the flowchart was very short and simple and\ndid not cover detailed steps in the litigation process. However, we found his evidence\nunclear and lacking in specificity.\n60.\nIn his letter of complaint to the Law Society, the Complainant described the\nsituation somewhat differently. He stated that after the Respondent had gone through\nthe documents and his explanation on the claim against Kori, the Respondent explained\n“with a sketch drawing the overall steps to be taken to recover the payment”. The\n\n11\n\n\fRespondent’s letter to the Complainant dated 25 November 2016 alluded to the\ntimelines for the filing of the Memorandum of Appearance and the Defence and\nCounterclaim, and that an application for summary judgment could be filed if the\nDefence had no merit. It also set out the legal fees at $700 per hour. The Warrant to\nAct signed by the Complainant further stated that P&P might be ordered to pay its\nopponent’s legal fees, in addition to the legal fees due to the Respondent’s firm.\n61.\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Law Society’s allegations are\nnot made out on the evidence. The evidence of the Complainant on the allegations was\nunsatisfactory. The other evidence suggests that at least some advice was given on the\nissues of litigation steps and timelines, the risk of being subject to adverse cost orders,\nand anticipated legal costs.\n62.\nIn addition, we do not think that a solicitor’s duty to advise the client of the risk\nof being subject to adverse cost orders and of anticipated legal costs comes within the\npurview of rules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015. These issues are specifically\ngoverned by rules 17(3) and 17(4) of the PCR 2015.\n63.\nThe Law Society’s third contention was that the Respondent failed to advise the\nComplainant of the option of commencing an adjudication under the Building and\nConstruction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap 30B, 2006 Rev Ed)(“SOPA\nAdjudication”). There was no documentary evidence indicating that advice on the\npossibility of a SOPA Adjudication was given by the Respondent. The Respondent’s\nAEIC also did not mention that such advice was given.\n64.\nThe Tribunal finds that this contention of the Law Society has been made out.\nThe option of a SOPA Adjudication would have been a very material consideration for\nthe Complainant when deciding whether to commence Suit 1255. Legal advice on this\noption would have been important and perhaps even determinative of the\nComplainant’s decision as to whether Suit 1255 should be commenced. Proper advice\non the point would also have required a description of the nature of a SOPA\nAdjudication and a comparison of its advantages and disadvantages with the normal\nlitigation process. It was not advice that a prudent and diligent solicitor would make\norally without some documentary follow-up or record. But there is a complete absence\nof documentary evidence in the present case setting out the advice given or even\nindicating that advice on a SOPA Adjudication had been given. There is a similar\nabsence of any mention of a SOPA Adjudication in the Respondent’s AEIC.\n65.\nThe Tribunal also finds the Complainant’s evidence that he was not advised of\na SOPA Adjudication more probable. Given P&P’s financial constraints at that time,\nit is likely that the Complainant would at least have seriously considered the option of\na SOPA Adjudication before commencing Suit 1255. But there is nothing to explain\nwhy the Complainant decided to commence Suit 1255 instead. Upon questioning by\nthe Tribunal, the Respondent stated that he did advise the Complainant of the possibility\nof a SOPA Adjudication but also told him that Kori could delay it by challenging it in\ncourt. The Respondent also gave evidence that the Complainant wanted to proceed,\nand to proceed fast. The Tribunal is unable to give weight to this as the Respondent’s\n\n12\n\n\fpurported advice is inconsistent with the nature and raison d'être of a SOPA\nAdjudication. A SOPA Adjudication seeks to facilitate payments for goods or services\nproviders in the building and construction industry, and to provide quick and lowercost resolution of payment disputes through adjudication. It is difficult to understand\nwhy the Respondent would not have availed himself of a SOPA Adjudication if the\nRespondent had advised him of its availability.\n66.\nThe Law Society’s final contention related to the fact that Suit 1255 was\ncommenced only in respect of P&P’s invoices which had fallen due as of 25 November\n2016, specifically, it sought payment of the sum of $1,132,384.28 plus interest and\ncosts. There were other invoices which fell due within a month after that date. In fact,\non 23 December 2016, the Respondent sent a letter of demand to Kori’s solicitors for\nthe payment of the sum of $371,720.14 for further invoices which had fallen due. These\ninvoices ultimately became the subject of a separate suit, Suit 1167, which was\ncommenced almost a year later on 11 December 2017.\n67.\nThe Law Society contended that the Respondent did not advise the Complainant\nof the option of commencing Suit 1255 only after all invoices had fallen due. The\nRespondent had not evaluated with the Complainant the risks and benefits of\ncommencing Suit 1255 on 25 November 2016 as compared to the option of waiting\nuntil all invoices had become due, and had not given advice to enable the Complainant\nto make an informed decision on the commencement of Suit 1255. The Respondent\nhad therefore breached rules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n68.\nThe Complainant’s evidence supported this. The Complainant testified that at\nhis meeting with the Respondent on 21 or 25 November 2016, the Respondent advised\nhim that P&P should first file a claim on the invoices due in November 2016, and then\npursue the invoices which fell due later. The Respondent did not advise him of the\noption of filing a claim only after all invoices had become due.\n69.\nThere was no documentary evidence showing that the Respondent had given\nthe relevant advice to the Complainant. On 25 November 2016 at 4:24pm, the\nRespondent emailed the Complainant with a draft Statement of Claim covering the\ninvoices which had fallen due on that date. At 5:38pm, Suit 1255 was filed. At 5:41pm,\nthe Complainant emailed the Respondent with his instructions to proceed with the filing.\nAt 5:43pm, the Respondent emailed a letter to the Complainant. The material part of\nthis letter stated:\nWe had earlier sent you in draft the Statement of Claim for you to peruse and\nto inform us of any errors that need to be corrected. For both your Fabrication\nClaim and the Manpower Claim, we have not included the November 2016\ninvoices as these are not due and payable yet by Kori. We will file these claims\nseparately in December 2016. We will file your claim today as discussed.\n70.\nThe Respondent gave evidence that he told the Complainant on 25 November\n2016 of the options of waiting until December 2016 to file a single suit, or to file 2 suits\nin November 2016 and December 2016 respectively. According to the Respondent, the\n\n13\n\n\fComplainant opted for 2 suits. The Respondent also testified that the Complainant\nwanted to proceed immediately, and did not want to wait even 1 month even though he\nknew that Suit 1255 might take months or even more than a year to be resolved.\nHowever, the Respondent did not provide his own view of what the Complainant should\ndo, and he told the Complainant that the decision was his. The Respondent further gave\nevidence that, as Kori had indicated that it might sue P&P, the Complainant wanted to\nsue first instead of making a counterclaim against Kori.\n71.\nThe Tribunal prefers the Complainant’s evidence to that of the Respondent. We\nfind that the Complainant decided to commence 2 suits because he had not been advised\nby the Respondent of the more sensible and practical option of filing a single suit a\nmonth later covering all outstanding invoices. We are unable to accept the\nRespondent’s explanation that the Complainant decided to commence 2 suits because\nhe wanted to be the plaintiff instead of having to make a counterclaim against Kori. It\nis not apparent at all why the Complainant would take such a position. The Respondent\ndid not offer any explanation. In fact, his own evidence was that he did not provide his\nown view of what the Complainant should do, and did not find out why the Complainant\nwas insistent on starting a claim immediately instead of making a counterclaim.\n72.\nThe Tribunal also relies on the lack of attendance notes or documentary\nevidence showing that the relevant advice had been given by the Respondent. The\nadvice was important and substantive advice and, if it had been given, it would more\nlikely than not have been recorded or alluded to in the Respondent’s letter of 25\nNovember 2016 to the Complainant. Instead, the letter merely stated that there would\nbe 2 suits. Further, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not state in his AEIC\nthat the relevant advice had been given to the Complainant, or the reasons why the\nComplainant commenced 2 suits instead a single suit in December 2016.\nKori’s application for production of documents\n73.\nOn 30 December 2016, Kori issued a Notice to Produce for P&P to disclose\ndocuments referred to in paragraph 8(iv) of its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim.\nParagraph 8(iv) pleaded that all the workers supplied by P&P to Kori “had the necessary\nregulatory approval to work in Singapore and had the relevant qualifications for the\nclaimed category of work”. It further pleaded that P&P had provided all necessary\ndocumentation to Kori.\n74.\nP&P did not respond to Kori’s Notice to Produce and, on 31 January 2017, Kori\nfiled an application in HC/SUM 431/2017 (“SUM 431”) seeking a court order against\nP&P for production of the documents. On 3 February 2021, the Respondent forwarded\nto the Complainant a copy of SUM 431 and stated that the Respondent would be\nobjecting to the application based on the lack of relevance of the documents. The\nRespondent also forwarded a copy of his draft opposing submissions.\n75.\nThe Assistant Registrar allowed SUM 431 on 15 February 2017 and ordered\nP&P to pay costs of $3,200 to Kori. The Respondent informed the Complainant of this\n\n14\n\n\fon the same day. The Respondent further stated that he was of the opinion that the\nAssistant Registrar was wrong, and that P&P should appeal.\n76.\nOn 16 February 2017, the Respondent sent to the Complainant a draft of the\nNotice of Appeal to Judge in Chambers and asked him to come to his office to sign the\nsupporting affidavit. An appeal by way of HC/RA 44 of 2017 (“RA 44”) was filed on\nthe same day. RA 44 was heard by the Judge on 6 March 2017. The Judge varied the\nterms of the order granted by the Assistant Registrar, and gave leave to P&P to amend\nparagraph 8(iv) of the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim. P&P was ordered to pay\ncosts of $2,000 to Kori.\n77.\nThe Law Society submitted that the Respondent failed to comply with rules\n17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 as he did not conduct a risk-benefit evaluation\nwith the Complainant, or advise the Complainant on the relevant legal issues, in relation\nto dealing with Kori’s application for production of documents. The Law Society relied\non the evidence of the Complainant that he had not been advised by the Respondent on\nthe merits and risks in resisting SUM 431 and filing RA 44. The Complainant testified\nthat, if he had been properly advised by the Defendant, he would have asked for time\nto produce the relevant documents rather than challenge the application for production\nof documents. There was also nothing on the face of the documentary evidence that\nshowed that the Respondent had conducted the necessary evaluation or rendered the\nrelevant advice. The Respondent simply informed the Complainant of the\nRespondent’s proposed courses of action and did not advise the Complainant of his\noptions.\n78.\nThe Respondent’s evidence was that, at a discussion, he was told by the\nComplainant that he did not have the documents which were the subject of the Notice\nto Produce. The Respondent felt that, in any event, the documents were not material to\nP&P’s claim. He was not in favour of amending the Reply and Defence to\nCounterclaim, as costs would have been payable for the amendment. He felt that,\ninstead, P&P should resist any application by Kori for the production of the documents.\nIf P&P was successful in this regard, Kori would have to pay costs to P&P. The\nRespondent also disagreed with the Law Society that he did not conduct the required\nevaluation with, or render the relevant advice to, the Complainant. The Respondent\nalso gave evidence that the Complainant agreed to resist SUM 431 on grounds of\nirrelevance.\n79.\nThe Tribunal finds against the Respondent on this issue. The lack of attendance\nnotes and documentary evidence as to the advice given by the Respondent to the\nComplainant when faced with Kori’s request for the production of documents is one\nkey consideration. The fact that the Respondent did not deal with his advice on this\nissue in his AEIC is another.\n80.\nWhat also weighs significantly with the Tribunal is that the Respondent’s course\nof action was controversial if indeed, as the Respondent testified, he felt that the\ndocuments were not relevant. A sensible and practical course would have been to\namend the Reply and Defence to Counterclaim so as to remove references to the\n\n15\n\n\firrelevant documents. Otherwise, the documents were prima facie relevant as P&P had\nreferred to them in its pleadings, and it would be an uphill task to successfully resist\nKori’s application. The costs payable to Kori for such an amendment would likely be\nmodest, in contrast to the financial exposure of P&P to legal fees and adverse cost\norders in contesting Kori’s application.\n81.\nIt is not necessary for the Tribunal to rule on whether the Respondent’s course\nof action in responding to Kori’s request for production of documents was justifiable.\nWhat is clear is that the decision as to how to respond to Kori’s request for the\nproduction of documents involved the weighing of several factors. The costs payable\nto Kori for such an amendment in all likelihood would not have exceeded the fees that\nP&P would have to pay for resisting Kori\n82.\nIt is not clear on the evidence before the Tribunal whether the Complainant in\nfact did have the documents the production of which was sought by Kori (whether on\nthe basis of the court order made by the Assistant Registrar or as varied by the Judge).\nHowever, this is not relevant as the issue is whether the Respondent evaluated with and\nadvised the Complainant as to the options of how to deal with Kori’s application and\nthe comparative risks and benefits.\n83.\nIn this instance, an exercise of judgment was required to be made by the\nComplainant with the assistance of substantive evaluation and advice from the\nRespondent. In the absence of any attendance notes or documentary evidence which\nshowed that the Respondent rendered such evaluation and advice to the Complainant,\nthe Tribunal has to draw and place weight on the necessary adverse inference against\nthe Respondent.\n84.\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal holds that the Respondent breached rules\n17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to Kori’s Notice to Produce dated\n31 December 2016 and the conduct of SUM 431 and RA 44.\nThe Suit 1255 Settlement\n85.\nIn the afternoon of 17 October 2017, the first day of the trial of Suit 1255, P&P\nand Kori entered into the Suit 1255 Settlement. There was no formal agreement signed\nbetween the parties, and Suit 1255 Settlement was recorded only in the transcript of the\ntrial of Suit 1255. The transcript recorded Kori’s counsel stating to the Court that a\nsettlement had been reached on the Manpower Sub-Contract and that Kori had agreed\nto pay P&P the sum of $236,731.48 subject to P&P conceding a sum of $543.73 on\nKori’s counterclaim against P&P. The Respondent was recorded as confirming the\nsettlement.\n86.\nThe problem was that there was no express agreement on the timeframe for\npaying of the settlement sum under the Suit 1255 Settlement. That issue would have\nbeen avoided simply by the inclusion of the word “forthwith” in the settlement but that\nwas not done. The Respondent gave evidence that he was “naïve” in assuming that Kori\nwould pay the settlement sum immediately. Kori refused to pay and apparently took\n\n16\n\n\fthe position that the settlement sum would be payable only upon the conclusion of Suit\n1255 as it was subject to set-off by the counterclaim of Kori against P&P in Suit 1255.\n87.\nThe Complainant gave evidence that, from November 2017 onwards, he\nrepeatedly asked the Respondent about Kori’s payment of the settlement sum.\nHowever, there are no attendance notes or documentary evidence as to any exchanges\nbetween the Complainant and the Respondent on this issue.\n88.\nOn 23 March 2018, P&P filed HC/SUM/1394/2018 (“SUM 1394”) under Order\n27 rule 3 of the Rules of Court, seeking to enter judgment on the Suit 1255 Settlement\nbased on an admission of fact. The supporting affidavit for SUM 1394 was affirmed\nby the Respondent personally, and there are no attendance notes, emails or other\ndocumentary evidence showing that the Complainant had given instructions for the\nfiling of SUM 1394.\n89.\nOn 9 April 2018, the Respondent wrote to inform the Complainant that SUM\n1394 had been dismissed by an Assistant Registrar with costs of $3,700 ordered against\nP&P. The Respondent told the Complainant that the Assistant Registrar had decided\nthat judgment could not be entered on the settlement agreement and that P&P had to\nsue for breach of the settlement agreement in a fresh suit. The Respondent further told\nthe Complainant that he did not agree with the Assistant Registrar’s decision but that\nan appeal would take time and might not be successful. He then advised the\nComplainant to file a fresh suit against Kori. A draft Statement of Claim for the\nproposed fresh suit in the State Courts was annexed to the Respondent’s letter.\n90.\nThe Complainant testified that he did not give any instructions for the filing of\nSUM 1394. He further gave evidence that, before he received the Respondent’s letter\nof 9 April 2018, he did not even know that SUM 1394 had been filed.\n91.\nOn the other hand, the Respondent testified under cross-examination that he\ndiscussed the filing of SUM 1394 with the Complainant on 18 March 2018, which was\nthe last day of the trial of Suit 1255. According to the Respondent, he told the\nComplainant that it might take 6 to 9 months before judgment would be given in Suit\n1255, and the Complainant asked the Respondent to file an application. After\ndiscussion, the Respondent told the Complainant that P&P could try to get judgment\nbased on an admission and the Complainant told him to go ahead.\n92.\nThe Tribunal accepts the Complainant’s evidence and finds that the Respondent\nfiled SUM 1394 without the instructions of the Complainant. There were no attendance\nnotes or documentary evidence showing that instructions had been obtained from the\nComplainant for the filing of SUM 1394, or that there was a discussion between the\nRespondent and the Complainant on 18 March 2018. There was also no evidence that\nthe Respondent had forwarded to the Complainant a copy of SUM 1394 and the\nsupporting affidavit (which had been affirmed by the Respondent personally) after they\nhad been filed. The Tribunal further notes that, in the other instances where the\nRespondent had filed applications for P&P, the Respondent would write to the\nComplainant in advance to seek instructions for the filing as well as send a draft of any\n\n17\n\n\faffidavit or submissions that were proposed to be filed. The supporting affidavits would\nalso usually be affirmed by the Complainant.\n93.\nIt follows that the Respondent could not have complied with rules 17(2)(e)(i)\nand 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to the filing of SUM 1394. There was no\nevaluation or advice to speak of.\nP&P’s applications for additional evidence\n94.\nThe first tranche of the trial of Suit 1255 was from 17 October 2017 to 20\nOctober 2017. On 23 October 2017, the Respondent sent a letter to the Complainant\nrecording that the Complainant had informed him on 20 October 2017 that the\nComplainant wanted to call additional witnesses and produce further documents\nshowing that P&P’s workers performed steel fabrication work at the project site for a\ncertain period. The letter also informed the Complainant that a further 2 days of trial\nmight be required and that $25,000 would be payable to the court for hearing and filing\nfees, a transcript fee, and an application fee.\n95.\nAlso on 23 October 2017, the Respondent wrote to Taisei (a third party) on the\ninstructions of the Complainant, requesting for the eye-scan records for P&P’s workers\nentering the project site for the relevant period. Taisei did not reply.\n96.\nOn 6 November 2017, the Respondent sent a letter to the Complainant enclosing\na draft application to compel Taisei to disclose the eye-scan records and a draft affidavit\nfor the Complainant’s execution. On 15 November 2017, P&P filed SUM 5237 for\nthird-party discovery against Taisei, and the hearing of the application was fixed for 1\nDecember 2017.\n97.\nOn 20 November 2017, Taisei wrote to the Respondent stating that it had not\nreceived the Respondent’s letter of 23 October 2017 and wanted to know more about\nSUM 5237. The Respondent replied to Taisei on 22 November 2017, attaching his\nearlier letter of 23 October 2017 and asking Taisei for a response. There is no evidence\nbefore the Tribunal of Taisei’s response.\n98.\nOn 29 November 2017, Taisei filed an affidavit stating that it was willing to\nproduce the eye-scan records but that the search would take 66-88 days and would cost\n$66,000 to $264,000. On the same day, the Respondent wrote to advise the\nComplainant that this sum was ridiculous, and that P&P should withdraw SUM 5237\nand pay costs to Taisei. On 1 December 2017, P&P withdrew SUM 5237 and was\nordered to pay costs of $500 to Kori and $2,300 to Taisei.\n99.\nOn 6 December 2017, the Respondent sent to the Complainant a draft summons\nto adduce further evidence and a draft of the supporting affidavit for him to sign. On 7\nDecember 2017, P&P filed SUM 5616 for leave to call 4 further witnesses and recall 3\nwitnesses at the trial of Suit 1255.\n\n18\n\n\f100. On 12 January 2018, the Respondent sent to the Complainant 3 reply affidavits\nfiled by Kori in SUM 5616. On the same day, the Respondent sent a draft reply affidavit\nto the Complainant for him to sign. At the hearing of SUM 5616 on 17 January 2018,\nthe Court dismissed P&P’s application with costs fixed at $6,000.\n101. The Law Society submitted that P&P’s efforts to adduce further evidence after\nthe first tranche of trial was the result of the Respondent’s failure to properly advise\nand discuss with the Complainant the evidential issues in relation to P&P’s claims.\nAccording to the Law Society, the Respondent was aware or should have been aware\nthat P&P’s evidence on the work done under the Fabrication Sub-Contract was\ninadequate and was being challenged. The Respondent should have explored and\ndiscussed the state of the evidence with the Complainant, but failed to do so. The Law\nSociety argued that there was a breach of rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015\nby the Respondent in this respect.\n102. The Tribunal is of the view that this allegation is too wide and not sufficiently\nparticularised in the Charges to be fairly raised against the Respondent. It was not\ndisputed that the Respondent assisted in preparing the Complainant’s AEIC for Suit\n1255 after taking his instructions, and tendered in the trial the documentary evidence\nprovided by the Complainant. Beyond this, there is insufficient evidence before the\nTribunal of P&P’s evidential difficulties in Suit 1255 and the reasons why the evidence\nis said to be deficient. It is therefore not clear to the Tribunal what exactly the\nRespondent is alleged to have failed to evaluate with the Complainant or what relevant\nlegal issues the Respondent had allegedly failed to advise the Complainant on so as to\nenable the Complainant to make an informed decision about how to act in the matter.\n103. Further, rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 deal with a legal\npractitioner’s specific duties to conduct a risk-benefit evaluation with the client on\nwhether a particular course of action should be taken in a matter, and to advise the client\non relevant legal issues so that the client is able to make an informed decision about\nhow to act in the matter. They are not relevant for general complaints that a legal\npractitioner’s acts or conduct has fallen below the requisite standards of care, skill,\ncompetence or diligence, which more rightly fall within the rubric of rule 5 of the PCR\n2015. As such, a general allegation that a legal practitioner has failed to properly\nassess or discuss the state of a client’s evidence for trial does not, in the absence of\ncircumstances showing a breach of the specific duties in rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f)\nof the PCR 2015, fall within the scope of those two provisions.\n104. Accordingly, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent did not breach\nrules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to the allegedly deficient state\nof P&P’s evidence for the first tranche of the trial of Suit 1255. For the avoidance of\ndoubt, the Tribunal does not express any view on whether the Respondent breached any\nduties of care, skill, competence or diligence.\n105. The Law Society also contended that the Respondent breached rules 17(2)(e)(i)\nand 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to P&P’s applications to adduce further\nevidence, namely, the applications in SUM 5237 and SUM 5616 seeking, respectively,\n\n19\n\n\fthird-party discovery against Taisei and leave to call further witnesses for trial. The\nLaw Society argued that, as confirmed by the Complainant in his evidence, the\nRespondent did not evaluate with or give legal advice to the Complainant on whether\nP&P should file these applications.\n106. The Tribunal accepts this contention. The Complainant clearly needed to have\nan evaluation with and legal advice from the Respondent on the importance of the eyescan records and the evidence of the further witnesses, as well as the risks and benefits\nof filing SUM 5237 and SUM 5616. These were applications which, if pursued, would\nhave caused P&P to incur fees and expenses and potentially exposed P&P to adverse\ncost orders. Further, one of the specific issues that clearly ought to have been explored\nwas whether another approach should be made to Taisei by phone or an actual visit\nbefore the filing of SUM 5237, to ascertain Taisei’s costs of reviewing and identifying\nthe relevant records which would normally have to be borne by P&P even if SUM 5237\nwas successful. The filing of SUM 5237 without checking on this issue with Taisei\nappears to be imprudent.\n107. There are no attendance notes or documentary evidence showing that any\nevaluation was conducted or legal advice dispensed in relation to the filing of SUM\n5237 and SUM 5616. Neither is there any evidence that militates against the drawing\nof an adverse inference against the Respondent in this regard.\n108. The documentary evidence is also consistent with the Law Society’s case. The\nRespondent’s initial letter dated 23 October 2017 to the Complainant on the issue of\ncalling further evidence simply recorded that the Complainant had informed the\nRespondent on 20 October 2017 that the Complainant wanted to call additional\nwitnesses and adduce further documents in evidence. On SUM 5237, the Respondent\nemailed a letter to the Complainant on 26 November 2017 attaching a draft summons\nand a draft supporting affidavit to be filed against Taisei. Similarly for SUM 5616, on\n6 December 2017, the Respondent sent to the Complainant a draft summons to adduce\nfurther evidence and a draft of the supporting affidavit for him to sign. None of these\n3 letters by the Respondent referred to or contained any evaluation or legal advice\nrequired to be conducted or given under rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n109. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has breached rules\n17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to P&P’s filing of SUM 5237 and\nSUM 5616.\nRespondent acted without the Complainant’s knowledge or instructions\n110. The Law Society contended that the Respondent breached rule 17(2)(f) when\nhe acted on two occasions on behalf of P&P in Suit 1255 without the knowledge or\ninstructions of the Complainant.\n111. First, the Respondent did not inform the Complainant that Taisei had\ncommenced garnishee proceedings against P&P for the costs of $2,300 ordered against\nP&P for the withdrawal of SUM 5237. Further, without the Complainant’s knowledge\n\n20\n\n\for instructions, the Respondent wrote to inform Taisei’s solicitors that P&P was\nagreeable to pay $1,513.70 for the costs of the garnishee proceedings. The Respondent\nadmitted that he had acted without the Complainant’s instructions, but gave evidence\nthat he felt that the Complainant could not provide any instructions on the correct\namount of costs.\n112. Second, the Respondent sent proposals to Kori’s solicitors for the party-party\ncosts of the trial of Suit 1255 that had been ordered against Kori, without seeking the\nComplainant’s instructions. The Respondent admitted to this but testified under crossexamination that he spoke with and advised the Complainant prior to the filing of his\nbills of costs and received the Complainant’s agreement in this regard. However, there\nis no documentary evidence or attendance notes of such a discussion, and the Tribunal\ndoes not accept this evidence.\n113. The Law Society submitted that these instances constituted breaches of rule\n17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015. We agree. As the Respondent admitted that he issued the\nproposals without the Complainant’s instructions, the Respondent could not have\ncomplied with rule 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n114. In addition, we note that the Respondent might also have breached rules 5(2)(e)\nand 5(2)(i) of the PCR 2015. These rules require a legal practitioner to keep the client\nreasonably informed of the progress of the client’s matter, and follow all lawful, proper\nand reasonable instructions that the client is competent to give. Given that the Charges\nagainst the Respondent do not rely on these rules, we do not need to consider them\nfurther.\nEvaluation of the use of alternative dispute resolution processes in Suit 1255\n115. The Law Society submitted that the Respondent failed to evaluate with the\nComplainant the viability of the alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) processes prior\nto the commencement as well as in the course of Suit 1255. This constituted a breach\nof rule 17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR 2015 by the Respondent.\n116. We note that rule 17(2)(e)(ii) does not specify a particular point in time or a\nparticular stage in legal proceedings at which the solicitor has to evaluate the use of\nADR process with the client. It requires the solicitor to do so “in an appropriate case”.\nIn other words, the solicitor may exercise some measure of discretion in deciding\nwhether to conduct such evaluation with the client. Of course, if the solicitor does not\nexercise such discretion reasonably or in the best interests of the client, this can result\nin a breach of rule 17(2)(e)(ii).\n117. The Complainant signed an ADR Offer on 22 February 2017, stating that P&P\nwas available for mediation from 20 March 2017 onwards. On 23 February 2017, the\nRespondent wrote to inform the Complainant that the Court at a pre-trial conference on\n21 February 2017 had directed that the parties consider ADR such as mediation. This\nletter attached a copy of Appendix I of the Supreme Court Practice Directions titled\n\n21\n\n\fGuidelines for Advocates and Solicitors Advising clients about ADR. The Respondent\nfurther stated as follows:\nAs explained to you, we would advise you to attempt mediation as this might cut\nshort the claim process and lead to savings of legal fees.\n118. On 15 March 2017, the Respondent wrote to inform the Complainant that Kori\nwas agreeable to mediation between April and June 2017. From 20 March 2017 to 3\nJune 2017, there were various letters between the Respondent, Kori’s solicitors and the\nSingapore Mediation Centre (“SMC”) on the proposed mediation, principally relating\nto scheduling, fees and the agreement to mediate. Some of these letters were copied or\nforwarded to the Complainant but some were not.\n119. On 5 July 2017, the Respondent wrote to the SMC, copying the Complainant.\nThis letter stated that the Respondent had not obtained instructions from the\nComplainant and would be applying to be discharged, and would not be proceeding\nwith the mediation. On 10 July 2017, there was an exchange of emails between the\nSMC and the Respondent. The SMC requested for the contact details of the\nComplainant so that it could contact him directly on the mediation, but the Respondent\ndeclined to provide the contact details on the ground of confidentiality. These emails\nwere not forwarded or copied to the Complainant.\n120. On 4 August 2017, the Respondent wrote to update the Complainant that he had\ninformed the Court at a Pre-Trial Conference on 1 August 2017 that P&P did not wish\nto go for mediation due to a lack of funds and the unlikelihood of a settlement, and that\nit preferred to go for trial. This letter attached a fresh ADR offer filed by Kori and a\ndraft ADR response rejecting the offer. The Respondent then stated:\nWe would advise you to proceed with the filing of the ADR response due to\nyour lack of funds and the unlikelihood of a settlement being reached at the\nmediation.\nYou have a strong case that is likely to succeed. The implication that arises\nfrom you not accepting the ADR offer for mediation is that if you do not\nsucceed in your claim, the court can award higher costs to the Defendant.\nHowever, as you will likely succeed in your claim, there will be no adverse\nconsequence if you were to reject mediation.\n121.\n\nThe ADR response rejecting Kori’s ADR offer was filed on 10 August 2017.\n\n122. The Law Society contended that the Respondent did not properly update or\nadvise the Complainant on the progress of the preparations for the mediation. In\nparticular, the Respondent did not keep the Complainant informed of letters from the\nSMC, the fact that Kori had signed the agreement to mediate, and that SMC wanted to\ncontact him directly in July 2017. The Complainant’s evidence was that the\nRespondent informed him about ADR in February 2017 but without much explanation.\nShortly before 4 August 2017, the Complainant met the Respondent who advised him\n\n22\n\n\fnot to proceed with mediation. The Respondent assured him that he had a strong case\nand that given the fees involved in pursuing the mediation route, the Complainant\nwould be better off proceeding to trial.\n123. We do not think the evidence establishes any breach of rule 17(2)(e)(ii) of the\nPCR 2015 by the Respondent. It cannot be said that the Respondent did not evaluate\nwith the Complainant the use of ADR processes where appropriate. The Respondent\ndid advise the Complainant in February 2017 of ADR processes, as shown in the\nRespondent’s letter of 23 February 2017 to the Complainant. The Complainant himself\nsigned an ADR offer inviting Kori to mediate. It is also not disputed that the\nRespondent did take steps to arrange for a mediation, before calling it off in his email\nof 5 July 2017 to the SMC.\n124. It is not entirely clear why the Complainant did not proceed with the mediation.\nIt could be because, as alleged by the Respondent, the Complainant decided not to\nproceed because he thought it was likely that Kori would be unreasonable, or because,\nas alleged by the Law Society, the Respondent had advised the Complainant that he\nhad a strong case and would be better off proceeding to trial. It is also not clear why\nthe Respondent did not forward or copy to the Complainant all correspondence on the\nmediation. But these questions are really peripheral to the central issue; in our view,\nthe evidence does not warrant a finding that the Respondent breached rule 17(2)(e)(ii)\nof the PCR 215.\nF.\n\nDC 1043\n\n125. In relation to DC 1043, the Law Society contended that the Respondent failed\nto advise the Complainant as required by rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015\nin relation to the following issues:\n(a)\n\nthe commencement of DC 1043;\n\n(b)\n\nan Offer To Settle issued by Kori in DC 1043 on 27 July 2018; and\n\n(c)\n\na second Offer To Settle issued by Kori in DC 1043 on 29 January 2019.\n\n126. The Law Society also argued that the Respondent failed to evaluate with the\nComplainant the use of alternative dispute resolution processes, as required by rule\n17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR 2015.\nThe commencement of DC 1043\n127. As mentioned above, on 9 April 2018, P&P’s application in SUM 1394 in Suit\n1255 for judgment to be entered on the Suit 1255 Settlement based on an admission of\nfact was dismissed with costs of $3,700.\n128. At 3:06pm on the same day, the Respondent emailed a letter to inform the\nComplainant of the dismissal of SUM 1394, and stated that he did not agree with the\n\n23\n\n\fdecision and that P&P had the right of appeal. However, the Respondent added that an\nappeal would take time and might not be successful, and advised as follows: “It seems\nthat the easier route would be for you to file a fresh suit against Kori Construction (S)\nPte Ltd for the Manpower Claim under the settlement agreement. We enclose, in draft,\nthe Statement of Claim for this Suit.”\n129. At 5:31pm on the same day, P&P filed DC 1043 against Kori for the recovery\nof the settlement sum of $236,187.75 due under the Suit 1255 Settlement plus interest.\n130. The Law Society argued that, after the dismissal of SUM 1394 on 9 April 2018,\nthe Respondent did not conduct an evaluation with or give legal advice to the\nComplainant on P&P’s options in relation to the recovery of the settlement sum. The\nRespondent simply advised the Complainant on 9 April 2018 itself to commence a fresh\nsuit. This was borne out by the evidence of the Complainant. The Respondent had\ntherefore breached rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n131. Having reviewed the evidence and the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal\nfinds that the Law Society has established its case. The Tribunal is unable to accept the\nRespondent’s evidence that he had complied with rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the\nPCR 2015.\n132. In his AEIC, the Respondent testified that he had advised the Complainant that\nDC 1043 hinged on an issue of law on which arguments could be made by both sides\nand the decision could go either way. He gave evidence that the Complainant chose to\nproceed in the hope of getting Kori to make payment without having to wait for\njudgment in Suit 1255. However, there were no attendance notes or other documentary\nevidence of such advice being given by the Respondent or the instructions of the\nComplainant to proceed with a fresh suit. Further, if such a discussion between the\nRespondent and the Complainant had taken place, it would have taken place between\nthe Respondent’s letter to the Complainant sent at 3:06pm on 9 April 2018, and the\nfiling of DC 1043 less than 3 hours later on the same day. The Respondent’s AEIC\nwas noticeably silent on the date and time of his discussion with the Complainant on\nthe filing of DC 1043.\n133. In any event, even based on the Respondent’s evidence of his discussion with\nthe Complainant on the filing of DC 1043, the Respondent did not conduct any riskbenefit evaluation or give any legal advice on important issues concerning the filing of\nDC 1043.\n134. There was no dispute on the liability of Kori to pay the settlement sum to P&P.\nThe sole issue in DC 1043 was whether payment should be made immediately or only\nupon the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255. The Respondent himself gave evidence\nthat the merits of DC 1043 were evenly balanced, and the decision could go either way.\nIn other words, by filing DC 1043, P&P would be incurring legal fees and expenses\nand assuming the risk of being subject to adverse cost orders on an uncertain quest to\nobtain judgment on the Suit 1255 Settlement. If successful, P&P could be entitled to\npayment of the settlement sum even before the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255. The\n\n24\n\n\falternative option was to simply wait for the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255 and\nthen assert the entitlement to be paid the settlement sum.\n135. The last day of the trial of Suit 1255 was 18 March 2018. This meant that the\njudgment for Suit 1255 would be issued within a matter of months from 18 March 2018.\nThe Respondent himself gave evidence that he had advised the Complainant on 18\nMarch 2018 that the issue of the judgment might take 6-9 months from that date (that\nis, during the period from September to December 2018).\n136. If so, apart from the merits of DC 1043, it was crucial to balance the prospect\nof DC 1043 being concluded significantly before December 2018, against the fees and\nexpenses incurred in the conduct of DC 1043 and the risk of being subject to adverse\ncost orders in the event that DC 1043 was unsuccessful. It was not certain at all, or\neven unlikely, that DC 1043 would be concluded significantly earlier than 6-9 months\nof its filing. DC 1043 might of course conclude expeditiously if there was a successful\napplication for summary judgment. However, given the nature of the dispute and the\nfact that the Suit 1255 Settlement was an oral contract, it must have at least been\nuncertain that an application for summary judgment would succeed. As it turned out,\nP&P did file an application for summary judgment in DC 1043, which was dismissed\nby the court.\n137. There is no evidence that the Respondent conducted any risk-benefit evaluation\nwith or gave any legal advice to the Complainant on all these issues. The Respondent\ndid not discuss with the Complainant on the time frame within which DC 1043 would\nbe expected to conclude, the quantum of fees and expenses that would be incurred by\nP&P in the conduct of DC 1043, or the risk of P&P being subject to adverse cost orders\nif DC 1043 was dismissed.\n138. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent breached rules\n17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to the commencement of DC 1043.\nKori’s 1st Offer To Settle\n139. On 27 July 2018, Kori issued an Offer To Settle (“OTS”) in DC 1043. Kori\noffered to pay the settlement sum of $236,187.75 within 14 days of the delivery of\njudgment in Suit 1255 and for this sum to be added to the sums ordered to be paid by\nKori to P&P or set off against the sums ordered to be paid by P&P to Kori, as the case\nmight be.\n140. It is not disputed that this OTS was never forwarded by the Respondent to the\nComplainant. What is in dispute is whether the Respondent discussed with the\nComplainant the effect of the OTS and the options open to the Complainant.\n141. The Complainant gave evidence that the Respondent never brought the OTS to\nhis attention or discussed it with him. However, the Respondent’s evidence under\ncross-examination was that he did discuss the OTS with the Complainant, but that the\nComplainant did not want to accept the offer as there was nothing new in it. The\n\n25\n\n\fRespondent also gave evidence that the Complainant knew the implications of not\naccepting the OTS. However, the Respondent did not give evidence as to when exactly\nhis discussion with the Complainant took place.\n142. The Tribunal prefers the Complainant’s evidence to the Respondent’s evidence.\nThat there are no attendance notes or other documentary evidence of the Respondent’s\ndiscussions with the Complainant or the Complainant’s instructions on the OTS,\ncoupled with the undisputed fact that the OTS itself was not even forwarded to the\nComplainant, warrant the drawing of an adverse inference against the Respondent.\n143. Further, the Respondent’s evidence on his discussion with the Complainant,\neven if accepted, does not show that the Respondent had complied with his duties under\nrules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n144. The OTS was made on 27 July 2018, more than 4 months after the\ncommencement of DC 1043. At that time, the timelines for discovery and exchange\nof AEICs, and the trial dates for DC 1043, had not been fixed. Meanwhile, in Suit 1255,\nthe parties’ closing submissions were exchanged on 14 May 2018, and the parties were\nsubsequently just waiting to receive judgment. It was only on 19 December 2018 that\nDC 1043 was fixed by the State Courts for a 1-day trial on 7 February 2019. However,\nless than 2 weeks later, on 31 December 2018, judgment was issued by the High Court\nfor Suit 1255.\n145. In these circumstances, there was a continuing duty on the Respondent to\nevaluate with, and legally advise, the Complainant with respect to the OTS as the\nprospect grew stronger over time that the decision in Suit 1255 would be issued before\nthe trial of DC 1043. The Respondent himself advised the Complainant on 18 March\n2018 (the last day of trial of Suit 1255) that the judgment in Suit 1255 might be issued\nduring the period from September to December 2018.\n146. As December 2018 drew nearer without the trial dates for DC 1043 being fixed,\nthe Respondent was under a duty to assess with the Complainant the risks and benefits\nof accepting the OTS. This duty became all the more relevant and pressing when the\nHigh Court’s decision in Suit 1255 was issued on 31 December 2018. However, there\nis no evidence that the Respondent evaluated with and advised the Complainant on the\nrisks and benefits of accepting the OTS in view of the impending issue or upon the\nactual issue of the decision in Suit 1255. The Respondent’s brief evidence that, on an\nunspecified date, he discussed the OTS with the Complainant but that the Complainant\ndid not want to accept the offer is insufficient.\n147. This conduct also has to be viewed against the legal fees that were being\nincurred by P&P in DC 1043. The Respondent issued 2 bills for fees and disbursements\nincurred for DC 1043. The first was issued on 15 January 2019 for the sum of\n$37,694.15 and the second was issued on 29 March 2019 for the sum of $6,687.95.\n\n26\n\n\fKori’s 2nd Offer To Settle\n148. Kori issued a 2nd OTS on 29 January 2019, which appears to have been received\nby the Respondent on 30 January 2019. By this time, Kori had paid the settlement sum\nof $236,187.75 and the only outstanding issue in DC 1043 was whether interest of\n$9,558.19 was payable by Kori. Kori’s 2nd OTS proposed that Kori would pay half the\ninterest and parties would bear their own costs.\n149. The Respondent sent a letter to the Complainant on 30 January 2019. The\nRespondent informed the Complainant that, at a hearing for DC 1043 that day, the trial\nJudge had indicated that the issue of interest could go either way and that it might be\nbetter for parties to settle. The Respondent advised the Complainant to make an offer\nfor Kori to pay the interest of $9,588.19 and for parties to bear their own costs. The\nRespondent further updated the Complainant on Kori’s 2nd OTS and stated as follows:\nPlease let us know whether you wish to:\na) Accept half the interest;\nb) Push for the full interest; or\nc) Go for trial for the full interest and costs.\nWe would advise you to push for the full interest as the Defendant is likely to\npay if you don’t give up so easily.\n150. The Complainant gave evidence that he met the Respondent on 30 January 2019\nand the Respondent asked him which of the 3 options he wanted. The Complainant\ntold the Respondent that he wanted option 3 because he thought that it was only right\nthat Kori paid what was fully due to P&P. The Complainant testified, however, that\nthe Respondent did not advise him that on the anticipated costs of DC 1043 proceeding\nall the way to trial only on the issue of the interest of $9,558.19. Neither did the\nRespondent advise him on the costs implications if P&P rejected Kori’s 2nd OTS but\nwas ultimately unsuccessful in DC 1043.\n151. The Respondent’s evidence was that the Complainant wanted to go for trial as\nhe wanted costs. As such, no counter-offer was made by P&P to Kori’s 2nd OTS and\nDC 1043 went to trial.\n152. On 16 August 2019, the Court dismissed DC 1043 and awarded costs, including\nindemnity costs from the date of Kori’s 2nd OTS, to Kori. In a letter dated 27 August\n2019 from the Respondent to the Complainant, the Respondent stated that the Court in\nSuit 1255 had estimated the costs for DC 1043 to be $20,000, and that this amount had\nbeen deducted from an interim payment under Suit 1255. There is no evidence before\nthis Tribunal as to the actual amount of costs paid by P&P to Kori in respect of DC\n1043, or the date when the interim payment under Suit 1255 was made with a deduction\nof $20,000.\n153. In our view, it is clear that the Respondent failed to comply with rules 17(2)(e)(i)\nand 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015. The Respondent did not perform the necessary\n\n27\n\n\fevaluation or give the required advice in relation to Kori’s 2nd OTS. The Respondent’s\nown letter acknowledged that the trial Judge had observed that the trial could go either\nway, and did not express any disagreement with this view. This meant that there was a\npossible, even significant, chance that P&P might not prevail at the trial of DC 1043.\nYet, there was no discussion with the Complainant on balancing the benefits of\nrecovering half the sum of $9,558.19 from Kori against the exposure of P&P to the\nlegal costs and possible adverse costs orders of proceeding with the trial. Even if P&P\nprevailed at the trial, there was no certainty at all that the amounts and costs recovered\nfrom Kori would cover P&P’s actual legal costs payable to the Respondent.\n154. Further, as highlighted earlier, legal fees and disbursements were being incurred\nby P&P for DC 1043. The Respondent issued a first bill on 15 January 2019 for legal\nfees and disbursements of $37,694.15 and a second bill on 29 March 2019 for legal fees\nand disbursements of $6,687.95.\nEvaluation of the use of alternative dispute resolution processes in DC 1043\n155. On 27 July 2018, the Respondent sent a letter to the Complainant attaching a\ncourt-issued ADR form the particulars of which had already been filled in by the\nRespondent. This form stated that the Complainant wished to opt out of ADR. The\nletter asked the Complainant to sign the form and return it to the Respondent. It appears\nthat the Complainant did as he was asked.\n156. The Complainant’s evidence was that the Respondent did not advise him on\nADR options in DC 1043 or that opting out of ADR would expose him to adverse costs\norders. He also testified that he did not recall instructing the Respondent that he wished\nto opt out from ADR in DC 1043. On the other hand, the Respondent gave evidence\nunder cross-examination that he had 2 discussions with the Complainant on ADR,\nrespectively, before the filing of DC 1043 and before the letter of 27 July 2018 was sent\nto the Complainant.\n157. The Law Society argued that the Respondent did not properly evaluate with the\nComplainant the use of ADR processes in DC 1043. On balance, even if we disregard\nthe Respondent’s evidence which is not supported by attendance notes or documentary\nevidence, we decline to hold the Respondent in breach of rule 17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR\n2015.\n158. It is not disputed that the Complainant signed the ADR form. It was not a\ncomplicated document, and the Complainant did not suggest that he did not understand\nwhat he was signing. His evidence was that, in February 2017, the Respondent had\nalready explained ADR processes to him in relation to Suit 1255. It should also be\nborne in mind that DC 1043 was filed as a result of a dispute arising in relation to the\nSuit 1255 Settlement. In August 2017, before the Suit 1255 Settlement had been\nentered into, the Complainant had opted for mediation for Suit 1255 but ultimately did\nnot pursue it. Further, the dispute in DC 1043 was simply whether the agreed settlement\nsum of $236,187.75 was payable to P&P immediately or only upon the delivery of the\n\n28\n\n\fjudgment in Suit 1255. It was not the type of situation where ADR would have been\nconsidered a top priority.\n159. Taking into account all the circumstances, we do not think there was a duty on\nthe Respondent to take additional steps to evaluate with the Complainant the use of\nADR processes in relation to DC 1043. We wish to make clear, however, that this\nconclusion does not detract from the breaches by the Respondent of rules 17(2)(e)(i)\nand 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation to the commencement of DC 1043 and Kori’s\n1st OTS and 2nd OTS.\nG.\n\nSUIT 1167\n\n160. The Law Society contended that the Respondent failed to advise the\nComplainant as required by rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in relation\nto the commencement of Suit 1167 as well as an OTS issued by P&P on 22 May 2018.\nThe Law Society also argued that the Respondent failed to comply with rule 17(2)(e)(ii)\nof the PCR 2015, as he failed to evaluate with the Complainant the use of alternative\ndispute resolution processes.\nThe commencement of Suit 1167\n161. It will be recalled that P&P commenced Suit 1255 against Kori on 25 November\n2016 in respect of invoices that had fallen due by that date. There were further invoices\nthat fell due after that date. On 23 December 2016, the Respondent sent a letter of\ndemand to Kori’s solicitors for the payment of these further invoices. However, it was\nonly a year later on 11 December 2017 that P&P commenced Suit 1167 against Kori\nfor the payment of these further invoices, that is, the sum of $342,821.05 plus interest.\n162. The Law Society made 3 contentions in relation to the commencement of Suit\n1167.\n163. First, the Law Society submitted that the Respondent failed to advise the\nComplainant on the anticipated legal costs that would be incurred in commencing and\nprosecuting Suit 1167. While this appears to be supported by the evidence before this\nTribunal, we do not think that there was a breach of rules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the\nPCR 2015. As mentioned above, a solicitor’s duty to advise the client of anticipated\nlegal costs is specifically governed by rule 17(3) of the PCR 2015.\n164. Second, the Law Society submitted that the Respondent failed to evaluate with\nand advise the Complainant in relation to the timing of the filing of Suit 1167 with a\nview to preserve the option of consolidating it with Suit 1255. Consequently, Suit 1167\nwas filed so long after the commencement of Suit 1255 that consolidation of the 2 suits\nwas no longer possible.\n165. The Respondent’s evidence is that he had advised the Complainant on 25\nNovember 2016 of the options of waiting until December 2016 to file a single suit, or\nto file 2 suits in November 2016 and December 2016 respectively and then seek\n\n29\n\n\fconsolidation. According to the Respondent, the Complainant opted for 2 suits. This\nevidence has already been rejected as we have found that P&P commenced both Suit\n1255 and Suit 1167 against Kori because the Complainant had not been advised by the\nRespondent of the option of filing a single suit in December 2016 covering all\noutstanding invoices.\n166. Even assuming that the Respondent’s evidence is accepted, it does not explain\nwhy it took one year after the filing of Suit 1255 for P&P to commence Suit 1167.\n167. The Respondent testified that the Complainant did not want to commence Suit\n1167 in light of Kori’s issue of the Notice to Produce and other complications in Suit\n1255. He also testified that Suit 1167 was not ready for filing until December 2017\nbecause the Complainant did not have the necessary supporting documents. However,\nthese general assertions are lacking in detail, and are not supported by attendance notes\nor other documentary evidence. There is also no evidence that the Respondent\nspecifically advised or otherwise reminded the Complainant of the importance of filing\nSuit 1167 expeditiously in order to preserve the option of consolidation.\n168. The Tribunal is therefore of the view that the Law Society’s contention is\nestablished.\n169. Third, the Law Society submitted that the Respondent should have advised the\nComplainant of the option of waiting for the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255 instead\nof commencing Suit 1167 on 11 December 2017. The basis for this submission is as\nfollows.\n170. Prior to the commencement of Suit 1167, on 26 October 2017, Kori’s solicitors\nwrote to the Respondent. This letter stated that Kori had certified P&P’s outstanding\ninvoices for an amount of $342,821.05, and requested that P&P issue invoices for this\ncertified amount. However, Kori took the position that it would not pay the certified\namount pending the resolution of their counterclaim in Suit 1255. On 27 October 2017,\nthe Respondent forwarded and explained the letter to the Complainant and then stated\nas follows:\nWe would advise you to check if you are agreeable to the new certification\nand if so to issue new invoices… These should be sent directly to Kori\nConstruction (S) Pte Ltd with a copy to us.\nWe would give Kori Construction (S) Pte Ltd 30 days to make payment and\nproceed to sue them after that.\n171. On 15 November 2017, the Respondent forwarded to the Complainant a letter\ndated 9 November 2017 from Kori’s solicitors, which stated that Kori would not make\npayment of the sum of $342,821.05 until after Suit 1255 had been decided. The\nRespondent further stated to the Complainant:\n\n30\n\n\fWe advise you to file a suit in the High Court on 6 December 2017 for this\nsum of $342,821.05. We will then proceed with summary judgment.\n172. On 11 December 2017, P&P filed Suit 1167 against Kori for the payment of the\nsum of $342,821.05 plus interest. P&P’s application for summary judgment against\nKori failed, and Suit 1167 proceeded to trial on 31 October 2018 and 1 November 2018.\nOn 21 January 2019, the Court delivered judgment in favour of P&P for the sum\nclaimed plus interest and costs. It should be noted that, by then, the judgment in Suit\n1255 had already been issued.\n173. This Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent clearly failed to fulfil his duties\nunder rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015. The Respondent did not evaluate\nwith the Complainant the risks and benefits of filing Suit 1167 as opposed to simply\nwaiting for the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255. Based on the letter dated 26 October\n2017 from Kori’s solicitors, Kori appeared to have agreed that it was liable to pay P&P\nthe sum of $342,821.05, subject to any set-off against its counterclaim in Suit 1255.\nThe first tranche of the trial of Suit 1255 had been completed on 20 October 2017 and\nwould very likely, and did in fact, conclude sooner than a fresh suit like Suit 1167.\nFurther, the conduct of Suit 1167 would cause P&P to incur significant costs but would\noffer no certainty that P&P would be able to recover the sum of $342,821.05 from Kori.\n174. All these considerations would no doubt have prompted a responsible solicitor\nto advise the Complainant to seriously consider holding back the filing of a fresh suit\nand wait for the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255, and explain the reasons supporting\nand detracting from such a course. The Tribunal is unable to find that the Respondent\ndischarged such a responsibility.\n175. Under cross-examination, the Respondent stated that he discussed with the\nComplainant that Suit 1167 might overtake Suit 1255, since Suit 1167 involved only\nthe Manpower Sub-contract and P&P could file for summary judgment. The\nRespondent testified that he thought that the summary judgment application would\nsucceed, and that Suit 1167 would conclude quite quickly. One would have expected\nsuch important advice to be in writing, or evidenced by attendance notes. However,\nthere is no documentary evidence indicating that such advice was given, or that there\nwas any discussion between the Respondent and the Complainant on the various\nconsiderations pointing to one course of action or another. Moreover, the only\ndocumentary evidence containing relevant advice, namely, the Respondent’s letters to\nthe Complainant dated 27 October 2017 and 15 November 2017, simply stated that\nP&P should file Suit 1167. There was no explanation of the risks and costs of doing so\nand no mention of the alternative of waiting for the issue of the judgment in Suit 1255.\nP&P’s Offer To Settle\n176. On 22 May 2018, P&P issued an OTS in Suit 1167. In essence, the offer was\nfor Kori to pay the sum of $350,000 in full and final settlement, plus interest and costs,\nwithin 14 days of acceptance.\n\n31\n\n\f177. The Law Society contended that this OTS was issued without any instructions\nfrom the Complainant. The Complainant’s evidence was that he found out about this\nOTS only when the Respondent forwarded the OTS to him on 22 May 2018. There is\nno documentary evidence that the draft OTS was sent to the Complainant, or of any\ndiscussions that the Respondent had with the Complainant on the OTS.\n178. The Tribunal finds that the OTS was issued by the Respondent on behalf of P&P\nwithout the knowledge or instructions of the Complainant. It follows that the\nRespondent breached rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 in this regard.\nEvaluation of the use of alternative dispute resolution processes in Suit 1167\n179. The Respondent received a letter from the SMC dated 18 April 2018 providing\ninformation on mediation, but did not forward it to the Complainant. He also did not\nevaluate mediation or ADR with the Complainant. Under cross-examination, he\nexplained that he had many discussions with the Complainant before the filing of Suit\n1167 and the Complainant knew very well all about ADR. He testified that there was\na discussion with the Complainant on ADR after the defence was filed. However, there\nwere no documentary records or attendance notes of such a discussion.\n180. The Tribunal rejects this evidence and finds that the Respondent did not discuss\nwith the Complainant the use of ADR in relation to Suit 1167. To establish a breach of\nrule 17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR 2015, it must also be shown that this was an appropriate\ncase in which the Respondent should have evaluated the use of ADR processes with\nthe Complainant.\n181. The Tribunal is of the view that this was indeed an appropriate case. Suit 1167\nwas commenced on 11 December 2017 and involved the Steel Fabrication SubContract which was being litigated in Suit 1255. Much had transpired since the filing\nof Suit 1255 in November 2016 and the Respondent should have discussed the various\ndevelopments with the Complainant and evaluated with him the use of ADR processes\nin Suit 1167.\n182. For instance, in August 2017, the Complainant rejected ADR for Suit 1255. On\n17 October 2017, the Suit 1255 Settlement was entered into between P&P and Kori on\nthe Man-Power Contract, pursuant to which Kori agreed to pay $236,731.48 subject to\nP&P conceding a sum of $543.73 on Kori’s counterclaim. The first tranche of the trial\nof Suit 1255 was completed on 20 October 2017. By 11 December 2017, the settlement\nsum had not been made by Kori under the Suit 1255 Settlement.\n183. In our view, it is not sufficient for the Respondent to say that the Complainant\nknew the ADR options for Suit 1167. Rule 17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR 2015 is not fulfilled\nsimply because a client is advised of or knows about ADR options. It requires the legal\npractitioner to evaluate the use of ADR processes with the client in an appropriate case.\nIn an appropriate case, the legal practitioner has to discuss with and advise the client\non the competing considerations, whether legal, financial or practical, in relation to the\n\n32\n\n\fuse of ADR processes in the client’s matter. We find that the Respondent failed to do\nthis in relation to Suit 1167.\nH.\n\n4TH AND 5TH CHARGES - RULE 17(5) OF THE PCR 2015\n\n184. Rule 17(5) of the PCR 2015 provides that if a client disputes or raises a query\nabout a bill of a legal practitioner, the legal practitioner must inform the client in writing\nof the client’s right to apply to the court to have the bill taxed or review any fee\nagreement, unless the legal practitioner believes that the client knows, or reasonably\nought to know, of that right.\n185. The 4th and 5th Charges allege that the Respondent breached rule 17(5) of the\nPCR 2015 in or around February 2017 and January 2019 respectively. It is not disputed\nthat the Respondent did not at any material time inform the Complainant in writing of\nhis right to taxation. The Respondent’s response was that the Complainant did not\ndispute or raise any query about the Respondent’s bills in February 2017 or January\n2019.\n186. The Complainant’s AEIC stated that he approached the Respondent in February\n2017 to question the quantum of the Respondent’s bills as P&P had financial constraints.\nUnder cross-examination, the Complainant’s evidence was different. He recounted that\nhe had a disagreement with the Respondent in February 2017 in the Respondent’s office.\nHowever, this was because the Respondent wanted the Complainant to pay the\noutstanding invoices and told him to “get out”. The Complainant responded that he\nwould pay the invoices.\n187. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find that the Complainant\ndisputed or raised a query about the Respondent’s bills in February 2017.\n188. With respect to January 2019, the Law Society relied on 3 instances of the\nComplainant allegedly disputing or raising queries on the Respondent’s invoices.\n189. First, the Complainant gave evidence that, on 22 or 23 January 2019, he\nexpressed unhappiness with the Respondent’s invoice of $99,841.60 for Suit 1167. The\nRespondent then gave a reduction of $23,500 by issuing a fresh invoice. However,\nthere is no evidence that the Complainant remained unhappy, or continued to dispute\nor raise query, after this discount of $23,500. As such, the Tribunal is unable to find\nthat the Respondent’s duty to inform the Complainant in writing of the right to taxation\nhad arisen.\n190. Second, on 28 January 2019, the Respondent wrote to inform the Complainant\nthat he was not agreeable to the Complainant’s request that the payment received from\nKori in Suit 1167 be used to pay the invoices for Suit 1167 and not other invoices. The\nLaw Society submitted that this showed that the Complainant had earlier approached\nthe Respondent and questioned him about the invoices, and that there was therefore a\ndispute on the invoices. The Tribunal is unable to accept this submission. Such an\ninference cannot be drawn from the Respondent’s letter dated 28 January 2019. Further,\n\n33\n\n\fthe Complainant himself did not in his AEIC allege that the Respondent’s letter dated\n28 January 2019 was issued as a result of the Complainant raising a dispute on the\nRespondent’s invoices.\n191. Third, the Law Society referred to an email received by the Complainant on 10\nJanuary 2019 from Jurong Town Corporation, the landlord of P&P’s office premises,\nstating that it would proceed with legal action unless there was full settlement of rental\narrears. The Complainant’s evidence was that he met the Respondent and asked for a\nportion of the payment received as a result of the Suit 1255 Settlement and the judgment\nin Suit 1167 to be paid to P&P so that it could pay the rental arrears. The Respondent\nrefused. The Complainant also testified that he took the opportunity to question the\nbasis of the Respondent’s invoices as he believed them to be too high.\n192. The Respondent’s evidence was that the Complainant never raised the rental\narrears with him, or asked for a portion of the money received as a result of the Suit\n1255 Settlement and the judgment in Suit 1167 to be used to pay the rental arrears.\n193. The email from Jurong Town Corporation no doubt would have put pressure on\nthe Complainant to pay the rental arrears. It would not be surprising if this prompted\nthe Complainant to approach the Respondent for money to pay the rental arrears.\nHowever, this by itself does not make it probable that the Complainant would also have\nquestioned the Respondent’s invoices.\n194. The Law Society pointed out that the Respondent did not have documentary\nrecords or attendance notes of his meeting with the Complainant on or around 10\nJanuary 2019. However, this does not assist the Law Society in this instance as the\nRespondent’s position was that no such meeting took place. Further, the Tribunal notes\nthat, when the Complainant subsequently made a request that the moneys recovered in\nSuit 1167 be used to pay only the invoices for that Suit, the Respondent declined this\nrequest by way of a letter dated 28 January 2019. This letter did not refer to any earlier\nrequest by the Complainant for the release of a greater sum of money for the payment\nof P&P’s rental arrears, or any dispute raised by the Complainant on the Respondent’s\ninvoices.\n195. On balance, therefore, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Complainant\nquestioned the basis of the Respondent’s invoices on or around 10 January 2019. As\nsuch, we find that the 4th and 5th Charges are not made out.\nI.\n\n6TH CHARGE – RULE 5(2)(C) OF THE PCR 2015\n\n196. The 6th Charge and Alternative 6th Charge state that the Respondent breached\nrule 5(2)(c) of the PCR 2015 in relation to his representation of P&P in Suit 1255, DC\n1043 and Suit 1167, that is, he failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence\nin the provision of services to P&P in those legal proceedings. The particulars of the\nbreach stated in the Charges overlapped substantially with the allegations in the 2nd and\n3rd Charges and their Alternative Charges, but included new particulars such as a failure\nto keep accurate timesheets.\n\n34\n\n\f197. However, the Law Society’s position was that it would not proceed with the 6th\nCharge and Alternative 6th Charge if both the 2nd and 3rd Charges (or their respective\nAlternative Charges) are established. Given the Tribunal’s findings on these latter\nCharges, therefore, it is not necessary to consider the 6th Charge or Alternative 6th\nCharge. We consider the 6th Charge to be deemed withdrawn by the Law Society in\nview of our findings on the 2nd and 3rd Charges and the Law Society’s position as\naforesaid.\nJ.\n\nPROPOSED 7TH CHARGE – RULE 17(2)(A) OF THE PCR 2015\n\n198. After the filing of closing and reply submissions by the parties, the Tribunal\nqueried the parties as to whether rule 17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015 was relevant to this\ncase. This rule provides that a legal practitioner must not undertake work in a manner\nthat unnecessarily or improperly increases the costs that are payable to the legal\npractitioner.\n199. A further hearing was convened to consider this issue. The Law Society was of\nthe view that rule 17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015 is indeed relevant, and sought leave to\nprefer a proposed 7th Charge and Alternative 7th Charge (set out in full in the Appendix)\nagainst the Respondent for breach of the rule. Although the allegations in these\nCharges still relate to the Respondent’s conduct of Suit 1255, DC 1043 and Suit 1167,\nthey specifically refer to the following:\n(a)\n\nthe commencement of Suit 1255 and Suit 1167 when an adjudication under\nSOPA would be the appropriate course of action to take;\n\n(b)\n\nthe resisting of SUM 431 and RA 44 in Suit 1255;\n\n(c)\n\nthe filing of SUM 5237 and SUM 5616 in Suit 1255;\n\n(d)\n\nthe entry into the Suit 1255 Settlement without reducing it in writing or getting\nan agreement on the material terms as to the payment of the settlement sum, and\nthe consequent filing of SUM 1394 and commencement of DC 1043; and\n\n(e)\n\nThe commencement of Suit 1167 one year after the commencement of Suit 1255,\nsuch that it had to be prosecuted as a separate and independent suit.\n\n200. The Charges also recount that, despite such conduct, the Respondent proceeded\nto bill P&P a total of $423,880.96 (including GST and disbursements).\n201. The Law Society took the position that the proposed Charges would be\nproceeded with irrespective of whether the 2nd and 3rd Charges (or their respective\nAlternative Charges) are established. In other words, even though the conduct alleged\nin the proposed 7th Charge and Alternative 7th Charge overlapped very substantially\nwith the facts relied upon for the 2nd and 3rd Charges (or their respective Alternative\n\n35\n\n\fCharges), the Respondent was to be additionally charged with the contravention of rule\n17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015.\n202. It is clear that this Tribunal has the power to prefer the additional Charges\nagainst the Respondent under section 89(4) of the Legal Profession Act, provided that\nproper notice of the allegations is given to him and he has a reasonable opportunity to\ndeal with any complaint levelled against him (Law Society of Singapore v Tan Puay\nKhiang [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [50]-[51]). It is similarly clear that the contravention\nof rule 17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015 is a different disciplinary offence from the\ncontravention of rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 which is the subject of\nthe 2nd and 3rd Charges (and their respective Alternative Charges). There is no risk of\nthe Respondent being punished twice for the same offence.\n203. The critical issue is whether this Tribunal should exercise its statutory\njurisdiction to allow the additional Charges in all the circumstances of this case. As will\nbe explained below, we will not allow the Law Society to prefer a proposed 7th Charge\nand Alternative 7th Charge.\n204. The Law Society’s application to introduce the additional Charges was made\nonly after the trial had been completed and closing submissions had been exchanged,\nin response to a query raised by the Tribunal as to the relevance of rule 17(2)(a) of the\nPCR 2015 to the case. There was no suggestion by the Law Society that additional\nAEICs or the recalling of witnesses would be necessary. In fact, the Law Society took\nthe position that the additional Charges would be based on the facts already before this\nTribunal. The Law Society also submitted that the Respondent had already been\nafforded a reasonable opportunity to deal with the complaint in the additional Charges\nas he had been cross-examined on the necessity and propriety of his actions and had\naddressed the reasons for his actions in his Defence and submissions.\n205. In our opinion, given the course of the proceedings, the introduction of the\nadditional Charges at such a late stage in the proceedings would be unfair and\nprejudicial to the Respondent. The focus of the additional Charges is whether the\nRespondent undertook work in a manner that unnecessarily or improperly increased the\ncosts that were payable to him. This is fundamentally different from the issues in the\n2nd and 3rd Charges (and their respective Alternative Charges) as to whether the\nRespondent had conducted the evaluation and dispensed the advice required by rules\n17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015.\n206. The AEICs and cross-examination of the Complainant and the Respondent did\nnot deal specifically with the issue of whether there had been breaches of rule 17(2)(a)\nof the PCR 2015. No case on a breach of rule 17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015 was put to the\nRespondent under cross-examination. The primary inquiry was whether the\nRespondent, in each of the relevant instances in the conduct of Suit 1255, DC 1043 and\nSuit 1167, had evaluated with the Complainant the expense or risk involved in a\nparticular course of action or the use of ADR processes, or had advised the Complainant\non the relevant legal issues to enable him to make an informed decision about how to\nact. We do not think it can safely be said that, based solely on the proceedings before\n\n36\n\n\fthis Tribunal, the Respondent has had a reasonable opportunity of meeting a case based\non a breach of rule 17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015.\n207. Further, if the additional Charges are introduced, the question of whether the\nsum of $423,880.96 (including GST and disbursements) billed by the Respondent to\nP&P is reasonable may become relevant. The Respondent may conceivably take the\nposition that his fees would have been the same even if he had conducted the legal\nproceedings in a manner regarded by the Law Society as necessary and proper. The\nLaw Society may also dispute this position. There is little evidence in these\nproceedings, if any, that assists the Tribunal on this question.\n208. Finally, we place some weight on the lateness of the Law Society’s application\nto introduce the additional Charges. It is not clear why Charges based on a breach of\nrule 17(2)(a) of the PCR 2015 were not introduced much earlier, since the other Charges\nwere already relying on breaches of other limbs of rule 17(2) of the PCR 2015. We\nacknowledge the constraints under which the Law Society has to operate when\nconducting a prosecution based on the evidence of a layman complainant, and we do\nnot suggest any lack of diligence on the part of the Law Society. However, save in\nexceptional circumstances, it is generally undesirable that a respondent should be faced\nwith new charges near what he reasonably assumed was the conclusion of the\ndisciplinary proceedings.\nK.\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\n209. This Tribunal finds that the Respondent breached rules 17(2)(e)(i) and 17(2)(f)\nof the PCR 2015 in relation to the following:\n(a)\n\nthe commencement of Suit 1255;\n\n(b)\n\nresisting Kori’s application for production of documents in SUM 413 and filing\nRA 44 against the Assistant Registrar’s decision in SUM 413;\n\n(c)\n\nthe filing of SUM 1394 in relation to the Suit 1255 Settlement without the\ninstructions of the Complainant;\n\n(d)\n\nthe filing of SUM 5237 and SUM 5616 in Suit 1255 seeking third-party\ndiscovery against Taisei and leave to call further witnesses for trial;\n\n(e)\n\nthe commencement of DC 1043;\n\n(f)\n\nKori’s 1st OTS in DC 1043;\n\n(g)\n\nKori’s 2nd OTS in DC 1043; and\n\n(h)\n\nthe commencement of Suit 1167.\n\n37\n\n\f210. This Tribunal also finds that the Respondent breached rule 17(2)(f) of the PCR\n2015 by making proposals for costs on behalf of P&P to Taisei and Kori in Suit 1255\nwithout the instructions of the Complainant. This Tribunal further finds that the\nRespondent breached rule 17(2)(e)(ii) of the PCR 2015 in that he failed to evaluate with\nthe Complainant the use of ADR processes in Suit 1167.\n211. The above breaches of the PCR 2015 amount to improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.\n212. We would also like to record that, in our view, the findings are established\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, which is the applicable standard of proof in these\nproceedings (Law Society of Singapore v Dhanwant Singh [2020] 4 SLR 736 at [116]).\nConsequently, we find the Respondent guilty of the 2nd and 3rd Charges.\n213. We further determine, pursuant to section 93(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act,\nthat cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the\nLegal Profession Act. We note the observations in Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine\nGowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR 390 and Law Society of Singapore v Constance\nMargreat Paglar [2021] 4 SLR 382 that only the most serious cases should be heard\nby the Court of Three Judges. We are satisfied that this is a serious case that warrants\nthe attention of the Court of Three Judges for the following principal reasons:\n(a)\n\nThe breaches of rules 17(2)(e) and 17(2)(f) of the PCR 2015 were not one-off\nbreaches but form a pattern of irresponsible and unprofessional conduct by the\nRespondent over a period of almost 3 years.\n\n(b)\n\nIt is clear that the Respondent knew of his duties under the relevant rules at the\nmaterial times and he did not assert to the contrary. The breaches were not\ncommitted merely as a result of the Respondent's lack of care or awareness of\nhis professional duties.\n\n(c)\n\nThe breaches relate to the same client and essentially the same dispute with Kori.\nThe breaches caused or contributed to the lamentable situation where 3 separate\nsuits were commenced by P&P against Kori, and various applications were filed\nin the suits by P&P and rejected by the courts with costs. The resulting\ninefficiency and waste of resources, as well as the significant prejudice visited\nupon P&P and the Complainant, are apparent. Although P&P substantially\nprevailed in its dispute with Kori, it received only a sum of $185,757.26, after\ndeductions on account of the Respondent’s bills and the payment of costs\nordered by the Court. In contrast, the Respondent billed P&P a total of\n$423,880.96 (including GST and disbursements) for Suit 1255, DC 1043 and\nSuit 1167.\n\n(d)\n\nIt would have been clear to the Respondent that the Complainant, although a\nbusinessman, was not familiar with legal proceedings and procedures and was\nsuffering financial stress as a result of the dispute with Kori. However, the\n\n38\n\n\fRespondent completely failed to give the Complainant the professional advice\nand guidance that was sorely needed to navigate through P&P’s legal troubles.\n214.\n\nFor completeness, and with respect to the other Charges:\n\n(a)\n\nThe 1st Charge (and Alternative 1st Charge) have been stayed (for reasons set\nout in our Interim Report dated 24 May 2021);\n\n(b)\n\nWe find that the 4th and 5th Charges are not made out for the reasons stated at\nparagraphs 184 to 195;\n\n(c)\n\nWe consider the 6th Charge to be deemed withdrawn by the Law Society in view\nof our findings on the 2nd and 3rd Charges and the Law Society’s stated position;\nand\n\n(d)\n\nWe will not allow the Law Society to prefer a proposed 7th Charge and\nAlternative 7th Charge for the reasons stated at paragraphs 198 to 208.\n\n215. Finally, pursuant to Section 93(2) of the Legal Profession Act, the Tribunal\norders the Respondent to pay the Law Society’s costs, the amount of such costs to be\nagreed or taxed by the Registrar.\nDated this 27th day of May 2022\n\nLEE ENG BENG, SC\nPRESIDENT\n\nWONG SIEW HONG\nADVOCATE & SOLICITOR\n\n39\n\n\fAPPENDIX\n1st Charge\nYou, Andrew John Hanam, are charged that between 25

(Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Ezekiel Peter Latimer (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>The present disciplinary proceedings against the Respondent arose from a complaint lodged by three Complainants, Chung Fook Keong Melvin (<strong>Mr Chung</strong>), Doan Thi Thanh Thuy (<strong>Ms Thuy</strong>) and Pang Kia Phoo (<strong>Mr Pang</strong>), in respect of his conduct as an advocate and solicitor and in relation to events that took place between 2016 and 2019.</li>\n<li>The complaint is grouped into two categories: (a) Ms Thuy’s appointment as a director of a Company (the <strong>Company</strong>); and (b) the Respondent’s conduct of a lawsuit (the <strong>Lawsuit</strong>), which was commenced by Ms Thuy and Mr Chung.</li>\n<li>The Respondent had previously been engaged by Ms Thuy and Mr Chung in a separate matter. Later, the Respondent approached Ms Thuy to be a director of the Company, to which Ms Thuy agreed. The Respondent had been engaged to act for the Company.</li>\n<li>Before agreeing she asked if it was safe for her to be a director of the Company. She was unaware that the Company had an ongoing legal case with another company (the <strong>Creditor</strong>), in which the Creditor subsequently obtained final judgment against the Company, and filed an application against the Company for the examination of judgement debtor (<strong>EJD</strong>). The Court made several orders for Ms Thuy to attend Court to be orally examined on the debts of the Company, which she failed to attend.</li>\n<li>The Creditor commenced committal proceedings against Ms Thuy for breach of EJD orders. The Respondent filed another Notice of Appointment to represent Ms Thuy as a non-party, but neither Ms Thuy nor the Respondent attended the hearing on 2 April 2018. As a result, a warrant of arrest was issued against Ms Thuy, which was discharged by the Court subject to conditions which included the requirement that Ms Thuy must provide security and surrender her passport to the Sheriff.</li>\n<li>Ms Thuy’s application seeking a release of her passport was granted on condition that a surety be provided to secure the return of her passport after 30 days. Pursuant to this, the Respondent gave a personal undertaking to the Court (<strong>Personal Undertaking</strong>).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><strong>Facts in Relation to the Respondent’s Conduct of the Lawsuit</strong></h4>\n<ol start=\"7\" type=\"1\">\n<li>In or around 2017, Mr Chung and Ms Thuy engaged the Respondent to commence the Lawsuit. In the course of proceedings, the Defendants’ solicitors requested a copy of the documents in the Plaintiffs’ list of documents.</li>\n<li>Subsequently, the Defendants obtained an order for specific discovery against Ms Thuy and Mr Chung, which also ordered that unless Ms Thuy and Mr Chung filed and served the affidavit and exhibits they were directed to disclose by a specified date, their claims against the Defendants would be dismissed without further order (<strong>Unless Order</strong>). Instead of arranging for Ms Thuy and Mr Chung to depose to the affidavit as directed in the Unless order, the Respondent filed a solicitor’s affidavit in purported compliance with the Unless Order. However, the Court found that this was not in compliance with the Unless Order and consequently that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung were in breach of the Unless Order.

The complaint is grouped into two categories: (a) Ms Thuy’s appointment as a director of a Company (the Company); and (b) the Respondent’s conduct of a lawsuit (the Lawsuit), which was commenced by Ms Thuy and Mr Chung. The Respondent had previously been engaged by Ms Thuy and Mr Chung in a separate matter. Later, the Respondent approached Ms Thuy to be a director of the Company, to which Ms Thuy agreed. The Respondent had been engaged to act for the Company. Before agreeing she asked if it was safe for her to be a director of the Company. She was unaware that the Company had an ongoing legal case with another company (the Creditor), in which the Creditor subsequently obtained final judgment against the Company, and filed an application against the Company for the examination of judgement debtor (EJD). The Court made several orders for Ms Thuy to attend Court to be orally examined on the debts of the Company, which she failed to attend. The Creditor commenced committal proceedings against Ms Thuy for breach of EJD orders. The Respondent filed another Notice of Appointment to represent Ms Thuy as a non-party, but neither Ms Thuy nor the Respondent attended the hearing on 2 April 2018. As a result, a warrant of arrest was issued against Ms Thuy, which was discharged by the Court subject to conditions which included the requirement that Ms Thuy must provide security and surrender her passport to the Sheriff. Ms Thuy’s application seeking a release of her passport was granted on condition that a surety be provided to secure the return of her passport after 30 days. Pursuant to this, the Respondent gave a personal undertaking to the Court (Personal Undertaking).\n\nFacts in Relation to the Respondent’s Conduct of the Lawsuit\n\nIn or around 2017, Mr Chung and Ms Thuy engaged the Respondent to commence the Lawsuit. In the course of proceedings, the Defendants’ solicitors requested a copy of the documents in the Plaintiffs’ list of documents. Subsequently, the Defendants obtained an order for specific discovery against Ms Thuy and Mr Chung, which also ordered that unless Ms Thuy and Mr Chung filed and served the affidavit and exhibits they were directed to disclose by a specified date, their claims against the Defendants would be dismissed without further order (Unless Order). Instead of arranging for Ms Thuy and Mr Chung to depose to the affidavit as directed in the Unless order, the Respondent filed a solicitor’s affidavit in purported compliance with the Unless Order. However, the Court found that this was not in compliance with the Unless Order and consequently that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung were in breach of the Unless Order. The claim in the Lawsuit was therefore dismissed and Ms Thuy and Mr Chung were ordered to pay the Defendants the costs of the proceedings fixed at S$5,500. Following these orders, the Respondent filed summonses to: (1) appeal the striking out of the claim in the Lawsuit; and (2) seek leave to file the Notice of Appeal out of time. However, the Respondent withdrew both summonses. As a result, multiple costs orders were made against Ms Thuy and Mr Chung, totaling to a sum of S$7,800 (Costs Orders). This led to the Defendants filing a Writ of Seizure and Sale (WSS) to enforce the Costs Orders, which was duly executed when various assets belonging to Ms Thuy were seized on 17 October 2018, with such assets having been pledged to Mr Pang previously. The following main charges, referencing section 83(2)(b) of the Act for grossly improper conduct in the discharge of professional duty as an advocate and solicitor, were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nFirst Charge\n\nFailing to disclose to Ms Thuy information that would reasonably affect her interests, thereby breaching rule 5(2)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (Cap 161) (PCR).\n\nSecond Charge\n\nFailing to withdraw from representing Ms Thuy in Court Proceedings despite the fact that there was a reasonable expectation of a conflict between his duty to serve the best interests of Ms Thuy as his client and his own personal interest, thereby breaching rule 22(2) of the PCR.\n\nThird Charge\n\nFailing to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Ms Thuy and Mr Chung in respect of the Suit, thereby breaching rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.\n\nFourth Charge\n\nFailing to keep Ms Thuy reasonably informed of the progress of the Suit, thereby breaching rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR.\n\nFindings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (DT)\n\nThe DT found that the First Charge had been made out, and that the Respondent’s conduct was in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR and amounted to improper conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (the Act). The DT found that the Second Charge was made out, and that the Respondent’s conduct was in breach of Rule 22 of the PCR and amounted to improper conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Act. The DT found that the Third Charge was made out, and that the Respondent’s conduct was in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR and amounted to improper conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Act. The DT found that the Fourth Charge had been proven, and constituted a breach of Rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR and amounted to improper conduct under section 83(2)(i) of the Act. The DT ordered costs against the Respondent in the sum of S$9,000.\n\nCourt of Three Judges\n\nThe Court ordered that the Respondent be struck off the Roll. The Court further ordered that the Respondent pay costs of S$25,000.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jan_25_Peter_Ezekial_DT_Report_compressed.pdf","pdf-content":"DT/SEC/O312022\n\nIn the Matter of Ezekiel Peter Latimer an\nAdvocate & Solicitor\n\nAnd\n\nIn the Matter of the Legal Profession Act 1966\n\nREPORT OF THE DISCPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nDISCPLINARY TRIBUNAL\nPresident: Ms Kuah Boon Theng' SC\nAdvocate & Solicitor: Mr Sanjiv Rajan\n\nSolicitors for the Law Societv of\n\nThe Resnondent (\n\nSingapore\n\nEzekiel Peter Latimer\n\nThing\nMs Angelia Thng\nMs Tang Kai Qing\nMs Nicole Lee\nBraddell Brothers LLP\n11 Beach Road, #04-01\nSingapore 189675\nRef: ATYT/TKQ/20220008\n\nDated this\n\npc. 0\n\n4th\n\nday of May 2023\n\nin oerson)\n\n\fI\n\nL\n\nIntroduction\n\nI\n\nOn 3 June 2020, the complainants, Chung Fook Keong Melvin (\"Mr Chung\"),\nDoan Thi Thanh Thuy (\"Ms Thuy\") and Pang Kia Phoo (\"Mr Pang\") lodged a\ncomplaint against the Respondent in respect of his conduct as an advocate and\n\nsolicitor and in relation to events that took place between 2016 and 2019\n(\"Complaint\").\n\n2\n\nThe Respondent was admitted to the Bar in 1996.

Sometime in or around2016,\n\nthe Respondent asked Ms Thuy if she was keen to be a director of the Company'\nHe informed her that the role was a temporary one, and that the director she was\nsupposed to replace was undergoing medical treatment and would retum once he\n\nhad completed his treatment.l Ms Thuy agreed and was appointed a director on 8\n\nOctober 2016. There was no dispute that Ms Thuy took up the appointment only\nafter she had asked the Respondent if it was safe for her to be a director of the\nCompany. However, what the Respondent said in response to her 9uerY, and the\n\ncapacity in which the Respondent provided that advice, is a point of contention\nbetween the parties.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent claimed that he told Ms Thuy that the Company had been involved\n\nin a lawsuit with a Malaysian-registered company known as Horizon Petroleum\nLimited (Malaysia Registration No. LL04373) (\"[IPL\") (namely, HC/S 124812014\n(\"S 1248\")) but that the case oohad been settled between the parties\" and\"she would\nnot have any personal liabitity in respect of this Suit 1248/2014'.2 Unbeknownst to\n\nMs Thuy, S 1248 was still an ongoinq legal case and concerned a debt owed under\n\nITranscript (10 Aug) atpp4l-42,1nes27-2;Affidavitof Evidence-in-Chief (\"AEIC\") of DoanThi\nThanh Thuy at [0] and AEIC of Chung Fook Cheong Melvin at [0]. Contrary to what the Respondent\nstated, the \"Mr Lim\" he referred to as a director was not actually a director of the Company.\n\n2\n\nRespondent's Affidavit at [7]\n\n\fJ\n\na settlement agreement which the Company had entered into with HPL, for which\n\nthe Company had failed to make any of the agreed payments.3\n\n7\n\nHPL subsequently obtained final judgment against the Company on 20 February\n2017J On 5 June 2017, HPL filed an application against the Company for the\nexamination ofjudgment debtor (\"EJI)\"). In the EJD proceedings, the Court made\n\nsix orders (dated 26 July 2017s,22 September 20176,20 October 20171 ,l0\nNovember 20178, 1 December 2017e and 22 December 20171\\ for Ms Thuy to\nattend Court and be orally examined on the debts of the Company.ll However, in\nbreach of the EJD orders, she failed to attend these proceedings.l2 At some point\nduring these events, the Respondent would have been aware of the EJD proceedings\nas he was engaged to act for the Company and proceeded to file a Notice of\n\nAppointment on behalf of the Company on 20 October 2017 (the same date as the\n3rd EJD order).13\n\n8\n\nOn23 January 2018, HPL filed an application for leave to commence committal\nproceedings against Ms Thuy for breach of the EJD orders.ra Shortly thereafter on\n\n3\n\nProsecution's Bundle of Documents (\"PBD\") Tab 1, in particular paragraphs 3 to 12 of the Statement of\nClaim (AmendmentNo. l)\n4\nPBD Tab 9\n5\n\npgo tab to\n\n6PBDTab ll\n7\n8\ne\n\nPBD Tab 12\nPBD Tabt4\n\nPBI tab 15\n\nro\n\nPBD Tab lj\n\nrr Siatement of Case at\n\n[9]\n\n12\n\nSiatement of Case at[20]\n\n13\n\nPBD Tab 13\nPBD Tab l8\n\n14\n\n\f4\n\nI February 20l8,the Respondent filed another Notice of Appointment, this time to\nrepresent Ms Thuy in S 1248 as a non-patty.tt HPL's application for leave to\n\ncommenco committal proceedings was subsequently granted on 13 February\n201816, and committal proceedings were cofirmenced on 19 February 201817 and\nscheduled to be heard on 2 April2018.\n\n9\n\nNeither Ms Thuy nor the Respondent as her lawyer attended the hearing on 2 April\n2018. As a result , a warrant of arrest issued against Ms Thuy on that date.l8 The\n\nwa:rant of arrest was only discharged by the Court on 19 July 2018 subject to\nconditions which included the requirement that Ms Thuy must provide security and\nsurrender her passport to the Sheriff by 23 July 2018 until further order.re\n\n10. On behalf of Ms Thuy, the Respondent prepared and submitted a ooPlea in\nMitigation\", seeking to explain the circumstances that led to Ms Thuy's noncompliance with the EJD orders.2OIn the Plea of Mitigation, he urged the Court to\n\nimpose the \"lightest possible sentence\" on Ms Thuy. On 12 September 2018, a\nCommittal Order was made against Ms Thuy and she was ordered inter alia to pay\na fine of 5$25,000.00 for acting in contempt of Court, failing which she would be\n\ncommitted to prison for 14 days (\"Committal Order\").2l Pursuant to the\n\n15\n\nPBD Tab 19\nPBD Tab 2o\nr7\nPBD Tab 2l\n18\nOrder of Court at PBD Tab 22, Warrant of Arrest at PBD Tab 24\nre\nPBD Tab25\n20\nExhibit L3\n16\n\n2rPBD Tab26\n\n\f5\n\nCommittal Order, Ms Thuy's passport was handed over to the Sheriff of the\nSupreme Court on25 September 2018.\n\n11.

Ms Thuy's application seeking a release of her passport was granted on condition\nthat a surety be provided to secure the return of her passport after 30 days. On 16\nJanuary 2019, the Respondent gave a personal undertaking to the Court, wherein\n\nhe agreed to \"provide security to the Court for the sum of 5$25,000 for the\nfollowing pu{poses, namely: (a) the release of the passport of [Ms Thuy] pending\n\n22\n23\n\nPBD Tab29\nPBD Tab 3l\n\n\f6\n\nthe outcome of the appeal in CA/CA 17712018; and (b) security to the Court\npending the stay of execution that was granted by [the Court] on the 4th of January\n\nl20lgl'(\"Personal Undertaking').24 Had Ms Thuy breached the conditions of\nthe release of her passport, the Respondent would have been liable to pay up on\nthe sum of 5$25,000.00.\n\nFacts in relation to the Respondent's conduct of MC 16562\n\n13.

On26 April2018, the Defendants applied for specific discovery against Ms Thuy\nand Mr Chung.2s On 30 April 2018, the Court issued an order in terms of the\napplication and further directed that unless Ms Thuy and Mr Chung filed and\nserved the affidavit and exhibits they were directed to disclose by 3 May 2018,\n\ntheir claims against the Defendants would be dismissed without further order\n(\"Unless Order\").26 Instead of arranging for Ms Thuy and Mr Chung to depose to\nthe affidavit as directed in the Unless Order, on 3 May 2018, the Respondent filed\na solicitor's affidavit in purported compliance with the Unless Order.z1 However,\n\n24\n\nPBD Tab32\nPBD Tab 36\n26\nPBD Tab 37\n27\nPBD Tab 38\n\n25\n\n\f7\n\nthe Court found that this was not in compliance with the Unless Order and\nconsequently thatMs Thuy and Mr Chung were in breach of the Unless Order.

Following these orders, the Respondent filed summonses to: (1) appeal the striking\nout of the Plaintiffs' claim in MC 16562; and (2) seek leave to file the Notice of\nAppeal out of time. However, these summonses were later withdrawn.

Proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (\"DT\")\n19. In these proceedings, the Law Society is represented by Ms Angelia Thng, Ms Tang\nKai Qing and Ms Nicole Lee from Braddell Brothers LLP. The Respondent appears\nin person. The hearing before the DT coflrmenced on 10 August 2022 and continued\n\nonl2 August 2022 and 12 October 2022.\n\nSubmissions made bv the parties in relation to the l't Charge/Alternative I't Charee\n\n20. The Law Society submits that there was an implied retainer entered into between the\nRespondent and Ms Thuy, because:37 (l) there was a pre-existing solicitor-client\nrelationship between them; (2) the Respondent had approached Ms Thuy specifically\n\nto ask if she would be willing to accept an appointment as director of the Company;\n\n(3) Ms Thuy expressly asked the Respondent for advice; (a) the Respondent\nvoluntarily advised Ms Thuy as to what directorship would entail; and (5) the\nRespondent never highlighted to Ms Thuy that she should seek legal advice.\n\n37\n\nLaw Society Closing Submissions t95l-tl0ll\n\n\f2t\n\n2I. By virtue of this implied retainer, the Law Society contends that under Rule 5(2)(b)\nof the PCR, the Respondent ought to have informed Ms Thuy that there was a debt\nowed by the Company to HPL, and that the Company was in the midst of ongoing\ncourt proceedings. In failing to do so, the Law Society contends that the Respondent\nhad acted in breach of the PCR.38\n\n22. In his Defence, the Respondent did not dispute that there was already a solicitor-client\nrelationship between Ms Thuy and himself at the time when he approached her about\n\nbeing a director of the Company. The Defence instead focused on making the\nfollowing assertions:\n\n(1)\n\nThe Respondent claimed that at the time, heo'was informed and was qware\n\nthat the Company had entered into a settlement with HPL in respect of\nHC/Suit 1248/2014 and there were no ongoing proceedings against the\nCompany\".3eAccordingly, the Respondent maintained that he had\n\"informed [Ms Thuy| that the Company had been involved in litigationwith\n\nHPL in Suit 1248 of 2014, but that the Suit had been settled', and that that\nwas indeed \"the state of affiirs at the time when [Ms ThuyJ became a\nDirector of the Company'';ao and\n\n(2)\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged that Ms Thuy did ask him if she would face\nany liability as a Director and in response, he\"informed her that as long as\n\n38\n3e\n\nLaw Society Closing Submissions t95l-tl01l\n\nDefence at [1]\nao\nDefence at [4]\n\n\f22\n\nshe did not execute any personal guarantee(s) on behalf of the Company\n\nshe would not face any personal liability\". The Respondent also\nacknowledged that he had \"informed [Ms ThuyJ that she would notface any\n\npersonal liabilities and her only responsibility would be to carry out the\nminimal, tawful duties of the Director with no financial cost to herself'.ar\n\n23. Accordingly, it would appear from the Respondent's Defence that he denies that he\nwas under an obligation to disclose the information referred to by the Law Society in\n\nthe I't Charge (i.e. the existence of the Company Debt and the ongoing court\nproceedings) because he asserts that there was in fact no active litigation, and\nalthough he knew about the debt that the Company owed to HPL, he believed that\nthere had already been a settlement and the \"Company owners were paying payment\nto HPLpursuant to the settlement at the time [Ms ThuyJ had joined as a Director and\n\nthere was no foreseeable reason that the owners of the Company would not continue\n\nto honor the settlement agreement\".\n\n2\n\nln other words, he was not outright disputing\n\nthat he had a duty to answer Ms Thuy's queries diligently and truthfully without\nmisleading her, but was simply maintaining that he did not in fact mislead Ms Thuy\nbecause the Company's situation was not what the Law Society claimed it was at the\n\nmaterial time.\n\n24. It was only during the proceedings and also in his written submissions that the\nRespondent took the position that there should be no implied retainer on the facts.a3\n\n4r Defence at\na2\n\n[3]\n\nDefence at [5]\na3\nTranscript (12 Aug) page ll4lines 14-16 and Respondent's Written Submissions at [1]\n\n\f23\n\nHe submitted that he had offered Ms Thuy the opportunity to be a director in the\nCompany purely as a friend whom he knew was looking for an opportunity to eam\nsome money. Consequently, he disputed that he was under any duty to advise Ms\n\nThuy as her lawyer. He went on to reiterate that he did not know and could not have\nreasonably anticipated that the ongoing court proceedings would continue, and\nenforcement proceedings would be taken out against Ms Thuy.aa He also claimed that\n\nMs Thuy was not as uninformed as she was made out to be, since she is (allegedly)\n\nproficient in English (i.e. able to read, speak and understand English), has been\ngainfully employed and has also been involved in business.\n\na\"L*;.^;^--\n\n*^,1^ L,, +L^ -^-+:^^ in relation to }1.o 2\"d rr1h^-^^l Al+^*^+:,,^ ond nl^-^^\n\n25. The Law Society submits that the Respondent's conduct amounts to abreach of Rule\n22(2) of the PCR. They argue that by giving the Personal Undertaking, the\nRespondent had placed himself in a position of potential conflict between his own\n\ninterest and that of Ms Thuy's. In the circumstances, the Respondent had an\nobligation under Rule 22(3) of the PCR to: (l) make full and frank disclosure of the\nadverse interest; (2) advise Ms Thuy to seek legal advice; (3) in the event Ms Thuy\n\ndid not seek legal advice, to ensure that Ms Thuy was not under the impression that\nhe was protecting her interests; and (a) to obtain Ms Thuy's informed consent in\n\nwriting for the Respondent to continue acting for her. The Law Society submits that\n\naa\n\nFor example, at Transcript (12 Aug) page l26lines 5-10 where the Respondent asserted that the advice\nhe gave to Ms Thuy was fair and accurate and'onobody anticipated that ... unfortunate thingwould\nhappen\".\n\n\f24\n\nthe Respondent failed to take any ofthe steps required ofhim under Rule 22(3) ofthe\nPCR.45\n\n26. The Respondent's Defence against the 2nd Charge/Alternative 2\"d Charge is fairly\nstraightforward. He does not dispute the allegation that he failed to highlight a\npotential conflict of interest and also failed to advise Ms Thuy to seek independent\nlegal advice. To the Respondent's mind, there simply was no conflict of interest. The\nRespondent's arguments are threefold.46 First, he did not see a conflict of interest in\n\ngiving the Personal Undertaking. Second, no one else was prepared to act as surety\nfor Ms Thuy, and third, Ms Thuy had confirmed to him, prior to issuing the Personal\nUndertaking, that she would attend Court for all the requisite hearings and had no\nintention of fleeing jurisdiction.\n\nSubmissions made bv the parties in relation to the 3'd Charge/Altemative 3d Charge\n\n21. In relation to the 3d Charge, the Law Society submits that in line with the\nRespondent's duty to act with reasonable diligence and competence under Rule\n\n5(2Xc) of the PCR, the Respondent should have: (1) informed Ms Thuy and Mr\nChung that the Unless Order had been issued against them; and (2) made reasonable\nefforts to ensure that the Unless Order was complied with.aT The Law Society argues\n\nLaw Society Closing Submissions p45l-[148]\nDefence at [7]-[8]; Respondent's Written Submissions atl2l-l3l\na7\nLaw Society's Closing Submissions at [57]\na5\n\na6\n\n\f25\n\nthat the Respondent failed in his duties because he did neither of these things and had\n\noffered bare assertions to justifr his non-compliance.as\n\n28. The Respondent admits that he did not comply with the Unless Order. Indeed, the\nRespondent had initially indicated that he was prepared to plead gurlty to the 3d\nCharge ae\n\n, until it was pointed out to him that the particulars in the 3d\n\nCharge/Altemative 3d Charge also included the allegation that he had failed to inform\n\nMs Thuy and Mr Chung that the Unless Order had been issued against them.50 On\nthis issue, the Respondent contends that he did inform Ms Thuy of the Unless Order,\nand that Ms Thuy had asked him to file an application to ooset aside the (Jnless\n\nOrder\".Sr He further referred to the affidavit of Mr Chung and Ms Thuy dated 28\nMay 2018 filed in an attempt to appeal the striking out in MC 16562 (\"Affidavif') as\nsupport for his contention that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung were aware of the Unless\nOrder being issued and were involved in the process of attempting to set aside the\nUnless Order.\n\nSubmissions made by the parties in relation to the 4ft Charge/Altemative 4ft Chargg\n\n29. While the 3'd Charge focuses on the Respondent's alleged breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of\nthe PCR (namely, that he had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence\nin the conduct ofMC I6562),the 4th Charge asserts that the Respondent also breached\n\na8\nae\n50\n\nLaw Society's Closing Submissions at [163]\n\nTranscript (10 Aug) page l8 lnes22-25\nTranscript (10 Aug) page26line 3 to page 28 line 9\n\n5r Defence\n\nat [9]; Respondent's Written Submissions at [4]\n\n\f26\n\nRule 5(2)(e) of the PCR, which requires a legal practitioner to keep the client\nreasonably informed of the progress of the client's matter. The 4ft Charge also\nincludes the following additional particulars which refer to the adverse consequences\n\nthat arose from the Respondent's alleged mishandling of MC 16562: (1) the Costs\nOrders made against Ms Thuy and Mr Chung which imposed a liability to pay atotal\n\nof $7,800 towards the Defendants' costs; (2)that the Defendants filed a Writ of\nSeizure and Sale on 30 August 2018 to appoint a Bailiff and enforce the Cost Orders;\n(3) thatthe assetsbelongingto Ms Thuy and Mr Chung werethen seizedbytheBailiff\n\non 17 October 2018; and (a) that Ms Thuy had to repurchase the seized assets at a\npublic auction by paying a sum of S$4,500.00.s2\n\n30. The Law Society submits that the Respondent's conduct constituted a breach of Rule\n5(2Xe) of the PCR, because he failed to keep Ms Thuy and Mr Chung reasonably\ninformed ofthe progress of MC 16562.s3 While acknowledging that he was negligent\n\nin the conduct of MC 16562 and also not disputing the adverse consequences faced\nby Ms Thuy and Mr Chung as particularised in the 4th Charge/Altemative 4th Charge,\nthe Respondentnevertheless denies thathehad failedto keep Ms Thuy and Mr Chung\n\nreasonably informed of the proceedings in MC 16562.s4In support of his argument,\n\nhe refers to: (1) the fact that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung had jointly executed the\n\nAffidavit on 28 May 2018 to appeal the striking out of their claim, which meant that\nthey must have known about the Unless Order and the fact that their claim had been\n\n52\ns3\n\nStatement of Case, pages32 to 36\n\nLaw Society's Closing Submission at1225l-12281\n5a\nDefence at [ 1]-[12]; Respondent's Written Submissions at [5]\n\n\f27\n\ndismissed; (2) the factthatan Interpleader Summons was filed on 17 October 201855\n\nwith a supporting affidavit deposed by one ofthe complainants (Mr Pang) in response\n\nto the seizure of the property by the Bailiff, which showed that Ms Thuy and Mr\nChung must have been made aware of the enforcement procedures taken out against\n\nthem; and (3) the fact that the Complainant waited for a period of approximately 2\nyears before filing a Complaint against the Respondent.s6\n\n3t\n\nDuring the Inquiry, the Respondent explained that while he had emailed Ms Thuy\nand Mr Chung in relation to MC 16562, he has since lost access to his Hotmail\naccount because\n\nooHotmail\n\n... changed the security passcode\".sT He also stated that\n\nwhile there was a physical file, he had lost it after keeping it in some boxes.ss\n\nV.

In respect of the l't Charge/Altemative l't Charge, there are two issues to consider:\n(1) whether there was an implied retainer such that the Respondent owed Ms Thuy a\n\nduty under Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR; and (2) if such a duty was owed, whether the\nRespondent had breached that duty.\n\n5s\ns6\n\nExhibit Ll\n\nDefence at [14]; Respondent's Written Submissions at t6l-t7l\nTranscript (12 Oct), page 60, lines 5-7\n58\nTranscript (12 Oct), page 60 lines 21-30\n5?\n\n\f28\n\n33. We answer the first issue in the affirmative. The case of Law Societ.v of Singapore v\nAhmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani t20061 4 SLR(R) 208se (MW)\n\nat [65]-\n\n[69] is instructive. In Ahmad Khalis, based on an objective analysis of the facts, the\n\nCourt held that there was an implied retainer between the respondent and the\nbeneficiaries ofan estate because: (1) the respondent had given express advice to the\nbeneficiaries; (2) they had taken it; (3) the advice given was not perfunctory or non-\n\ncommittal; (4) the respondent had sought to allay the beneficiaries' fears; and (5) no\nother solicitor was acting for the beneficiaries.6o\n\n34. In the present case:\n\n(1) the Respondent gave express advice to Ms Thuy on the possible\nliabilities she would face as a director of the Company. While the\ncontent of this advice is disputed (with Ms Thuy stating that the\nRespondent told her there were no risks, while the Respondent claimed\n\nthat he informed Ms Thuy that there would be no liability unless she\nexecuted a personal guarantee), the fact remains that advice was given.\n\n(2) There can be no doubt that Ms Thuy relied on the Respondent's advice6l\nand agreed to proceed with her appointment as a director of the\nCompany after receiving the Respondent's assurancas.62\n\n5e\n\nLaw Society's l't Bundle of Authorities (\"LSBOAl\") TAB 3 at pp38-39\n\n60\n\nLSBOAI TAB 3 at pp38-39\n\n6rTranscript (12 Aug) pages 115-116, lines 29-15\n62\n\nTranscript (10 Aug) pages4l-42,lines 27-3\n\n\f29\n\n(3) The advice that the Respondent gave Ms Thuy was not perfunctory as\nthe Respondent himself acknowledged that he understood the legal\nobligations and responsibility of a director under Singapore law.63\n\n(a) The Respondent had sought to allay Ms Thuy's concems, as he\n\nexplicitly recalled her asking \"is it safe for me to come on as a\ndirector\",64 and proceeded to answer / reassure her; and\n\n(5) There was no other solicitor acting for Ms Thuy at the time.\n\n35. We were not persuaded by the Respondent's insistence that he had only approached\nMs Thuy about the directorship purely as her friend. The Respondent had been\nengaged as Ms Thuy's and Mr Chung's lawyer to handle an adoption matter in 2015.\n\nHence, there was already a lawyer and client relationship between the Respondent\nand Ms Thuy when the latter sought his advice about the implications of being a\ndirector of the Company. The Respondent should have realised that Ms Thuy viewed\n\nhim as her lawyer when she asked him if she would incur any personal liability if she\ntook up the appointment. As someone who had been Ms Thuy's lawyer, he should\nhave recognised the significance of the legal question she posed to him65 and the fact\n\nthat she was placing reliance on his advice as a lawyer. In fact, the Respondent\n\n63\n\nTranscript (12 Aug) page 101, lines 16-23\nTranscript (12 Aug) page 105, lines 10-12\n65\nTranscript (12 Aug) page I16, lines 23-28\n6a\n\n\f30\n\neventually acknowledged that Ms Thuy had viewed him as her lawyer and there was\na possibility that he had effectively misled her.66\n\n36. We also find that the Respondent's refusal to acknowledge Ms Thuy's poor command\nof English and his attempts to cast her as someone who was experienced in business\nwas not convincing and crucially, was incongruent with the Plea in Mitigation he had\nprepared for Ms Thuy in response to the Committal Order, in which he had stated the\n\nfollowing:\n\n(l) That Ms Thuy wasoounfamiliar with the history of the company, and to\nmake matters worse for her, her poor command of English mqde it\n\ndfficult for her to understand the nature of the orders made against\nher\".67 We find that if Ms Thuy was unfamiliar with the history of the\n\nCompany, this was because the information that the Respondent\nprovided to her was inaccurate and misleading.\n\n(2) TItatMs Thuy o'cannot be described as a corporqte sdwy person, who\nis familiar with the rules, regulations of corporate compliance\".6s W'e\n\nnote that the Respondent had nevertheless tried to persuade the Tribunal\n\nthat Ms Thuy had been involved in business and was therefore not\nunfamiliar with how companies worked.\n\n66\n\nTranscript (12 Oct) page 7 ,lines 7-31\n\n67\n\nExhibit L3 page 3\nExhibit L3 page 4\n\n68\n\n\f31\n\n37. In the circumstances, we are satisfied that there was an implied retainer between the\nRespondent and Ms Thuy.\n\n38. As to the second issue, we find that the Respondent breached his duty under Rule\ns(2xb) of the PCR.\n\n(1)\n\nRule 5(2)(b) requires a legal practitioner to inform the client of all\ninformation known to the legal practitioner that may reasonably affect the\nlegal interest of the client in the matter. In interpreting this rule we are\nfurther guided by the General Principles in Rule 5(1)(c) which provides that\na legal practitioner has a duty to be diligent in the advice and information\n\ngiven to his client.\n\n(2)\n\nWe agree with the Law Society's submissions that the fact that the Company\n\nowed a debt and there were ongoing proceedings were information that\nwould reasonably affect Ms Thuy's interest as a director of the Company.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent admitted that had he known that there was active\nlitigation he would not have gtven the same information to Ms Thuy, and\nalso agreed that the risk to Ms Thuy was actually higher than what he\nrepresented.6e As the director of a defendant facing a sizeable legal claim in\n\nongoing legal proceedings, Ms Thuy unknowingly took on additional\nobligations and was further exposed to liabilities if she failed to comply with\n\n6e\n\nTranscript (12 Aug) page 133, lines 7-21\n\n\f32\n\nthose duties, including but not limited to the possibility of facing committal\nproceedings if she failed to respond to any court orders in S 1 248.\n\n(3)\n\nAs for the Respondent's contention that he was not aware that the court\nproceedings would have continued, or that enforcement proceedings would\n\nhave been taken out against Ms Thuy, these statements do not assist him.\nThe Respondent owed a duty not only to provide Ms Thuy with information\nthat would affect her legal interests, but also to confirm/check the accuracy\n\nof the information he chose to share with her. In the course of the Inquiry,\n\nit became apparent that the Respondent was still pointing to what he had\npurportedly been told about the CompanyT0, when a simple perusal of the\n\nCourt papers in S 1248 would have revealed that he had been misled. ln\nfact, he appeared not to understand the basis of the legal claim made by HPL\n\nagainst the Company.Tl As the Respondent himself eventually admitted\n\nduring the Inquiry, ooin hindsight, maybe I could have checked the\nrecords\".12 We disagree that this should only have occurred to him \"in\n\nhindsighf'.\n\n39.\n\nConsequently, we are satisfied that the Respondent failed to exercise diligence\nwhen he provided Ms Thuy with inaccurate information about the Company and\nfalsely reassured her that she would not face any liability so long as she did not sign\n\nany personal guarantee. We also find that Ms Thuy relied on the Respondent's\n\n70\n\nFor e.g., Transcript (12 Oct) pages2l-24\n\n7r Transcript (12 Aug) pages 129 to 132\n72\n\nTranscript (12 Aug) pages 132-133, lines l9 to 10\n\n\f33\n\nadvice, to her own detriment. We therefore find that the l't Charge has been made\n\nout, and that the Respondent's conduct is in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR\nand amounts to improper conduct under Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\nThe 2nd Charge/Altemative 2od Charge\n\n40. In relation to the 2nd Charge, we find that the Law Society has made out its case. We\nagree with the Law Society's submissions that there was a reasonable expectation of\na conflict of interest between the Respondent's duty to serve Ms Thuy's interest, and\n\nhis own personal interest.\n\n41. By gtving the Personal Undertaking, the Respondent had agreed to be held personally\nliable if his client Ms Thuy breached the terms/conditions upon which her passport\nhad been released to her. He had a vested interest in ensuring that Ms Thuy complied\n\nwith the terms/conditions imposed by the Court. This interest was in potential conflict\n\nwith Ms Thuy's own interest, for example, if she had a legitimate reason to stay\nlonger in Vietnam and needed the Respondent to apply to the Court on her behalf to\ndefer the date upon which her passport was to be surrendered, such an application\nwould have entailed a degree ofpersonal risk to the Respondent, because if the Court\nrejected the request and Ms Thuy did not retum to Singapore in time, he would have\nto make good on the Personal Undertaking.\n\n42. As for the Respondent's reliance on Ms Thuy's confirmation that she would attend\nin Court and had no intention to flee the jurisdiction, this statement does not assist\n\n\f34\n\nthe Respondent. Rule 22 of the PCR is designed to cover potential conflicts of\ninterest. Even with Ms Thuy's confirmation, there was always a possibility that she\n\nmight have to breach the terms/conditions imposed by the Court for the release of her\npassport. As for the Respondent's contention that Ms Thuy had no one else to help\n\nher, the Respondent's good intentions do not cure the potential conflict of interest.\nHe needed to take the steps listed in Rule 22(3) of the PCR (i.e. make full and frank\ndisclosure, advise Ms Thuy to seek independent legal advice, and get her informed\nconsent in writing for him to continue acting for her). None of these steps were taken.\n\n43. By the Respondent's own admission, he struggled to understand that there was a\npotential conflict of interest.T3 During the lnquiry, after it was explained to him by\nthe Tribunal, the Respondent conceded that there was a potential conflict of interest.Ta\n\nIt was clear that he had hitherto not recognised that there was one.75 Accordingly, we\nare satisfied that the 2nd Charge is made out, and that the Respondent's conduct is in\n\nbreach of Rule 22 of the PCR and amounts to improper conduct under Section\n83(2Xb) of the LPA.\n\nThe 3'd Charge/Alternative 3d Charge\n\n44. The gravamen of the 3d ChargeiAlternative 3d Charge centres around the\nRespondent's conduct of MC 16562. Pursuant to Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR, the\nRespondent was expected to \"act with reasonable diligence and competence in the\n\n73\n\nTranscript (12 Oct) page 43,lines 8-20\nTranscript (12 Oct) pages 42-43,lines 24-l I\n75\nTranscript (12 Oct) page45,lines 14-25\n7a\n\n\f35\n\nprovision of services to the client\" and exercise all reasonable eflorts to achieve the\nclient's objectives (i.e. to comply with the terms of the Unless Order).76 This, the\nRespondent failed to do. Although much has been made of the Respondent's alleged\n\nfailure to inform Ms Thuy and Mr Chung that an Unless Order had been issued, we\nfind that the problems arising from the Respondent's handling of MC 16562 extend\nfar beyond that.\n\n45. In the first place, the Respondent admitted that \"when the (Jnless Order was given...\nmost of the documents sought afier were in [hisJ possession\".TT These were the very\ndocuments he proceeded to disclose after the Unless Order was issued. It is not clear\n\nto us why discovery was not given earlier, which might have avoided the Unless\nOrder.\n\n46. Once the Unless Order was issued, there is no satisfactory evidence to show that Ms\nThuy and Mr Chung were promptly notified before the 3 May 2018 deadline. The\nRespondent claimed that he had tried to contact his clients about the affidavit that\nneeded to be filed but\"had dfficulty locating [themJ to ffirm their ffidavif'.78 He\n\nthought that he had time to prepare and file the affidavit disclosing the documents,\nbut only realised on 3 May 2018 (the last day for compliance) that he had not been\nable to reach his clients and he had also fallen ill.\n\nT6tsgoAt TAB 15 atp344\n77\n\nPBD Tab 41 paragraph [4]. Also, Transcript (12 Aug) pageT3,lines 6-7 where the Respondent agreed\nthat he already had the documents.\n78\nPBD Tab 4t at [5]\n\n\f36\n\n47. When he filed a solicitor's affidavit in purported compliance with the Unless Order,\nhe stated atparagraph 1 of the affidavitTethat he was authorised by his clients to\ndepose the affidavit on their behalf. In reality, he had no such authority, since he was\n\nnever able to reach his clients to tell them about the Unless Order and what needed\nto be done by way of compliance. He also failed to explain to the Court why he had\nnot been able to procure an affidavit from his clients. He gave no assurances to the\nCourt that he would file his clients' affidavit as soon as possible. It seemed that the\nRespondent had simply filed his own affidavit, hoping that it would be accepted by\nthe Court.\n\n48. On 7 May 2018, the Court rejected his affidavit and found his clients to be in noncompliance of the Unless Order and dismissed the claim. At that point, the\nRespondent should have urgently updated his clients and obtained their instructions\n\nto appeal against the dismissal of the action. Although the Respondent proceeded to\n\nfile MC/RA 1612018 on ll May 2018 to appeal the striking out of the claim, there\nwere some unusual aspects relating to this attempt to appeal, which bear noting. A\n\nsupporting affidavit was signed by Ms Thuy and Mr Chung on 28 May 2018.\nUnfortunately, a complete copy of this affidavit was not made available to us, as there\nwas a missing page.80 It was also unclear when this was filed. The Respondent\n\nhimself deposed to an affidavit in support of MC/RA 1612018 but this was only\nsigned on 2 July 2018. MC/RA 1612018 was then heard before District Judge Lim\nWee Ming on 4 July 2018 and leave was granted to the Plaintiffs to withdraw the\n\n7e\n80\n\nPBD Tab 38 at pl\nPBD Tab 40. There are two copies of page 2butpage 3 is missing\n\n\f37\n\nappeal with costs of 5$800.00 to be paid to the Defendants. The circumstances that\n\nled to the Respondent asking for leave to withdraw MC/RA 1612018 are unclear.\nHowever, in a subsequent affidavit that the Respondent deposed to on 15 August\n2018, he explained that when MC/RA 1612018 was heard on 4 July 2018 before\n\nDistrict Judge Lim Wee Ming, the Court took the view that MC/RA 1612018 had\nbeen filed out of time.8l The reason why the Court was of this view is not entirely\n\nclear, but what is clear is that even though the Respondent did not agree that the\nappeal was filed out of time, he proceeded to ask for leave to withdraw MC/RA\n1612018, which the Court granted. Consequent to the withdrawal of MCiRA 1612018,\n\nMs Thuy and Mr Chung were ordered to pay costs of S$S00.00 to the Defendants.\nThere is no evidence that the Respondent ever had his clients' instructions to seek\nleave to withdraw the appeal.\n\n49. The Respondent eventually filed MC/SUM 599812018 to seek leave to file the Notice\nof Appeal out of time, but this was only filed on 17 Septenrber 2018, more than two\nmonths after MCiRA 1612018 had been withdrawn. The only affidavit that appears\n\nto have been submitted in support of MC/SUM 599812018 was the afEdavit the\nRespondent deposed to on 15 August 2018 which is referenced in paragraph 48\nabove. Again, when MC/SUM 5998/2018 eventually came up for hearing before\n\nDistrict Judge Chiah Kok Khun on 2 Novernber 2018, the Respondent again sought\nleave to withdraw MC/SUM 599812018, and this time it was granted with a costs\norder of 3$1,500.00 against Ms Thuy and Mr Chung.\n\n8r PBD\n\nTab 44 paragraphs 3-6\n\n\f38\n\n50. A fuller consideration of MC 16562 therefore shows that once the Unless Order was\nissued, the Respondent's subsequent conduct only served to make matters worse for\n\nhis clients. The Respondent himself has repeatedly acknowledged that he was\nnegligent in his handling of MC 16562.We are therefore satisfied that the 3d Charge\n\nis made out, and that the Respondent's conduct is in breach of Rule 5(2Xc) of the\nPCR and amounts to improper conduct under section 83(2Xb) of the LPA.\n\nThe 4th Charge/Alternative 4ft Charge\n\n51\n\nWith regards to the 4th ChargelAltemative 4th Charge, it is the Law Society's case\nthat the Respondent failed to keep Ms Thuy and Mr Chung reasonably informed of\nthe progress of MC 16562 and is consequently in breach of Rule 5(2Xe) of the PCR.\n\nIn (d) of the particulars under the 4th Charge, the Law Society contends that despite\nknowing about the Unless Order, the Respondent failed to inform Ms Thuy and Mr\nChung about the Unless Order and failed to ensure that they filed the ORC 3009\n\nAffidavits by 3 May 2018. Although the Respondent has disputed Ms Thuy and Mr\nChung's claim that they remained in the dark about the breach of the Unless Order\n\nuntil the Bailiff arrived at their home on 17 October 2018, this is neither here nor\nthere. What the Respondent is being charged with is a failure to keep his clients\n\ninformed of the Unless Order with the consequence that they ended up in breach as\n\nof 3 May 2018, and the evidence indicates that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung remained\nunaware of the Unless Order by the time their claim was struck out by the Court.\n\n\f39\n\n52. As for the Respondent's insistence that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung knew about the\nUnless Order and the need to appeal the dismissal of their claim well before the\n\nBailiff showed up at their home, even if the Respondent's claims are true, they\nwould not assist him. Under (i) of the particulars under the 4th Charge, the Law\nSociety asserts that the Respondent failed to keep Ms Thuy and Mr Chung\nreasonably informed of the progress of MC 16562 in that he \"did not provide [Ms\n\nThuyl and [Mr Chung] with any timeous updates andlor details about the\nprogress/status of the Suit whilst it was ongoing, including inter aliathat the Unless\n\nOrder had been made against them, that they were found to be in breach of the\nUnless Order and that the Defendants had obtained judgment against them pursuant\n\nto the Unless Order\". At best, the Respondent is saying that he had told his clients\nabout the Unless Order and/or the dismissal of their claim after the fact. He cannot\nbe said to have kept his clients \"reasonably informed\" of the progress of MC 16562\n\nsimply by claiming that the period where he had failed to keep them informed was\nnot as long as was claimed by the complainants.\n\n53. We also make the following observations:\n\n(1) The Respondent was unable to produce any contemporaneous evidence that he\nfollowed-up with Ms Thuy and Mr Chung in writing. The lack of access to his\nHotmail account and the disappearance ofhis physical file do not assist his case.\n\nWhile there is evidence that Ms Thuy and Mr Chung were both asked to sign\nan affidavit on 28 May 2018, there is no other evidence relating to what the\nRespondent told them about the progress of MC 16562 at the time. There is also\n\n\f40\n\nno evidence that the Respondent updated them on what happened with the\nappeal that he filed on 17 May 2018, no evidence as to whether Ms Thuy and\n\nMr Chung's instructions were sought before the Respondent sought leave to\nwithdraw the appeal on 4 July 20t8, whether he had kept them informed as to\n\nwhy a subsequent application had to be filed to seek leave to file a Notice of\nAppeal out of time, why that application was also eventually withdrawn by the\nRespondent on 2 November 2018, and certainly no evidence that the\nRespondent had ever informed Ms Thuy and Mr Chung that at each of these\nstages of the proceedings, additional cost orders were being made against them.\n\n(2) We are also unable to accept the Respondent's assertion that Mr Pang's affidavit\n\nfiled in the Interpleader Summons 82 supports his Defence. Indeed, as the\nRespondent himself admitted during the Inquiry, Mr Pang's affidavit does not\n\nshow, on its face, that the Respondent had kept Ms Thuy and Mr Chung\nupdated.s3\n\n(3) As for the so-called delay in the frling of the Complaint, we find this to be\nirrelevant. There is evidence that Ms Thuy, Mr Chung and Mr Pang agreed not\n\nto sue the Respondent for negligence only because the Respondent signed a\nLetter of agreement dated 13 May 2019 acl<nowledging his negligence and\nagreeing to settle all claims arising from MC 16562, including the Garnishee\n\n82\n\nExhibit tl\n\n83\n\nTranscript (12 Oct) page I19, lines 13-15\n\n\f4t\n\nOrder.sa It was up to them whether they wished to file the Complaint against the\n\nRespondent, and if so, when.\n\n54. ln The Law Societv of Singapore v Ooi Oon Tat l202ll SGDT 1385, the Tribunal\nfound that the respondent's confumelious and repeated failure to reasonably inform\nthe complainant of his discovery obligations, which ultimately led to the suit being\nstruck out, constituted a breach of his duty to keep the client reasonably informed\n\nof the progress of the client's matter under Rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR and amounted\nto improper conduct within the meaning of section 83(2)(bxi) of the LPA. We find\nthat the Respondent's conduct of MC 16562 was no less egregious.\n\n55\n\nAccordingly, we find t!3t the 4th Charge has been proven. The Respondent's conduct\n\nin failing to keep Ms Thuy and Mr Chung reasonably informed constituted a breach\nofRule 5(2)(e) ofthePCR and amountsto improperconductunder section S3(2)(bXi)\n\nofthe LPA.\n\nVII. Conclusion\n\n56. Having regard to our findings and for the reasons given above, we find that the I't,\n2nd,3d and 4ft Charges have been made out on the evidence. This being the case,\nthere is no necessity for us to find that the Altemative Charges have also been made\nout.

with the monies in the Firm's client account (DBS Bank\nAccount No. 048-902066-0) held for client, Allied Technologies Limited, to wit,\n\nby failing to record the transactions in any cash books, ledgers and journals in\nrespect of the client account, and in so doing, you contravened Rules 11(1)\n\nand/or 11(2) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors' Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 8§,\n1999 Rev Ed), and you are thereby guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\nThe Charges are set out in the Law Society’s Statement of Case (Amendment No. 1),\na copy of which is annexed hereto and marked “A”.\n\nThe Respondent Pleaded Guilty/The Agreed Facts\n\nAt the hearing of the Disciplinary Tribunal on 3 December 2021, the Respondent\npleaded guilty to all seven alternative charges.\nThe parties signed an Agreed Statement of Facts (Amendment No. 1), a copy of\nwhich is annexed hereto and marked “B”.\n\n10.\n\nThe salient facts extracted from this document are as follows:\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 September 2017, the Complainant entered into a placement agreement with\nOCBC Securities Private Limited where the latter would procure subscribers for up to\n675,164,460 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Complainant at an issue price of\nS$0.05 per share.\n\n12.\n\nOn 23 October 2017, the Complainant entered into an Escrow Agreement with the\nFirm where the Firm agreed to act as the escrow agent to hold a sum of up to\nS$$33,758,223 on escrow in its client account for the Complainant with DBS Bank Ltd\n\n(Bank Account No. 048-902066-0) (the “Escrow Account”). The Respondent signed\nthe agreement for and on behalf of the Firm.\n13.\n\nThe Escrow Agreement states that the Complainant appoints the Firm to act as escrow\nagent to hold the Escrow Funds subject to and in accordance with the provisions of\nthe Escrow Agreement and that the Firm is obliged to hold the funds in the Escrow\nAccount as client funds on trust for the Complainant, until it is instructed by the\nComplainant to release the funds.\n\n\f14.\n\nThe Escrow Agreement further states that the funds in the Escrow Account can only\nbe released when the Complainant issues a Release Notice to the Firm, duly executed\nby any two out of the three Authorised Signatories specified in the Escrow\nApgreement, except that clause 3.3 provides the additional circumstances when the\nfunds can be released, namely: (a) following the resignation of the Escrow Agent (i.c.\nthe Firm); or (b) in accordance with a Singapore Court order or judgment to release\n\nthe funds.\n15.\n\nThe authorized signatories for the Escrow Account were changed twice prior to 23\nMarch 2019. The Complainant informed the Firm of these changes via email and the\nRespondent acknowledged the change in signatories by reply to the said emails.\n\n16.\n\nFrom 1 November 2017 to 22 January 2019, various sums were placed into and\nwithdrawn from the Escrow Account. The last escrow notice was provided by the\nFirm on 22 January 2019 by way of a letter from the Firm to the Complainant signed\nby the Respondent dated 22 January 2019, in which the Firm confirmed in writing\nthat it was holding $33,153,416.56 (the “Balance Escrow Funds”) in the Escrow\nAccount pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.\n\n17,\n\nBetween 19 March 2019 and 17 May 2019, the Complainant made six demands for the\nFirm to release the Balance Escrow Funds. These demands are described below.\n\n18.\n\nOn 23 March 2019, the Complainant issued a Release Notice dated 19 March 2019 for\nthe sum of $$33,153,416.56 (i.e. the Balance Escrow Funds) by way of an email from\nthe Complainant’s Ms Daisy Ong to the Respondent attaching the Release Notice.\nUnder the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Firm was to release the Balance Escrow\nFunds within seven banking days, i.e. by 2 April 2019 (“1* Demand”).\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged receipt of the Release Notice by way of an email to\nthe Complainant’s Ms Daisy Ong dated 25 March 2019 and stated in the email that he\nwould “arrange for the release of the balance Escrow Funds”.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent failed to release the Balance Escrow Funds within seven banking\ndays upon receipt of the Release Notice from the Complainant on 23 March 2019.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Complainant’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Clement Leow sent\na chaser by way of an email to the Respondent stating that the Firm had failed to\nrelease the Balance Escrow Funds within the time provided under the Escrow\nAgreement and requested that the Firm release the Balance Escrow Funds\n\nimmediately (“2\" Demand”).\n22.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, the Firm issued a DBS Cheque No. 304250 dated 15 April 2019\n(the “Cheque”) payable to the Complainant for the sum of S$33,153,416.56 (i.e. the\nBalance Escrow Funds). However, upon the Complainant’s presentation of the\nCheque at the POSB Bank on 24 April 2019, the Complainant was informed that the\nCheque was unlikely to be cleared because: (a) the Cheque appeared to be altered\nand the authorised signatories were required to sign next to the alteration, which had\nnot been done; and (b) there were smudges on the Cheque.\n\n\f23.\n\nThe Respondent provided the Cheque to the Complainant despite knowing that the\nCheque would be dishonoured because inter alia there were insufficient funds in the\nEscrow Account at that time.\n\n24,\n\nOn the same day, 24 April 2019, the Complainant informed the Respondent by way of\nan email of the issues with the Cheque and requested that the Firm issue a cashier’s\norder in respect of the Balance Escrow Funds instead by 12pm on Friday that week\n(i.e. 26 April 2019) (“37 Demand”).\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent responded by way of an email to, infer alia, the Complainant’s Ms\nDaisy Ong on 25 April 2019 stating that he “will make the arrangements™.\n\n26.\n\nOn 30 April 2019, the Complainant sent a formal demand to the Respondent and the\nFirm for the release of the Balance Escrow Funds by 12pm on 7 May 2019 by way of\nan email from the Complainant’s Mr Clement Leow to the Respondent attaching a\nformal letter of demand of even date (“4* Demand”).\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent did not respond to the 4\" Demand of the Complainant.\n\n28.\n\nOn 9 May 2019, the Complainant sent a further demand for the release of the Balance\nEscrow Funds by 2pm on 10 May 2019 by way of an email from the Complainant’s\nMs Daisy Ong to the Respondent (“5'\" Demand”).\n\n29,\n\nOn 10 May 2019, the Respondent replied by way of an email to the Complainant\nstating that “[the Firm] will expedite the remittance”. The Respondent also stated “I\nunderstand that we are to remit the funds to a separate escrow set up in accordance\nwith the SGX directive. Let us know the account details of the new escrow account.”\nThere were further emails exchanged between the Complainant and the Respondent\non the same day. The Respondent stated in a later email “since remittance to the new\nescrow account is not required, we will require some time to arrange for the cashiers\norder on Monday”.\n\n30.\n\nOn 13 May 2019, the Respondent sought an extension of time for the release of the\nBalance Escrow Funds by way of an email to the Complainant, explaining that the\nFirm would “require more time for signatories to be arranged for the release of the\nfunds by latest this Friday 3pm” (i.e. 17 May 2019).\n\n31.\n\nBetween 25 March 2019 and 13 May 2019, the Respondent repeatedly made\nrepresentations to the Complainant that the Firm would release the Balance Escrow\nFunds and/or that the release of the Balance Escrow Funds would be forthcoming,\nwhen the Respondent knew the Balance Escrow Funds would not be released because,\ninter alia, there were insufficient funds in the Escrow Account at that time.\n\n32.\n\nOn 17 May 2019, the solicitors for the Complainant, issued a formal letter of demand\nto the Firm for the release of the Escrow Funds by 22 May 2019, 4 pm (“6%\nDemand”).\n\n33.\n\nDespite the six demands from the Complainant and/or its solicitors for the release of\nthe Balance Escrow Funds, the Firm and/or the Respondent failed to release the\nBalance Escrow Funds to the Complainant.\n\n\f10\n\n34.\n\nOn 22 May 2019, the Firm issued a letter to the Complainant informing the\nComplainant, inter alia, “that the Funds have been paid out from our firm's Clients’\nAccount. We are still investigating, but have reasons to believe that the Funds were\npaid out on the instructions of our partner, Ong Su Aun Jeffrey (“Jeffrey Ong”) and\nmight have been unauthorised...”.\n\n35.\n\nOn 23 May 2019, the Complainant’s solicitors sent a letter to the Firm requesting\ndetails of the matters stated in the Firm’s letter dated 22 May 2019. On 24 May 2019,\nthe Firm replied by way of a letter to the Complainant’s solicitors that the Firm has no\nknowledge of any of the Complainant’s demands or communications with the\nRespondent, and in turmn requested copies of all demands and communications with\nthe Respondent. The Firm also stated in the letter that the Law Society had intervened\ninto the Firm’s client accounts.\n\n36.\n\nOn 28 May 2019, the Complainant’s solicitors sent a letter to the Firm requesting\nfurther details in addition to the requests in the letter dated 23 May 2019. After\nseveral chasers, the Firm’s solicitors responded to the Complainant’s queries by way\nof a letter dated 6 June 2019 to the Complainant’s solicitors. In the letter, it was stated\nthat the funds in the Escrow Account were paid out in the period between 31 October\n2017 and 21 August 2018, and the funds were paid out by cheque or intemet funds\ntransfer.\n\n3%\n\nThe Firm’s Response also stated that the authorised signatories in the Firm to the\nEscrow Account for the period between September 2017 and May 2019 were as\nfollows:\n“For the period between September 2017 to sometime in October 2018, the cheque\nsignatories of the Clients’ Account were (a) Mr Jeffrey Ong, (b) Mr Desmond Ong,\n\nand (c) Mr Vincent Lim.\nMr Desmond Ong ceased to be a partner in or around October 2018 and he was\nremoved as a cheque signatory short while after [sic].\nFor the period between end-February 2019 to 13 May 2019, the cheque signatories of\nthe the [sic] Clients’ Account were (a) Mr Jeffrey Ong, (b) Mr Mark Tan, and (c) Mr\nVincent Lim.”\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent allowed the funds in the Escrow Account to be paid out to party(ies)\nother than the Complainant, without receiving the relevant authorisation from the\nComplainant. There were several occasions between October 2017 and May 2019\nwhere the Respondent allowed funds to be paid out of the Escrow Account without\nthe authorisation of the Complainant. These instances are set out below:\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nS$4 million was paid out to Asia Box Office Pte. Ltd. (a subsidiary of the\nComplainant);\nabout $4 million (either SGD or USD) was paid out to a Mr Lim Tah Hwa @\nLin Tah Hwa, the substantial shareholder of the Complainant; and\n\n\f11\n\n(c)\n\nsome amounts were paid into Platform Capital Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd,\nwhich the Respondent was aware was Mr Kenneth Low’s personal corporate\nvehicle. Mr Kenneth Low is the sole sharcholder and director of Platform\n\nCapital Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd.\n39,\n\nInsofar as the Respondent took instructions from the Complainant’s Mr Kenneth Low,\nthe Respondent accepts that Mr Kenneth Low is not authorised by the Complainant to\nsolely authorise any transactions pertaining to the Escrow Account.\nAccordingly, the following escrow notices issued by the Firm did not state the true\nbalance of the Escrow Account at the relevant times:\n(a)\n\nescrow notice dated 3 November 2017;\n\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nescrow notice dated 16 March 2018;\nescrow notice dated 26 March 2018;\nescrow notice dated 5 April 2018 (reflecting the balance at $15,297,637.95);\n\n(e)\n\nescrow notice dated 5 April 2018 (reflecting the balance at $38,297,627.95);\n\n(f)\n\nescrow notice dated 6 April 2018,\n\n(9)\n(h)\n(i)\n(i)\n\nescrow notice dated 11 April 2018;\nescrow notice dated 11 June 2018;\nescrow notice dated 12 July 2018;\nescrow notice dated 30 July 2018;\n\n(k)\n\nescrow notice dated 3 August 2018;\n\n(I)\n\nescrow notice dated 10 October 2018;\n\n(m) escrow notice dated 12 July 2018;\n(n) escrow notice dated 31 December 2018; and\n(o)\n\n41.\n\nescrow notice dated 22 January 2019.\n\nTo date, the Respondent and the Firm have failed to account for the Balance Escrow\nFunds and/or release or return the Balance Escrow Funds to the Complainant.\n\nThe Law Society’s Submissions\n\n42.\n\nThe Law Society filed its written submissions to the Tribunal on 1 December 2021. It\nsubmits that the present case is one where sufficient cause for disciplinary action\nunder section 83 of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (“the LPA”) exists due to the\ngravity of the Respondent’s misconduct.\n\n43,\n\nIt submits that the present case is one which necessitates severe sanction given that\nthe Respondent was clearly dishonest in the discharge of his professional duties. The\nAgreed Statement of Facts (Amendment No. 1) and the facts in the Statement of Case\n\n(Amendment No. 1) (which the Respondent does not dispute) show that the\nRespondent was not just dishonest for an isolated incident but acted dishonestly on\nnumerous occasions.\n\n44,\n\nIn support of that submission, the Law Society highlights a number of acts of the\nRespondent.\n\n\f12\n\n45.\n\nFirst, the Respondent made a number of unauthorized payments out of the Escrow\nAccount that were not authorized by the Complainant.\nSecondly, the Respondent accepted that his Firm issued 15 escrow notices that stated\na false balance in the Escrow Account between October 2017 and January 2019. This\nwas done to keep knowledge of the unauthorized payments from the Complainant.\n\n47.\n\nThirdly, when the Complainant made demands for the release of the funds from the\nEscrow Account, the Respondent misrepresented on numerous occasions that he\nwould be arranging for the release of the funds when he had no intention to do so and\nit was not possible to release the full sum of $33,153,416.56 as there were insufficient\nfunds in the Escrow Account.\n\n48.\n\nLastly, the Respondent signed and issued a cheque to the Complainant in the sum of\n$33,153,416.56, knowing that the cheque would be dishonored as there were\ninsufficient funds in the Escrow Account.\n\n49.\n\nThe Law Society emphasized that in cases which involved dishonest conduct on the\npart of a solicitor handling a client account, the Court of Three Judges found the most\nsevere sanction applicable and ordered the errant solicitor to be struck off the rolls.\n\n50.\n\nOn his part, the Respondent did not file any written submissions, nor did he make any\noral submissions opposing the Law Society’s submission that cause of sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action existed at the hearing on 3 December 2021.\n\nThe Tribunal’s Decision\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Law Society’s submission that cause of sufficient gravity\nexists.\n\n52\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the totality of the acts of the Respondent highlighted\nby the Law Society in its submissions undoubtedly establish a pattern of dishonest\nconduct on the part of the Respondent in connection with funds that his Firm held for\nthe Complainant.\n\n53.\n\nIn such event, there is no option but for this Tribunal to find that cause of sufficient\ngravity exists.\n\n54.\n\nThe pronouncements of the Courts have made this much clear. The case of Law\nSociety ofSingapore v Chia Choon Yang [2018] 5 SLR 1068 is illustrative. The Court\n\nof Three Judges made a number of observations in relation to the consequences of\ndishonesty.\n33.\n\nAt [16]: “We have repeatedly and consistently held that dishonesty on the part of a\nsolicitor will be viewed with utmost gravity and generally be met with the direst\nconsequences”.\n\n\f13\n\n56.\n\nAt [19]): “...we identified three broad categories of cases where dishonesty will almost\ninvariably lead to an order for striking off (at [105] — [108]:\n(a) First where the errant solicitor has been convicted of a criminal offence involving\ndishonesty that implies a “defect of character” that renders him unfit for the\nprofession,\n\n(b) Second, where the errant solicitor fails to deal appropriately with his client’s\nmoney or his firm’s accounts. This category of cases would also include instances\nwhere the solicitor has been dishonest in his dealings with the client such that\nthere is a violation of the relationship of trust and confidence that inheres in the\nsolicitor-client relationship\n(c) Third, where the errant solicitor is fraudulent in his dealings with the court,\nbreaches his duty of candour to the court and violates his obligations as an officer\nof the court. This is rooted in the fact that at the core of the solicitor’s role is the\nduty to assist in the administration of justice.”\n57.\n\nAt [20]: “These categories of cases illustrate the overarching principle that striking\noff will be the presumptive sanction in cases involving dishonesty that is indicative of\na character defect rendering the solicitor unfit for the profession, or if it undermines\nthe administration ofjustice”.\n\n58.\n\nThe present case falls squarely within category (b) above involving dealings with\nclient’s money. The Respondent’s actions resulted in financial loss of close to $33\nmillion to the Complainant. It is noted that it has not been established before the\nTribunal that the Respondent benefited personally from the acts that are in the Agreed\nStatement of Facts (Amendment No. 1), but this is not an integral part of the case\nagainst the Respondent, nor does it take it out of category (b).\n\n59.\n\nThe present case further involves breaches of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’\nAccounts) Rules, which were connected to the Respondent’s dishonest dealings with\nhis client’s money. Adherence to these rules is important for the protection of the\npublic and maintaining public confidence in the manner in which client’s money is to\nbe handled and safeguarded by members of the legal profession.\n\n60.\n\nThe seven alternative charges to which the Respondent has pleaded guilty are brought\nunder section 83(2)(h) of the LPA which provides for disciplinary action to follow\nwhere a Respondent has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honorable\nprofession.\n\n61.\n\nIn the recent case of Law Society of Singapore v Yong Wei Kuen Paul [2020] 4 SLR\n1284, the Respondent was struck off the rolls following a finding of dishonesty on a\ncharge brought under section 83(2)(%) of the LPA (at {13] and [22]).\n\n62.\n\nFor the above reasons, and based on the Respondent’s plea of guilt on all seven\nalternative charges, the Tribunal determines pursuant to section 93(1)(c) of the LPA\nthat cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the\nLPA.\n\n\f28th\n\n\f\fAmended by\nagreement.\n\nIN THE MATTER OF ONG SU AUN JEFFREY\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\n\nDated this 3™ day of\nDecember 2021\n\nAND\n\n-\n\n—\n\nl\n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n\n(CHAPTER 161)\n\nDrew & Napier LLC\nCounsel for the Law\nSociety\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE (AMENDMENT NO. 1)\n\nCOUNSEL FOR THE LAW SOCIETY\nMR ADAM MANIAM\nMS GINA DING\nDrew & Napier LLC\n10 Collyer Quay\n10\" Floor Ocean Financial Centre\nSingapore 049315\nTel: +65 6531 2741\nFax: +65 6220 0324\nRef: AMYM/GDHX/378119\n\nDated-this—15\"\"—day-of —July—2021-\n\nRe-dated this 3\" day of December 2021.\n\n\fSTATEMENT OF THE CASE (AMENDMENT NO. 1)\nMr Ong Su Aun Jeffrey (the “Respondent”), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, was admitted to the roll in 2003 and was at all material\ntimes the managing partner at the firm of JLC Advisors LLP (the “Firm”).\n\nRule 5(2)(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (“LP(PC)R\")\nmade pursuant to Section 71(2) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed)\n(“LPA”) mandates that a legal practitioner must be honest in all his or her dealings\nwith the client.\n\nRule 5(2)(b) of the LP(PC)R mandates that a legal practitioner must, when advising\nthe client, inform the client of all information known to the legal practitioner that may\nreasonably affect the interests of the client in the matter.\n\nRule 5(2)(i) of the LP(PC)R mandates that a legal practitioner must follow all lawful,\nproper and reasonable instructions that the client is competent to give.\n\nRule 5(5) of the LP(PC)R mandates that when a legal practitioner is given\ninstructions purportedly on behalf of his or her client, the legal practitioner must\nensure that the person giving those instructions has the authority to give those\ninstructions on behalf of the client; or if there is no evidence of such authority, obtain\nthe client’s confirmation of those instructions within a reasonable time after receiving\nthose instructions.\n\nRule 16(1) of the LP(PC)R sets out the principle that a legal practitioner is under a\nduty to ensure that any money or other property which a client of the legal\npractitioner, with the agreement of the legal practitioner, has entrusted with the legal\n\n\fpractitioner, or has made the legal practitioner responsible for, is held in a way that\nprotects the interests of the client.\n\nRule 16(2) of the LP(PC)R mandates that a legal practitioner is accountable to his or\nher client for any money or other property which the client has entrusted with the\nlegal practitioner, or has made the legal practitioner responsible for.\n\nRule 8(1) read with rule 7 of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (Cap\n161, R 8, 1999 Rev Ed) (“LP(SA)R\") made pursuant to Section 72(1) of the LPA\nprovides that, except as provided under rule 7, no money shall be drawn from a client\naccount unless the Council upon an application made to it by the solicitor specifically\nauthorises in writing such withdrawal. Rule 7(1)(a) of the LP(SA)R provides the\nspecific instances money may be withdrawn from a law firm’s client account.\n\nRule 11(1) read with rule 11(2) of the LP(SA)R provides that every solicitor shall at all\ntimes keep properly written up in the English language such cash books, ledgers and\njournals and such other books and accounts as may be necessary, to show inter alia,\nall his dealings with client's money received, held or paid by him through a client\naccount.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent has violated Rules 5(2)(a), 5(2)(b), 5(2)(i), 5(5), 16(1) and 16(2) of\n\nthe LP(PC)R and Rules 7(1)(a) and 8(1), 11(1) and 11(2) of the LP(SA)R. The\nparticulars of the violations are set out below.\n\nCircumstances giving rise to the complaint\n\n1.\n\nThe Complainant in this case is Allied Technologies Limited (the “Complainant”), a\ncompany incorporated in Singapore which is listed on the Singapore Exchange. The\n\n\fcomplaint in this case was made on behalf of the Complainant by its Chief Financial\nOfficer, Ms Ong Lizhen Daisy (“Ms Daisy Ong\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 21 September 2017, the Complainant entered into a placement agreement\n(‘Placement Agreement”) with OCBC Securities Private Limited (“Placement\nAgent’) where the Placement Agent would procure subscribers for up to\n675,164,460 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Complainant at an issue price\nof S$0.05 per share (“Proposed Placement”).\n\n13.\n\nOn 23 October 2017, the Complainant entered into an agreement with the Firm\n(“Escrow Agreement’) where the Firm agreed to act as the escrow agent to hold a\nsum of up to $$33,758,223 on escrow in its client account for the Complainant with\nDBS Bank Ltd (Bank Account No. 048-902066-0) (the “Escrow Account”). The\nRespondent signed the agreement for and on behalf of the Firm.\n\n14.\n\nPreambular clauses A and B of the Escrow Agreement refer to the Placement\nAgreement and state that it was agreed that all funds raised through the Proposed\nPlacement (up to the maximum sum of S$33,758,223) shall be disbursed by the\nPlacement Agent in 2 tranches, to an account held by the Firm (the “Escrow\nFunds”).\n\n15.\n\nClause 1 of the Escrow Agreement states that the Complainant appoints the Firm to\nact as escrow agent to hold the Escrow Funds subject to and in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Escrow Agreement.\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to clause 2.4 of the Escrow Agreement, the Firm is obliged to hold the\nfunds in the Escrow Account as client funds on trust for the Complainant, until it is\ninstructed by the Complainant to release the funds.\n\n\f17.\n\nPursuant to clause 3.2 read with clause 3.1 of the Escrow Agreement, the funds in\nthe Escrow Account can only be released when the Complainant issues a release\nnotice to the Firm, duly executed by any 2 out of the 3 Authorised Signatories\nspecified in the Escrow Agreement, except that clause 3.3 provides the additional\ncircumstances when the funds can be released, namely: (a) following the resignation\nof the Escrow Agent (i.e. the Firm); or (b) in accordance with a Singapore Court order\nor judgment to release the funds.\n\n18.\n\nThe key terms of the Escrow Agreement are as follows:\n\n“1.

Su Aun Jeffrey (the “Respondent”), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, was admitted to the roll in 2003 and was at all material\ntimes the managing partner at the firm of JLC Advisors LLP (the “Firm”).\n\nThe Complainant in this case is Allied Technologies Limited (the “Complainant”), a\ncompany incorporated in Singapore which is listed on the Singapore Exchange. The\ncomplaint in this case was made on behalf of the Complainant by its Chief Financial\nOfficer, Ms Ong Lizhen Daisy (“Ms Daisy Ong\").\n\nOn 21 September 2017, the Complainant entered into a placement agreement\n(‘Placement Agreement’) with OCBC Securities Private Limited (“Placement\nAgent’) where the\n\nPlacement Agent would\n\nprocure subscribers for up to\n\n675,164,460 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Complainant at an issue price\nof $$0.05 per share (“Proposed Placement”).\n\nOn 23 October 2017, the Complainant entered into an agreement with the Firm\n\n(“Escrow Agreement’) where the Firm agreed to act as the escrow agent to hold a\nsum of up to $$33,758,223 on escrow in its client account for the Complainant with\nDBS Bank Ltd (Bank Account No. 048-902066-0) (the “Escrow Account”). The\nRespondent signed the agreement for and on behalf of the Firm. A copy of the\nEscrow Agreement is annexed hereto at Annex A.\n\nPreambular clauses A and B of the Escrow Agreement refer to the Placement\nAgreement and state that it was agreed that all funds raised through the Proposed\nPlacement (up to the maximum sum of $$33,758,223) shall be disbursed by the\n\n\fPlacement Agent in 2 tranches, to an account held by the Firm (the “Escrow\nFunds”).\n\nClause 1 of the Escrow Agreement states that the Complainant appoints the Firm to\nact as escrow agent to hold the Escrow Funds subject to and in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Escrow Agreement.\n\nPursuant to clause 2.4 of the Escrow Agreement, the Firm is obliged to hold the\nfunds in the Escrow Account as client funds on trust for the Complainant, until it is\ninstructed by the Complainant to release the funds.\n\nPursuant to clause 3.2 read with clause 3.1 of the Escrow Agreement, the funds in\n\nthe Escrow Account can only be released when the Complainant issues a release\nnotice to the Firm, duly executed by any 2 out of the 3 Authorised Signatories\nspecified in the Escrow Agreement, except that clause 3.3 provides the additional\ncircumstances when the funds can be released, namely: (a) following the resignation\nof the Escrow Agent (i.e. the Firm); or (b) in accordance with a Singapore Court order\nor judgment to release the funds.\n\nThe key terms of the Escrow Agreement are as follows:\n\n“1. APPOINTMENT\nThe company hereby appoints the Escrow Agent to act as escrow agent to\nhold the Escrow Funds subject to and in accordance with the provisions of\nthis Agreement.\n2. RECEIPT OF THE ESCROW FUNDS\n2.1 Upon receipt of any of the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent shall as soon\nas reasonably practicable, issue a notice to the Parties in the form, or\nsubstantially in the form, attached hereto as Schedule 1 confirming receipt of\nthe Escrow Funds (or part thereof) (the “Escrow Notice”).\n\n\f2.4 The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Funds as client funds on\ntrust for the Company as provided in this Agreement until instructed\nhereunder, or to deliver the Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement.\nThe Escrow Agent shall have no beneficial interest in the Escrow Funds for its\nown account.\n\n3. RELEASE OF THE COMPANY ESCROW FUNDS\n3.1 For the purposes of this Agreement, “Authorised Signatory” means the 3\npersons as set out in Schedule 2.\n3.2 Upon the receipt of a release notice duly executed by any 2 out of\nthe 3 Authorised Signatories in the form attached hereto as Schedule 3\n(the “Release Notice”) the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the Company’s\nprovision of any documents the relevant bank might request for (including\nwithout limitation the constitution and/or such other documents confirming the\nincorporation or registration of the recipient entity), as soon as reasonably\npracticable and in any event within seven (7) banking days, release the\nEscrow Funds by bank transfer in the amount and to the bank account as\nset out in the Release Notice.\n3.3 Other than a release of the Escrow Funds in accordance with Clauses 3.1\nto 3.2 above of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall otherwise release the\nEscrow Funds or any portion thereof only in the following circumstances:\n3.3.1 following the resignation of the Escrow Agent in accordance with\nClause 4.4 below of this Agreement; or\n\n3.3.2 in accordance with the terms of a Singapore Court order or\njudgment or decree ordering the release of the Escrow Funds or any\nportion thereof ...\n\nSCHEDULE 2: AUTHORISED SIGNATORIES\nName\n\nSpecimen Signature\n\nLim Jin Wei\n\n[1\n\nYau Woon Foong\n\n[1\n\nShih Chih-Lung\n\n[\n\n...” [Emphasis added.]\n\n10.\n\nThe authorised signatories for the Escrow Account were changed twice prior to 23\nMarch 2019. The Complainant passed a Directors’ Resolution in Writing on 11 July\n2018 (the “July 2018 Resolution”) and once more on 8 October 2018 (the “October\n2018 Resolution”) to change the authorised signatories for the Escrow Account. A\n\n\fcopy of the July 2018 Resolution (signed in counterparts) is annexed hereto at\nAnnex B and a copy of the October 2018 Resolution (signed in counterparts) is\nannexed hereto at Annex C.\n\n11.\n\nThe Complainant informed the Firm of the change in signatories for the Escrow\nAccount on both occasions by way of emails from the then-Group Financial\nController of the Complainant, Ms Ang Lee Ai (“Ms Ang\") to the Respondent on 11\nJuly 2018, and separately, on 9 October 2018. The Respondent acknowledged the\nchange in signatories and replied to Ms Ang’s emails on both 11 July 2018 and 9\nOctober 2018. Copies of the email correspondence between Ms Ang and the\nRespondent in respect of the change in signatories pursuant to the July 2018\nResolution and October 2018 Resolution, are annexed hereto at Annex D and\nAnnex E respectively.\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to the October 2018 Resolution, the Escrow Account can be operated\n\njointly by the two authorised signatories, being Mr Lim Jin Wei and Mr Low Si Ren\nKenneth (“Mr Kenneth Low\").\n\n13.\n\nFrom 1 November 2017 to 22 January 2019, various sums were placed into and\n\nwithdrawn from the Escrow Account. The details of these deposits and withdrawals\nare not relevant for the various charges against the Respondent. Copies of escrow\nnotices and release notices issued during this period are annexed hereto at Annex\n\nF.\n\n14.\n\nThe last escrow notice was provided by the Firm on 22 January 2019 by way of a\nletter from the Firm to the Complainant dated 22 January 2019 (“Last Escrow\nNotice”), in which the Firm confirmed in writing that it was holding $33,153,416.56\n(the “Balance Escrow Funds”) in the Escrow Account pursuant to the Escrow\n\n\fAgreement. The Last Escrow Notice was signed by the Respondent. The Last\nEscrow Notice is annexed hereto at Annex G.\n\nComplainant’s instructions / demands to release the Escrow Funds\n\n15.\n\nBetween 19 March 2019 and 17 May 2019, the Complainant made 6 demands for\nthe Firm to release the Balance Escrow Funds. These demands are described below.\n\n16.\n\nOn 23 March 2019, the Complainant issued a Release Notice dated 19 March 2019\n(“‘Release Notice”) for the sum of S$33,153,416.56 (i.e. the Balance Escrow Funds)\nby way of an email from the Complainant's Ms Daisy Ong to the Respondent\nattaching the Release Notice. Pursuant to clause 3.2 of the Escrow Agreement, the\nFirm was to release the Balance Escrow Funds within seven banking days, i.e. by 2\nApril 2019 (“1%t Demand”). The Release Notice was signed by Mr Lim Jin Wei and Mr\nLow Si Ren Kenneth. A copy of the Release Notice is annexed hereto at Annex H.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged receipt of the Release Notice by way of an email to\nthe Complainant’'s Ms Daisy Ong dated 25 March 2019 and stated in the email that\nhe would “arrange for the release of the balance Escrow Funds”.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent failed to release the Balance Escrow Funds within seven banking\ndays upon receipt of the Release Notice from the Complainant on 23 March 2019.\n\n19.\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Complainant’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Clement Leow (“Mr\nClement Leow”) sent a chaser by way of an email to the Respondent stating that the\nFirm had failed to release the Balance Escrow Funds within the time provided under\nthe Escrow Agreement and requested that the Firm release the Balance Escrow\n\nFunds immediately (‘2\" Demand”).\n\n\f20.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, the Firm issued a DBS Cheque No. 304250 dated 15 April 2019\n(the\n\n“Cheque”)\n\npayable\n\nto\n\nAllied\n\nTechnologies\n\nLimited\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nsum\n\nof\n\nS$$33,153,416.56 (i.e. the Balance Escrow Funds). The Complainant's Mr Kenneth\nLow collected the Cheque by hand from the Respondent. However, upon the\nComplainant’s presentation of the Cheque at the POSB Bank Branch at Ngee Ann\nCity on 24 April 2019, the bank officers informed the Complainant that the Cheque\nwas unlikely to be cleared because: (a) the Cheque appeared to be altered and the\nauthorised signatories were required to sign next to the alteration, which had not\nbeen done; and (b) there were smudges on the Cheque. A copy of the Cheque is\nannexed hereto at Annex |. Both signatures on the Chegue were made by the\nRespondent.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent personally provided the Cheque to the Complainant's Mr Kenneth\nLow despite knowing that the Cheque would be dishonoured because inter alia there\nwere insufficient funds in the Escrow Account at that time.\n\n22,\n\nOn the same day, 24 April 2019, the Complainant's Ms Daisy Ong informed the\nRespondent by way of an email of the issues with the Cheque and requested that the\nFirm issue a cashier's order in respect of the Balance Escrow Funds instead by\n12pm on Friday that week (i.e. 26 April 2019) (“3 Demand”).\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent responded by way of an email to, inter alia, the Complainant's Ms\nDaisy Ong on 25 April 2019 stating that he “will make the arrangements”.\n\n24.\n\nOn 30 April 2019, the Complainant sent a formal demand to the Respondent and the\nFirm for the release of the Balance Escrow Funds by 12pm on 7 May 2019 by way of\nan email from the Complainant's Mr Clement Leow to the Respondent attaching a\n\n\fformal letter of demand of even date (“4* Demand”). A copy of the letter of demand\ndated 30 April 2019 is annexed hereto at Annex J.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent did not respond to the 4\" Demand of the Complainant.\n\n26.\n\nOn 9 May 2019, the Complainant sent a further demand for the release of the\nBalance Escrow Funds by 2pm on 10 May 2019 by way of an email from the\nComplainant's Ms Daisy Ong to the Respondent (“5\" Demand”).\n\n27.\n\nOn 10 May 2019, the Respondent replied by way of an email to, infer alia, the\nComplainant’'s Mr Clement Leow, stating that “[the Firm] will expedite the remittance”.\nThe Respondent also stated “| understand that we are to remit the funds to a\nseparate escrow set up in accordance with the SGX directive. Let us know the\naccount details of the new escrow account.” There were further emails exchanged\nbetween the Complainant and the Respondent on the same day. The Respondent\nstated in a later email “[s]ince remittance to the new escrow account is not required,\nwe will require some time to arrange for the cashiers order on Monday” (i.e. 13 May\n\n2019).\n\n28.\n\nOn 13 May 2019, the Respondent sought an extension of time for the release of the\nBalance Escrow Funds by way of an email to, inter alia, the Complainant's Mr\nClement Leow, explaining that the Firm would “require more time for signatories to be\narranged for the release of the funds by latest this Friday 3pm” (i.e. 17 May 2019).\n\n29.\n\nThe email correspondence referred to above are annexed hereto at Annex K.\n\n30.\n\nBetween 25 March 2019 and 13 May 2019, the Respondent repeatedly made\nrepresentations to the Complainant that the Firm would release the Balance Escrow\n\n\fFunds and/or that the release of the Balance Escrow Funds would be forthcoming,\nwhen the Respondent knew the Balance Escrow Funds would not be released\nbecause, inter alia, there were insufficient funds in the Escrow Account at that time.\n\n31.\n\nOn 17 May 2019, the then-solicitors for the Complainant, Rajah and Tann Singapore\nLLP (“R&T\"), issued a formal letter of demand to the Firm for the release of the\nEscrow Funds by 22 May 2019, 4 pm (“6'\" Demand”). A copy of the letter from R&T\nto the Firm dated 17 May 2019 is annexed hereto at Annex L.\n\n32.\n\nDespite the 6 demands from the Complainant and/or its solicitors for the release of\nthe Balance Escrow Funds, the Firm and/or the Respondent failed to release the\nBalance Escrow Funds to the Complainant.\n\n33.\n\nOn 22 May 2019, the Firm issued a letter to the Complainant informing the\nComplainant, inter alia, “that the Funds have been paid out from our firm's Clients’\n\nAccount. We are still investigating, but have reasons to believe that the Funds were\npaid out on the instructions of our partner, Ong Su Aun Jeffrey (“Jeffrey Ong”) and\nmight have been unauthorised...”. A copy of the letter from the Firm to the\nComplainant dated 22 May 2019 is annexed hereto at Annex M.\n\n34.\n\nOn 23 May 2019, the Complainant’s solicitors sent a letter to the Firm requesting\ndetails of the matters stated in the Firm's letter dated 22 May 2019. A copy of the\nletter from the Complainant's solicitors to the Firm dated 23 May 2019 is annexed\nhereto at Annex N.\n\n35.\n\nOn 24 May 2019, the Firm replied by way of a letter to the Complainant's solicitors\nthat the Firm has no knowledge of any of the Complainant's demands or\ncommunications with the Respondent, and in turn requested copies of all demands\n\n\f10\nand communications with the Respondent. The Firm also stated in the letter that the\nLaw Society had intervened into the Firm's client accounts. A copy of the letter from\nthe Firm to the Complainant’s solicitors dated 24 May 2019 is annexed hereto at\nAnnex O.\n\n36.\n\nOn the same day, the Complainant instructed its solicitors to file a police report. The\npolice report dated 24 May 2019 filed by Ms Doreen Chia is annexed hereto at\nAnnex P.\n\n37.\n\nThe Complainant also made announcements on the Singapore Exchange on 23 May\n2019, 25 May 2019, 28 May 2019, and 29 May 2019 to update its shareholders on\ndevelopments pertaining to the escrow funds deposited with the Firm. These\nannouncements are annexed hereto at Annex Q.\n\n38.\n\nOn 28 May 2019, the Complainant’s solicitors sent a letter to the Firm requesting\nfurther details in addition to the requests in the letter dated 23 May 2019. A copy of\nthe letter from the Complainant’s solicitors to the Firm dated 28 May 2019 is annexed\nhereto at Annex R.\n\n39.\n\nOn 30 May 2019, the Firm's solicitors, Advocatus Law LLP, wrote to the\nComplainant’s solicitors stating a substantive reply would be given by 3 June 2019. A\ncopy of the letter from the Firm’s solicitors to the Complainant’s solicitors dated 30\nMay 2019 is annexed hereto at Annex S.\n\n40.\n\nBetween 3 June 2019 and 6 June 2019, the Complainant’s solicitors sent several\nchasers to the Firm’s solicitors. In response, the Firm’s solicitors requested more\ntime. Copies of the letters from the Complainant's solicitors to the Firm's solicitors\ndated 3 June 2019 and 6 June 2019, and a copy of the letter from the Firm’s\n\n\f11\nsolicitors to the Complainant's solicitors dated 4 June 2019 are collectively annexed\nhereto at Annex T.\n\n41.\n\nOn 6 June 2019, the Firm’s solicitors responded to the Complainant’s queries by way\nof a letter to the Complainant’s solicitors. In the letter, it was stated that the funds in\n\nthe Escrow Account were paid out in the period between 31 October 2017 to 21\nAugust 2018, and the funds were paid out by cheque or internet funds transfer. A\ncopy of the letter from the Firm's solicitors to the Complainant’s solicitors dated 6\nJune 2019 (“Firm’s Response”) is annexed hereto at Annex U.\n\n42.\n\nThe Firm's Response also stated that the authorised signatories in the Firm to the\nEscrow Account for the period between September 2017 to May 2019 were as\nfollows:\n\n“For the period between September 2017 to sometime in October 2018, the\ncheque signatories of the Clients’ Account were (a) Mr Jeffrey Ong, (b) Mr\nDesmond Ong, and (c) Mr Vincent Lim.\n\nMr Desmond Ong ceased to be a partner in or around October 2018 and he\nwas removed as a cheque signatory short while after [sic].\n\nFor the period between end-February 2019 to 13 May 2019, the cheque\nsignatories of the the [sic] Clients’ Account were (a) Mr Jeffrey Ong, (b) Mr\nMark Tan, and (c) Mr Vincent Lim.”\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent allowed the funds in the Escrow Account to be paid out to party(ies)\nother than the Complainant, without receiving the relevant authorisation from the\n\nComplainant. There were at least two occasions between October 2017 and May\n\n\f12\n2019 where the Respondent allowed funds to be paid out of the Escrow Account\nwithout the authorisation of the Complainant. These instances are set out below:\n\n(@)\n\nS$4 million was paid out to Asia Box Office Pte. Ltd.

Mr Kenneth Low is the sole shareholder and director of Platform\nCapital Asia (Singapore) Pte Ltd. A copy of the company’s ACRA Business\nProfile is exhibited hereto at Annex V.\n\n44,\n\nInsofar as the Respondent took instructions from the Complainant’s Mr Kenneth Low,\nthe Respondent accepts that Mr Kenneth Low is not authorised by the Complainant\nto solely authorise any transactions pertaining to the Escrow Account.\n\n45.\n\nAccordingly, the following escrow notices issued by the Firm_on the instructions of\nthe Respondent, did not state the true balance of the Escrow Account at the relevant\ntimes:\n\n(a)\n\nescrow notice dated 3 November 2017;\n\n(b)\n\nescrow notice dated 16 March 2018;\n\n(c)\n\nescrow notice dated 26 March 2018;\n\n(d)\n\nescrow notice dated 5 April 2018 (reflecting the balance at $15,297,637.95),\n\n\f13\n\n46.\n\n(e)\n\nescrow notice dated 5 April 2018 (reflecting the balance at $38,297,627.95);\n\ni\n\nescrow notice dated 6 April 2018;\n\n(9)\n\nescrow notice dated 11 April 2018;\n\n(h)\n\nescrow notice dated 11 June 2018;\n\n0]\n\nescrow notice dated 12 July 2018;\n\n)]\n\nescrow notice dated 30 July 2018;\n\n(k)\n\nescrow notice dated 3 August 2018;\n\n()]\n\nescrow notice dated 10 October 2018;\n\n(m)\n\nescrow notice dated 12 July 2018;\n\n(n)\n\nescrow notice dated 31 December 2018; and\n\n(o)\n\nescrow notice dated 22 January 2019.\n\nOn 11 June 2019, the Complainant's Ms Daisy Ong filed a complaint to the Law\nSociety pursuant to section 85(1) of the Legal Profession Act in relation to the\nRespondent's conduct in the aforesaid matters on behalf of the Complainant\n(“Complaint”).

Both parties sought timelines to\nfacilitate the discussions. The DT directed accordingly and fixed the hearing to be held\non 15 November 2022.\n1\n\n\f6.\n\nOn 26 October 2022, the Respondent’s solicitors informed the DT that the Law Society\nwould be proceeding with the 1 st, 2nd and 3rd alternative charges, and would be\nwithdrawing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd main charges, as well as the 4th main and alternative\ncharges. Further, that the Respondent would be pleading guilty to the 1 st, 2nd and 3rd\nalternative charges.\n\n7.\n\nThe 1st, 2nd and 3rd alternative charges (“Alternative Charges”) read as follows:\nALTERNATIVE FIRST CHARGE (“LS1B”)\n\nYou, CHARAN SINGH S/O BANTAR SINGH, an Advocate and Solicitor of\nthe Supreme Court and Sole Proprietor of M/s Charan Singh & Co, had failed\nto inform and/or take instructions from Mr Basant Singh S/O Mokand Singh\n(NRIC No. SXXXX850D) and Madam Sockdev Kaur D/O Veer Singh (NRIC\nNo. SXXXX675A), on the completion of the sale and purchase of the property\nlocated at 88 Sophia Road, #04-01, Singapore 228188 in March 2018, and are\ntherefore guilty of such misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession\nunder section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161).\nALTERNATIVE SECOND CHARGE (“LS2B”)\n\nYou, CHARAN SINGH S/O BANTAR SINGH, an Advocate and Solicitor of\nthe Supreme Court and Sole Proprietor of M/s Charan Singh & Co, had:\n\n(a) failed to advise Mr Basant Singh S/O Mokand Singh (NRIC No.\nSXXXX850D) and Madam Sockdev Kaur D/O Veer Singh (NRIC No.\nSXXXX675A) to take the necessary steps to ensure that they receive the\nsum of S$280,000.00 upon completion of the sale and purchase of the\nproperty located at 88 Sophia Road, #04-01, Singapore 228188 in or around\nMarch 2018; and\n\n2\n\n\f(b) provided M/s KL Lim Law Practice with a copy of the signed transfer\ndocument and informing (sic) M/s KL Lim Law Practice to proceed\nunconditionally with the completion of the sale and purchase of the property\nlocated at 88 Sophia Road, #04-01, Singapore 228188 on or around 12\nMarch 2018,\n\nand are therefore guilty of misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor\nas an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession\nunder section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161).\nALTERNATIVE THIRD CHARGE (“LS3B”)\n\nYou, CHARAN SINGH S/O BANTAR SINGH, an Advocate and Solicitor of\nthe Supreme Court and Sole Proprietor of M/s Charan Singh & Co, had failed,\nbetween 12 March 2018 and 28 March 2019, to follow up with M/s KL Lim\nLaw Practice on the sum of S$280,000.00 due to Mr Basant Singh S/O Mokand\nSingh (NRIC No. SXXXX850D) and Madam Sockdev Kaur D/O Veer Singh\n(NRIC No. SXXXX675A) from the completion of the sale and purchase of the\nproperty located at 88 Sophia Road, #04-01, Singapore 228188, and are\ntherefore guilty of misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an\nofficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession under\nsection 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161).\n\n8.\n\nOn 4 November 2022, the Law Society filed the Agreed Statement of Facts (“LS5”).\n\n9.\n\nOn 10 November 2022, the Respondent filed his Plea in Mitigation (“R1”), Bundle of\nDocuments (“RBD”) and Bundle of Authorities (“RBA”).\n\n10.\n\nOn 14 November 2022, the Law Society filed its Sentencing Submissions (“LS6”) and\nBundle of Authorities (“LSBA”).\n\n3\n\n\fIII. THE HEARING\n11.\n\nAt the hearing held on 15 November 2022, the Alternative Charges were read to the\nRespondent who pleaded guilty to them. The Respondent also admitted to the facts as\nstated in the Agreed Statement of Facts. The DT then heard the mitigation plea from the\nRespondent’s Counsel and the sentencing submissions from the Law Society’s Counsel,\nas well as their submissions on costs. The rest of the charges that were not proceeded\nwith were withdrawn by the Law Society.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE AGREED FACTS\n\n12.\n\nAs set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts:\n\na.\n\nThe Respondent represented, amongst others, the Complainants in relation to the\nsale and purchase of the Property. NS Nemura Matsue Contractors Pte Ltd\n(“Nemura”) had constructed a development in which the Property is located for\nthe Sikh Missionary Society Malaya. Following the completion of the development,\nNemura took ownership of the Property and elected to sell the Property in 2001.\n\nb.\n\nOn or around 14 February 2001, Nemura sold the Property to Mr Ram Singh (“Mr\nRam”) and Madam Gurbachan Kaur (“Madam Gurbachan”) (collectively\n“Buyers”). The Complainants were entitled to receive the sum of S$280,000.00\nfrom the proceeds of the sale in the following manner:\n\ni.\n\nThe buyers were to pay S$200,000.00 to the Complainants upon completion\nof the sale and purchase pursuant to Clause 3 of the Sale and Purchase\nAgreement (“SPA”); and\n\nii.\n\nNemura authorised the Respondent (by way of a letter dated 28 May 2002)\nto pay S$80,000.00 to Mr Basant (after deduction of the Respondent’s legal\ncosts for the sale and purchase of the Property) from the sale proceeds of the\nProperty.\n\n4\n\n\fc.\n\nDespite the execution of the SPA in February 2001, the sale and purchase of the\nProperty did not complete until sometime in or around March 2018.\n\nd.\n\nOn 15 November 2003, Mr Ram passed away leaving Madam Gurbachan as the\nsole buyer in the SPA.\n\ne.\n\nOn or around 2008, Madam Gurbachan entered into a sub-sale agreement with her\ndaughter Madam Dhanwant Kaur D/O Ram Singh (“Madam Dhanwant”) to sell\na “half (1/2) share in the [P]roperty as joint owner” 1 to Madam Dhanwant. Madam\nGurbachan subsequently passed away in 2009.\n\nf.\n\nFollowing these events, the completions of the SPA and the sub-sale were further\ndelayed due to various reasons arising from the passing of the Buyers.\n\ng.\n\nOn 6 March 2018, the Respondent received an email from Madam Dhanwant\nrequesting a copy of the signed transfer document of the Property.\n\nh.\n\nBetween 7 and 12 March 2018, the Respondent corresponded with M/s KL Lim\nLaw Practice (“KL Lim”), Madam Dhanwant’s appointed solicitors, regarding the\nsigned transfer document of the Property. The Respondent provided KL Lim with\nthe signed transfer document on or around 12 March 2018.\n\ni.\n\nFollowing the receipt of the signed transfer document, KL Lim asked the\nRespondent, by email, to let it know if “there [was] any other outstanding matter”\nby 13 March 2018 as it was “instructed to lodge the transfer, as the matter has\nbeen outstanding since 2008.”2\n\nj.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, the Respondent replied to KL Lim confirming that there “[was]\nno outstanding matter ….. and that [KL Lim] may proceed with the completion\nherein”3 even though he was aware that the sum of S$280,000.00 was due to the\nComplainants.\n\nemphasis in italics in original Agreed Statement of Facts.\nIbid.\n3 Ibid.\n5\n1\n2\n\n\fk.\n\nDuring this whole period in March 2018, the Respondent continued to represent\nthe Complainants.\n\nl.\n\nDespite that, at no point in time did the Respondent inform the Complainants about,\nor take instructions from them, on the completion of the sale and purchase of the\nProperty. The Respondent did not follow up or enquire about the S$280,000.00\nuntil 28 March 2019, when the Complainants, who after having independently\nfound out about the completion of the sale and purchase, contacted the Respondent\nto enquire about the sum of S$280,000.00 which they had yet to receive.\n\nm.\n\nThereafter the Respondent tried, by sending an email to KL Lim, to follow up and\nrecover the S$280,000.00 on various dates but received no response from KL Lim.\n\nn.\n\nV.\n\nTo date, the Complainants have not received the S$280,000.00 that was due to them.\n\nTHE MITIGATION, SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE AND THE FINDINGS OF\nTHE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent’s Counsel urged the DT to consider the following mitigating factors and\nto reprimand the Respondent instead of imposing a penalty:\n\na.\n\nThe Respondent was remorseful and has pleaded guilty at the earliest possible\nopportunity.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent had relied on KL Lim as a fellow solicitor, thinking that KL Lim\nwould update the Respondent as to when the completion would take place. The\nRespondent’s Counsel clarified that this point was not meant to qualify the guilty\nplea in any manner but was raised as a matter of background to the Respondent’s\nfailure to safeguard the Complainants’ interest.\n\nc.\n\nThe Respondent had handled the Complainant’s matter in a manner “he best\nthought fit at the time” and was not motivated by malice or personal interest at any\ntime and there was no dishonesty involved.\n6\n\n\fd.\n\nThe Respondent had handled the matter as a way to give back to the Sikh\nMissionary Society Malaya and the Respondent did not charge the Complainants\nany fees. When queried, the Respondent’s Counsel clarified that the Respondent\nwas supposed to deduct his fees from the S$280,000.00 but since he had failed to\ncollect the S$280,000.00, he did not charge any fees.\n\ne.\n\nThe three charges that were proceeded with were closely connected and arose out\nof the same transaction.\n\nf.\n14.\n\nThe Respondent has an unblemished record and no antecedents.\n\nThe Alternative Charges were framed around section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\nAct 1966 (“LPA”), which provides as follows:\n\nPower to strike off roll, etc.\n83.—(1) All advocates and solicitors are subject to the control of the Supreme Court\nand shall be liable on due cause shown —\n(a) to be struck off the roll;\n(b) to be suspended from practice for a period not exceeding 5 years;\n(c) to pay a penalty of not more than $100,000;\n(d) to be censured; or\n(e) to suffer the punishment referred to in paragraph (c) in addition to the\npunishment referred to in paragraph (b) or (d).\n\n“(2) Subject to subsection (7), such due cause may be shown by proof that\nan advocate and solicitor —\n…..\n\n7\n\n\f(h) has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession;”\n…..\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent’s Counsel submitted that in the absence of any element of dishonesty,\nwilfulness or motivation of personal interest, the Respondent’s acts of misconduct would\nnot constitute cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action to be referred to the Court\nof 3 Judges under section 93(1)(c) of the LPA.\n\n16.\n\nFurther, the Respondent’s Counsel urged that a reprimand would be sufficient and was\nan appropriate sentence on the basis of the following cases:\na.\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Yeo Kan Kiang Roy [2017] SGDT 7 (“Roy Yeo”); and\n\nb.\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Gurdaib Singh s/o Pala Singh [2010] SGDT 6\n(“Gurdaib Singh”).\n\n17.\n\nThe Law Society’s Counsel agreed with the Respondent’s Counsel that the Respondent’s\nacts of misconduct did not constitute cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action to\nbe referred to the Court of 3 Judges as there was an absence of dishonesty, fraud or other\nserious acts. However, he submitted that the appropriate sanction was a penalty as the\nRespondent had acted negligently and without the level of diligence and care expected\nof a reasonably competent solicitor.\n\n18.\n\nThe Law Society’s Counsel also submitted that the Respondent had displayed a high\ndegree of gross negligence in view of the following factors:\na.\n\nThe Respondent failed in his only duty to the Complainants, which was to ensure\nthat they received the S$280,000.00 due to them, by failing to update or inform the\nComplainants of the developments in the matter when contacted by KL Lim in\nearly 2018, after a long delay of close to 18 years, and even proceeded to inform\nKL Lim to proceed unconditionally;\n\nb.\n\nThe extended nature of the transaction in question and the inordinate delay in the\ncompletion of the SPA, due to various matters that concerned the other parties to\n8\n\n\fthe transaction but not the Complainants, had warranted a greater level of diligence\nand competence on the Respondent’s part;\nc.\n\nThe Respondent’s distinct lack of care was further reflected by his failure to follow\nup with KL Lim for more than a year, and he only did so after being prompted by\nMr Basant in March 2019;\n\nd.\n\nThe potential loss to the Complainants was not insignificant and the prejudice was\nfurther exacerbated by the long delay of close to 18 years that the Complainants\nhad waited;\n\ne.\n\nThe Respondent is a senior advocate and solicitor of 28 years standing and his acts\nof misconduct would result in a greater level of damage to the integrity of and trust\nin the legal profession; and\n\nf.\n\nThe Respondent has not apologised to the Complainants, which was a relevant\nfactor to be taken into account.\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society’s Counsel relied on three case precedents in support of its submission\nfor a penalty to be imposed:\na.\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Ong Lian-Yi Gregory [2022] SGDT 15 (“Gregory\nOng”)\n\nb.\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar [2019] SGDT 11\n(“Constance Margreat”); and\n\nc.\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Sham Chee Keat [2018] SGDT 5 (“Sham Chee\nKeat”).\n\n20.\n\nAfter the hearing, the DT came across the recent reported decision of the Court of 3\nJudges, Law Society of Singapore v Seow Theng Beng Samuel [2022] SGHC 112\n(“Samuel Seow”), and on 3 January 2023 invited parties to address the DT on its\nrelevance to the nature of the sanction to be imposed, and on the quantum of any penalty\nthat may be determined. The submissions of parties tendered on 10 January 2023 may be\nsummarised as follows.\n\n9\n\n\f21.\n\nThe Law Society’s Counsel submitted that Samuel Seow was not directly relevant to the\npresent case, as it was concerned with the application for a sanction under section 83(1)\nof the LPA following a determination by a disciplinary tribunal that there was cause of\nsufficient concern while this DT was concerned with whether cause of sufficient gravity\nis made out. Although both cases satisfied the elements of misconduct under s 83(2)(h),\nthe conduct of the respondent in Samuel Seow involved a pattern of acts of verbal and\nphysical abuse, aggression and extreme threats, a number of which formed the basis of\nseparate criminal charges under the Penal Code 1871. Present in Samuel Seow as well\nwere aggravating factors absent from the instant case, viz, the respondent being in a\nposition of authority over the victims; the misconduct appearing to be part of a broad\npattern of conduct; and the lack of remorse. In Samuel Seow too, the Court of 3 Judges\nwas considering when striking out was appropriate in cases not involving dishonesty,\nand held that the misconduct must attest to character defects rendering the solicitor unfit\nto be a member of the legal profession; or it has caused grave dishonour to the standing\nof the legal profession. The Law Society’s counsel submitted that the conduct of the\nRespondent has not reached that threshold to warrant striking out, and that a financial\npenalty remained the appropriate sanction in the present case.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent’s Counsel submitted that Samuel Seow was not applicable to the present\ncase. It was concerned with whether a striking-off order was warranted in cases of\nmisconduct not involving dishonesty or conflicts of interest. There the solicitor was\ninvolved in grave misconduct of several clear incidents of abusive or vulgar language\nand the use of physical force. While he claimed to be remorseful, he initially downplayed\nhis misconduct and misstated the position to both the Law Society and the media. The\nfacts of the present case were far removed from that in Samuel Seow, with no instances\nof the misconduct which were present in that case. The Respondent’s conduct did not fall\nbelow the required standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness, but was that of\nlapses in the way he communicated with the Complainants and the manner in which he\nhanded over the transfer document to KL Lim. The Respondent has been frank and\nforthcoming with all the relevant facts and documents at all times, and took a certain\ncourse at an early opportunity. His conduct at all times was neither malicious nor\nmotivated by personal interest or dishonesty, and he had conducted himself with utmost\n\n10\n\n\fhonesty, integrity and probity. Counsel for the Respondent maintained that a reprimand\nwould be a fair and appropriate sanction in all the circumstances of this case.\n23.\n\nHaving considered the Agreed Statement of Facts, and submissions of both Counsel as\nwell as the case authorities, the DT agrees and accepts that the Respondent’s acts of\nmisconduct did not constitute cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action to exist\nunder section 83 of the LPA, as required under section 93(1)(c) of the same Act, even\nthough striking-off may be made in cases of misconduct not involving dishonesty or\nconflicts of interest.\n\n24.\n\nIn relation to the appropriate sanction to be imposed on the Respondent, the DT is of the\nview that the cases relied on by the Respondent in support of the imposition of a\nreprimand had extenuating circumstances that were absent in the present case:\n\na.\n\nIn Roy Yeo, the disciplinary tribunal determined that the respondent should be\nreprimanded for being guilty of two charges for failing to inform his client of\ndirections made in two pre-trial conferences at the High Court, and one charge of\nmisleading the complainant that he was still acting for his client, her father, when\nhe had already discharged himself from doing so. However, the DT notes that the\ndisciplinary tribunal in that case accepted the submissions of both the counsel for\nthe Law Society and the respondent that, for the first two charges, the failure was\nmore an error of judgement as the respondent had tried earlier to contact his client\nbut failed and did not consider whether there were other viable means of\ncommunicating with his client without compromising confidentiality. As for the\nthird charge, the disciplinary tribunal accepted that there was no intention by the\nrespondent to mislead the complainant, and that his conduct did not amount to\ntaking an unfair advantage of the complainant, since he did not gain any sort of\nbenefit at all. He was not being dishonest with the complainant but was trying to\nskirt around the issues that she was concerned with.\n\nb.\n\nIn Gurdaib Singh, the respondent pleaded guilty to two charges - for failing to\nrespond or reply in writing to a legitimate request by a fellow advocate and solicitor,\nand for failing to keep the complainant reasonably informed of the progress of the\nsale of the matrimonial property. The disciplinary tribunal determined that a\n11\n\n\freprimand was sufficient as his breaches were in the nature of unfortunate lapses\nand shoddy behaviour. It noted that no loss or financial risk was caused as what the\nrespondent was accused of was for not informing the complainant that she had no\nclaim to the net proceeds of sale of the matrimonial property, which comprised\nentirely the Central Provident Fund savings of the complainant’s husband, and thus,\nshe would not be receiving any share of the net proceeds of sale.\n25.\n\nOn the other hand, the cases relied on by the Law Society appeared to be more in line\nwith the facts of the present case:\na.\n\nIn Gregory Ong, the respondent who had claimed trial was found guilty of two\ncharges - for failing to make the necessary applications within the prescribed time\nto set aside a statutory demand, and for failing to keep the complainant reasonably\ninformed of the same. As a result, the complainant was adjudged a bankrupt. The\ndisciplinary tribunal determined that the respondent should be ordered to pay a\npenalty of S$5,000.00 even though it found that the respondent did not benefit\npersonally, had no antecedent and was not dishonest. The disciplinary tribunal\nfound that the respondent displayed a total lack of care in failing to apply to set\naside the statutory demand and/or for an extension of time to make the application.\nThis was despite knowing the consequences that would follow if he failed to do so,\nand the regular requests made by the complainant for an update.\n\nb.\n\nIn Constance Margreat, the respondent had pleaded guilty to four charges of failing\nto provide updates on the clients’ claims for damage to their vehicles. The\ndisciplinary tribunal determined that the respondent should be ordered to pay a\npenalty of S$4,000.00 on the respondent on the basis of lapses in her management\nof the clients’ files.\n\nc.\n\nIn Sham Chee Keat, the respondent who had claimed trial was found guilty of one\ncharge of failing to act with reasonable diligence and competence by including or\ncausing to be included statements of fact, which the respondent ought to have\nknown to be inaccurate and false, in an affidavit filed by his client in court. The\ndisciplinary tribunal determined that the respondent should be ordered to pay a\npenalty of S$5,000.00 on the respondent for acting carelessly in not checking his\nnotes and documents before allowing his client to depose an inaccurate affidavit.\n12\n\n\f26.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent has displayed a total lack of care in failing to perform\nthe one and only task that the Complainants had reposed on him i.e. to ensure that they\nreceived the S$280,000.00 due to them from the proceeds of the sale of the Property upon\ncompletion. Indeed, it appears that the Respondent had completely forgotten about his\nduty until he was reminded of it a year later.\n\n27.\n\nFurther, although the Respondent submitted that the Complainants continue to have a\ncause of action to recover S$280,000.00 and may not therefore suffer any loss, it was not\ndisputed that the Complainants have not recovered the S$280,000.00 and will continue\nto suffer prejudice in not having recovered the sum. The Complainants will still have to\ncommence legal proceedings to recover the S$280,000.00 and, until the claim is\nsuccessfully prosecuted and the money is received, recovery is not a given. In this regard,\nthe DT notes that the Respondent has pointed to the involvement of KL Lim, another\nsolicitor, in the completion of the sale and purchase of the Property, and what he had\nexpected the latter to have done during the process. The recovery of the S$280,000.00 by\nthe Complainants may therefore not be a straightforward one.\n\n28.\n\nOn the other hand, the DT does not place much weight on the Law Society’s submission\nin relation to the lack of apology by the Respondent as the Respondent may not be at\nliberty to provide an express apology given the restrictions that may be imposed on him\nby his professional indemnity insurance policy.\n\n29.\n\nThe DT does recognise that the Respondent has accepted his responsibility by pleading\nguilty to the Alternative Charges that were proceeded with at a relatively early stage of\nthese disciplinary proceedings and his acts of misconduct were not motivated by personal\ninterest.\n\n30.\n\nIn view of these factors, as well as having read the Plea in Mitigation, the Law Society’s\nSentencing Submissions and parties’ further submissions, the DT does not think that a\nreprimand would suffice but finds that a penalty would be more appropriate.\n\n31.\n\nBased on the three cases cited, as well as after having considered the decision of the\nCourt of 3 Judges in Samuel Seow, Counsel for the Law Society submitted that a global\n13\n\n\fpenalty in the range between S$4,000.00 to S$5,000.00 would be appropriate. Counsel\nfor the Respondent submitted that it should be no more than S$2,000.00 instead.\n32.\n\nUnlike the respondents in Gregory Ong and Sham Chee Keat who had claimed trial, the\nRespondent had pleaded guilty. As for the respondent in Constance Margreat, she had\nfaced 19 charges, with accompanying alternative charges, but only four were proceeded\nwith. The charges were also all based on different traffic accident claims that she was\nhandling for the vehicle owners. The charges were also under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA,\nwhich deals with misconduct of a more serious nature. The four sets of charges that the\nRespondent faced, however, all stemmed from the one transaction that concerned the sale\nand purchase of the Property. Moreover, they were under section 83(2)(h) instead.\nNotwithstanding these, the DT notes that the Complainants, having waited for 18 years\nto receive the amount of S$280,000.00, which is a substantial sum, even though the delay\ncould not be attributed to the Respondent, would have to wait even longer to recover the\nsum. This further wait will not be necessary if the Respondent had simply exercised the\nlevel of diligence and care that was expected of him as a senior member of the profession.\nIn the circumstances, the DT is of the view that a global sum of S$4,000.00 would be the\nappropriate penalty for this case.\n\n33.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the Alternative Charges and admitted to\nthe Agreed Statement of Facts. The DT finds the Alternative Charges to be made out.\nPursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the LPA, the DT determines that, while no cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the LPA, the\nRespondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of S$4,000.00, which is, in the DT’s view,\nsufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed.\n\nVI.\n\nCOSTS\n\n34.\n\nIn relation to costs, the Respondent indicated his intention to take a certain course of\naction relatively early, after the submissions of the Statement of Defence but before the\nfiling of witness statements and exchange of documents. The hearing took about an hour.\nIn the circumstances, while the Counsel for the Law Society submitted that costs should\nbe fixed at not less than S$3,000.00 having regard to the fairly significant amount of\nwork done, the DT orders, pursuant to section 93(2) of the LPA, that the Respondent\n14\n\n\fpays the Law Society costs in the amount of S$2,500.00. This amount is at the top of the\nrange of costs submitted by Counsel for the Respondent and is commensurate with the\ncosts of S$2,500.00 ordered in Gregory Ong despite the respondent there having claimed\ntrial to the charges.\n\nDated this 10th day of February 2023\n\nMr Tan Puay Boon, SC\nPresident\n\nMr Chong Yee Leong\nMember\n\n15\n\n\f","timestamp":"2024-12-11T02:00:15+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-dec-2024/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Rai Vijay Kumar (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Rai Vijay Kumar (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>The present proceedings against the Respondent arose from statements made by the Respondent about the Honourable Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean (the <strong>Judge</strong>) and/or members of the Appellate Division of the High Court.</li>\n<li>The Respondent acted for the plaintiff, one Ms Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman (<strong>Ms Noor</strong>) in a claim against Changi General Hospital Pte Ltd and other defendants, which was heard before the Judge.

At all material times, the\nRespondent was the managing director of Arbiters Inc Law Corporation.\n\nThe Charges\n\nThe Law Society proffered one charge of improper conduct or practice as an\nadvocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1966\n(“LPA”) and an alternative charge of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA as follows:\n\nCHARGE\nThat you, VIJAY KUMAR RAI, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore, whilst practicing with Arbiters Inc Law Corporation located at 10\nMarina Boulevard, #39-01 Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 2, Singapore\n018983, are charged that on or about 26 March 2021 and 19 April 2021, you had,\nin breach of rule 13(2) of the Legal Professional (Professional Conduct) Rules\n2015, made the following statements against the Honourable Justice Belinda\nAng Saw Ean and/or members of the Appellate Division of the High Court:\n\n\f(a) \"IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE APPELLATE DIVISION TO\n\nHEAR THE MATTER AS THE TRIAL JUDGE IS ALREADY SITTING IN\nTHE APPELLATE DIVISION AS ITS PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS\nOF THE APPELLATE DIVISION MAY BE CONSTRAINED AGAINST\nOVERTURNING OR OVERRULING HER DECISION(S)\",\n\n(b) “The timing of the Trial Judge's appointment as president of the Appellate\n\nDivision on 18 December 2020, just before the release of her Grounds of\nDecision, is unfortunate as it is likely to be misperceived by the public as an\nattempt to constrain the Applicant's appeal”;\n\n() \"Further, the Applicants believe that it is not inconceivable that the\n\nAppellate Division will feel constrained against overturning and/or\noverruling the decision(s) made by the President of the Appellate Division\nherself.

HC/S 59 was\nheard before the Honourable Justice Belinda Ang Saw Ean (the “Judge”). The\nJudge dismissed Ms Noor’s claim in HC/S 59 and Ms Noor commenced an\nappeal in CA/CA 47/2018 thereafter (“CAI/CA 477).\n\nThe Court of Appeal allowed CA/CA 47 in part and remitted the case back to\nthe Judge to assess the loss and damage caused to Ms Noor. After Ms Noor\npassed away, her brother was added as a party to continue the action in his\ncapacity as executor of her estate (the “Estate”).\n\n\fOn or about 2 January 2021, the Judge was appointed as a judge and\nPresident of the Appellate Division of the High Court (“Appellate Division”).\n\nOn or about 19 January 2021, the Judge awarded the Estate a total amount of\n$326,620.61 as damages in HC/S 59 (the “AOD Judgment’). The AOD\nJudgment was a decision of the Judge sitting in the General Division of the High\nCourt (“General Division”). The Estate commenced an appeal, which was\nallocated by default to be heard by the Appellate Division (the “Appeal”).\n\n10.\n\nThe Estate filed CA/OS 9/2021 (“CAJ/OS 9”) seeking a transfer of the Appeal to\nthe Court of Appeal.\n\n11.\n\nThe Complainant sat as the Court of Appeal in CA/OS 9, in which the Respondent\nacted as counsel for the Estate. In arguing for the Appeal to be transferred from\nthe Appellate Division to the Court of Appeal under O 56A rule 12(3)(g) of the\nRules of Court (2014 Rev Ed), the Respondent made the following submissions\nin the Estate’s Written Submissions:\n\n“B. IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE APPELLATE DIVISION TO\nHEAR THE MATTER AS THE [JUDGE] IS ALREADY SITTING IN THE\nAPPELLATE DIVISION AS ITS PRESIDENT AND THE MEMBERS OF THE\nAPPELLATE\nDIVISION\nMAY\nBE\nCONSTRAINED\nAGAINST\nOVERTURNING OR OVERRULING HER DECISION(S)\n34. The timing of the [Judge’s] appointment as president of the Appellate\nDivision on 18 December 2020, just before the release of her Grounds of\n\n\fDecision, is unfortunate as it is likely to be misperceived by the public as\nan attempt to constrain the [Estate’s] appeal.\n\n36. Further, the [Estate] believe[s] that it is not inconceivable that the\nAppellate Division will feel constrained against overturning and/or\noverruling the decision(s) made by the President of the Appellate\nDivision herself. It would seem that the Appellate Division is hearing\nan appeal against its very own decision.\n37. The [Judge] specifically acknowledged at [185] of the AOD Judgment that\n[the Court of Appeal] was greatly assisted by Professor Goh Boon Cher. The\n[Judge] then went on to extrapolate that both Professor Goh and Dr. Lynette\nTeo Li San were independent witnesses who had properly discharged their\nduties as expert witnesses to the satisfaction of the Court, which cannot be\ncorrect as their testimonies were the very basis for the [Judge] to have wrongly\nmade the finding that the nodule had not been malignant, which was\nsubsequently overturned by [the Court of Appeal]. In light of the President\nof the Appellate Division of the High Court making such findings, there\nis a real possibility that the Appellate Division may feel constrained in\noverturning these findings. It should be for the Court of Appeal and not the\n[Judge] to determine the true extent to which the Court of Appeal was assisted\nby the Respondent’s witness and their conduct in the matter.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n12.\n\nIn response, CGH raised its concern and disagreement with the Respondent’s\nStatements in its Written Submissions as follows:\n\n“23. We note with concern the [Respondent’s] submissions... particularly\nwhere they refer to [the Judge’s] appointment as President of the Appellate\nDivision and state that “it is not inconceivable that the Appellate Division will\nfeel constrained against overturning and/or overruling the decision(s) made\nby the President of the Appellate Division”. The [Respondent is] essentially\nsuggesting that the other judges of the Appellate Division would be unable to\nhear an appeal arising from a decision of [the Judge] in a fair and unbiased\nmanner simply by virtue of the fact that they are in the same Appellate\nDivision as [the Judge], who is the presiding President. We disagree in the\nstrongest terms. [CGH] believes that the Appellate Division will be able\nto hear the matter impartially. To give credence to the [Respondent’s]\narguments on this point would conceivably undermine public\nconfidence in the administration ofjustice and in the Singapore judicial\nsystem.”\n\n\f[emphasis added]\n\n13.\n\nDespite being told that these submissions would conceivably undermine public\nconfidence in the administration of justice and in the Singapore judicial system,\nthe Respondent maintained these submissions in the Estate’s Reply\nSubmissions:\n\n“15. While [CGH] states that it believes the Appellate Division will be able\nto hear the matter impartially, it has cited no grounds for such belief. |t\nis precisely because justice must be done and seen to be done. The\n[Estate] repeal[s] paragraphs [34] to [37] of the [Estate’s] Written\n\nSubmissions.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n14.\n\nIn Noor Azlin bte Abdul Rahman and another v Changi General Hospital Pte\nLtd [2021] SGCA 59, the Grounds of Decision for CA OS/9 (the “Judgment”),\nthe Court of Appeal\n\nmade the following\n\nobservations\n\nregarding the\n\nRespondent’s conduct and the allegations raised by the Respondent against\nthe Judge and other members of the Appellate Division:\n\n“115\n\nit is deeply troubling that such allegations are being levelled\n\nagainst the Judge and the other members of the [Appellate Division],\nespecially when no basis — whether reasoned or otherwise — has been\nprovided for them.\n116\n\n... Despite being alerted to the problematic nature of his\n\narguments, Mr Rai remained unrepentant...\n\n117\nThe spurious and unwarranted nature of the allegations levelled by\nMr Rai needs no further elaboration. | would only observe that the Judge had\n\n\fheard the AOD Hearing and delivered her decision in her capacity as a judge\nsitting in the Gen Div, not as President of the [Appellate Division]. There is\nabsolutely no indication (and certainly none has been provided by Mr Rai)\nthat any judge sitting in the [Appellate Division] will be influenced by this fact\nwhen hearing the Appeal. A decision by a judge of the Appellate Division\nsitting in the Gen Div or the old High Court, is not the same as a decision of\n\nthe [Appellate Division] itself. In my view, Mr Rai’s intemperate submission\nis wholly without basis.\n118\nWhilst it is undoubtedly the duty of every counsel to put forward all\navailable arguments in the best interests of his or her client, it is equally\nimportant for counsel to recognise his or her overarching duty as an officer of\nthe court (see, eg, the decisions of the High Court in Public Trustee and\nanother v By Products Traders Pte Ltd and others [2005] 3 SLR(R) 449 at\n[26] and [35]; Mia Mukles v Public Prosecutor [2017] SGHC 252 (“Mia\nMukles”) at [6]; and the decision of this court in Imran bin Mohd Arip v Public\nProsecutor and other appeals [2021] 1 SLR 744 (“Imran’) at [81]). The\nbalancing of these twin duties requires counsel to make submissions in a\nresponsible manner (see Mia Mukles at [6] and Imran at [81]). More\nspecifically, as was pointed out by CGH in its written submissions,\nallegations of bias against sitting judges in Singapore have the potential to\nundermine public confidence in the administration of justice and are never\nto be taken lightly. The irresponsible as well as intemperate manner in which\nMr Rai has made these baseless allegations is entirely at odds with his duty\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.”\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the release of the Judgment, the Respondent wrote to the Supreme\nCourt Registry on 11 June 2021 to request that the Court of Appeal consider\nclarifying and/or revising [111]-[118] of the Judgment.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent explained that his arguments were “in respect of likely public\nmisperception”, and that he was not making any allegations against the Judge or\nmembers of the Appellate Division. The Respondent also stated that it was CGH\nwho ‘“imputed” assumptions that he had levelled allegations of bias against\nmembers of the judiciary, and that “the issues of bias and lack of impartiality were\nraised by [CGHY\".\n\n10\n\n\f17.\n\nOn 15 June 2021, the Supreme Court Registry informed the Respondent that the\nCourt of Appeal had directed that no change would be made to the Judgment.\n\n18.\n\nOn 18 June 2021, the Complainant referred to the Law Society information\ntouching upon the Respondent’s conduct pursuant to section 85(3)(a) of the\n\nLPA.\n\n19.\n\nOn 28 February 2022, the Honourable Chief Justice appointed this Disciplinary\nTribunal to hear and investigate the matter.\n\nIv.\n\nProcedural History\n\n20.\n\nIn these proceedings, the Law Society was represented by Mr Chia Voon Jiet\nand Mr Pesdy Tan and the Respondent represented himself. At the hearing on\n22 June 2022, the Respondent was assisted by Ms Jasleen Kaur.\n\n21.\n\nBy way of a letter dated 7 March 2022 from the Disciplinary Tribunal\nSecretariat, the following directions were given under the Legal Profession\n(Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (“Rules”):\n\na.\n\nPursuant to rule 8 of the Rules, the Respondent is to furnish the Secretary\nwith five copies of his defence and one copy of the same to the other party\n\n11\n\n\fby 18 March 2022.\nb.\n\nPursuant to rule 9 of the Rules, each party is to furnish the Secretary with\nfive copies of the list of documents and one copy of the same to the other\nparty by 1 April 2022.\n\nc.\n\nPursuant to rule 10 of the Rules, each party is to furnish the Secretary\nwith five copies each of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of his/her\nwitnesses, bundle of documents and bundle of authorities and one copy\nof the same to the other party by 4 May 2022.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent’'s Defence was submitted on 18 March 2022. The List of\nDocuments for both the Law Society and the Respondent were submitted on 1\nApril 2022.\n\n23.\n\nSubsequently, a Pre-Hearing Conference (“PHC”) was convened on 14 April\n2022 at 11.00am. The PHC was conducted via Zoom conference facilities and\nattended by counsel for the Law Society and the Respondent in person. At the\nPHC, the following directions were issued:\n\na.\n\nParties are to file and serve their affidavits of evidence-in-chief and\n\nAgreed Bundle of Documents by 27 April 2022;\n\n12\n\n\fb.\n\nParties are to confirm by 1.00pm on 27 April 2022 if a further PHC is\nneeded on 5 May 2022;\n\nc.\n\nSubmissions and Bundles of Authorities are to be filed and served by 8\nJune 2022; and\n\nd.\n\nThe hearing is fixed from 22-24 June 2022 beginning at 10.00am on 22\nJune 2022.\n\n24.\n\nOn 27 April 2022, the Law Society's counsel submitted the Agreed Bundle of\nDocuments. Counsel also informed that:\n\na.\n\nThe Law Society will not be calling any witness.\n\nb.\n\nThe Parties had agreed to the authenticity and admissibility of the\ndocuments in the Agreed Bundle of Documents but not the truth of their\ncontents.\n\nc.\n\nThe Law Society’s counsel was of the view that a further PHC was not\nrequired.\n\nd.\n\nThe Law Society’s counsel had conferred with the Respondent who had\nconfirmed his agreement to the above.\n\nWhile not specifically stated in the Law Society’s counsel's letter, it had also\nbeen discussed and agreed by counsel and the Disciplinary Tribunal at the\n\n13\n\n\fPHC on 14 April 2022 that the hearing could proceed without the need for\ncalling of any witnesses, the evidence being by way of an Agreed Bundle of\nDocuments for which authenticity and admissibility was agreed. The Law\nSociety’s counsel, however, asked to be allowed to confirm this after seeking\ninstructions from the Law Society. By his letter on 27 April 2022, he confirmed\nthe Law Society’s agreement that no witnesses would be called. Accordingly,\nno affidavits of evidence-in-chief were required to be submitted by the Parties.\n\n25.\n\nOn 4 May 2022, the Disciplinary Tribunal informed the Parties that the further\nPHC on 5 May 2022 was vacated.\n\n26.\n\nOn 8 June 2022, both Parties submitted their respective written submissions\nand bundles of authorities.\n\n27.\n\nThe hearing for the matter commenced on 22 June 2022 and completed on the\nsame date. The further hearing dates on 23 and 24 June 2022 were vacated\nsince they were not required.\n\nThe Law Society’s Case\n\n28.\n\nThe Law Society’s position was that the Statements contain allegations of bias\nagainst the Judge and members of the Appellate Division by suggesting a lack\n\n14\n\n\fof actual impartiality or an inability to remain impartial.\n\n29.\n\nAs to the statement — “B. IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE\n\nAPPELLATE DIVISION TO HEAR THE MATTER AS THE [JUDGE] IS\nALREADY SITTING IN THE APPELLATE DIVISION AS ITS PRESIDENT AND\nTHE MEMBERS OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION MAY BE CONSTRAINED\nAGAINST OVERTURNING OR OVERRULING HER DECISION(S)\", the Law\nSociety contended:\n\na.\n\nThe Respondent was stating that, as the Judge is currently the President\nof the Appellate Division, the other members of the Appellate Division\n‘may be constrained against overturning or overruling” the Judge’s\ndecision. For this reason, the Respondent submitted that it would be\n“‘inappropriate” for the Appellate Division to hear the Appeal. This\nstatement is clearly an allegation that the members of the Appellate\nDivision would not be impartial in hearing the Appeal and would be biased\nagainst the Estate.\n\nBy stating that the Appellate Division “may be constrained against\noverturning or overruling” the Judge’s decision, the Respondent is casting\ndoubt on the ability of the judges of the Appellate Division to act impartially\nand fairly. The Respondent is speculating that the judges of the Appellate\nDivision would (whether consciously or subconsciously) hesitate to\n\n15\n\n\foverrule the Judge’s decision in the AOD Judgment simply because the\nJudge is also the President of the Appellate Division. The inference to be\ndrawn is that these judges would be deferential towards accepting the\nJudge’s findings in the AOD Judgment, irrespective of the merits of the\nAppeal. It follows that the Respondent is also alleging that the Estate will\nnot obtain a fair hearing if the Appeal is heard by the Appellate Division.\nThis was why the Respondent submitted that it would be “inappropriate”\nfor the Appellate Division to hear the Appeal. This statement also carries\nwith it the grave insinuation that within the judiciary, junior judicial officers\nwould be predisposed to affirming decisions made by more senior\ncolleagues, even when sitting in a superior court and hearing an appeal.\nIt implies that judicial officers, in this case the judges of the Appellate\nDivision, lack the judicial independence, open-mindedness and moral\ncourage to decide an appeal fairly based solely on its merits, without fear\nor favour, simply because the appeal was against the decision of a senior\nmember of the judiciary. It casts aspersions on the entire Singapore\njudiciary, not just the members of the Appellate Division.\n\nIn the Defence, the Respondent himself describes the meaning of his\nsubmission as follows:\n\n“The [Estate] expressed its reservation that the Judge was the President of\nthe Appellate Division, outranking the other members of the Appellate\n\n16\n\n\fDivision and that it was unlikely for any person in any profession to\noverrule the decision of jts superior.”\n[emphasis added]\n\nThe above makes it clear that the Respondent intended to convey the\nmisplaced concern that the other members of the Appellate Division,\nbeing “outrank[ed]” by the Judge, would be unlikely to overrule the\ndecision of the Judge, in the same way a subordinate would hesitate or\nrefuse to disagree with his boss. This is an extremely troubling statement.\nIt assumes that judges are susceptible to outside influences like “any\nperson in any profession”. However, this is a false equivalence and a\npoor analogy as it not only ignores the solemn oath each judge takes to\ndischarge their duties “without fear or favour, affection or ill-will”, but also\nfundamentally misunderstands the distinction between a decision made by\na judge sitting as the General Division, and the appointment of that same\njudge as the President of the Appellate Division. The two are unrelated and\nit is improper to even suggest that the timing of the appointment of a judge\nas President of the Appellate Division is somehow connected to an earlier\ndecision made by the same judge.\nAs to the statement — “The timing of the [Judge’s] appointment as president of\nthe Appellate Division... is unfortunate as it is likely to be misperceived by the\npublic as an attempt to constrain the [Estate’s] appeal”, the Law Society\ncontended:\n\n17\n\n\fThe Respondent is stating that the appointment of the Judge as\nPresident of the Appellate Division may be perceived as something done\nto “constrain” the Appeal, due to the “timing” of the appointment which\nwas characterised as “unfortunate”. The statement does not clarify or\nexplain how the appointment of the Judge as President of the Appellate\nDivision may be perceived as affecting or otherwise interfering with the\nAppeal, given that these are two clearly separate and distinct events that\nhave nothing to do with the other. Read in context, the statement clearly\nsuggests that there may be a perception that the Judge was appointed\nas President of the Appellate Division 17 days before the AOD Judgment\nso that the Judge can somehow exert some measure of influence or\ncontrol over the outcome of the Appeal. At best, it suggests that the other\njudges of the Appellate Division may be (consciously or subconsciously)\nbiased towards upholding the AOD Judgment because it was decided by\na judge who was recently appointed President of the Appellate Division.\nAt worst, it can be read to mean that the timing of the appointment of the\nJudge and the AOD Judgment was contrived or staged in such a way as\nto deliberately deny the Estate a fair hearing in the Appeal. Calling into\nquestion the propriety of the timing of the appointment of the Judge as\nPresident of the Appellate Division, and alleging that it may be perceived\nas “an attempt to constrain” the Appeal, also implicates the Chief Justice,\ngiven that such appointments are made by the Chief Justice.\nThe Respondent, however, relies on this statement to argue that he did\n\n18\n\n\fnot raise allegations of bias against members of the Appellate Division\nand that he was only “concerned with any misperception the public may\nhave of the Appellate Division hearing the matter”, and that “these\narguments were made solely in the context of any misperception by the\npublic’.\n\nThe\n\nLaw\n\nSociety\n\ncontended\n\nthat\n\nsuch\n\nexplanation\n\nis\n\nunconvincing as the prior statement by the Respondent that “the\nAppellate Division may be constrained against overturning or overruling\nher decision(s)” did not contain any such qualification. It also contended\nthat it is difficult to see how the public will likely form the perception that\nthe Appellate Division will not act with impartiality, when the decision\nbeing appealed against was a decision of the General Division, i.e., a\nsubordinate court to the Appellate Division. There was also no reason for\nthe public to think that the Judge’s appointment as President would be a\nconsideration taken into account by the Appellate Division in determining\nthe merits of the Appeal. Indeed, the Respondent has not adduced any\nobjective evidence to substantiate his assertion that the public may\n“misperceive” the Judge’s appointment as an “attempt to constrain’ the\nEstate’s Appeal. His position that ‘it was entirely possible that the public\nmay come to the same misperception”, since the Estate had expressed its\nreservations about the Judge’s appointment and the Appellate Division’s\nimpartiality, is speculative at best. There is nothing to suggest that the\nEstate’s reservations would be shared by other members of the public. On\nthe contrary, a fair-minded reasonable member of the public would\nundoubtedly accept that a judge would carry out judicial duties\n\n19\n\n\fconscientiously, impartially, and decide the cases before them solely\nbased on their merits and nothing else. After all, judges aim to do justice\nin every case before the courts “without fear or favour, affection or ill-will”.\nThere is therefore no basis for the Respondent to impute the Estate’s\npurported concerns as potential concerns that the public may have.\nc.\n\nThe allegations that: (i) the Appellate Division is unable to remain\nimpartial; and (ii) there is possible misperception by the public of this\ninability, are not mutually exclusive. The fact that the Respondent is\nalluding to the risk of misperception by the public does not preclude the\nRespondent from also making allegations of bias against the Appellate\nDivision.\n\n31.\n\nAs to the statement — “the [Estate] believe[s] that it is not inconceivable that the\nAppellate Division will feel constrained... It would seem that the Appellate\nDivision is hearing an appeal against its very own decision”, the Law Society\ncontended:\n\na.\n\nBy this statement, the Respondent doubled down on his allegation by\nreiterating that it was “not inconceivable” that the Appellate Division “will feel\nconstrained”. Clearly, the Respondent is not merely referring to the risk of\nmisperception by the public but alluding to a real risk and possibility that the\njudges of the Appeliate Division will hesitate or find it difficult to overturn the\n\n20\n\n\fJudge’s decision or findings.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent also added that “it would seem that the Appellate Division\nis hearing an appeal against its very own decision.” The Respondent made\nthis statement knowing full well that the AOD Judgment was a decision of\nthe General Division. The Respondent also must have known that\nalthough the Judge was appointed President of the Appellate Division, the\nAOD Judgment is not a decision of the Appellate Division. Consequently,\nthis statement can only be understood to mean that the other judges of the\nAppellate Division will treat any decision of the Judge (including the AOD\nJudgment) as a decision of the Appellate Division (i.e., its own decision),\nthereby becoming judges in their own cause due to her appointment. Not\nonly is this statement legally and factually wrong, it also insinuates that the\njudges of the Appellate Division may be unable or unwilling to look beyond\nthe identity of the Judge (being the President of the Appellate Division)\nand decide the Appeal solely on its merits due to an alleged interest in\nupholding the decision of a senior judge on the bench.\n\n32.\n\nAs to the statement — “In light of the President of the Appellate Division of the\nHigh Court making such findings, there is a real possibility that the Appeliate\n.Division may feel constrained in overturning these findings”, the Law Society\ncontended:\n\na.\n\nBy this statement, the Respondent reiterated that as certain findings had\n\n21\n\n\fbeen made by the Judge, members of the Appellate Division may feel\n“constrained in overturning [the] findings”. Again, this stems from the\nappointment of the Judge as the President of the Appellate Division,\nwhich supposedly influences the ability of the other members of the\nAppellate Division to act impartially as the Judge is their “superior”.\n\n33.\n\nAsto the statement— “While [CGH] states that it believes the Appellate Division\nwill be able to hear the matter impartially, it has cited no grounds for such\nbelief”, the Law Society contended:\na.\n\nThis reply by the Respondent puts beyond doubt that he was levelling\nallegations of bias against the Judge and members of the Appellate\nDivision by suggesting a lack of actual impartiality or an inability to remain\nimpartial when hearing the Appeal. Although CGH rightly highlighted the\nproblematic nature of the Respondent’s submissions and stated that “the\nAppellate Division will be able to hear the [Appeal] impartially”, the\nRespondent continued to persist in his allegations by re-affirming his\nprevious submissions.\n\nb.\n\nIfthe Respondent did not intend to level allegations of bias and/or suggest\nan inability of the Appellate Division to hear the matter impartially, this\nwould have been the best opportunity for the Respondent to clarify and\nstate unequivocally that he was not levelling allegations of bias and that\nthis was not his intention. The Respondent did not do so. Instead, the\n\n22\n\n\fRespondent doubled down and countered that CGH “cited no grounds for\n[its] belief’ that the Appellate Division will be able to hear the Appeal\nimpartially. At this juncture, there can be no doubt that the Respondent\nwas squarely dismissing and casting doubt on CGH’s position that the\nAppellate Division would remain impatrtial.\nc.\n\nIn addition, it also does not lie in the Respondent’s mouth to assert, in the\nDefence, that CGH had ‘“unilaterally imputed the assumption that the\n[Statements] meant that the Appellate Division would not be able to hear the\nmatter impartially”, and that he “did not have an opportunity to clarify by an\noral hearing or otherwise, that he was not making any allegation[s]” of bias.\nCGH could not have “unilaterally” imputed any assumption as to the\nmeaning of the Statements since these allegations of bias and inability to\nremain impartial were first raised by the Respondent. CGH was simply\nresponding to the Respondent’s submissions based on its interpretation\n\nof the same. Even if CGH had mischaracterised or misunderstood the\nnature of the Respondent’s submissions, it was open to the Respondent\nto clarify his position in the Estate’s Reply Submissions. The Respondent\ndid not do so. Instead, he persisted in maintaining his allegations of bias.\n\n34.\n\nThe Law Society contended that the Respondent’s subjective state of mind in\nmaking the Statements is irrelevant in determining whether there has been a\nbreach of the duty to be respectful to the Court (see The Law Society of Singapore\n\n23\n\n\fv Carolyn Tan Beng Hui and Au Thye Chuen [2020] SGDT 10 (“Carolyn Tan”)\nat [47]), but conceded that his state of mind is relevant for the purposes of\ndetermining whether there is cause of sufficient gravity (see The Law Society of\nSingapore v Eugene Singarajah Thuraisingam [2018] SGDT 8 at [46]) (“Eugene\nThuraisingam’). As no oral evidence was adduced in this case, the Tribunal can\ndraw its factual conclusions on the basis of the contemporaneous documents\nprovided: see, e.g., The Law Society of Singapore v Manjit Singh s/o Kirpal\nSingh and another [2014] SGDT 2 at [64]. The Law Society contended that the\nTribunal should review the evidence from an objective viewpoint to ascertain\nthe meaning of the Statements, as well as the Respondent’s subjective state\nof mind in making the Statements: see The Law Society of Singapore v Wong\nSin Yee [2017] SGDT 12 at [44].\n\n35.\n\nThe Law Society’s position is that the Respondent’s explanation that he had “no\nchoice but to raise these arguments as he was dutybound to act in his client’s\nbest interests” and that his “failure to raise this argument may have resulted in\nan action by the [Estate] and/or a complaint to The Law Society for being\nderelict in his duty” should be rejected:\na.\n\nThe Respondent’s duty to put forward all available arguments in the best\ninterests of his client is subject to his overarching and overriding duty to\nthe Court and the balancing of these duties requires counsel to make\nsubmissions in a responsible manner — see Png Hock Leng v AXA\nInsurance Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC(A) 10 at [23]. Far from making\n\n24\n\n\fsubmissions in a responsible manner expected of an officer of the Court,\nthe Respondent launched spurious and baseless allegations of bias\nagainst the members of the Appellate Division. It is therefore not a\ndefence to claim that he was “dutybound” to raise these arguments.\nb.\n\nItis also untenable for the Respondent to claim that he had “no choice”\nbut to raise these arguments. As an officer of the Court, it was incumbent\non him to first attempt to advise the Estate against making such\narguments and thereafter, if the Estate persisted in their view that these\n\narguments should be included, to consider whether it would have been\nappropriate to discharge himself — see Loh Der Ming Andrew v Koh Tien\n\nHua [2022] SGHC 84 at [87] to [88].\n\n36.\n\nThe Law Society emphasised that allegations of judicial bias are extremely\nserious in that they have the potential to undermine public confidence in the\njudiciary and its administration of justice:\n\na.\n\nAsan officer of the Court, it was incumbent on the Respondent to conduct\nhimself in a manner that was consistent with the standing, dignity, and\nauthority of the Court. The Respondent did not provide any evidential\nbasis that any judge sitting in the Appellate Division will be influenced by\nthe fact that the AOD Judgment was issued by the Judge. The suggestion\nthat the Appellate Division may feel “constrained” and that it would be\n“hearing an appeal against its very own decision” are bare assertions.\n\n25\n\n\fb.\n\nThere was also no basis for the Respondent to draw a connection\nbetween (a) the timing of the Judge’s appointment as President of the\nAppellate Division, and (b) the hearing of the Appeal, to suggest that it\n\nwas a calculated and deliberate move to “constrain” the Estate’s Appeal\nas the Appellate Division will then be predisposed to affirming a decision\nof the Judge who is also the President of the Appellate Division. Similarly,\nthere was absolutely nothing to suggest any deliberate contrivance to\nhave the Judge be appointed the President of the Appellate Division so\nas to influence the Appellate Division and “constrain” the Appeal.\n\n37.\n\nThe Law Society contends that by levelling allegations of bias against the\nJudge and members of the Appellate Division and suggesting a lack of actual\nimpartiality or an inability to remain impartial without any proper basis for doing\nso, the Respondent acted in breach of his duty to be respectful to the Court\nunder rule 13(2) of the PCR., which requires that “(a) legal practitioner must\nalways be respectful of a court or tribunal.”\n\n38.\n\nThe Law Society referred to the explanation by the Court in Law Society of\nSingapore v Govindan Balan Nair [2020] 5 SLR 988 at [27] in respect of the\n\nimpact of a breach of the PCR:\n\n*Coming to the two charges, the primary charge premised on s 83(2)(b)(i)\nof the LPA was engaged once there was a breach of the LPPR; the\nalternative charge was framed on the more general provision of s 83(2)(h).\n\n26\n\n\fAs | was of the view that the respondent had breached LPPR r 22(3), |\nfound the primary charge made out.”\n[emphasis added]\n\nVL.\n\nThe Law Society’s Case on the Alternative Charge\n\n39.\n\nAs to the alternative charge, the Law Society contended that the standard of\n“‘unbefitting conduct” is less strict, and a solicitor only needs to be shown to\nhave been guilty of such conduct as would render him unfit to remain as a\nmember of an honourable profession: Law Society of Singapore v Wong Sin\nYee [2018] 5 SLR 1261 at [24]:\n\n“As a practical guide, it may be asked whether reasonable people, on hearing\nwhat the solicitor had done, would have said without hesitation that as a\nsolicitor he should not have done it (Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee\nSing [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 at [41], citing Wong Kok Chin v Singapore Society\nof Accountants [1989] 2 SLR(R) 633 at [17]). It is sufficient if his conduct\nbrings him discredit as a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal\nprofession as a whole.”\n[emphasis added]\n\n40.\n\nThe Law Society contended that in applying these principles, there is no doubt\nthat reasonable people, on hearing what the Respondent had done, would\n\nhave said without hesitation that he should not have levelled unsubstantiated\nallegations of bias against the members of the Appellate Division, especially\nwhen doing so would undermine public confidence in the judiciary.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent’s conduct in hurling baseless allegations against sitting\njudges of the Appellate Division is, by any measure, wholly inconsistent with\n\n27\n\n\fhis duty as an advocate and solicitor to uphold the standing, dignity, and\nauthority of the Court.\n\nVIl. The Respondent’s Case\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent contested the Charge and the Alternative Charge principally\non the following grounds:\na.\n\nHis actions as patrticularised in the charges do not reflect that which he\nhad sought to convey. If his actions had been considered in their proper\ncontext, they would not be disrespectful to the Honourable Court or\nimproper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the\nmeaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1966.\n\nb.\n\nHis actions as particularised in the charges do not reflect that which he\nhad sought to convey. If his actions had been considered in their proper\ncontext, they would not be considered to be disrespectful to the\nHonourable Court or misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\n\nAct 1966.\n\n28\n\n\f43.\n\nThe Respondent presented his perspective of the background to the matter in\nthe Respondent’s Submissions, which we present in summary:\na.\n\nHe was engaged in early 2012 by Ms Noor who had worked as a\nparalegal at Messrs Allen & Gledhill for many years. Ms Noor\nsubsequently commenced legal proceedings against CGH for medical\nnegligence from 2007 to 2012 for failing to follow-up and/or advise her\nin respect of an opacity in her lung which was later discovered to be\nmalignant cancer, ultimately leading to her death. Messrs Allen &\nGledhill was unable to act for Ms Noor due to a conflict of interests and\nreferred her to the Respondent who was requested to render her legal\nassistance instead.\n\nb.\n\nMs Noor commenced proceedings in HC/S 59 against CGH and three\nof its doctors on 20 January 2015. The Respondent contends that\nCGH had conducted itself in a reprehensible manner throughout the\nproceedings, which conduct included but was not limited to, putting Ms\nNoor to strict proof on all issues, making desultory offers to settle the\nmatter,\n\ncausing undue delay to\n\nproceedings,\n\nengaging expert\n\nwitnesses to make dubious readings in a bid to advance CGH's\nposition that the negligence had no causal link to Ms Noor's missed\ndiagnosis of cancer, and not divulging the names of its senior doctors\nwho had reviewed Ms Noor's X-Rays and erroneously concluded that\nthe nodule in her lung did not warrant follow-up.\n\n29\n\n\fHC/S 59 was presided over by the Judge who found that CGH had\nbreached its duty of care but did not cause Ms Noor's cancer. Ms\nNoor's claim was therefore dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal\noverturned the decision of the High Court and remitted the matter to\nthe Judge for the assessment of damages with leave to parties to\nrefine or revise their evidence adduced at trial, only in respect of the\nfindings by the Court of Appeal.\nUpon the finding of the Court of Appeal that CGH was liable, Ms Noor\ncommenced an application for interim payment in HC/SUM 1204/2019\non 8 March 2019. The matter was originally fixed before an Assistant\nRegistrar (the “AR”) on 25 March 2019. After the AR had heard the\narguments made on behalf of Ms Noor, the AR declined to make any\norder and adjourned the matter to be heard by the Judge at a later date.\nMs Noor was aggrieved by the fact that the AR had refrained from\nmaking a decision and wrote in to the Supreme Court to complain as\n\nto the conduct of the matter. The AR was then directed to resume the\nhearing of the matter which was then refixed for a special half day\nhearing before the AR on 1 April 2019.\nHowever, before the hearing resumed on 1 April 2019, Ms Noor\nsuccumbed to lung cancer. As a result of Ms Noor’s passing, the matter\nwas adjourned for the Estate to be added as a party to proceedings.\n\n30\n\n\fThe Estate was added as a party to the proceedings on 5 July 2019.\nAfter the Estate was added to the proceedings, the AR awarded Ms\nNoor $200,000 by way of an interim payment in HC/SUM 1204/2019.\nThe Estate was dissatisfied with the award and instructed the\nRespondent to appeal. However, the appeal in HC/RA 301/2019 was\ndismissed by the Judge on 3 February 2020.\nFollowing the Judge’s dismissal of the appeal in HC/RA 301/2019, the\nEstate instructed the Respondent to appeal to the Court of Appeal by\nCA/OS 11/2020. Leave was denied by the Court of Appeal on 5 May\n2020.\nAt the Assessment of Damages Hearing in HC/S 59, the Judge awarded\n\nthe Estate $304,000.00 in general damages and $22,620.61 in special\ndamages (less the $200,000.00 in interim damages), with party and party\ncosts fixed at $105,000.00 and disbursements to be taxed if not agreed.\nDissatisfied with the award of damages, the Estate instructed the\nRespondent to appeal against the Judge's award.\nOn 2 January 2021, amendments were made to the Supreme Court of\nJudicature Act 1969 by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment)\nAct 2019 (Act 40 of 2019). The amendments included, inter alia, the\ncreation of the Appellate Division. The Estate's appeal would therefore\nbe fixed before the Appellate Division in AD/CA 22/2021.\n\n31\n\n\fThe Respondent conveyed to the Estate the fact that the appeal would\nno longer lie to the Court of Appeal as before and would instead be heard\nby the Appellate Division, and that the Judge had been appointed the\nPresident of the Appellate Division but would not be hearing the appeal.\nThe Respondent said that the Estate expressed its reservations for\nseveral reasons. Firstly, the Estate was concerned that the timing of the\n\nJudge’s appointment as the President of the Appellate Division might\nlead to a perception by the public that there would be a conflict of\ninterests. Secondly, the Estate expressed its concern as to whether the\nAppellate Division would feel constrained in overturning the Judge’s\nspecific finding that Dr Goh Boon Cher and Dr Lynette Teo, the expert\nwitnesses of CGH, had properly discharged their duties to the\nsatisfaction of the Court of Appeal. The Estate took the position that far\nfrom assisting the Court, the opinions of CGH'’s expert witnesses only\nled to confusion and had unnecessarily delayed the proceedings. The\nEstate therefore took the view that the Appellate Division was not the\nappropriate forum due to the perception of a possible conflict of interests.\nThe Respondent said that he advised the Estate that the appeal before\nthe Appellate Division would be a fresh hearing, where the Justices of\nthe Appellate Division would consider the evidence afresh and would\nnot simply be bound by the decision of the Court below. However, the\nEstate was not persuaded and even took the position that it was human\n\n32\n\n\fnature not to go against the decisions of one's superiors. The\nRespondent said that he therefore advised the Estate that an\napplication could be made to have the matter transferred to the Court\nof Appeal under s29D(2)(c)(ii) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act,\nread with O 56A, rule 12 of the Rules of Court (2014 Rev Ed). The\nEstate therefore instructed the Respondent to do so and made it clear\nthat one of its reasons for doing so was because the Appellate Division\nmight be constrained in overturning the decision.\nThe Respondent said that, on the express instructions of the Estate,\nthe Respondent filed the application for leave to have the matter\ntransferred to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that the Court of\nAppeal was the more appropriate forum and prepared the Affidavit and\nWritten Submissions on the Estate's behalf. The issues raised in the\nappeal, as succinctly summarised by the Court of Appeal, were as\nfollows:\n\ni. That the appeal related to a matter of public importance and/or would\nraise a point of law of public importance, namely, when section\n10(3)(a) of the Civil Law Act would apply;\nii. That the appeal related to a matter of public importance and/or would\nraise a point of law of public importance, namely, when punitive and/or\n\n33\n\n\faggravated\n\ndamages\n\nwould\n\nbe\n\nawarded\n\nfor\n\na\n\ndefendant's\n\nunreasonable conduct of proceedings;\niii. That the appeal raised novel issues and its results would be of\nsignificance as there were no precedents quantifying damages for\ncancer patients; and\niv. There were other relevant matters which would make it more\n\nappropriate for the Court of Appeal to hear the appeal.\nThe Respondent said he was constrained by the requirements of the\nSupreme\n\nCourt\n\nPractice\n\nDirections,\n\nwhich\n\nlimited\n\nthe\n\nWritten\n\nSubmissions to a maximum of 20 pages. Due to the nature of the\napplication, he had to first set out the procedural background, before\naddressing each individual issue raised in the appeal. The Respondent\nsaid that the imposed page limit of 20 pages made it impossible for him\nto properly expound on the Estate's points. Every point raised had to be\nkept to its bare minimum.\nThe Respondent said that due to these constraints, he contemplated\n\nexcluding the reservations raised by the Estate as this would have\nallowed him to improve and expound on the arguments on the other\nrelevant issues. However, given the Estate's express instructions to\npresent these arguments, the Respondent said that he considered that\nhe would be at risk of breaching his duty as a solicitor for failing to\n\n34\n\n\fcomply with the express instructions of his client. Further, he said that,\nhad the appeal been dismissed without him having raised the\nreservations of the Estate, the Respondent would have found himself\nat risk of being sued for negligence. The Respondent said that it is for\nthis\n\nreason\n\nthat\n\nNotwithstanding the\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\ninclusion\n\nof the\n\nincluded\n\nthe\n\narguments.\n\nEstate's reservations,\n\nthe\n\nRespondent said he was careful to make it clear that this was the\nEstate's view and not his own.\n\nUpon the publication of the Judgment in CA/OS 9 on 9 June 2021, the\nRespondent said he realised that the Complainant had misconstrued his\narguments, and promptly wrote a letter to the Supreme Court on 11 June\n2021, explaining that there had been a misunderstanding in respect of\nthe Written Submissions tendered by the Respondent.\nIn respect of [112] of the Judgment, the Respondent emphasised that\nthis was a mere header which was meant to summarise the argument.\nThe header was in itself lengthy and it was not feasible for the\nRespondent to explain that these were the Estate's arguments rather\nthan his own.\n\nIn respect of [113] of the Judgment, the Respondent stated that the timing\nof the Judge's appointment as the President of the Appellate Division\nwas unfortunate as \"as it [was] likely to be misperceived by the public as\n\n35\n\n\fan attempt to constrain the [Estate's] appeal”. The Respondent said the\nword ‘\"likely\" was used because it had been the Estate's own\nmisinterpretation of the Judge’s appointment as the President of the\nAppellate Division. In fact, the Respondent was careful to use the word\n\"misperceived\" rather than \"perceived\", to indicate that this was clearly\nan inaccurate view. The fact that a layperson, without understanding\nand/or knowledge of the law, such as the Estate, could make such a\nmistake, would suggest that the reasonable observer could very well\narrive at the same misguided view. Whilst the Respondent accepted that\nhe could have stated more clearly that these were the Estate's views, the\nfact that the Estate, who was himself a layperson, could make such a\nmistake, made it not inconceivable that other members of \"the public\nwould reach the same misperception”. Thus, by highlighting these issues\non behalf of the Estate, the Respondent was essentially submitting that\nthe Court of Appeal should hear the matter to avoid such unfounded\nperceptions, which is in line with the maxim \"justice must not only be\ndone, but seen to be done\". The risk of such misperception had been\nreal especially since the Estate itself had had the same misperception.\nThe Respondent said he could not have explained the Estate's position\nin more detail due to the 20-page limit imposed by the Supreme Court\nPractice Directions. Due to this constraint, the Respondent had been\n\n36\n\n\fcompelled to keep the argument to its bare minimum, which ultimately\nled to the misunderstanding.\nWith regard to the Estate’s Reply Submissions, he said that it was CGH\nwho had imputed the assumption that the Respondent had suggested\nthat \"the other judges of the Appellate Division would be unable to hear\nan appeal arising from a decision of Ang J in a fair and unbiased manner\",\nwhen this had not been raised by the Respondent. He said that CGH had\nessentially raised the allegations of bias and impartiality when the\nRespondent had not even suggested them. The Respondent's sole\nconcern was the public misperception of a potential conflict of interests,\nwhich had been raised by the Estate. Given that CGH had made such a\ngeneral and sweeping statement alleging that the Estate had raised bias\nand impartiality, citing no grounds for its belief, this was pointed out by\nthe Respondent in the Estate’s Reply Submissions. The Respondent\nsaid he was not imputing any bias or impartiality on the part of any judge.\nHe said that the penultimate sentence at [15] of the Estate's Reply\nSubmissions, which read \"It is precisely because justice must be done\nand seen to be done\", made it clear that the Respondent was merely\nreferring to how the public could misperceive the Appellate Division\nhearing the matter.\nThe premise for the Estate's submissions was no different from a\nhypothetical scenario of a Review Committee, Inquiry Committee, or\n\n37\n\n\fDisciplinary Tribunal, made up entirely of subordinate lawyers of a\nrespondent's own firm, or a Commissioner for Oaths or Notary Public\ncommissioning or notarising a document prepared by a lawyer from the\nsame firm, which would not have been permitted due to a potential\nconflict of interests. This was precisely the type of perceived conflict of\ninterests raised by the Estate. Despite being advised that CGH's\nunreasonable conduct of the litigation could be dealt with by the\nAppellate Division, the Estate maintained its concern that the Court of\nAppeal, which had previously reversed the Judge's holding on the liability\nof CGH, would be the more appropriate forum for the hearing of the\nappeal.\nThe Respondent said he was cognisant of his duty as an officer of the\n\nCourt. He said that, whilst the reservations were raised by the Estate, he\ndid not suggest any allegations of bias and/or impartiality against the\nJudge, or the other judges of the Appellate Division. Instead, the\n\nreservations by the Estate were mischaracterised by CGH as allegations\nof bias and/or impartiality and the Respondent had no opportunity by way\nof an oral hearing to explain that he was not, in fact, making any.\nallegation(s) against the Judge and/or the other judges of the Appellate\nDivision.\n\nWhilst the Respondent did not share the Estate's concerns, the\nRespondent contended that he had to give deference to the decision in\n\n38\n\n\fChee Siok Chin and another v Attorney-General [2006] 4 SLR(R) 92\n(\"Chee Siok Chin\"), where Justice Woo Bih Li (as his Honour then was)\nheld:\n\"9\n\nNevertheless, it was true that the press had from time to time mentioned\nthe incident between Mr Ravi and me. While | did not necessarily accept\nthat the public was of the impression that | was or would be prejudiced\nagainst Mr Ravi, | had to take into account the concerns of the\nApplicants. As the maxim goes, justice must not only be done, it must\nalso be seen to be done. In my view, this maxim applies whether the\nfear of prejudice’is against the litigant or his counsel.\n\n10\n\nInthe interest of justice, | indicated to Mr Ravi that | would accede to\nthe application to recuse myself if the Applicants were maintaining\ntheir instructions. After taking further instructions, Mr Ravi informed\nme they were still maintaining their position and | recused myself.\"\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nAs an officer of the Court, the Respondent said he had to heed the dicta\nby the Court in Chee Siok Chin and place the concerns of the Estate\nbefore the Court for the Court's consideration. Had the Respondent\nunilaterally decided to disregard the concerns of the Estate, this could\nhave resulted in adverse consequences to the Respondent. Although the\napplication in CA/OS 9 had neither been for the recusal of the Appellate\nDivision nor based on grounds of suspicions or likelihood of bias, the\nconsiderations by the Court in Chee Siok Chin, namely, the concerns of\nthe Applicants therein, which the Court had to take into account, were\nstill nonetheless relevant and applicable to CA/OS 9 as they pertained to\nthe appropriateness of the forum for the hearing.\n\n39\n\n\fw.\n\nThe fact that the Respondent had elected to err on the side of caution\nought not to be held against him.\n\nVIil.\n\nOur Findings\n\n44.\n\nIt is not disputed that the Statements were made by the Respondent, and that\nthe Statements referred to the Judge and the judges of the Appellate Division\n\n(collectively referred to as the “Court”).\n\n45.\n\nThe Charges against the Respondent turn, first, on whether the Statements\nhe had made were disrespectful to the Court. The Respondent contended\nprincipally that he had not been disrespectful to the Court as he had, on the\ninstructions of his client, the Estate, presented the Estate’s perceptions and\nconcerns as to the impartiality of the Court. In our view, the Statements have\nto be construed objectively, in the context in which they were said, to determine\nif the Statements or any of them were disrespectful to the Court.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent in oral arguments accepted that we should ascertain\nobjectively the meaning of the Statements, but contended that we must also\ntake into consideration his subjective intention as the person who made the\nStatements.’\n\n! NOE 22 June 2022 p 54 lines 3-17.\n\n40\n\n\f47.\n\nIn our view, the subjective intention of the Respondent, when he made the\nStatements, is not relevant in determining whether the Statements were\ndisrespectful to the Court. We agree with the Law Society that, if the\nStatements are objectively disrespectful to the Court, the maker's subjective\nintention will not excuse him, though in appropriate circumstances, it may be a\nmitigating factor and may be relevant in determining whether there is cause of\nsufficient gravity to refer the Respondent to the Court of Three Judges: see\nCarolyn Tan at [47] and Eugene Thuraisingam at [46].\n\n48.\n\nIn our mind, there is no doubt that, objectively construed in the context in which\nthey were made, the Statements were disrespectful to the Court. The\nStatements alleged that there was bias or alleged bias on the part of the Judge\nand/or the Appellate Division.\n\na.\n\nThe statement “IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE APPELLATE\nDIVISION TO HEAR THE MATTER AS THE [JUDGE] IS ALREADY\nSITTING IN THE APPELLATE DIVISION AS ITS PRESIDENT AND THE\nMEMBERS OF THE APPELLATE DIVISION MAY BE CONSTRAINED\nAGAINST OVERTURNING OR OVERRULING HER DECISION(S)’\nclearly suggests that the judges of the Appellate Division would not be\nable to discharge their duties impartially and fairly. It also insinuates that\n\n41\n\n\fwithin the judiciary, more junior judges would not dare overturn decisions\nof their more senior colleagues and that members of the Appellate\nDivision would not be able to decide cases independently with open\nminds.\n\nThe statement “The timing of the [Judge’s] appointment as president of\nthe Appellate Division... is unfortunate as it is likely to be misperceived by\nthe public as an attempt to constrain the [Estate’s] appeal” suggests that\nthere is likely to be a perception that the Judge was appointed as\nPresident of the Appellate Division weeks before the AOD Judgment so\nthat the Judge could somehow exert some measure of influence or control\nover the outcome of the appeal against the AOD Judgment. While the\nstatement referred to this as a possible misperception by the public, there\nwas no evidence or basis provided for this assertion of misperception.\nMoreover, reading the statement as a whole, the misperception was not\nthe main sting intended in this statement. Rather, the point was to query\nthe timing of the appointment of the Judge and to suggest that somehow,\nher appointment as President of the Appellate Division, coming so soon\nbefore the AOD Judgment, was an effort to stymie any challenge to the\nAOD Judgment.\n\nThe statement “the [Estate] believe[s] that it is not inconceivable that the\n\n42\n\n\fAppellate Division will feel constrained... It would seem that the Appellate\nDivision is hearing an appeal against its very own decision” suggests that\nthe judges of the Appellate Division would not be able to discharge their\nduties impartially and fairly merely because the AOD Judgment had been\nissued by the President of the Appellate Division (sitting as a judge of the\nGeneral Division). In fact, it goes further to suggest that the judges of the\nAppellate Division would treat a judgment issued by the President of the\nAppellate Division as their own which implies that the judges of the\nAppellate Division would naturally uphold a judgment issued by their\nsenior colleague.\n\nThe statement “In light of the President of the Appellate Division of the\nHigh Court making such findings, there is a real possibility that the\nAppellate Division may feel constrained in overturning these findings”\nsuggests that the judges of the Appellate Division would not be\nindependent or impartial and that they would not dare go against the\njudgment of the President of the Appellate Division.\n\nThe statement “While [CGH] states that it believes the Appellate Division\nwill be able to hear the matter impartially, it has cited no grounds for such\nbelief’ came in response to CGH’s submissions that the statements\nmentioned at sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) above suggested that the\n\n43\n\n\fAppellate Division would not be able to hear the Appeal in a fair and\nunbiased manner simply because the AOD Judgment had been issued\nby the President of the Appellate Division and that CGH disagreed\nstrongly with the statements. It is clear from the Respondent’s reply that\nthe Respondent stood by the earlier statements and, by not denying the\nvery serious meaning ascribed by CGH to the earlier statements,\nconfirmed that the Respondent indeed meant what had been said in the\nearlier statements.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent, in the Respondent’s Submissions, had explained that he had\nmade the Statements on the instructions of his client, the Estate, to convey the\nEstate’s perceptions and concerns.\n\nWe note that no affidavit by the\n\nRespondent was received in evidence, and the Respondent was accordingly\nnot cross examined on any of the explanations he gave in the Respondent’s\nSubmissions.\n\n50.\n\nIt is, however, not disputed that the Estate, on 12 March 2021, in support of its\napplication to transfer the appeal to the Court of Appeal, did affirm an affidavit\nwhich, at the sub heading preceding paragraph 37 of the affidavit, and at\n\nparagraphs 37 to 41 of the affidavit, made assertions that were the same or\nsubstantially similar to the Statements. It is also not disputed that the\nRespondent, upon publication of the Judgment in CA/OS 9, wrote to the Court\n\n44\n\n\fof Appeal to try to explain that his submissions, which contained the\nStatements, had put forward his client’s perceptions, instead of his own.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent accordingly contends that by making the Statements, he had\nnot subjectively intended to be disrespectful of the Court: he was only\nconveying the perceptions and concerns of his client, the Estate, and not his\nown.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent further contends he should not be faulted for making the\nStatements in these circumstances as (at paragraph 12 of his Defence) he had\n“no choice but to raise these arguments as he was dutybound to act in his\nclient’s best interests.” If he had not raised them, it “may have resulted in an\naction by (his client) and/or a complaint to the Law Society for being derelict in\nhis duty.”\n\n53.\n\nWe do not accept the Respondent’s contentions.\n\n54.\n\nFirst, as stated in [47] above, in the light of our determination that the Statements,\nobjectively construed in the context they were made, are disrespectful of the\nCourt, the Respondent’s subjective intentions are irrelevant.\n\n95.\n\nSecondly, we reject the Respondent’s contention that he should not be faulted\nfor making the Statements as he had made them on his client’s instructions.\n\n45\n\n\fWhile he had a duty to put forward the available arguments in the best interest\nof his client, most importantly, he also had an overarching and overriding duty\nas an officer of the Court, and the discharge of these dual duties required him\nto make submissions in a responsible manner — see Png Hock Leng v AXA\nInsurance Pte Ltd [2022] SGHC(A) 10 at [23]. What the Respondent did in this\ncase was not responsible at all. He could not take cover under the cloak of\nsaying the words were his client's words rather than his own and that he was\nduty bound to put forth his client's belief, as if he was the client’s unthinking\nmouthpiece. His duty to the Court was paramount, even if the client gave\ninstructions to the contrary. He was duty bound to advise the client against\nmaking the Statements, if, as is the case, there was no objective basis for the\nallegations of bias or lack of impartiality on the part of the Court. No fair-minded\nand informed observer would have regarded the allegations in the Statements\nof lack of impartiality or bias on the part of the Court as having any basis. If the\nclient remained adamant in his position, and refused his advice, the\nRespondent should have considered carefully, given his paramount duty to the\nCourt, whether it would be best to discharge himself — see Loh Der Ming\nAndrew v Koh Tien Hua [2022] SGHC 84 at [87] to [88].\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent had relied on Chee Siok Chin for the proposition that the Court\nof Appeal was required to be apprised of the Estate’s concerns in an application\nof that nature which was before the Court of Appeal. With respect, we disagree.\n\n46\n\n\fChee Siok Chin was a case unique on its facts, and is clearly distinguishable.\nIt was not in dispute that the Judge there had had an acrimonious exchange\nwith counsel in a previous case which had been repeatedly reported in the\npress over the years. The Judge had further made a complaint of misconduct\nagainst counsel arising from that previous case. In the light of those specific\ncircumstances, although the Judge did not accept that the public was under the\nimpression that he would be prejudiced against counsel, he agreed to recuse\nhimself as the litigant was of the view that she would be prejudiced by the\nprevious antecedent between the Judge and counsel. Unlike Chee Siok Chin,\nin the present case, there is no basis whatsoever for the Estate’s concerns as\nto the impartiality of the Court. The Respondent’s duty to make submissions in\na responsible manner prohibited the Respondent from making allegations of\nbias or alleged bias which had no basis.\n\nS7.\n\nWe therefore find that the Law Society has proved beyond reasonable doubt\nthat the Respondent had, by the Statements, made statements that were\ndisrespectful to the Court, alleging actual bias or apparent bias on the part of\nthe Judge and the judges of the Appellate Division.\n\n98.\n\nBy levelling allegations of bias against the Judge and members of the Appellate\nDivision and suggesting a lack of actual impartiality or an inability to remain\nimpartial without any proper basis for doing so, the Respondent acted in breach\n\n47\n\n\fof his duty to be respectful to the Court under rule 13(2) of the PCR.\n\n59.\n\nWe find that such a breach of the PCR amounts to “improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor” under the second limb of section 83(2)(b)\n\nof the LPA.\n60.\n\nWe therefore find the Charge against the Respondent has been proved beyond\nreasonable doubt.\n\n61.\n\nGiven our finding on the Charge, it is strictly not necessary to consider the\nAlternative Charge. However, for completeness, we will also deal with the\nAlternative Charge.\n\n62.\n\nThe standard of “unbefitting conduct” is less strict, and a solicitor only needs to\nbe shown to have been guilty of such conduct as would render him unfit to\nremain as a member of an honourable profession — Law Society of Singapore\nv Wong Sin Yee [2018] 5 SLR 1261 at [24].\n\n63.\n\nIn our opinion, a reasonable person would say without hesitation that the\nRespondent should not have levelled unsubstantiated allegations of bias\nagainst the members of the Appellate Division, especially when doing so would\nundermine public confidence in the judiciary.\n\n64. The Respondent’s conduct in making such allegations against sitting judges of\nthe Appellate Division is, by any measure, wholly inconsistent with his duty as\n\n48\n\n\fan advocate and solicitor to uphold the standing, dignity, and authority of the\nCourt.\n\n65.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent is also guilty of misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of\nan honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\nIX.\n\nConclusion\n\n66.\n\nThe final question to be addressed is whether there is “cause of sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action” pursuant to section 93(1)(c) of the LPA.\n\n67.\n\nIn Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR\n390, the Court of Three Judges at [28] gave the guidance that only the most\nserious cases of misconduct are to be referred to the Court of Three Judges,\nholding at [35] that the determination that conduct falls within section 83(2) of\n\nthe LPA is a necessary but insufficient condition for “due cause” to be found\nunder section 83 of the LPA for a lawyer to be referred to the Court of Three\nJudges.\n\n68.\n\nWhile it is misconduct to question, without basis, the impartiality of the Court, a\n\nsampling of previous cases illustrates that not all such cases of misconduct are\nnecessarily sufficiently serious to be referred to the Court of Three Judges.\n\n49\n\n\f64.\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Rajah Thampoe T [1971-1973] SLR(R) 624 (“‘Re\nRajah’), is a clear case of sufficiently serious misconduct for referral to the\nCourt of Three Judges. The lawyer had made many improper and offensive\nstatements to the Court, and to opposing counsel, in two proceedings in the\nMagistrates’ Courts. His statements to the Court included - see [5] of Re Rajah\n— “This is a police court and therefore there is no proper trial”’, “This court\nshowed interest prejudice in these cases’, “My instructions are that there is no\nfair trial. They say that they fear, rightly, that they cannot get justice. This court\nis prejudiced. This court is an organ of power.”\n\nIn his evidence before the\n\nTribunal (and also when he addressed the Court of Three Judges — see [18] of\nRe Rajah), the lawyer had said he was justified in making his statements. The\nTribunal had accordingly found — see [10] of Re Rajah — that the lawyer had\nendorsed his client’s belief that they could not get justice from the Court.\n\n69.\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Gopalan Nair (aka Pallichadath Gopalan Nair)\n[2010] SGDT 11 (“Gopalan Nair’) is another clear example of misconduct which\nmerited referral to the Court of Three Judges. The lawyer was found guilty of two\ncharges which related to insulting High Court Judges in his blog. In respect of one\ncharge, the lawyer had in his blog identified a High Court Judge as prostituting\nherself in the proceedings by being nothing more than an employee of Mr Lee Kuan\nYew and his son in carrying out their orders. The other charge related to the lawyer\n\n50\n\n\fposting on his blog, several months later, a similarly worded offensive statement in\nrespect of another High Court Judge. The lawyer absented himself from the\ndisciplinary hearing.\n\n70.\n\nIn contrast, in other cases, although the lawyers had questioned the impartiality of\nthe Court, without basis, their misconduct had not been found to be sufficiently\nserious to be referred to the Court of Three Judges.\n\n71.\n\nIn The Law Society of Singapore v Chia Ti Lik alias Xie Zhili[2011] SGDT 4, there\nwere several charges against a lawyer for making statements insinuating that the\nCourt had not been fair in handling his case due to political reasons, and that the\nCourt and the Attorney-General's Chambers had\n\nintentionally acted\n\nin\n\ncombination to disadvantage a litigant. The Tribunal found at [58], [79] and [116]\nthat the lawyer had made statements “calculated to cast doubt on the integrity of\nthe judiciary and the judicial processes” and found him guilty of the relevant\ncharges. However, the Tribunal did not find that there was cause of sufficient\ngravity, noting at [121] that the misconduct there “[did] not rise to the level of that\nin [Gopalan Nair]’.\n\n72.\n\nIn The Law Society of Singapore v Ravi s/o Madasamy [2020] SGDT 8, one of\nthe charges of which the lawyer was found guilty was publishing a statement\nonline attacking the impartiality and integrity of State Prosecutors. Another\n\n=]|\n\n\fcharge of which he was found guilty was publishing a statement online alleging\nthat a judge of the State Courts was biased against defence psychiatrists. The\nTribunal regarded the lawyer’s subjective intention in making the statement as\n\na relevant factor in deciding if there was cause of sufficient gravity. Although it\naccepted that his statements were directed to the executive and not the\njudiciary, it found that he intended to cast aspersions of bias against the State\n\nProsecutors and the judge of the State Courts. The Tribunal distinguished\nGopalan Nair as a case of “egregious and unrepentant conduct”, although it\naccepted that conduct less egregious than in Gopalan Nair could be regarded\nas showing cause of sufficient gravity. The Tribunal, however, determined that\nthere was no cause of sufficient gravity in the case before it.\n\n73.\n\nIn Carolyn Tan, the Tribunal found the lawyer's misconduct in filing an affidavit\naccusing a Judicial Commissioner of “a closed mind”, and having “expressed\noutspoken, extreme and unbalanced views’, and “only seeking points in\nsupport of his conclusion as opposed to being fair minded as to the correct\ndecision” — see Carolyn Tan at [35] — had been made in “some haste ... (as) (i)t\nwas filed in support of an application made in great haste” — see Carolyn Tan\nat [43] and [46]. The Tribunal determined there was no cause of sufficient\ngravity.\n\n74.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier at [47], although the Respondent’s subjective intention\n\n52\n\n\fwhen he made the Statements is irrelevant in determining whether he had\nbreached his duty of being respectful to the Court or had behaved in an\nunbefitting manner, his subjective intention may be relevant in determining\nwhether there is cause of sufficient gravity.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent had made the Statements because he thought he had to\ncomply with his client’s instructions to raise his client's perceptions and\nconcerns.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent in oral argument accepted that if he had known that his\nmaking of the Statements, even on his client’s instructions, was inappropriate\nand improper, he would not have made them. He accepted that if we came to\nthe conclusion, after hearing his explanation, that he had behaved improperly,\n\nhe would not repeat such conduct.?\n\n77.\n\nWe have made clear in this decision our view that the Respondent was wrong\nin making the Statements on the instructions of his client.\n\n78.\n\nWe note that the Statements were made in documents filed in court\n\nproceedings and were not published to the public.\n\n2 NOE 22 June 2022 p 63 lines 22-32, p 64 lines 1-130, p 71 lines 7-14.\n\n53\n\n\f28th\n\nApril\n\n\f","timestamp":"2024-11-11T04:00:28+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-nov-2024/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Mohammed Lutfi bin Hussin (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Mohammed Lutfi bin Hussin (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>The present disciplinary proceedings against the Respondent arose from information referred by the Attorney-General on the Respondent’s conduct in relation to the false attestation of having witnessed the signing of mortgage documents by a client when he had not personally done so.

At the material time, he was the sole director of the\n\nlaw firm Lutfi Law Corporation. Lutfi Law Corporation ceased operations on or\naround 1 May 2017 and the Respondent is currently working at A. Rohim Noor\nLila LLP.\n\nThe Complaint alleges that the Respondent falsely attested to witnessing the\nsigning of conveyancing documents by a client he had never met nor personally\nattended to, having left his conveyancing secretary to attend to the client. For this,\nthe Respondent had already been convicted in the State Courts of Singapore on 10\nJune 2020 on two charges under s 59(6) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004\nRev Ed) (“LTA”), namely, DCN-900055-2019 and DCN-900018-2020 (“the\nState Court Charges”)%. The Respondent pleaded guilty to both the State Court\nCharges and was sentenced to a global fine of $5,600. In pleading guilty, the\nRespondent accepted the Statement of Facts dated 25 May 2020 prepared by\n\n'CBOD Tab 1\n2CBOD Tab 10 & Tab 11\n\n\fDeputy Public Prosecutors Benedict Chan and Joseph Gwee (“Prosecution’s\n\nStatement of Facts”)>.\n\nII.\n\nBackground facts\n\nSometime in 2014, a property agent by the name of Kok Chiew Leong introduced\nMohammad Naseeruddin bin Allamdin (“Naseeruddin™) to a conveyancing\nsecretary with Lutfi Law Corporation by the name of Fauziah binte Mohd\nHussain, also known as Angela Veronica (“Angela”). Naseeruddin was\nintroduced as a prospective buyer of 35 Saraca Terrace, Singapore 805486 (the\n“Property”). He subsequently engaged the Respondent to act for him in the\nconveyancing transaction for the Property®.\n\nThe conveyancing documents for the purchase of the Property included the\nfollowing:\n\na.\n\nThe Mortgage Instrument, in a form prescribed under s 51 of the LTA. On\nthe Mortgage Instrument, Naseeruddin was named as the mortgagor, and\nMalayan Banking Berhad (“Maybank”) was the mortgagee.\n\n3CBOD Tab 12\n\n4 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 4\n\n\fb.\n\nThe Transfer Instrument, in a form prescribed under s 51 of the LTA. One\nYeo Ming Joo and one Lim You En were named as the transferors, and\nNaseeruddin was named the transferee’.\n\nThe Mortgage Instrument and the Transfer Instrument were executed by\n\nNaseeruddin on 22 April 2014 and were supposed to be signed before the\nRespondent. However, throughout the entire conveyancing transaction for the\nProperty, the Respondent had never met Naseeruddin. Only Angela met with\nNaseeruddin in relation to the purchase of the Property® and for the execution of\nthe Mortgage Instrument and the Transfer Instrument. Both the Mortgage\nInstrument and the Transfer Instrument were eventually registered on 7 May\n2014.\n\nTo facilitate the purchase of the Property, Maybank had disbursed a loan of\n$$2,320,000 to Naseeruddin. Naseeruddin subsequently defaulted on the monthly\nmortgage payments. It was then discovered that Naseeruddin had perpetrated a\nfraud on Maybank by submitting forged income documents when he applied to\nsecure the loan of S$2,320,000. This became the subject of an investigation\nconducted by the Commercial Affairs Department (“CAD”)’.\n\nSometime in March 2015, the CAD was alerted to 6 police reports lodged by\nrepresentatives of various banks between November 2014 and February 2015,\n\n5 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 5\n\n6 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 6\n7 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 7 & 8\n\n\fincluding Maybank®. The CAD investigation in turn uncovered the circumstances\nleading to the Respondent’s signing of the Mortgage Instrument and the Transfer\nInstrument for the Property, in particular, the fact that the Respondent had not been\npresent when Naseeruddin signed the Mortgage Instrument and the Transfer\nInstrument on 22 April 2014. Both documents had been prepared by Angela, who\nalso made the arrangements for Naseeruddin to sign the documents. In signing as a\nwitness to Naseeruddin’s signature on the Mortgage Instrument, the Respondent had\nrepresented on the Mortgage Instrument that he personally witnessed Naseeruddin’s\nsignature®, when he had not done so. The Respondent also signed the Certificate of\nCorrectness on the Mortgage Instrument, certifying that it was correct for the\npurposes of the LTA. As for the Transfer Instrument, Angela had placed it on the\n\nRespondent’s desk for his signature'’. In signing the Certificate of Correctness to the\nTransfer Instrument in his capacity as Naseeruddin’s solicitor, the Respondent had\nrepresented that to the best of his ability and in so far as he had any reasonable\nmeans of ascertaining, Naseeruddin had accepted proprietorship and was of full age\nand legal capacity.\n\nOn 2 December 2019, the CAD charged the Respondent with one charge under s\n59(6) of the LTA for falsely certifying to the correctness of the Mortgage\nInstrument by falsely stating that he had witnessed Naseeruddin’s signature on\nthe Mortgage Instrument. On 23 March 2020, the Respondent received an\nadditional charge under s 59(6) of the LTA for falsely certifying to the\n\n$CBOD p 67 para2 & 16\n9 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 10\n10 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 12\n\n\fcorrectness of the Transfer Instrument by implying that Naseeruddin had\naccepted proprietorship and was of full age and legal capacity. The Respondent\npleaded guilty to both the State Court Charges'! in the State Courts of Singapore\non 5 June 2020. He was convicted on the two charges on 10 June 2020 and\nsentenced to a fine of $$2,800 for each charge, for a global fine of $$5,600'2,\n\n111\n\nThe Charges\n\n10.\n\nFollowing the Complaint that the Respondent’s actions compromised public\nconfidence in the legal profession, the Law Society preferred the following\ncharges against the Respondent:\n\n15T CHARGE\n\nThat you, Mohammed Lutfi bin Hussin, are guilty of grossly improper\nconduct in the discharge of your professional duty as amounts to improper\n\nconduct within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Professional\nAct (Cap 161) in that you, on or around 22 April 2014, had falsely\n\nrepresented that you had\n\nwitnessed the\n\nsignature of Mohammad\n\nNaseeruddin bin Allamdin (“Naseeruddin™) as it appeared on the mortgage\ninstrument (no.: ID/954935K) (“Mortgage Instrument™) by signing as\nwitness to his signature and thereafter signing the Certificate of Correctness\ncertifying the correctness of the matters set out in the Mortgage Instrument,\nwhen you had in fact not personally witnessed Naseeruddin sign the\nMortgage Instrument.\n\n11 CBOD p 8 para 20\n'2CBOD p 8 para 21\n\n\fALTERNATIVE 1% CHARGE\n\nThat you, Mohammed Lutfi bin Hussin, are guilty of misconduct unbefitting\nan advocate or solicitor of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfessional Act (Cap 161) in that you, on or around 22 April 2014, had\nfalsely represented that you had witnessed the signature of Mohammad\nNaseeruddin bin Allamdin (“Naseeruddin™) as it appeared on the mortgage\ninstrument (no.: 1ID/954935K) (“Mortgage Instrument”) by signing as\nwitness to his signature and thereafter signing the Certificate of Correctness\ncertifying the correctness of the matters set out in the Mortgage Instrument,\nwhen you had in fact not personally witnessed Naseeruddin sign the\nMortgage Instrument.\n\n[Note: A minor error appears in the Alternative 1% Charge, in that “advocate or\nsolicitor of the Supreme Court” should in fact be “advocate and solicitor of the\n\nSupreme Court”]\n\n2\" CHARGE\n\nThat you, Mohammed Lutfi bin Hussin, are guilty of grossly improper\nconduct in the discharge of your professional duty as amounts to improper\nconduct within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Professional\nAct (Cap 161) in that you, on or around 22 April 2014, had recklessly or\nnegligently\n\ncertified\n\nthat\n\nMohammad\n\nNaseeruddin\n\nbin\n\nAllamdin\n\n(“Naseeruddin™) had accepted proprietorship and was of full age and legal\ncapacity by signing the Certificate of Correctness certifying the correctness\nof the matters set out in the transfer instrument (no..

The Respondent is represented by Mr\nGeorge Pereira and Mr Timothy Chan from Pereira & Tan LLC.\n\nThe 1 Charge and Alternative 1%t Charge\n\n12.\n\nThe hearing before the DT commenced on 14 June 2021 and continued on 16 June\n2021 for oral submissions. Prior to the hearing, the DT had been informed that the\nRespondent intended to plead guilty to the Alternative 1% Charge. Before the DT,\ncounsel for the Law Society maintained that the 1% Charge was made out. The facts\nrelating to both the 1% Charge and the Alternative 1% Charge are the same, and as\npart of the Statement of Agreed Facts, the Respondent had acknowledged that he\ndid falsely represent that he witnessed Naseeruddin’s signature and proceeded to\ncertify the correctness of the Mortgage Instrument when in fact he had never met\nNaseeruddin. The Respondent’s contention is that his conduct does not amount to\ngrossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within the\nmeaning of s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. He also argued that since the Complainant had\nspecifically referred to s 83(2)(h) and not s 83(2)(b) of the LPA, the Law Society\nhad gone beyond the scope of the Complaint when it framed the 1% Charge under s\n83(2)(b).\n\n13.\n\nAccordingly, the issues relating to the 1% Charge are essentially matters of legal\nsubmission, and are as follows:\n\n\fa.\n\nWhether the 1% Charge falls outside the scope of the Complaint against the\nRespondent by the Complainant;\n\nb.\n\nWhether the Respondent’s conduct amounted to that of grossly improper\nconduct in the discharge of his professional duty under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA;\nand\n\nc.\n\nIfthe Respondent’s conduct does amount to grossly improper conduct under s\n83(2)(b) of the LPA, whether in exercising its power under s 93 of the LPA,\nthe DT considers that there is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary\naction under s 83 of the LPA.\n\nThe 2\" Charge and Alternative 2™ Charge\n\n14.\n\nWith respect to the 2\" Charge and the Alternative 2 Charge, the Respondent\ndenies the charges, contending that it is unclear what the Complainant is raising\nwith regards to the Transfer Instrument'. The Law Society framed the 2\" Charge\nand Alternative 2\" Charge on the basis of recklessness or negligence on the part of\nthe Respondent when he certified that Naseeruddin accepted proprietorship and was\nof full age and legal capacity without personally verifying or checking with\nNaseeruddin. Counsel for the Law Society has confirmed that the Law Society is\nnot asserting that there was any dishonesty on the Respondent’s part in relation to\n\nthe 2\" Charge and the Alternative 2\" Charge.\n13 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 26\n\n\f10\n\n15.\n\nIn the Statement of Agreed Facts, the Respondent admitted that before signing the\nCertificate of Correctness in the Transfer Instrument, he did not meet with\n\nNaseeruddin personally and did not personally check with Naseeruddin whether he\nwas of full age and had legal capacity'®. However, the Respondent denies that in\nthis instance, his reliance on his conveyancing secretary Angela to conduct the\nnecessary checks on his behalf constituted recklessness and negligence on his\npart!>. His assertion is that Angela was an experienced conveyancing secretary,\nthere were no red flags, and there was never any real doubt that Naseeruddin\n\naccepted proprietorship and was of full age and legal capacity. Hence, the\nRespondent contends that there was no actual need for him to meet with or speak to\nNaseeruddin before he signed the Certificate of Correctness in the Transfer\nInstrument.\n\nRespondent’s Evidence\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent took the stand in his own defence. As the facts relating to the 1%\nCharge and the Alternative 1% Charge were not disputed, the Respondent’s\ntestimony was focused on the 2* Charge and the Alternative 2 Charge, i.e., the\ncircumstances leading to him signing the Transfer Instrument.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent’s evidence can be summarised as follows:\n\n4 Statement of Agreed Facts at para 14 (amended by the parties on 14 June 2021)\n15 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 29\n\n\f11\n\nHe acknowledged that he pleaded guilty to the second of the State Court\nCharges, and in so doing, had admitted that he “did falsely certify to the\ncorrectness of a dealing, fo wit, a Transfer in respect of the property at 35\nSaraca Terrace, Singapore 805486, in implying that the person acquiring title,\none Mohammad Naseeruddin bin Allamdin, accepts proprietorship and is of\nfull age and legal capacity” and had thereby committed an offence under s\n59(6) of the LTA.\n\nIn pleading guilty to the second of the State Court Charges, the Respondent\nhad agreed to the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts. This included the\nstatements found in para 13 of the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts which\nstated that the Respondent did not meet Naseeruddin at any point!®, did not\ncontact Naseeruddin to enquire whether he accepted the transfer of the\nproperty'’, and would sign the conveyancing documents that were left on his\n\ndesk without examining its contents'® as he assumed that the said documents\nwould have been prepared correctly. Paragraph 13 of the Prosecution’s\nStatement of Facts also included the statement that “It was only when [the\nRespondent] was questioned by CAD officers did he become aware that his\nlaw firm acted on behalf of Naseeruddin in relation to the Property”.\n\n1 NE 14 June 2021 at p 82 line 12-14\n1”NE 14 June 2021 atp 82 line 15-17\nBNE 14 June 2021 at p 82 line 18-30\n\n\f12\n\nIn para 36 of his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, the Respondent explained\nthat he pleaded guilty and agreed to the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts\nbecause he had “had enough and decided to plead guilty to get the matter over\nwith as quickly as possible even though there were matters stated in the\n[Prosecution’s Statement of Facts] ... that were clearly incorrect.” The\nRespondent nevertheless acknowledged that at no point in his mitigation plea\ndid he seek to object to or request any correction to para 13 of the\nProsecution’s Statement of Facts'®, During re-examination, the Respondent\nwas asked to explain why he went ahead to plead guilty without objecting to\nthe Prosecution’s Statement of Facts, and he said that “sometimes client PG\n\nout of expediency ... and I suppose that’s what happened here.”?°\n\nThe Respondent took the view that there was no need for him to meet with\nNaseeruddin to see whether he was of full age and legal capacity, because\nthere was a copy of Naseeruddin’s NRIC in the file to show that he was more\n\nthan 21 years of age.?! However, when he was asked if he could recall\nlooking at the file before he signed the Certificate of Correctness for the\nTransfer Instrument, he said that he could not remember.?? As for legal\ncapacity, he explained that it was not only his pair of eyes looking at the\ntransaction, and the “bank has .. got their own lawyers” and they “will go\nthrough the same checklist, because for [Naseeruddin] to take a ... loan, ... he\n\nwould need to be of age and of legal capacity as well.

I go through the files and ask her any questions that I\nhave.” The Respondent agreed that this was intended to describe his general\npractice®®, As for this particular conveyancing transaction, it was pointed out\n\nto the Respondent that there was no way of knowing what files were actually\nplaced before him on his desk because no such evidence had been adduced.’!\nEventually, during re-examination, the Respondent was able to produce the\nconveyancing file relating to the Property, through his counsel®?. He then\npointed to inter alia a photocopy of Naseeruddin’s NRIC (albeit not a clear\n\ncopy) that was in the file®.\n\n2 NE 14 June 2021 at p 87 line 27 to p 88 line 5.

When it was\nsuggested to him that a solicitor would be in dereliction of duty if he has a\nduty to check his staff’s work and does not do so, the Respondent disagreed\nbecause the staff did not do anything wrong and there were no problems that\nwere surfaced to his attention®*,\n\n[The above is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Respondent’s\nevidence or testimony before the DT].\n\nSubmissions made by the parties in relation to the 1% Charge\n\n18.\n\nIn relation to the 1% Charge, Mr Rai highlighted the Respondent’s admission that he\nfalsely represented that he had witnessed Naseerudin’s signature on the Mortgage\nInstrument by signing as a witness and thereafter also signing the Certificate of\nCorrectness in the Mortgage Instrument. Accordingly, Mr Rai submits that the 1%\nCharge is made out and the Respondent’s conduct can be said to amount to grossly\nimproper conduct within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. On the facts of the\ncase, it was submitted that the Respondent had acted dishonestly and there is cause\nof sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 93(1)(c) of the LPA.\n\n3 NE 14 June 2021 at p 98 line 15-32\n\n\f16\n\n19.\n\nIn Anwar Patrick Adrian v Ng Chong & Hue LLC, the Court of Appeal held that\n“an accurate certificate of correctness for registration is of paramount importance\nbecause the Registrar of Titles and the public place enormous faith on it — especially\nwhen it emanates from an advocate and solicitor™®.\n\n20.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges went on to state in Law Society of Singapore v Chia\n\nChoon Yang’’ that a solicitor’s act of false attestation would necessarily involve\ndishonesty, as he would be asserting a fact relating to a state of affairs which he\n\nknows to be untrue®, Chia Choon Yang was a case in which the respondent\nsolicitor acting as a notary public attested that he had witnessed a party sign on a\npower of attorney when in fact the party had already placed his signature on the\npower of attorney when it was brought before him for notarisation, and the\nattestation was therefore false. The Court of Three Judges noted that a solicitor’s\nmisconduct involving dishonesty is treated with utmost severity, even where the\n\ndishonesty might be described as being “technical” in nature®. Relying on Chia\nChoon Yang, the Law Society submits that the Respondent’s conduct in falsely\nattesting to Naseeruddin’s signature must similarly be said to amount to gross\nmisconduct under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. In Chia Choon Yang, the Court of Three\n\nJudges found the respondent lawyer guilty of grossly improper conduct and was\nsatisfied that the charge under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA had been made out.\n\n3512014] 3 SLR 761, CBOA Tab 9\n3 At [57]\n3712018] 5 SLR 1068 (“Chia Choon Yang”), CBOA Tab 13\n\nBAL[15]\n39 At [18]\n\n\f17\n\n21.\n\nMr Rai also referred the DT to Law Society of Singapore v Sum Chong Mun®, a\ncase involving a respondent lawyer who falsely attested to a signature on a Lasting\n\nPower of Attorney. Again, the Court of Three Judges was satisfied that the\nrespondent lawyer was guilty of grossly improper conduct and that the charge under\n\ns 83(2)(b) of the LPA had been made out*.\n\n22.\n\nMr Rai also made the point that under Para 50 of the Practice Directions and\nRulings 2013 which were in force at the material time in 2014, the Law Society had\nadvised its members that false attestation of documents may amount to grossly\nimproper conduct in the discharge of a solicitor’s duty, and that this direction\nremains in force today on the same terms*2,\n\n23.\n\nIn seeking to persuade the DT that there is cause of sufficient gravity for\ndisciplinary action under s 93(1)(c) of the LPA, the Law Society is not submitting\nthat the DT is bound to arrive at such a finding if it finds that the Respondent acted\ndishonestly. Rather, Mr Rai submits that based on the precedents, solicitors’\nmisconduct that involves dishonesty is always treated with utmost gravity, and on\n\nthe facts of this case, there are sufficient grounds for the DT to conclude that the\nRespondent’s dishonest conduct is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\nunder s 93(1)(c) of the LPA.\n\n4072017] 4 SLR 707 (“Sum Chong Mun), CBOA Tab 16\n4 At [5] and [50]\n\n“2NE 14 June 2021 at p 17 line to p 20 line 4\n\n\f18\n\n24,\n\nWe now turn to the Respondent’s submissions on the 1*' Charge. Mr Pereira began\nby submitting that the 15 Charge goes beyond the scope of the original complaint\nmade by the Complainant. When the Complainant submitted the complaint letter\ndated 14 July 2020, the Complainant concluded the letter by stating that it appeared\nthat the Respondent has been guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession under s\n83(2)(h) of the LPA. No reference was made to s 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n25.\n\nWe note that in response, Mr Rai submitted that there is no merit to the\nRespondent’s claim, and the way in which the 1% Charge was framed captures the\ngravamen or substance of the Complaint against the Respondent.\n\nThe\n\nComplainant’s reference to s 83(2)(h) of the LPA cannot be interpreted as a\ndirective or instruction to the Law Society, one that the Law Society is obliged to\nfollow without being able to exercise any discretion of its own.\n\n26.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the Alternative 1% Charge. This\nmeans that the Respondent not only acknowledges that there was wrongdoing on\nhis part, he also accepts that the wrongdoing amounted to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession (i.e. s 83(2)(h) of the LPA).\n\n\f19\n\n27.\n\nCiting Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar’ and Law Society\nof Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel*’, Mr Pereira has argued that only\nthe most serious cases should be heard by the Court of Three Judges, and the\n\nRespondent’s conduct was not so serious as to warrant such a referral®®, As Mr\nPereira submits, this is because if one looks at the particulars on the Mortgage\nInstrument, “[p]ractically everything on it is correct46 and the only thing that was\ninaccurate was the fact that the Respondent had signed as a witness to\nNaseeruddin’s signature when Naseeruddin did not actually sign before the\nRespondent*’. Mr Pereira pointed out that the conveyancing transaction itself was\n\ngenuine. Although Naseeruddin did perpetrate a fraud on Maybank, this was not\nsomething the Respondent knew about or had any part in. Even if the Respondent\nhad personally witnessed Naseeruddin’s signature, it would not have prevented the\nfraud on Maybank. Hence, Mr Pereira submitted that the Respondent “did not cause\nany harm to anyone”, and that Naseeruddin was the only party that the Respondent\nacted for in the transaction and he did not act in a way that was adverse to the\ninterests of his client*®,\n\n28.\n\nOn the 1% Charge, Mr Pereira submitted that the Respondent’s signing of the\nCertificate of Correctness on the Mortgage Instrument “is in order”, and under s 59\n\nof the LTA, the signing of the Certificate of Correctness “implies representations\nthat to the best of the signatory’s knowledge and belief and in so far as he has\n43[2021] SGHC 27 CSBOA Tab 4\n\n44 [2010] 3 SLR 390 Respondent’s 2\" Supplementary Bundle of Authorities\n45 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 11 & 12\n46 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 18\n47 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 19\n48 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 20\n\n\f20\n\nreasonable means of ascertaining, the Mortgage was made in good faith and that the\nmatters contained in it are substantially correct”. In the present case, Mr Pereira\nsubmits that the matters stated on the Mortgage were “definitely substantially\ncorrect” ¥,\n\n29.\n\nMr Pereira also sought to distinguish Chia Choon Yang and Sum Chong Mun,\nsubmitting that the facts in those cases were “far removed” from the present case,\nbecause in those two cases, someone else had purportedly signed as the signatory\nand ended up being given wide ranging powers, and as a result the respondent\nsolicitors had caused actual harm or potential harm3®, Mr Pereira also referred the\nDT to Kanthosamy Rajendran’s case, a case involving the “same offences as the\n\nRespondent but Kanthosamy’s case was worse because the purchaser for whom\nKanthosamy was acting for claimed that he never bought the property”. The Inquiry\nCommittee in Kanthosamy Rajendran’s case had decided to recommend a penalty\n\nrather than refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal®’,\n\n30.\n\nNotwithstanding the above submissions, Mr Pereira acknowledged that the\nAlternative 1% Charge that the Respondent has pleaded guilty to does involve an\nelement of dishonesty. Mr Pereira nevertheless seeks to persuade the DT that not all\ncases of dishonesty result in a striking off or suspension, and there “can be a case,\n3552\nalbeit rare, where a censure or fine would be sufficient™*,\nAccordingly, Mr Pereira\n\n4 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 21\n\n30 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 22\n5!

In this case, the Respondent did not in fact use\nreasonable means to ascertain those facts or act to the best of his ability. He had\nsimply relied on what his conveyancing secretary prepared without checking the\nTransfer Instrument himself and/or taking any steps to personally verify with\nNaseeruddin. Consequently, the Law Society submits that the Respondent’s\ncertification was provided recklessly or negligently.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent’s position is clear from the evidence he gave in these proceedings.\nAlthough he admits that he did not meet with or call Naseeruddin about the\nProperty, he maintains that he was entitled to rely on Angela, his experienced\nconveyancing secretary, and there were no red flags that warranted additional action\non his part.\n\n\f22\n\n34,\n\nA key part of the parties’ submissions related to the significance of the\nRespondent’s decision to plead guilty to the second of the State Court Charges. Mr\nRai pointed out that by pleading guilty to the second of the State Court Charges, the\nRespondent had already admitted that he “falsely certiffied] to the correctness” of\nthe Transfer and committed an offence under s 59(6) of the LTA. Accordingly, the\nRespondent’s conviction is final and conclusive against him in these proceedings\n\nunder s 83(2) of the LPA3*. However, Mr Pereira contended that all that the\nRespondent can be taken to have admitted to is that he did not during the criminal\nproceedings in the State Courts dispute the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts, but\nthis does not preclude the Respondent from now demonstrating to the DT how the\nfacts in the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts are not entirely accurate>,\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent points out that Naseeruddin was in fact of full age and legal\ncapacity and there was never really any doubt that he accepted proprietorship of the\nProperty. It was therefore submitted that notwithstanding the fact that the\nRespondent pleaded guilty to the second of the State Court Charges, and in so doing\naccepted the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts, in the end the, certification that he\nprovided in the Transfer Instrument was correct and he was entitled to rely on his\nstaff Angela not only to prepare the Transfer Instrument but to carry out all the\nnecessary checks.\n\n33 Law Society’s Skeletal Submissions dated 9 July 2021 at para 19\n54 Respondent’s Further Submissions at para 2\n\n\f23\n\nV.\n\nDT’s Findings\n\nThe 1* Charge\n\n36.\n\nOn the preliminary issue of whether the Law Society’s decision to frame the 1%\nCharge under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA went beyond the scope of the Complaint, we\nfind that the substance of the 1% Charge falls squarely within the matters raised in\nthe Complaint. We do not agree that the Complainant’s reference to s 83(2)(h) of\nthe LPA was intended to or can be said to have the effect of removing the Law\n\nSociety’s discretion to proceed on the basis of s 83(2)(b) of the LPA, if the Law\nSociety considered it appropriate to do so. Accordingly, we find that the\nRespondent’s objection to the 1% Charge on this ground lacks merit and cannot be\nsustained.\n\n37.\n\nWe next find that the Respondent’s false representation of having witnessed\nNaseeruddin’s signature by signing as a witness to his signature and by signing the\nCertificate of Correctness in the Mortgage Instrument, was sufficiently setrious to\nconstitute grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his professional duties\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. There can be no doubt that an act of\ncertification is an important aspect of a solicitor’s duty under s 59 of the LTA. We\ndo not agree with Mr Pereira that the Mortgage Instrument can be said to be\n\n“definitely substantially correct”, because the fact remains that the Respondent\nknowingly made\n\na false\n\nrepresentation\n\nof having personally\n\nwitnessed\n\nNaseeruddin’s signature. To the extent that this false representation was being\n\n\f24\n\ndownplayed in the Respondent’s submissions, this does not comport with Mr\nPereira’s acknowledgement that the false representation on the Mortgage\nInstrument involved dishonesty. Nor is it consistent with the Respondent’s decision\nto plead guilty to the Alternative 1% Charge and his admission that what he did with\nregards to the Mortgage Instrument constitutes misconduct unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\n38.\n\nHaving found that the 1% Charge has been made out, the DT has to consider\n\nwhether in exercising its power under s 93 of the LPA, there is cause of sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA.\n\n39.\n\nThat the false attestation on the Mortgage Instrument involves dishonesty is not in\ndispute between the parties. As officers of the Court and members of an honourable\nprofession, solicitors are expected to uphold high standards of probity and integrity.\nIt is difficult to see how the Respondent’s decision to assert a fact that he knows to\nbe false (while performing a statutory duty under s 59(2) of the LTA) can be\nregarded as anything other than a case in which cause of sufficient gravity for\ndisciplinary action has been established. In our view, such a conclusion is well\nsupported by the decisions of the Court of 3 Judges in Chia Choon Yang and Sum\nChong Mun. We find ourselves unable to agree with Mr Pereira that Chia Choon\nYang and Sum Chong Mun can be considered “far removed” from the present case.\nThe Court of 3 Judges in those cases had underscored the importance of the solemn\nduty of attestation that a solicitor undertakes, leaving no doubt that falsely attesting\nto having personally witnessed a party signing a document would involve an\n\n\f25\n\nelement of dishonesty and is an act that the court will view severely. We do not\nagree that the threshold for cause of sufficient gravity was met in Chia Choon Yang\nsimply because “someone else had purportedly signed as the signatory and ended\nup being given wide ranging powers” >, In fact, there was no definite finding made\nby the Court of 3 Judges in Chia Choon Yang that the signatory to the power of\nattorney in that case did not actually sign the power of attorney. Rather, the finding\nwas that it was clear it was not signed in the respondent’s presence. Whether or not\nthere is actual or presumed harm, an act of false attestation should still be regarded\nas sufficiently serious to constitute cause of sufficient gravity within the meaning of\ns 93(1)(c) of the LPA. This outcome should not change even if the false attestation\nwas only a “technical” breach because it turned out that the correct person did sign\nthe document. While the actual degree of harm will be a factor in sentencing, that is\nultimately a matter for the Court of 3 Judges to decide. As for Kanthosamy\nRajendran’s case, the DT does not consider itself bound by the decision reached by\nthe IC in that case, nor do we necessarily agree with the decision.\n\nThe 2™ Charge/ Alternative 2™ Charge\n\n40.\n\nAs for the 2™ Charge/Alternative 2™ Charge, we are unable to accept the\nRespondent’s contention that he was under no duty to personally verify with\nNaseeruddin that he was of full age and legal capacity and accepted proprietorship\nof the Propeity before signing the Certificate of Correctness in the Transfer\nInstrument. It bears noting again that the Respondent was performing an act of\n35 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions at para 22\n\n\f26\n\nstatutory certification pursuant to s 59 of the LTA. It was not only important that the\ninformation on the Transfer Instrument ultimately be correct. A solicitor providing\nthe certificate of correctness on a Transfer Instrument must represent “to the best of\nthe signatory’s knowledge and belief and in so far as he has any reasonable means\nof ascertaining” that the matters set forth in the Transfer Insttument are\nsubstantially correct and the person acquiring title accepts proprietorship and is of\nfull age and legal capacity. This, the Respondent clearly failed to do. By the\nRespondent’s own admission, he had simply relied on his staff. He even relied on\nMaybank and its legal officers because Naseeruddin had been granted a loan.\nHowever, any steps the Respondent himself may have taken (if at all) clearly fell\nshort of the expectation that he was to use “any reasonable means” he had to\npersonally verify for himself what needed to be verified. To accept the\nRespondent’s argument that he was entitled to rely on others to verify that\ninformation before signing the Certificate of Correctness would render the\nsolicitor’s duty under s 59 of the LTA meaningless.\n\n41.\n\nThere is of course, the fact that the Respondent pleaded guilty to the second of the\nState Court Charges, a charge based on the assertion that the Respondent “did\nfalsely certify to the correctness of a dealing, fo wit, a Transfer”. He had also\naccepted the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts, including the admission that he not\nonly did not contact Naseeruddin, but he would also sign the conveyancing\ndocuments left on his desk without examining its contents, and was only aware that\nhis law firm acted for Naseeruddin in relation to the Property when he was\nsubsequently questioned by CAD officers.\n\n\f27\n\n42,\n\nSection 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) states that “the fact that a\nperson has been convicted ... of an offence by or before any court in Singapore\nshall be admissible in evidence for the purpose ofproving ... that he committed ...\nthat offence ... and where he was convicted, whether he was so convicted upon a\nplea ofguilty or otherwise”.\n\n43.\n\nRule 23(2) of the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules states that the DT\n“may, in its discretion, accept as conclusive a finding offact ofa court of competent\nJurisdiction in Singapore to which proceedings the respondent was a party”.\n\n44.\n\nIn pleading guilty to the State Court Charges, the Respondent accepted his\nwrongdoing and guilt. He also accepted the facts stated in the Prosecution’s\nStatement of Facts. Indeed, s 227(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68,\n2012 Rev Ed) makes it clear that before a court records a plea of guilty, it must\nrecord the accused’s advocate’s confirmation that the accused understands the\nnature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit to the offence without\nqualification.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent has sought to explain that he only pleaded guilty to the second of\nthe State Court Charges and did not raise any objection to the Prosecution’s\nStatement of Facts because he had had enough and wanted to bring the matter to an\nend as quickly as possible. Accordingly, he does not actually agree that he falsely\ncertified the Transfer/Transfer Instrument; neither could it be said that what he\n\n\f28\n\ncertified was false, since Naseeruddin was in fact of full age and legal capacity and\nwas prepared to accept proprietorship.\n\n46.\n\nWe find that an offence under s 59(6) of the LTA is made out so long as a solicitor\nclaims to have performed the duties of certification, when he/she did not do so. It\ndoes not become an offence only if it can be proven that the facts stated on the\nTransfer Instrument were in fact false. The duties of certification require the\nsolicitor to personally verify that the person acquiring title accepts proprietorship\nand is of full age and legal capacity, or the person divesting title is entitled to divest\nthe interest under the instrument and is of full age and legal capacity. Accordingly,\na solicitor who fails to personally discharge this duty under s 59(2) of the LTA and\nsimply assumes that this is so because others have checked for him, does so at his\nown peril and can be held responsible for failing to discharge his duty. In other\nwords, the certification is false so long as there was in fact no meaningful\ncertification, and this is so even if the facts stated on the Transfer Instrument turned\nout to be true.\n\n47.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent had already admitted without qualification to\npara 13 of the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts that he “would sign conveyancing\ndocuments that were left on his desk without examining its contents, as he assumed\nthat the said documents would bhave been prepared correctly”. Having accepted\nthose facts in a court of law, we do not agree with the Respondent’s contention that\nthis should not be regarded as an admission and that he is not precluded from now\narguing that the Prosecution’s Statement of Facts are not entirely accurate. We note\n\n\f29\n\nthat a similar position had been unsuccessfully advanced by the respondent in Law\nSociety of Singapore v Choy Chee Yean®. The Court of 3 Judges in Choy Chee\nYean noted that the respondent had already expressly admitted the elements of the\ncriminal offence at the time of his guilty plea and had acknowledged that the\noffence involved dishonesty. As a lawyer, “he knew precisely what the plea of guill\n\nmeant and entailed”’. The same can be said of the Respondent in the present case.\n\n48.\n\nWe therefore find that the facts in the 2\" Charge/Alternative 2™ Charge have been\nestablished. In this regard, we note that the Law Society is not claiming that the\noffence was committed by the Respondent dishonestly; rather, the Respondent\nsigned the Certificate of Correctness in the Transfer Instrument recklessly or\nnegligently because he did not conduct any checks of his own. The question is this:\ncan the Respondent’s actions be said to constitute grossly improper conduct in the\ndischarge of his professional duty (s 83(2)(b) of the LPA), or is the Respondent\nguilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court or\nas a member of an honourable profession (s 83(2)(h) of the LPA)?\n\n49.\n\nIn the recent decision of Lok Der Ming Andrew v Koh Tien Hua’®, the Court of\nAppeal stated the following:\n\n“A solicitor’s conduct is grossly improper if it is dishonourable to the solicitor\nconcerned as a man and in his profession (Law Society ofSingapore v Ezekiel Peter\n3612010] 3 SLR 360 (“Chay Chee Yean), RSBOA Tab 2\n3T At [25]\n38 [2021] SGCA 81\n\n\f30\n\nLatimer [2019] 4 SLR 1427...). In contrast, the test for misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor is broader, and considers whether reasonable people, on\nhearing what the solicitor had done, would have said without hesitation that as a\nsolicitor he should not have done it..””°\n\nIn the round, we thought that Koh had acted appropriately in his conduct before the\ncourt. By consenting to have the particulars struck out, he had saved judicial time\nand resources. However, where Koh erred was in failing to advise his client\nproperly and failing to inform his client of the position he would be taking before\nthe court. This was improper, but in the circumstances, it was not grossly so, and it\ncertainly was not fraudulent. \"%\n\n50.\n\nIn the present case, we find that the Respondent’s failure to perform his duty under\ns 59(2) of the LTA in relation to the Transfer Instrument was improper conduct on\nhis part, but it was not grossly so. The Law Society did not allege that there was any\ndishonesty on the Respondent’s part, and we accept that the Respondent had simply\nlacked diligence in performing his duty, choosing instead to assume that if there\nwas any irregularity, his staff Angela would have spotted it. We are satisfied that\nreasonable people, upon knowing that the law requires the certification to be\nperformed by the solicitor of the party to the instrument, would have said without\nhesitation that the Respondent should not have simply relied on his staff but was\nexpected to personally take steps to contact his client Naseeruddin and check\n\n9 At[47]\n© At [49]\n\n\f31\n\nthrough the contents of the instrument. We therefore conclude that the 2\" Charge\nwas not made out in that the Respondent’s conduct, while improper, did not rise to\nthe level that it was grossly improperly. However, we find that the Alternative 2™\nCharge has been proven against the Respondent.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, we considered if the Respondent’s conviction on the Alternative 2™ Charge\nwould give rise to cause of sufficient gravity to warrant disciplinary action under s\n83 of the LPA. Between the 1% Charge and the Alternative 2\" Charge, the former\nmust be regarded as being more serious in nature and extent, in terms of the\nimpropriety of the conduct. If the Alternative 2\" Charge was being considered on\nits own, we might have been persuaded that cause of sufficient gravity may not be\nestablished, and the matter could be referred back to the Law Society to consider if\na fine, censure or warning should be imposed. However, bearing in mind that we\nhave already decided that cause of sufficient gravity has been established on the 1*\nCharge, and the fact that the subject matter of both charges relates to a single\nconveyancing transaction for which the Respondent was the solicitor in charge, we\nare of the view that the conviction on both the 1% Charge and the Alternative 2\"\nCharge should rightly be considered holistically in terms of what sanction would be\nappropriate to impose. Accordingly, in relation to both the 1% Charge and the\nAlternative 2\" Charge, we are satisfied that there is a prima facie case on the\nrelevant evidence that due cause is present, and in the circumstances, we find that\n\nboth ought to be referred to the Court of 3 Judges.\n\nVII.

However, the DT notes that due consideration should be placed on the fact that the Respondent had pleaded guilty to the Amended Charge on the first day of the hearing on 6 June 2022. The Respondent had also since returned the sum of $700 which was charged as solicitor-and-client costs to the Complainant. The DT placed great weight on this gesture as the gravamen of the complaint was that the Complainant felt aggrieved that he had to pay the Firm $700 from the damages for his personal injury claim, despite the manner in which the Respondent had handled his matter. Nevertheless, the DT noted that the Complainant’s dissatisfaction would also have been mitigated or completely avoided if the Respondent kept him informed of the various offers exchanged between NTUC and the Firm, and supplied him copies of the correspondence passing between the Firm and NTUC. He would then at least have had the opportunity to raise queries or objections regarding NTUC’s various offers and would have been aware of the party-and-party costs of $2,283.49 claimed by the Firm instead of only finding out when he received NTUC’s discharge voucher on 2 January 2020. Therefore, the DT was of the view that the issue of the $700 payment falls squarely within the four corners of the Respondent’s failures as reflected in the Amended Charge. The DT determined that while there exists no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA and recommended the sum of $3,500 which the DT considers sufficient and appropriate for the misconduct committed. The DT also ordered the Respondent to pay costs of $4,000 (all-in). Council accepted the findings of the DT and imposed a financial penalty of $2,500 on the Respondent.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n\n\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Oct_24_Full_DT_report_-_Krishnamoorthi_so_Kolanthaveloo.pdf","pdf-content":"DT/24/2021\n\nIN THE MATTER OF KRISHNAMOORTHI S/O KOLANTHAVELOO\n(AN ADVOCATE & SOLICITOR)\nAND\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT 1966\n\nREPORT OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nCoram\nPresident: Mr Lok Vi Ming, S.C.\nAdvocate & Solicitor: Ms Disa Sim Jek Sok\n\nSolicitors for the Law Society:\n\nSolicitors for the Respondent:\n\nMr Daniel John\nMs Cara Satapornvanit\n\nMr Ragbir Singh s/o Ram Singh Bajwa\n\nGOODWINS LAW CORPORATION\n143 Cecil Street\n#03-02 GB Building\nSingapore 069542\n\nBAJWA & CO\n3 Shenton Way\n#08-02 Shenton House\nSingapore 068805\n\nDated this\n\n3rd day of\n\nJanuary 2023\n\n\f2\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n1.\n\nMr Krishnamoorthi s/o Kolanthaveloo (the “Respondent”) was admitted to the roll of\nadvocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore on 8 July\n1992 and was, at all material times, a partner of M/s K. Krishna & Partners (the “Firm”).\n\n2.\n\nThese proceedings arose out of a complaint made by way of a letter dated 26 November\n2020 against the Respondent by Mr Seto Wan Tarng (the “Complainant”), a taxi driver\nwho has been working with ComfortDelGro since 2002.\n\nII.\n\nCHARGES AND PROCEEDINGS OF THE TRIBUNAL\n\n3.\n\nOn 11 November 2021, this Disciplinary Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) was appointed. In\nthe Statement of Case filed by the Law Society against the Respondent dated 21 October\n2021, the original charges preferred were as follows:\n\na.\n\nThe first main charge was that the Respondent had breached rules 5(2)(b), 5(2)(e),\n5(2)(i), 17(2)(c), 17(4), 26(2) and/or 39(2) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015 (“PCR”) in that sometime between 26 September 2019 and\n2 December 2019, during the course of the Firm’s retainer in acting for the\nComplainant in his personal injury matter, the Respondent had:\n\ni.\n\nissued the Firm’s 26 September 2019 letter to NTUC Income Insurance Cooperative Limited (“NTUC”), rejected their counter-offer of 25 November\n\n\f3\n\n2019, and issued the Firm’s further counter-offer of 2 December 2019 to\nthem, without the Complainant’s instructions; and/or\n\nii.\n\nfailed to keep the Complainant informed of the matters in (i) above; and/or\n\niii.\n\nfailed to explain to the Complainant that in any event, he is personally\nresponsible for paying his own solicitor-and-client costs in full, and that\nNTUC may not pay the full amount of such costs even if he was successful\nin his claim,\n\nand such conduct amounted to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\nsolicitor with the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act 1966\n(“LPA”).\n\nb.\n\nThe first alternative charge was that the same conduct as in the first main charge\nalso amounted to improper practice as an advocate and solicitor with the meaning\nof section 83(2)(h) of the LPA (i.e., misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession).\n\nc.\n\nThe second main charge was that the Respondent had breached rules 5(2)(b),\n5(2)(e), 5(2)(j), 17(2)(c), 17(4), 22(1)(a), 22(2), 22(3)(a) and/or 22(3)(b) of the\nPCR in that sometime on 17 December 2019, during the course of the Firm’s\nretainer in acting for the Complainant in his personal injury matter, the Respondent\nhad:\n\n\f4\n\ni.\n\nobtained the Complainant’s instructions to settle the Complainant’s personal\ninjury claim with NTUC at $2,800 in damages whilst failing to inform the\nComplainant that NTUC had already made its 17 December offer comprising\n$3,000 in damages and $2,283.49 for costs and disbursements; and/or\n\nii.\n\nrejected NTUC’s 17 December offer of $3,000 in damages with the intention\nof getting NTUC to make a higher offer of damages with the intention that\nany amounts in excess of $2,800 would be charged to the Complainant as the\nFirm’s solicitor-and-client costs,\n\nand such conduct amount to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\nsolicitor with the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\nd.\n\nThe second alternative charge was that the same conduct as in the second main\ncharge also amounted to improper practice as an advocate and solicitor with the\nmeaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA (i.e., misconduct unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession).\n\ne.\n\nThe third main charge was that the Respondent had breached rules 5(2)(a), 5(2)(b),\n5(2)(e), 5(2)(i), 5(2)(j), 17(2)(c), 17(4), 22(1)(a), 26(2) and/or 39(2)(g) of the PCR\nin that sometime on 18 December 2019, during the course of the Firm’s retainer in\nacting for the Complainant in his personal injury matter, the Respondent had led\nthe Complainant to believe that NTUC had offered to settle the Complainant’s\npersonal injury claim at $3,500, from which the Complainant had to pay the Firm\n\n\f5\n\n$700 in legal fees, whilst deliberately omitting to inform him that NTUC’s\nsettlement offer included an additional sum of $2,283.49 for costs and\ndisbursements which would be paid to the Firm directly, and by such deliberate\nomission, the Respondent induced the Complainant into instructing the Firm to\naccept NTUC’s settlement offer and/or agreeing to pay the Firm $700 in legal fees,\nand such conduct amount to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\nsolicitor with the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\nf.\n\nThe third alternative charge was that the same conduct as in the third main charge\nalso amounted to improper practice as an advocate and solicitor with the meaning\nof section 83(2)(h) of the LPA (i.e., misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession).\n\n4.\n\nThe matter was initially fixed for hearing from 6 June 2022 to 8 June 2022. However,\nprior to and on the first day of the hearing, the parties engaged in extensive discussions,\nleading eventually to the Law Society proceeding only on one amended charge (the\n“Amended Charge”) which is as follows:\n\n“AMENDED CHARGE\nYou, Krishnamoorthi s/o Kolanthaveloo, an Advocate & Solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, are charged that sometime between 26th\nSeptember 2019 and 28th January 2020, while practicing law under the law firm of\nK Krishna & Partners (the “Firm”), during the course of the Firm’s retainer in\nacting for the Complainant in his personal injury claim breached Rules 5(2)(b),\n\n\f6\n\n5(2)(e), 5(2)(h) and 17(2)(c) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n2015, in that you had:\n\na.\n\nissued the Firm’s 26th September 2019 letter to NTUC, rejected their counteroffer of 25 November 2019, and issued the Firm’s further counter-offer of 2\nDecember 2019 to them, without the Complainant’s instructions;\n\nb.\n\nfailed to keep the Complainant informed of the matters in (a) above and did\nnot supply copies of any correspondence passing between the Firm and\nNTUC throughout the entire duration of your handling of the claim; and\n\nc.\n\nfailed to give any reasonable advice to the Complainant on his personal\ninjury claim, his right to recover party-party costs from the tortfeasor, and\nhis liability to pay solicitor-client costs to the Firm;\n\nand such breaches amounted to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\nsolicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act\n1966.”\n\n5.\n\nThe Amended Charge and the Statement of Facts were read to the Respondent\nsubsequently in the afternoon of the first day of the hearing, 6 June 2022, and he pleaded\nguilty. We therefore found the Respondent liable for the matters raised in the Amended\nCharge.\n\n\f7\n\n6.\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned for parties to tender written submissions on sentencing\nand the parties reconvened at a subsequent hearing on 17 August 2022 where the Law\nSociety and the Respondent made further oral submissions on sentencing.\n\nIII. BACKGROUND FACTS\n\n(i)\n\nThe Statement of Facts (as reproduced from the version which was read to and\nagreed to by the Respondent on 6 June 2022)\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent is an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of\nSingapore of 29 years’ standing, and was at all material times a practising advocate and\nsolicitor and a partner in the Firm (as defined above).\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent’s main area of work is personal injury and accident claims.\n\n9.\n\nThe Complainant who was at all material times a taxi driver with ComfortDelGro. On 26\nApril 2019, the Complainant sustained personal injuries in a chain collision accident\nwhile he was driving his taxi.\n\n10.\n\nThe Complainant sent his taxi for repairs to ComfortDelGro’s authorised car repairer,\nChunni Motor Work Pte Ltd. The latter referred him to the Firm regarding his personal\ninjury claim.\n\n11.\n\nThe Complainant signed the Firm’s Warrant to Act on 17 May 2019.\n\n\f8\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent subsequently received the Firm’s letter dated 30 May 2019 confirming\ntheir appointment to act and enquiring as to his medical condition.\n\n13.\n\nThough the Respondent received Dr. Steven Ang’s specialist medical report around 28\nAugust 2019, he did not seek the Complainant’s instructions on it nor advise the\nComplainant on the quantum of damages claimable in respect of his injuries.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent did not give the Complainant any reasonable legal advice regarding the\nexpected damages he could get for his injuries, the legal costs he could recover from the\ntortfeasor’s insurer, or the legal costs he was expected to pay the Firm for handling the\nmatter.\n\n15.\n\nWithout seeking the Complainant’s instructions, on or around 26 September 2019, the\nRespondent wrote a letter to NTUC (the insurers for the tortfeasor) quantifying the\nComplainant’s claim seeking the following:-\n\nGeneral Damages\n\n$ 7,000.00\n\nSpecial Damages (including three days’ lost earnings)\n\n$ 345.50\n\nOthers (inclusive of medical report and search fees)\n\n$ 582.49\n\nContribution towards legal costs (i.e., P&P Costs)\n\n$ 2,500.00\n\nTOTAL\n\n16.\n\n$10,427.99\n\nNeither the Respondent nor the Firm supplied a copy of the above letter and enclosures\nto the Complainant.\n\n\f9\n\n17.\n\nOn or around 2 December 2019, the Respondent received NTUC’s counter-offer dated\n25 November 2019, in which they proposed to settle the Complainant’s claim at a sum\nof $4,007.49 comprising $2,000 for damages and $2,007.49 for costs and disbursements.\nNeither the Respondent nor the Firm supplied a copy of this letter to the Complainant.\n\n18.\n\nWithout consulting the Complainant nor keeping him informed of the action taken, the\nRespondent rejected NTUC Income’s offer, and on 2 December 2019, counter-proposed\nthe following:-\n\n19.\n\na.\n\nGeneral Damages\n\n$ 4,000.00\n\nb.\n\nMedical report fees\n\n$ 321.00\n\nc.\n\nGIA/LTA Fee\n\n$ 36.49\n\nd.\n\nCosts (inclusive of GST)\n\n$ 1,926.00\n\nTOTAL\n\n$6,283.49\n\nBy their without prejudice response email of 17 December 2019 (of 9:03am) NTUC\ncounter-offered the following:-\n\na.\n\nDamages\n\n$ 3,000.00\n\nb.\n\nCosts and disbursements\n\n$ 2,283.49\n\nTOTAL\n\n$5,283.49\n\nNeither the Respondent nor the Firm supplied a copy of this email to the Complainant.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent concluded the matter on around 28 January 2020.\n\n\f10\n\n21.\n\nThroughout the entire duration of the Respondent’s handling of the claim:-\n\na.\n\nthe Respondent did not personally speak with the Complainant at any time; all\ndealings were between the Respondent’s paralegal, Mr. Veknesh Mohanathass\n(“Veknesh”) or other staff and the Complainant;\n\nb.\n\nnone of the Firm’s emails to NTUC, or NTUC’s emails to the Firm, were furnished\nto the Complainant;\n\nc.\n\nthere was no email communication between the Firm and the Complainant; and\n\nd.\n\nno reasonable advice was given to the Complainant regarding his personal injury\nclaim, party-and-party costs and solicitor-and-client costs.\n\n22.\n\nThe claim was eventually concluded with the Complainant’s consent, but he was\naggrieved by the matters stated above and lodged a complaint with the Law Society of\nSingapore.\n\n(ii)\n\n23.\n\nOther relevant facts\n\nAside from the Statement of Facts, both the Law Society and the Respondent referred to\nother pertinent facts in their respective submissions on sentencing which we find ought\nto be highlighted as well.\n\n\f11\n\n24.\n\nFollowing NTUC’s counter-offer of $5,283.49 (comprising $3,000 for damages and\n$2,283.49 for costs and disbursements) on 17 December 2019, Veknesh replied NTUC\non the same date to counter-propose $3,600 for damages.\n\n25.\n\nOn 17 December 2019, Veknesh telephoned the Complainant to discuss NTUC’s\ncounter-offer of $5,283.49. There is disagreement as to whether this telephone\nconversation took place before or after Veknesh replied to NTUC to counter-propose\n$3,600 for damages. However, while the Complainant and Veknesh had different\naccounts of this telephone conversation, both the Law Society and the Respondent\ndescribed the contents of this conversation to include the following:\n\na.\n\nthe Complainant was informed that NTUC had initially offered compensation of\n$2,000;1\n\nb.\n\nthe Complainant informed Veknesh that he was unhappy with the figure of $2,000\nand wanted a sum of at least $3,000;2\n\nc.\n\nVeknesh explained that it was unlikely that NTUC would increase their offer such\nthat the Complainant would receive more than $3,000;3 and\n\nd.\n\nat the end of the discussion, the Complainant agreed to accept a sum of $2,800.4\n\n1 Paragraph 11 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Seto Wan Tarng dated 6 January 2022; Paragraph 11.a. of the Defence\n\ndated 2 December 2021.\n2 Paragraph 11 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Seto Wan Tarng dated 6 January 2022; Paragraph 11.b. of the Defence\ndated 2 December 2021.\n3 Paragraph 12 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Seto Wan Tarng dated 6 January 2022; Paragraph 9 of the Affidavit\nof Evidence-in-Chief of Veknesh Mohanathass dated 19 January 2022.\n4 Paragraph 12 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Seto Wan Tarng dated 6 January 2022; Paragraph 12 of the Defence\ndated 2 December 2021; Paragraph 10 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Veknesh Mohanathass dated 19 January 2022.\n\n\f12\n\n26.\n\nFollowing this, NTUC replied on 17 December 2019 to make a subsequent counter-offer\nof $5,783.49 (comprising $3,500 for damages and $2,283.49 for costs and\ndisbursements). There was yet another telephone conversation between Veknesh and the\nComplainant subsequently on 18 December 2019 where Veknesh informed the\nComplainant about NTUC’s latest counter-offer. However, on one hand, Veknesh’s\nversion of this conversation was that he informed the Complainant that NTUC had\noffered $3,500 and proposed that the Complainant contribute $700 as legal costs payable\nto the Firm to which the Complainant agreed.5 On the other hand, the Complainant’s\nrecalls Veknesh informing him that NTUC had agreed to pay him $2,800 but that NTUC\nwould issue a cheque for $3,500 and he would have to pay $700 in cash in exchange for\nthis cheque.6\n\n27.\n\nOn 2 January 2020, the Firm sent a letter to the Complainant, enclosing NTUC’s\ndischarge voucher dated 17 December 2019 for the amount of $5,783.49 in settlement of\nthe Complainant’s claims. The Complainant signed the discharge voucher and the matter\nwas eventually concluded on around 28 January 2020 when the Complainant collected\ncheque of $3,500 from the Firm after paying $700 in cash.\n\nIV. LAW SOCIETY’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCING\n\n28.\n\nThe Law Society recommended that a fine of $10,000 be imposed on the Respondent. In\nsupport of this recommendation, the Law Society submitted, inter alia, that:\n\n5 Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Veknesh Mohanathass dated 19 January 2022.\n6 Paragraph 13 of the Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Seto Wan Tarng dated 6 January 2022.\n\n\f13\n\na.\n\nThe Complainant was entitled to expect that (1) the Respondent would gather\ninformation from him on his claim (the injuries he suffered, expenses he incurred\nin treatment, etc.), (2) advise him on the prospects of success of his claim, (3)\nadvise him on the expected general and special damages he might recover, (4)\nadvise him on the party-and-party costs he may recover and that such costs belongs\nto him, (5) advise him on the solicitor-and-client costs the Firm was entitled to\ncharge him and that this amount had to be approved by the Public Trustee, and (6)\nadvise him that the settlement sum would be paid by NTUC to the Public Trustee\nwho would then in turn pay the Firm’s solicitor-and-client costs and return the\nbalance to the Complainant. Instead, the Respondent did none of these acts.7\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent never discussed any aspects of the pre-action letter of demand\ndated 26 September 2019 which was sent to NTUC with the Complainant (i.e., the\nfirst letter of demand sent to NTUC). Instead, the Respondent, inter alia, chose to\npitch the Complainant’s injury at the upper level of a “minor whiplash injury and\nsoft tissue damage classified as Grade 1 whiplash injury” as found in the Guideline\nfor the Assessment of General Damages in Personal Injury Cases, and claim partyand-party costs of $2,500 in the matter. The latter meant that his claim for solicitorand-client costs would be even higher.8\n\nc.\n\nThe Respondent should have realised that the Complainant’s medical report which\nhe had relied on to quantify the Complainant’s injuries was issued by a general\npractitioner and not an orthopaedic specialist, and should have advised the\n\n7 Paragraph 15 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n8 Paragraph 20 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n\n\f14\n\nComplainant to see an orthopaedic specialist or to submit to an examination by\nNTUC’s specialist (which NTUC offered in their letter dated 2 October 2019).9\n\nd.\n\nThe Respondent was careless about what damages the Complainant was entitled to\nand arbitrarily brought down his quantification of general damages from $7,000 to\n$4,000 in the Firm’s letter dated 2 December 2019 without any discussion with or\nexplanation to the Complainant.10\n\ne.\n\nThe Respondent provided no explanation to neither Veknesh nor the Complainant\nas to why the general damages of $3,000 offered by NTUC was fair and instead\nthere was simply some unprincipled haggling between Veknesh and the\nComplainant leading to the Complainant agreeing to accept a net sum of $2,800 for\nhis claim. The Respondent was therefore reckless in his actions of getting Veknesh\nto persuade the Complainant to accept NTUC’s counter-offer of 17 December\n2019.11\n\n29.\n\nThe Law Society referred us to two cases: (1) The Law Society of Singapore v Sham\nChee Keat [2018] SGDT 5 (“Sham”) where the respondent had misunderstood the\noutcome of a pre-trial conference and acted carelessly and caused the client to affirm\nstatements in his affidavit that were inaccurate or false, resulting in a penalty ordered of\n$5,000;12 and (2) The Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margret Paglar [2020]\nSGDT 4 (“Constance”) where the Law Society submitted that, in the absence of\naggravating factors, where a legal practitioner is charged and found liable for breach of\n\n9 Paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n10 Paragraph 28.a. of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n11 Paragraphs 34 and 37 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n12 Paragraph 47 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n\n\f15\n\nrule 5(2) of the PCR, a monetary penalty was appropriate and that a penalty of $6,000 in\nthat case was appropriate.13\n\n30.\n\nThe Law Society’s view here was that the Respondent’s conduct was more serious than\nthat of the charges proceeded against the lawyers in Sham and Constance14 and therefore\na penalty of $10,000 would be appropriate.\n\nV.\n\nTHE RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCING AND MITIGATION\nPLEA\n\n31.\n\nConversely, the Respondent submitted that only a reprimand or a censure should be\nimposed for the Amended Charge. The Respondent raised the following arguments in\nmitigation:\n\na.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that he should have been more circumspect and prudent\nand should have engaged with the Complainant at every stage. Instead, drawing on\nhis experience in dealing with cases involving taxi drivers, the Respondent had\nthought that taxi drivers preferred not to get involved at the early stages of such\nmatters given their daily work routine and would find it disruptive to attend the\nlawyer’s office or receive calls at the early stages of negotiations. Thus, he had\nproceeded to engage with NTUC until a reasonable offer had been received, and\nhad the interest of the Complainant at the forefront.15\n\n13 Paragraphs 46 and 49 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n14 Paragraph 52 of the Law Society’s Sentencing Submissions dated 12 July 2022.\n15 Paragraphs 16 and 19 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n\n\f16\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent also took the position that if he had engaged the Complainant at\nthe early stages of the negotiations, the Complainant would have in all likelihood\ntold him to negotiate further. Moreover, from his experience, some offers are\nridiculously low and do not merit any consideration nor reference to the client.16\n\nc.\n\nWhile the Respondent did not supply copies of the correspondence between the\nFirm and NTUC, he had, through Veknesh, updated the Complainant by phone on\n17 December 2019 and 18 December 2019.17\n\nd.\n\nThe Respondent, through Veknesh, had discussed the Complainant’s medical\nreport with him and did advise the Complainant as to the damages which he could\nreasonably expect during the call on 17 December 2019. On the 18 December 2019\nphone call, the Respondent had also, through Veknesh, advised the Complainant\nthat NTUC’s final offer of $3,500 was reasonable. Thus, while the Respondent\naccepts that he had “failed to give any reasonable advice to the Complainant” as\nper the Amended Charge, it was not the case where he gave no advice at all.18\n\ne.\n\nWhile the Respondent concedes that he should have explained to the Complainant\nthe difference between party-and-party costs and solicitor-and-client costs, the\nComplainant should have reasonably deduced from NTUC’s discharge voucher for\n$5,783.49 that NTUC was paying $2,283.49 as costs and disbursements in addition\nto the agreed damages of $3,500.19\n\n16 Paragraph 21 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n17 Paragraph 34 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n18 Paragraphs 27 to 30 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n19 Paragraphs 36 and 37 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n\n\f17\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent also relied on the case of Constance and highlighted the similarities in\nConstance and this case, namely that:20\n\n33.\n\na.\n\nboth cases involved the solicitors acting in motor accident cases;\n\nb.\n\nboth involved negotiations with insurers;\n\nc.\n\nboth involved a reduction of charges prior to pleading guilty;\n\nd.\n\nboth involved a breach of the PCR; and\n\ne.\n\nboth were for improper conduct and not grossly improper conduct.\n\nThe Respondent drew our attention to the fact that while the Law Society had submitted\nfor a fine of $6,000 in Constance, the tribunal in that case only ordered a penalty of\n$2,500.21\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent also highlighted his lack of antecedents and unblemished record of 30\nyears, and his service in the Law Society’s Non-Injury Motor Accident / Personal Injury\nMotor Accident sub-committee in mitigation.22\n\n35.\n\nIn addition to the submissions mentioned above, the Respondent also submitted at the\nhearing on 17 August 2022 that the Law Society had raised new assertions of fact that\n\n20 Paragraph 39 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n21 Paragraph 41 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n22 Paragraph 47 of the Respondent’s Sentencing Submissions and Mitigation Plea dated 12 July 2022.\n\n\f18\n\nthe Respondent did not agree to. Particularly, the Respondent took issue with the Law\nSociety’s submission at paragraph 28(c) above that the Respondent did not advise the\nComplainant to see an orthopaedic specialist or submit to an examination by NTUC’s\nspecialist, and that this submission was neither raised in the complaint nor the subject of\nthe complaint or Amended Charge.\n\n36.\n\nFinally, at the hearing before us on 17 August 2022, the Respondent indicated that he\nwas willing to make amends with the Complainant by returning the sum of $700 which\nwas charged as solicitor-and-client costs. We understand that this $700 has been returned\nby way of cheque to the Complainant on 13 September 2022.\n\nVI. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL\n\n37.\n\nSection 93 of the LPA provides as follows:\n\n“93.— (1) After hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary\nTribunal must record its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according\nto those facts shall determine that —\n(a)\n\nno cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83\nor 83A (as the case may be);\n\n(b)\n\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83 or 83A (as the case may be), the regulated legal practitioner\nshould be —\n(i)\n\nordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed;\n\n\f19\n\n(ii)\n\nreprimanded;\n\n(iii) ordered to comply with one or more remedial measures; or\n(iv) subjected to the measure in sub‑paragraph (iii) in addition to the\nmeasure in sub‑paragraph (i) or (ii); or\n(c)\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 or\n83A (as the case may be).”\n\n38.\n\nWe agree with the Respondent that the case of Constance bears several similarities with\nthis case. Notably, the Court of Three Judges held in Law Society of Singapore v\nConstance Margreat Paglar [2021] 4 SLR 382 at [31] that:\n\n“31\n\nIt cannot be gainsaid that the respondent could only be held to account for\n\nthe specific misconduct that she had been charged for. To hold otherwise would be\nprejudicial to the respondent, since it is the charge that informs a lawyer facing\ndisciplinary proceedings of the case that he or she has to meet and impacts the\ndecision he or she makes as to how to respond to the disciplinary proceedings…\nThe court did not dispute the point made that the Disciplinary Committee was not\nat liberty to consider the allegation which had been omitted from the amended\ncharge…”\n\n39.\n\nAs such, as it was in Constance, our decision on sentence must only be limited to the\nAmended Charge to which the Respondent had pleaded guilty. In this regard, we agree\nwith the Respondent that the Law Society’s submission at paragraph 28(c) above that the\nRespondent should had advised the Complainant to see an orthopaedic specialist or to\n\n\f20\n\nsubmit to an examination by NTUC’s specialist, was a new assertion of fact which was\nnot borne out in the Amended Charge, Statement of Facts or complaint.\n\n40.\n\nThat said, this is certainly not a case where only reprimand or a censure is appropriate. It\nis the very core of a legal practitioner’s duty to give proper guidance and advice to a\nclient. This is especially so where the client may lack certain sophistication and general\nunderstanding of the law such as in this case. It was therefore incumbent on the\nRespondent to give a full breakdown of what the Claimant would be getting in NTUC’s\nvarious offers and a proper explanation on the various types of costs he should pay.\n\n41.\n\nLegal practitioners also have a basic duty to keep clients informed of the progress of their\nmatter and to provide the client with copies of correspondence sent by the legal\npractitioner on the client’s behalf. This is so that the client will be aware of what is\nhappening in the matter and have an opportunity to raise any queries or objections. This\nwas not done by the Respondent.\n\n42.\n\nWe also agree with the Law Society that based on the Amended Charge and Statement\nof Facts, the present case is in our view more severe than in Sham (where a penalty of\n$5,000 was ordered) and Constance (where a penalty of $2,500 was ordered).\n\n43.\n\nFirst, the Amended Charge (to which the Respondent pleaded guilty and has been found\nliable for) concerned a breach of the following rules of the PCR:\n\n\f21\n\na.\n\nrule 5(2)(b) of the PCR: the legal practitioner must when advising the client, inform\nthe client of all information known to the legal practitioner that may reasonably\naffect the interest of the client;\n\nb.\n\nrule 5(2)(e) of the PCR: the legal practitioner must keep the client reasonably\ninformed of the progress of the client’s matter;\n\nc.\n\nrule 5(2)(h) of the PCR: the legal practitioner must provide timely advice to the\nclient; and\n\nd.\n\ntule 17(2)(c) of the PCR: the legal practitioner must explain clearly and properly to\nhis or her client a proposal of amicable resolution, or any other offer or position\ntaken by any other party, which affects the client.\n\n44.\n\nIn contrast, the respondent in Sham was found to have breached only rule 5(2)(c) of the\nPCR (i.e., failure to act with reasonable diligence and competence) and the amended\ncharge in Constance concerned a breach of only rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR (i.e., failure to\nkeep the client reasonably informed of the progress of the matter).\n\n45.\n\nSecondly, in Constance, the gravamen of the amended charge was that after the\nrespondent was instructed by the client to accept the tortfeasor’s insurer’s offer, the\nrespondent proceeded to negotiate further to obtain a higher party-and-party costs without\ninforming the client. In Sham, the respondent was found liable of failing to act with\nreasonable diligence and competence when she caused the client to include an inaccurate\nand false statement in her client’s affidavit.\n\n\f22\n\n46.\n\nHere, the Amended Charge pertains to the Respondent’s act of negotiating with NTUC\nwithout the Complainant’s instructions, failure to keep the Complainant informed of the\ninitial negotiation, failure to supply any correspondence to the Complainant, and failure\nto give any reasonable advice to the Complainant. The scope of the Amended Charge is\ntherefore much wider than both the amended charge in Constance and the charge in Sham.\n\n47.\n\nHowever, we do note that unlike in Sham where the respondent did not plead guilty and\nthe matter proceeded for hearing, the Respondent in this case had pleaded guilty to the\nAmended Charge on the first day of the hearing, 6 June 2022. Due consideration and\nweight should be placed on this fact. We have also taken into consideration the\nRespondent’s submissions on costs (as detailed below) in mitigation.\n\n48.\n\nMore crucially, the Respondent has since returned the sum of $700 which was charged\nas solicitor-and-client costs to the Complainant. We place great weight on this gesture as\nin our view, the gravamen of the complaint was that the Complainant felt aggrieved that\nhe had to pay $700 out of the damages for his personal injury claim to the Firm despite\nthe manner in which the Respondent had handled his matter. This is evident in the\nComplainant’s handwritten complaint dated 26 November 2020 where he states:\n\n“I complaint (sic):\na)\n\nLawyer K. Krishnamoorthi did not provide the best interest of his client –\nThe personal injury claim payout is $3,500 but told his client is $2,000 then\nask me to settle at $2,800.\n\n\f23\n\nb)\n\nLawyer K. Krishnamoorthi is dishonest, cheat and greedy – He tried to get a\nbigger amount for his legal fee from the personnal (sic) injury claim payout\nof his client.\n\nc)\n\nOvercharge of legal fee – He already claim his legal fee from NTUC Income\nCo-operative Limited and still ask his client to pay legal fee.”\n[Emphasis added]\n\n49.\n\nIn essence, the Complainant felt wronged that the Respondent had required him to pay\n$700 in cash (i.e., the Respondent had “tried to get a bigger amount for his legal fee” and\n“already [claimed] his legal fee from [NTUC] and still [asked] [the Complainant] to pay\nlegal fee”), even though (1) he had informed Veknesh that he wanted at least $3,000 in\ndamages but was advised to “settle at $2,800”; (2) NTUC had in fact offered $3,500 in\ngeneral damages; and (3) the Firm was already pocketing $2,283.49 in costs (i.e., the\n“legal fee from NTUC Income Co-operative Limited”).\n\n50.\n\nWe would also add that we are cognisant of the Tribunal’s duty to hear and investigate\nthe complainant and charges as has been held by the High Court in Law Society of\nSingapore v Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin and another matter [2020] 4 SLR 858 at [59] – [77].\nHowever, while the Amended Charge may not capture the full extent of the Respondent’s\ntransgression, the Amended Charge did not take away the gravamen of the complaint nor\nwas it outside the scope of the complaint.\n\n51.\n\nAs mentioned above, the gravamen of the complaint centres around the $700 which the\nComplainant had to pay out of the damages for his personal injury claim. The\nComplainant’s complaint that he was advised to “settle at $2,800” despite the offer from\n\n\f24\n\nNTUC being $3,500 and the “overcharge of legal fee” was a consequence of the\nRespondent’s failure to “to give any reasonable advice to the Complainant on his\npersonal injury claim, his right to recover party-party costs from the tortfeasor, and his\nliability to pay solicitor-client costs to the Firm” as reflected in the Amended Charge.\n\n52.\n\nThe Complainant’s dissatisfaction would also have been mitigated or even completely\navoided had the Respondent kept him informed of the various offers exchanged between\nNTUC and the Firm and if copies of the correspondence passing between the Firm and\nNTUC were supplied to him. He would then at least have had the opportunity to raise\nqueries or objections regarding NTUC’s various offers and would have been aware of\nthe party-and-party costs of $2,283.49 which was being claimed by the Firm instead of\nonly finding out when he received NTUC’s discharge voucher on 2 January 2020.\nTherefore, in our view, the issue of this $700 payment falls squarely within the four\ncorners of the Respondent’s failures as reflected in the Amended Charge.\n\n53.\n\nIn light of the above and having regard to the submissions made by the Law Society and\nthe Respondent, the Tribunal determines that while there exists no cause of sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action under section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be\nordered to pay a penalty of $3,500 pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA which we\nconsider sufficient and appropriate for the misconduct committed.\n\n\f25\n\nVII. COSTS\n\n54.\n\nHaving made a determination under section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, the Tribunal is\npermitted under section 93(2) of the LPA to make an order for payment of costs.\n\n55.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that the Respondent should pay costs of $6,014.08. This\nbeing the $5,000 honorarium which the Law Society pays to prosecuting counsel and\n$1,014.08 for tax and disbursements. However, bearing in mind the fact that the\nRespondent had pleaded guilty, and hearing did not proceed, counsel for the Law Society\nleft the issue of costs to our discretion.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that costs should be fixed at $4,000 (all in) as was ordered in\nthe case of Constance, bearing in mind the similarities of this case with Constance,\nnamely that the Law Society had amended the original charges to drop any allegation of\ndishonesty, and that the Respondent had pleaded guilty after the charges were amended.\n\n57.\n\nHaving heard the parties in relation to costs, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent pay\ncosts to the Law Society of $4,000 (all in).\n\n\f26\n\n58. We thank counsel for the Law Society and the Respondent for their spirited and suceinct\narguments and assistance.\n\nDated\n\nthis3rd day of January 2023\n\n(\n\nMr Lok Vi Ming,,S.C.\n(President)\n\nDisa Sim Jek Sok\n(Member)\n\n\f","timestamp":"2024-10-11T07:00:15+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2024/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Nedumaran Muthukrishnan (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Nedumaran Muthukrishnan (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>These proceedings against the Respondent arose from a complaint made by Mr Chan Yee Huat (the <strong>Complainant</strong>) who was a client of the Respondent from 2013 to 2019.

The DT noted that the Respondent had misled the Complainant into believing that he had or shortly would be posting and/or hand-delivering cheques for the payment of persons nominated by the Complainant when the Respondent did not do so and/or had no intention of doing so. Thus, the DT determined that the Respondent was guilty of the First Charge (and its alternative) beyond a reasonable doubt.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5><em><strong>Second Charge (and its Alternative)</strong></em></h5>\n<ol start=\"7\" type=\"1\">\n<li>In relation to the Second Charge, it was suggested that the Complainant was never told about the set-off prior to it being effected. The DT found that the Respondent had not been honest in his dealings with the Complainant when he applied the sum towards the settlement of his professional legal fees and costs without obtaining the Complainant’s prior consent and/or without first informing the Complainant of his intention to do so. Thus, the Second Charge (and its alternative) had been made out.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5><em><strong>Third Charge (and its Alternative)</strong></em></h5>\n<ol start=\"8\" type=\"1\">\n<li>On the Third Charge, the Respondent failed to produce any evidence regarding the basis on which his professional legal fees would be charged. There had been no accounting provided by the Respondent during the investigation. Therefore, the DT found that the Respondent had failed to inform the Complainant of the basis on which his fees for professional services would be charged and of the manner in which his fees and any disbursements were to be paid by the Complainant. Hence, the Third Charge (and its alternative) was made out.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5><em><strong>Fourth Charge (and its Alternative)</strong></em></h5>\n<ol start=\"9\" type=\"1\">\n<li>On the Fourth Charge, the Respondent had admitted that he had indeed used the Sum, which was the Complainant’s money and was paid into the client account, to pay his professional legal fees and costs, without issuing any bill of costs or written intimation to the Complainant. As stated by the Court of Three Judges in <em>Law Society of Singapore v Lim Yee Kai [2001] 1 SLR(R) 30</em> at [17], where rules relating to accounts are breached, disciplinary action is warranted as such contravention of the rules amount to grossly improper conduct in the discharge of a solicitor’s professional duty. Thus, the Fourth Charge (and its alternative) was made out.</li>\n<li>In respect of the above Charges, the DT determined that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed, with the Respondent to be referred to the Court of Three Judges (<strong>C3J</strong>). The DT awarded costs amounting to $10,000 and disbursements (to be agreed, if not, taxed) to the Law Society.</li>\n<li>The Council adopted the DT’s findings.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4><strong>The C3J’s findings</strong></h4>\n<ol start=\"12\" type=\"1\">\n<li>On 4 July 2024, the C3J found that the First Charge and the Third Charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</li>\n<li>In respect of the Second Charge, the C3J found that pursuant to section 6(4) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (the <strong>MVA</strong>), the Respondent was the beneficial owner of the Sum, and that accordingly, the Second Charge had not been made out. Consequently, with regards to the Fourth Charge, the C3J found that the Sum was not client’s money within the meaning of Rule 2 of the SAR and that accordingly, the Fourth Charge, which was premised on a breach of Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the SAR, had not been made out. The C3J therefore acquitted the Respondent of the Second and Fourth Charges.</li>\n<li>In respect of the First and Third Charges, the C3J ordered the Respondent to be suspended for four (4) years commencing 4 July 2024, with costs in the sum of $12,000 (inclusive of disbursements) be paid to the Law Society of Singapore, and for the costs order of the DT to remain.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To access the full report, click <a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Oct_24_Full_DT_report_-_Nedumaran_Muthukrishnan.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n                                    ","content":"In the Matter of Nedumaran Muthukrishnan (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor\n\nThese proceedings against the Respondent arose from a complaint made by Mr Chan Yee Huat (the Complainant) who was a client of the Respondent from 2013 to 2019.

Four charges (and their alternatives) were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nFirst Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (LPA) in that the Respondent had misled the Complainant into believing that he had or would shortly be posting and/or hand-delivering cheques for the payment of persons nominated by the Complainant in circumstances where he did not do so and/or had no intention to do so, in breach of Rule 5(2)(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (PCR).\n\nFirst Alternative Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent had misled the Complainant into believing that he had or would shortly be posting and/or hand-delivering cheques for the payment of persons nominated by the Complainant in circumstances where he did not do so and/or had no intention to do so, thereby breaching Rule 5(2)(a) of the PCR.\n\nSecond Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA in that the Respondent was not honest in his dealings with the Complainant and had applied the sum received on behalf of the Complainant towards the settlement of his professional legal fees and costs without obtaining the Complainant’s prior consent, thereby breaching Rule 5(2)(a) of the PCR.\n\nSecond Alternative Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent was not honest in his dealings with the Complainant and had applied the sum received on behalf of the Complainant towards the settlement of his professional legal fees and costs without obtaining the Complainant’s prior consent, thereby breaching Rule 5(2)(a) of the PCR.\n\nThird Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA in that the Respondent had failed to inform the Complainant of the basis on which your fees for his professional services would be charged and of the manner in which his fees and any disbursements in respect of, inter alia, H/S324/2016, HC/S325/2016 and HC/S52/2017 were to be paid by the Complainant, thereby breaching Rule 17(3)(a) of the PCR.\n\nThird Alternative Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent had withdrawn the sum from the client account in satisfaction of his solicitor’s costs in circumstances where (a) no bill of costs or other written intimation of the amount of solicitor’s costs incurred was delivered to the Complainant; and (b) the Respondent had failed to notify the Complainant that the sum would be applied towards or in satisfaction of his legal costs, thereby breaching Rule 17(3)(a) of the PCR.\n\nFourth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA in that the Respondent had withdrawn the sum from the client account in satisfaction of his solicitor’s costs in circumstances where (a) no bill of costs or other written intimation of the amount of solicitor’s costs incurred was delivered to the Complainant; and (b) the Respondent had failed to notify the Complainant that the sum would be applied towards or in satisfaction of his legal costs, thereby breaching Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (the SAR).\n\nFourth Alternative Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent had withdrawn the sum from the client account in satisfaction of his solicitor’s costs in circumstances where (a) no bill of costs or other written intimation of the amount of solicitor’s costs incurred was delivered to the Complainant; and (b) the Respondent had failed to notify the Complainant that the sum would be applied towards or in satisfaction of his legal costs, thereby breaching Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the SAR.\n\nThe DT had determined pursuant to section 93(1)(c) of the LPA that there is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under section 83 of the Act and that the Respondent is to pay the Law Society’s costs of the proceeding in the sum of $10,000 and reasonable disbursements.\n\nFindings of the DT\n\nFirst Charge (and its Alternative)\n\nThe DT found that the Respondent had not been honest in his dealings with the Complainant and had strung the Complainant along by falsely and deliberately concealing the truth from him over a period of one month as he had already set off the $160,000 against his legal fees and costs. The DT noted that the Respondent had misled the Complainant into believing that he had or shortly would be posting and/or hand-delivering cheques for the payment of persons nominated by the Complainant when the Respondent did not do so and/or had no intention of doing so. Thus, the DT determined that the Respondent was guilty of the First Charge (and its alternative) beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSecond Charge (and its Alternative)\n\nIn relation to the Second Charge, it was suggested that the Complainant was never told about the set-off prior to it being effected. The DT found that the Respondent had not been honest in his dealings with the Complainant when he applied the sum towards the settlement of his professional legal fees and costs without obtaining the Complainant’s prior consent and/or without first informing the Complainant of his intention to do so. Thus, the Second Charge (and its alternative) had been made out.\n\nThird Charge (and its Alternative)\n\nOn the Third Charge, the Respondent failed to produce any evidence regarding the basis on which his professional legal fees would be charged. There had been no accounting provided by the Respondent during the investigation. Therefore, the DT found that the Respondent had failed to inform the Complainant of the basis on which his fees for professional services would be charged and of the manner in which his fees and any disbursements were to be paid by the Complainant. Hence, the Third Charge (and its alternative) was made out.\n\nFourth Charge (and its Alternative)\n\nOn the Fourth Charge, the Respondent had admitted that he had indeed used the Sum, which was the Complainant’s money and was paid into the client account, to pay his professional legal fees and costs, without issuing any bill of costs or written intimation to the Complainant. As stated by the Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Lim Yee Kai [2001] 1 SLR(R) 30 at [17], where rules relating to accounts are breached, disciplinary action is warranted as such contravention of the rules amount to grossly improper conduct in the discharge of a solicitor’s professional duty. Thus, the Fourth Charge (and its alternative) was made out. In respect of the above Charges, the DT determined that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed, with the Respondent to be referred to the Court of Three Judges (C3J). The DT awarded costs amounting to $10,000 and disbursements (to be agreed, if not, taxed) to the Law Society. The Council adopted the DT’s findings.\n\nThe C3J’s findings\n\nOn 4 July 2024, the C3J found that the First Charge and the Third Charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. In respect of the Second Charge, the C3J found that pursuant to section 6(4) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189, 2000 Rev Ed) (the MVA), the Respondent was the beneficial owner of the Sum, and that accordingly, the Second Charge had not been made out. Consequently, with regards to the Fourth Charge, the C3J found that the Sum was not client’s money within the meaning of Rule 2 of the SAR and that accordingly, the Fourth Charge, which was premised on a breach of Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the SAR, had not been made out. The C3J therefore acquitted the Respondent of the Second and Fourth Charges. In respect of the First and Third Charges, the C3J ordered the Respondent to be suspended for four (4) years commencing 4 July 2024, with costs in the sum of $12,000 (inclusive of disbursements) be paid to the Law Society of Singapore, and for the costs order of the DT to remain.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Oct_24_Full_DT_report_-_Nedumaran_Muthukrishnan.pdf","pdf-content":"DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS\nUNDER THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT 1966\nDT/10/2022\nIN THE MATTER OF\nNEDUMARAN MUTHUKRISHNAN (FORMERLY\nOF N NEDUMARAN & CO)\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\nIN THE MATTER OF\nTHE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT (CHAPTER 161)\n\nREPORT OF DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nDISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nPRESIDENT: MR TAN KOK QUAN, SC\nADVOCATE & SOLICITOR: MR ANDREW CHAN\n\nTEO YIHUI\n\nNEDUMARAN MUTHUKRISHNAN\n(FORMERLY OF N NEDUMARAN & CO)\n\nPOINTER LLC\n144 ROBINSON ROAD\n#18-01\nROBINSON SQUARE\nCEDAR SUITES\nSINGAPORE 068908\n\nRESPONDENT-IN-PERSON\n\nCounsel for the\nLaw Society of Singapore\nDated this 18th day of September 2023\n\n\fBackground Facts\n1.\n\nThe Complainant is Mr Chan Yee Huat (the “Complainant”). During the period 2013 to 2019\nhe was a client of Mr Nedumaran Muthukrishnan (the “Respondent”).\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent was called to the Bar on 25 May 1996 and at the material time was\npractising at the law firm of Messrs M Nedumaran & Co. However, the Respondent has not\nheld a practising certificate since April 2020.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent was engaged to represent the Complainant as well as members of his\nfamily in various lawsuits involving various insurance companies in respect of health\nissues, traffic accidents and home accidents. The claims in which the Complainant was the\nplaintiff included HC/S 324/2016, HC/S 325/2016 and HC/S 52/2017.\n\n4.\n\nJudgements (by consent) were entered for the Complainant in HC/S 324/2016 on 3 October\n2017 and in HC/S 325/2016 on 10 October 2017.\n\n5.\n\nThe defendant in HC/S 324/2016 was ordered, inter alia, to pay to the Complainant:\na.\nb.\nc.\n\n6.\n\n$120,000 (inclusive of $20,000 as interim payment) being $100,000 in general\ndamages and $20,000 in special damages;\nCosts and disbursements to be agreed or taxed; and\nThe disbursements included $225.00 being the Public Trustee fees.\n\nThe defendant in HC/S 325/2016 was ordered, inter alia, to pay to the Complainant:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\n\n$660,000 (inclusive of $170,000 as interim payment), being $260,000 in general\ndamages, and $400,000 in special damages;\nCosts at $55,000;\nDisbursements to be agreed or taxed; and\nThe disbursements included $225.00 being the Public Trustee fees.\n\n7.\n\nThe Complainant was made a bankrupt on 13 November 2017 and Mdm Yvonne Hill was\nappointed his private trustee in bankruptcy (the “Private Trustee”).\n\n8.\n\nAt the Respondent’s request, a part of the judgement sums amounting to approximately\n$160,395.96 (the “$160k”) was paid to the Respondent’s law firm.\n\n9.\n\nBetween February to April 2020, the Complainant instructed the Respondent on numerous\noccasions to utilise the $160k to pay various persons nominated by the Complainant.\n\n10.\n\nBy way of emails between March and April 2020, the Respondent assured the Complainant\nor gave him the impression that the Respondent would be making the payments shortly or\nhad already made the payments to the nominated persons from the $160k.\n\n11.\n\nHowever, notwithstanding his assurances, the Respondent did not make any payments to\nthe nominated persons. Neither did the Respondent inform and/or account to the\nComplainant as to how the Respondent utilised the $160k.\n1\n\n\f12.\n\nOn 18 October 2021, the Respondent admitted to the Inquiry Committee that when he issued\nthe emails he had already set off the $160k against his legal fees and costs. However, no\ninvoice was ever issued to the Complainant in respect of the $160k or any part of it that was\nallegedly set off.\n\nThe Charges dated 5 September 2022.\n13.\n\nIn the Statement of the Case (“SOC”) dated 3 June 2022, the Law Society formulated 4\nCharges (and Alternative Charges) against the Respondent. Except for the 3rd Charge (and\nAlternative 3rd Charge), the 1st, 2nd and 4th Charges (and each of their Alternative\nCharges) were on 5 September 2022 amended, with the leave of this Tribunal.\n\n14.\n\nThe Charges which the Law Society proceeded against the Respondent at the hearing on 11\nNovember 2022, 9 & 14 December 2022 were as follows:\na.\n\nThe Amended 1st Charge and Alternative Amended 1st Charge concerned the\nRespondent not being honest in his dealings with the Complainant in that he misled\nthe Complainant into believing that he had posted or would shortly be posting and/or\nhand delivering cheques to pay the persons nominated by the Complainant, in breach\nof Rules 5(2)(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the\n“PCR”);\n\nb.\n\nThe Amended 2nd Charge and Alternative Amended 2nd Charge also concerned the\nRespondent not being honest in his dealings with the Complainant in that he applied\nvarious sums received on behalf of the Complainant to his legal fees and costs without\nobtaining the Complainant’s prior consent and/or without first informing him, in breach\nof Rule 5(2)(a) of the PCR;\n\nc.\n\nThe 3rd Charge and Alternative 3rd Charge concerned the Respondent’s failure to\ninform the Complainant of the basis on which his professional fees would be charged\nand the manner in which his professional fees and disbursements would be paid in\nbreach of Rule (17)(3)(a) of the PCR;\n\nd.\n\nThe Amended 4th Charge and Alternative Amended 4th Charge concerned the\nRespondent’s failure to issue any bill of costs or written intimidation of the amount of\nlegal costs incurred as well as for failing to notify the Complainant that he would be\nwithdrawing client’s money from client’s account in satisfaction of his legal costs in\nbreach of Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the Legal Profession (Solicitor’s Accounts) Rules (the\n“SAR”).\n\nThe Defence\n15.\n\nIn his Amended Defence No.1 filed on 23 September 2022 the Respondent alleged that the\nComplainant was lying and abusing the due process of the law, including the disciplinary\nprocess. No or limited particulars were provided. He further denied (again without any\nparticulars) all allegations in the SOC “as if the same were set forth seriatim and traversed\nseparately”.\n2\n\n\f16.\n\nIn his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) affirmed on 11 November 2022, the Respondent\nalleged that:\na.\n\nThe claims he was handling related to the Complainant, his wife and his brother;\n\nb.\n\nThey related to multiple road and other accidents, illnesses, hospitalisations and\nmedical leaves and ran into double digit millions of dollars;\n\nc.\n\nAll claims were based on tens of insurance policies;\n\nd.\n\nThere were hundreds of claims filed running into thousands of days of hospitalisations\nand medical leaves;\n\ne.\n\nHe attended numerous hearings, CDRs, interlocutory applications regarding the\nnumerous claims.\n\nf.\n\nAs the Complainant was impecunious, he felt sorry for the Complainant and he took\nonly what the Complainant could pay and when he could pay;\n\ng.\n\nFrom whatever the Complainant paid, he would partly apply for his fees and\ndisbursements;\n\nh.\n\nWhen he did not have enough, he would request the Complainant to pay for the\ndisbursements;\n\ni.\n\nThe Complainant precisely knew the details of the monies paid to him or received by\nhim from third parties like insurers and/or their lawyers;\n\nj.\n\nAt all times the Complainant knew exactly what he paid and for what; and\n\nk.\n\nThe Complainant always maintained proper report of figures.\n\nThe Hearing\n17.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent cross-examined the Complainant extensively relating to the\nComplainant’s credibility which as the Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”) pointed out to him was not\nthe issue relating to the 4 Charges or their alternatives.\n\nLaw Society’s Application to Amend the Charges\n18.\n\nAfter the close of hearing on 14 December 2022, Counsel for the Law Society indicated that\nshe was taking instructions and might be amending the SOC, in particular the Charges. On\n26 January 2023, the DT heard Law Society’s application to amend the SOC and the Charges.\nThe Law Society’s reasons for the amendments were that they related to\n3\n\n\fclarifications/admissions made by the Respondent during the hearing on 14 December 2022\nconcerning:\n\n19.\n\na.\n\nThe Amended 1st Charge/Alternative Amended 1st Charge, the time frame within\nwhich the Respondent informed the Complainant that he had already posted and/or\nhand delivered cheques for the payment to the various payees nominated by the\nComplainant;\n\nb.\n\nThe Amended 2nd Charge/Alternative Amended 2nd Charge, how and when the\nRespondent had set off the sum of $160,395.96 (the “Sum”) against his professional\nfees and costs; and\n\nc.\n\nThe Amended 4th Charge/Alternative Amended 4th Charge, how the Respondent had\nset off the Sum against his professional fees and costs.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the amendments on the grounds:\na.\n\nThat they were made very late as the information was available or within the knowledge\nof the Complainant/Law Society;\n\nb.\n\nNo reasons were given for the lateness of the amendments; and\n\nc.\n\nIn this case the credibility of witnesses is critical and the Complainant is a liar.\n\n20.\n\nAfter hearing both Counsel and considering their submissions, the DT allowed the Law\nSociety’s application to amend the SOC and Charges. We further gave leave to the\nRespondent to amend his Defence as a result of the Law Society’s amendments and allowed\neach party to file a further list of documents, if necessary.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent filed his Amended Defence on 16 February 2023 and a further pre-hearing\nconference (“PHC”) was held on 13 April 2023. At the PHC, Law Society confirmed that it\nhas no further list of documents to file. On 22 March 2023, the Respondent wanted to file his\nlist containing 1037 new items and 14 separate emails. It was not in the usual format and\nCounsel for the Law Society as well as the DT could not access any of these documents. On\n27 March 2023, the DT directed the Respondent to file and serve his List of Documents\n(“LOD”) in the correct format. The Respondent was also directed to file and serve copies of\nhis documents listed in his LOD in PDF format. The Respondent, thereafter, filed his LOD by\nway of a Google spreadsheet and copies of the documents listed in the LOD by way of a\nGoogle spreadsheet with links. There were 2626 links in the Respondent’s Google\nspreadsheet of 3 April 2023 and neither Counsel for the Law Society, nor the DT or\nits Secretariat could access any of the documents.\n\n22.\n\nThe DT then directed the Respondent to file and serve 3 sets of hard copies of his documents\nby 10 April 2023 failing which the DT would not be considering these documents. The\nRespondent did not comply with this direction and at the PHC on 27 April 2023, the DT\ninformed him that his new documents were not admitted.\n\n4\n\n\f23.\n\nAs a result of the Amended SOC and Charges, the Respondent applied to recall the\nComplainant for further cross-examination. When asked for the reasons for his\napplication, the Respondent admitted that his whole defence to the Charges is that the\nComplainant is a liar and he wanted to recall the Complainant to cross-examine him and\nshow that the Complainant cannot be believed and for that reason the Charges should be\ndismissed. In other words, the reason for recall is essentially to only further test the credibility\nof the Complainant and nothing more.\n\n24.\n\nWe dismissed the Respondent’s application to recall the Complainant as the Complainant in\nhis affidavit affirmed on 15 April 2023, stated that he “has no knowledge of the reasons for\nand/or behind the Law Society’s various Amendments to the SOC and Charges over the\ncourse of DT10/2022” and credibility of the Complainant is not relevant to the 4 Amended\nCharges and their Alternative Amended Charges.\n\nThe Complainant’s Bankruptcy\n25.\n\nAlthough it was not raised by the Respondent, the DT asked Counsel for the Law Society\nand the Respondent to address the issue of whether the bankruptcy of the Complainant in\nany manner affects this proceeding and his capacity to give instructions/directions on\nthe $160k.\n\n26.\n\nSection 78 of the then applicable Bankruptcy Act (“BA”) sets out the description of a\nbankrupt's property divisible amongst creditors:\n78. — (1) The property of the bankrupt divisible among his creditors\n(referred to in this Act as the bankrupt's estate) shall comprise —\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nall such property as belongs to or is vested in the bankrupt at the\ncommencement of his bankruptcy or is acquired by or devolves\non him before his discharge; and\nthe capacity to exercise and to take proceedings for exercising\nall such powers in or over or in respect of property as might have\nbeen exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit at the\ncommencement of his bankruptcy or before his discharge.\n\n(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply to (a)\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nproperty held by the bankrupt on trust for any other person;\nsuch tools, books, vehicles and other items of equipment as are\nneeded by the bankrupt for the bankrupt’s personal use in the\nbankrupt’s employment, business or vocation;\nsuch clothing, bedding, furniture, household equipment and\nprovisions as are necessary for satisfying the basic domestic\nneeds of the bankrupt and his family; and\nproperty of the bankrupt which is excluded under any other written\nlaw …\n\n5\n\n\f27.\n\nAccording to Section 2(1) of the BA, “property” of the bankrupt:\n“includes money, goods, things in action, land and every description of\nproperty wherever situated and also obligations and every description of\ninterest, whether present or future or vested contingent, arising out of or\nincidental to, property.”\n\n28.\n\nThe definition of \"property” at Section 2(1) of the BA does not encompass choses in action\nin respect of personal injury to the bankrupt, as well as damages recovered as compensation\nthereto.\n\n29.\n\nWith respect to the former, this is provided for at Section 131 of the BA, which stipulates that\na bankrupt is subject to certain disabilities whilst he is yet undischarged. These disabilities\nrelate to his incompetency to maintain any legal action without previous sanction of the\nOfficial Assignee, save for an action for injury to his person.\n“Disabilities of bankrupt\n131.---(1) Where a bankrupt has not obtained his discharge —\n(a)\n\nhe shall be incompetent to maintain any action, other than an\naction for damages in respect of an injury to his person,\nwithout the previous sanction of the Official Assignee; and\n\n(b)\n\nhe shall not leave, remain or reside outside Singapore without the\nprevious permission of the Official Assignee.”\n[Emphasis Added]\n\n30.\n\nThe rationale behind the special carve out for personal injury actions was succinctly\nexplained in the Court of Appeal case of Standard Chartered Bank v Loh Chong Yong\nThomas [2010] 2 SLR 569 (\"Thomas Low”).\n\n31.\n\nIn Thomas Low, the Court of Appeal recognised at [12] that Section 2(1) of the BA was in\npari materia with the definition of \"property\" at s 436 of England's Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45)\n(UK) (the “lA\"), and observed that cases over the years have not considered damages\nrecovered pursuant a personal injury action to be \"property\" of a bankrupt.\n\n32.\n\nThe Court of Appeal cited with approval at [13] – [14] the decision of Hoffmann L.J. in Heath\nv. Tang [1993] 1 W.L.R. 1421, 1423, as follows:\n“The property which vests in the trustee includes ‘things in action’ [see section\n436 [of the IA]. Despite the breadth of this definition, there are certain\ncauses of action personal to the bankrupt which do not vest in his\ntrustee. These include cases in which the damages are to be estimated\nby immediate reference to pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of his body,\nmind, or character, and without immediate reference to his rights of\nproperty:’ see Beckham v. Drake (1849) 2 H.L. Cas. 579, 604, per Erle J. and\nWilson v. United Counties Bank Ltd. [1920] A.C. 102.\n…\nSection 436 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c 45) (UK)1 is not in truth a\ndefinition of the word ‘property.’ It only sets out what is included.\n\n6\n\n\fAs will appear later from the cases that have been decided over many\nyears, actions which relate to a bankrupt’s personal reputation or body\nhave not been considered to be property and therefore they do not vest\nin anybody other than the bankrupt. They relate solely to his body, mind\nand character and any damages recovered are compensation for damage\nto his body, mind and character as opposed to other causes of action\nwhich have been considered to be a right of property. Thus causes of\naction to recover damages for pain and suffering have been held not to vest\nin the trustee….\n[Emphasis Added]\n\n33.\n\nIn the circumstances, we are satisfied that the $160K, being compensation or damages\nobtained pursuant to the Complainant’s personal injury lawsuits in HC/S 324/2015 and HC/S\n325/2015 in respect of personal injuries suffered by the Complainant, are excluded from the\nproperty that is divisible amongst his creditors pursuant to Section 78 of the BA and the\nComplainant was always at liberty to utilise the monies at his sole discretion, including giving\ninstructions and / or directions to the Respondent concerning the use of the same.\n\nThe Charges against the Respondent\n34.\n\nOn 4 June 2022, the Law Society formulated 4 charges under Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Chapter 161) (“LPA”) and 4 Alternative Charges under Section 83(2)(h) of\nthe LPA. All 4 Charges and Alternative Charges concern the Respondent’s breach of various\nrules under the PCR and Legal Profession (Solicitor’s Accounts) Rules (the “SAR”) of the\nLPA.\n\n35.\n\nOn 5 September 2022 with the leave of the DT the 1st, 2nd and 4th Charges were amended.\nOn 26 January 2023, the 3 amended Charges and Alternative Amended Charges and the 3rd\nCharge and Alternative 3rd Charge were as follows:\n\n1st CHARGE\nYou, Nedumaran Muthukrishnan, are charged that you, as an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, did act in breach of Rule 5(2)(a) of the

Client had nominated and/or shortly intended to make\npayment of the Sum (or part thereof) to, in circumstances when you did not do so and/or\nhad no intention to of doing do so, and as such, you are thereby guilty of improper conduct\nor practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Chapter 161).\n7\n\n\f(Alternative Charge: 1st Charge)\nYou, Nedumaran Muthukrishnan, are charged that you, as an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, did act in breach of Rule 5(2)(a) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) to wit, you were\nnot honest in your dealings with your client, Chan Yee Huat (“Your Client”) in that between\nthe period of 17 March 2020 and

or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of\nthe Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).\n\n2nd CHARGE\nYou, Nedumaran Muthukrishnan, are charged that you, as an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, did act in breach of Rule 5(2)(a) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap161), to wit,

the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).\nThe Respondent’s Amended Defence:\n36.\n\nThe Respondent’s defence, as can be gathered from his Amended Defence, AEIC, questions\nput to the Complainant and his replies to the DT when the DT sought clarification from him\nwere:\na.\n\nThe Complainant, Mr Chan is a liar and cannot be believed;\n\nb.\n\nHe is lying in his complaint dated 26 April 2021;\n\nc.\n\nThe Respondent is entitled to set off the $160k against his professional legal fees and\ncosts; and\n\nd.\n\nThe Complainant was aware of the set off.\n\n37.\n\nThe Amended Defence and AEIC filed by the Respondent were bare allegations and denials\nwithout any particulars or contemporaneous documents adduced by the Respondent in\nsupport.\n\n38.\n\nThe relevant paragraphs of the Respondent’s Amended Defence are as follows:\n\n10\n\n\fa.\n\n“The Complainant (“Chan”) is lying and is abusing the due process of the law, including\nthe disciplinary process.”\n\nb.\n\n“38 39The Respondent will also aver that the Law Society had confirmed at the PHC\nof 29.8.2022 that Chan is allegedly unaware of the exact amount in question. In this\nregard, it will be averred that, inter alia, Chan is being inconsistent or non-committal\nbecause he was/is at all material times lying.”\n\nc.\n\n“39. Further or in the alternative, as regards paragraph 13 of the SOC (Amendment No.\n2). the Respondent will aver that Chan is a liar and is misleading the DT that the\nRespondent only handled a handful of cases to give the false impression that monies\ndue to him (and his family) who have still not settled the full legal fee of the Respondent\nfor handling the multitude of cases from 2012/2013 to 2019 and Chan (and his wife)\ndisappeared in late 2019 without paying the Respondent his full legal fees and\ndisbursements as pleaded at, inter alia, paragraph 34 herein above and Chan (and his\nwife) is/are fully aware of this at all material times.”\n\nd.\n\n40. Further or in the alternative, as regards paragraph 13 of the SOC (Amendment\nNo.2) the Respondent will aver that Chan (and his wife) were at all material times knew\nof and/or were aware of and/or had prior knowledge of and/or had consented to the set\noffs including those pleaded by the Law Society at paragraph 13 of the SOC\n(Amendment No.2) and that they also knew at all material times that they had not fully\npaid the Respondent all his legal fees and disbursements for all the work that he had\ndone/incurred from 2012/2013 to 2019.\n\ne.\n\n41. Further and/or in support of the Defence filed herein, the Respondent will refer to\nall his responses to the Law Society written and oral including those responses given\nby the Respondent at the Inquiry Committee hearing on 18 October 2022 and save as\nalleged herein the Respondent denies all allegations contained in the Case Statement\nas if the same were set forth seriatim and traversed separately.\n\nLegal Principles\n39.\n\nA breach of Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA arises inter alia if the Respondent is guilty of a breach\nof any rule of conduct under the PCR which \"amounts to improper conduct or practice as an\nadvocate and solicitor\".\n\n40.\n\nThe standard of professionalism of an advocate and solicitor is an objective one, determined\nby the Court: see Law Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar Naidu [2012] 4 SLR 1232 at [43].\nTo determine whether an advocate and solicitor has complied with the relevant rules under\nthe PCR, the solicitor's conduct will be assessed against what a reasonably competent\nadvocate and solicitor would have done, taking into account the particular circumstances of\nthe case, the context of time and deadline pressures.\n\n41.\n\nThe key question is thus whether the standards applied and skills discharged by the advocate\nand solicitor in question are consistent with the legal profession's presumed responsibilities\n11\n\n\fand obligations to its clients: see Lie Hendri Rusli v Wong Tan & Molly Lim [2004] 4 SLR(R)\n594 at [44].\n42.\n\nUltimately, no single touchstone will be conclusive in determining the existence and extent of\na solicitor's duty in any given matrix; the application of these overarching principles must be\nundergirded by pragmatism and reality.\n\n43.\n\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA has been held to be a \"catch-all provision\" which can be invoked\nwhen the conduct does not fall within any of the other enumerated grounds in Section 83 of\nthe LPA but is nevertheless considered unacceptable: see Ng Chee Sing v Law Society of\nSingapore [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 (“Ng Chee Sing”) at [40].\n\n44.\n\nTo make out a charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, it is sufficient to show that a solicitor\nis guilty of conduct which \"brings discredit to a respondent as an advocate and solicitor or on\nthe legal profession as a whole\" (see The Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer\n[2019] SGDT 416 at [9]) or \"render[s] him unfit to remain as a member of an honourable\nprofession\" (see Ng Chee Sing at [40]).\n\n45.\n\nA practical test for whether such misconduct is made out is to ask \"if reasonable people, on\nhearing about what [the respondent] has done, would have said without hesitation that as\n[an advocate and solicitor] he should not have done it”. This is an objective standard\ndetermined by the Court, and not based on the standard of peer judgment: Ng Chee Sing at\n[41]-[42]. The totality of the solicitor's conduct and the whole course of events must be taken\ninto account in this analysis: see The Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o\nDaniel [2009] SGDT 6 at [19].\n\n46.\n\nA charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA is made out if the advocate and solicitor’s\nmisconduct is “not sufficiently serious to be considered as ‘grossly improper’ but which may\nbe described as ‘unbefitting’ an advocate and solicitor”: see The Law Society of Singapore v\nSidambaram Uthayasurian [2009] SGDSC 1 at [28]. Accordingly, it follows that the standard\nof misconduct required to make out a charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA is less strict\nthan the standard of “grossly improper conduct” required under Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\nThe DT’s Findings\n\nAmended 1st Charge and Amended Alternative 1st Charge:\n47.\n\nThe Amended 1st Charge concerns improper conduct and practice as an advocate and\nsolicitor under Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA read with Rule 5(2)(a) of the PCR, which requires\nthat an Advocate and Solicitor must \"be honest in all the legal practitioner's dealings with his\nor her client.”\n\n48.\n\nThe Amended 1st Alternative Charge concerns \"misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or a member of an honourable profession under\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\"\n12\n\n\f49.\n\nOne of the guiding principles of rule 5 of the PCR requires that \"the relationship between a\nlegal practitioner and his or her client imports a duty to be honest in all dealings with the\nclient.” In addition, and as stated by the learned author of Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015: A Commentary:\n“The primary precepts which flow from the principle of honesty set out in rule\n5(1)(a) of the PCR in the context of the lawyer and client relationship may be\nexpressed as follows: (a) the solicitor must be honest in all his dealings with\nhis client and maintain a relationship of trust and confidence which the\nclient is entitled to expect and on which he relies (b) he is accountable to\nthe client for any money or other property with which he has been entrusted\nor for which he has been made responsible (c) he must be scrupulously fair\nin the manner he charges his clients for his services.\"\n[Emphasis Added]\n\n50.\n\nThe following facts were undisputed/admitted by the Respondent:\na.\n\nThe Complainant was a client of the Respondent and that on behalf of his client, the\nRespondent received the sum of $58,393.13 in HC/S 324/2016 on or about 4 May 2018\nand the sum of $102,002.83 in HC/S 325/2016 on or about 6 December 2016\namounting to a total of $160,395.96 (the $160k).\n\nb.\n\nThe Complainant instructed the Respondent to make payment from the $160k to\nvarious persons he nominated, namely, his private trustee, various doctors and his\nprevious solicitor (collectively the “payees”) by way of multiple emails to the\nRespondent from 3 February 2020 to17 April 2020.\n\nc.\n\nThe Respondent represented to the Complainant by his multiple emails between 17\nMarch 2020 to 17 April 2020 that he had posted or would shortly be posting or handdelivering cheques for payment to the payees.\n\nd.\n\nDespite the Respondent’s representation, he never posted or hand-delivered the\ncheques to the payees, nor made any payment to the payees in any other form.\n\ne.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2019 (i.e., prior to sending the emails to the Complainant between\nMarch 2020 and April 2020), he had already set off the sum against his professional\nlegal fees and costs.\n\nf.\n\nThe Respondent misled/misrepresented to the Complainant when he sent the emails\nbecause the Respondent “just wanted to piss off” the Complainant.\n\ng.\n\nThe Respondent further admitted that on hindsight his deliberate misleading of the\nComplainant was poor judgement on his part.\n\nh.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, the Respondent clarified that the $160k was professional\nlegal fees and costs due and owing to him.\n\n13\n\n\f51.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent was not honest in his dealings with the Complainant and had strung\nthe Complainant along by falsely and deliberately concealing the truth from him over a period\nof one month as he on his own case had already set off the $160k against his legal fees and\ncosts. In this connection, the Respondent accepts that he received the $160k and it is clear\nthat he mispresented and misled the Complainant in flagrant breach of his duties to be honest\nin all his dealings with his client and to maintain a relationship of trust and confidence which\nthe client was entitled to expect and on which he relied.\n\n52.\n\nIn the circumstances the DT finds the Respondent guilty of the Amended 1st Charge and the\nAmended 1st Alternative Charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The Respondent was not\nhonest in his dealings with the Complainant, and between 17 March 2020 and 17 April 2020,\nhe misled the Complainant into believing that he had or shortly would be posting and/or handdelivering cheques for the payment of persons nominated by the Complainant when the\nRespondent did not do so and/or had no intention of doing so.\n\nAmended 2nd Charge and Amended Alternative 2nd Charge\n53.\n\nThe issue in these charges relate to whether the Respondent, when he applied the $160k\ntowards the settlement of his legal fees and costs, obtained the Complainant’s prior consent\nand/or first informed the Complainant of his intention to utilise the $160k in such manner.\n\n54.\n\nAs stated above a solicitor’s duty of honesty extends to being accountable to his client for\nany money or other property with which he has been entrusted or for which he has been\nmade responsible.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent admitted that prior to issuing the emails (referred to in the Amended 1st\nCharge and Amended 1st Alternative Charge) to the Complainant he had already set off the\n$160k against his professional legal fees and costs in the period 2017 to 2019.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent further made the bare allegation that the Complainant must have been\naware of it as the Complainant was in the Respondent‘s office “every day”. The DT does not\nunderstand how the Complainant by being in the Respondent‘s office every day could\nactually know that the $160k was set off by the Respondent against his professional legal\nfees and costs. Further even if the Complainant somehow became aware of the set off, that\ndid not or in any way lessen the Respondent’s duty of honesty to the client to expressly\naccount for the set off of the $160k.\n\n57.\n\nIn any event, the Complainant denied any knowledge of the set off.\nCross-Examination of the Complainant on 11 November 2022 at page 102:\nQ:\n\nAnd that---I now put it to you that that somebody, that is me, had obtained your consent before\napplication of the 160,000.\n\nA:\n\nNo, Sir\n\nQ:\n\nI put it to you that that somebody from whom that knowledge had gone to your and your wife,\nthat is me, had informed you and your wife with regard to this. \"Yes\" or \"No\"?\n\n14\n\n\fA:\n\nNo, Sir.\n\n…\n\n58.\n\n59.\n\nQ:\n\n..I put it to you that no bill of costs or other written intimation of the amount was delivered to you\nbecause you, at all material times, knew about it---knew about how the monies were applied.\n\"Yes\" or \"No\"?\n\nA:\n\nCan I clarity your question? Apply to what?\n\nQ:\n\nApplied, with respect to my $500,000-odd legal fees.\n\nA:\n\nNo, Sir.\n\nThat the Respondent had never informed the Complainant when he set off the $160k in 2017\nto 2019 is further supported by the following:\na.\n\nThe Respondent has not adduced any contemporaneous documents to evidence the\nfact that he had informed the Complainant of the set off which he alleged was in the\nperiod 2017 to 2019.\n\nb.\n\nNeither has he alleged any prior oral conversation when he informed the Complainant\nof the set off.\n\nc.\n\nThe fact that the Respondent sent the emails referred to in the Amended 1st Charge\nand Amended 1st Alternative Charge suggests that the Complainant was never\ninformed of the intention to set-off. Accordingly, no consent could have been obtained\nto such set-off.\n\nFurther the Respondent was dishonest when he failed to inform or to obtain the\nComplainant’s prior consent to set off the $160k for the following reasons:\na.\n\nThe Respondent concealed that he had set off an amount and only revealed it for the\nvery first time before the Inquiry Committee in spite of the Complainant’s demand to\nknow what had become of the monies received by him in his emails to the Respondent\nin February to April 2020.\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent did not produce any invoice or breakdown of his legal fees in respect\nof the set-off.\n\n60.\n\nAlso, the cross examination as a whole suggests that the Complainant was never told about\nthe set-off prior to it being effected. This explains why much time was spent as whether the\nComplainant knew what the monies were used for. If the Respondent had informed the\nComplainant that the monies were to be set and had obtained the consent of the Complainant\nprior to set-off, the DT would have expected this point be raised in the defence and the AEIC.\n\n61.\n\nIn the circumstances, the DT finds the Respondent guilty of the Amended 2nd Charge and the\nAmended 2nd Alternative Charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The Respondent was not\nhonest in his dealings with his client, the Complainant, when he applied the $160k towards\n15\n\n\fthe settlement of his professional legal fees and costs without obtaining the Complainant‘s\nprior consent and/or without first informing the Complainant of his intention to do so.\n\nThe 3rd Charge and Alternative 3rd Charge\n62.\n\nThe 3rd Charge and the Alternative 3rd Charge concerns improper conduct and practice as\nan advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(b) or alternatively Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA\nread with Rule 17(3)(a) of the PCR, which requires that a solicitor informs his client of the\nbasis on which his professional legal fees would be charged and the manner in which his\nfees and disbursements would be paid.\n\n63.\n\nRule 17 of the PCR states that: “A legal practitioner must act in the best interests of his or\nher client, and must charge the client fairly for work done”.\n\n64.\n\nFurther, and as stated by the learned author of Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules 2015: A Commentary at [17.023]:\n“...The client must be fully informed so that he is absolutely clear about the\nextent of his actual or potential liability for fees and expenses related to\n[the solicitor’s] retainer. The [solicitor] must be entirely transparent and\nclearly explain the basis of the fees, disbursements, and any other\nnecessary and foreseeable payments... regarding the basis on which\nfees are charged... if a time-based rate (hourly rate) applies (as is a common\npractice), the client should be informed that the rate applies to all time spent\nin the conduct of the retainer (if this is the agreement), whether it concerns\nlegal research, communications, correspondence, attendance at meetings or\nany other form of engagement. Such information is important to the client\nbecause it gives him a measure of control in deciding the type and extent of\nwork he wants the legal practitioner to undertake. Indeed, this is consistent\nwith the lawyer’s responsibility to evaluate with a client whether the\nconsequence of a matter justifies the expense or the risk involved ...”\n[Emphasis Added]\n\n65.\n\nIn the case of Legis Point LLC v Tay Choon Ai [2008] 3 SLR 1269 at [69], the Court observed\nthat:\n\"The onus should be on law firms to make their fee arrangements clear\nand unambiguous, and it would be improper and unsatisfactory outcome if\nlaw firms could simply take undue advantage of ambiguities in their fee\nagreements by insisting on their interpretation of the fees at the close of the\nsolicitor-client relationship.\"\n[Emphasis Added]\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent has not produced any evidence regarding the basis on which his\nprofessional legal fees would be charged. Apart from one invoice which the Respondent said\nhe issued in 2013, no further invoices were issued by the Respondent to the Complainant.\nIn his evidence, the Respondent said he “only took what (the Complainant) can pay as and\nwhen he can pay”.\n\n16\n\n\f67.\n\nThe Respondent's bare and bald defence and contention at the hearing (which was not\npleaded in his Defence) was that a breakdown of the work he had done and time spent was\npreviously given to the Complainant, and that \"it is a breakdown that [the Respondent and\nthe Complainant] actually [went] through together”.\n\n68.\n\nThe Complainant’s evidence is that he does not recall signing any Letter of Engagement and\nWarrant to Act with the Respondent. The Respondent has also completely failed to produce\nany such Letter of Engagement and Warrant to Act (which document would have set out the\nbasis for his legal fees) in the course of these proceedings.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent has previously taken the position before the Inquiry Committee that “what\nthe Complainant owed him was more than what [the Respondent] owed the Complainant”.\nThe Respondent subsequently affirmed this position during his cross-examination.\nNotwithstanding this, the Respondent has at all material times been unable to adduce any\nbreakdown to the Inquiry committee as well as the DT in the course of these proceedings to\ndemonstrate the basis for his aforesaid statement / position:\n\nCross-Examination Of the Respondent (on 14 December 2022 at page 177 of the transcripts):\nQ:\n\nMr Nedumaran, you've taken the position before the Inquiry Committee on 18th October 2021\nthat what Mr Chan owes you in terms of legal fees is more than what you owed him, am I right?\n\nA:\n\nWhat Mr Chan owes is more than what I owed him, yes.\n\nQ:\n\nYes, what Mr Chan owes you is more than what you owe him?\n\nA:\n\nYes.\n\nQ:\n\nYes, am I right? Yes. you also asked that the in---I mentioned this earlier, you were asked that\nthe inquiry committee hearing on 18th October and in a post-hearing even on the same day to\ngive an accounting to reconcile the legal fees that you claimed you set off against your legal\nfees---let me repeat that, sorry. You were asked to provide an accounting to reconcile the legal\nfees claimed and set off with the sums that you received from the---from Mr Chan, in particular,\nthe sums in Suit 324 and 325. And just now you confirmed that you did not give this accounting,\nright?\n\nA:\n\nYes.\n\nQ:\n\nNotwithstanding your belief that what the respondent---or rather, what Mr Chan owes you is\nmore than what you owe him, you have yet to provide the committee or this Tribunal of any\naccounting to substantiate this averment, am I right?\n\nA:\n\nYes.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent has not given any evidence as to the basis for his legal fee throughout the\ncourse of the proceedings. No accounting has also been provided by the Respondent todate.\n\n71.\n\nIn the circumstances the DT finds the Respondent guilty of the 3rd Charge and the 3rd\nAlternative Charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The Respondent failed to inform the\n17\n\n\fComplainant of the basis on which his fees for professional services would be charged and\nof the manner in which his fees and any disbursements were to be paid by the Complainant.\n\nAmended 4th Charge and Amended Alternative 4th Charge\n72.\n\nPursuant to Section 83(2)(b) or Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA read with Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the\nSAR, a solicitor must, before drawing any money from his client’s account any of his client’s\nmoney as properly required for or towards payment of the client’s costs, ensure that a bill of\ncosts or other written intimidation of the amount of costs incurred has been delivered to the\nclient and the client has been notified that money held for him will be applied towards or in\nsatisfaction of the solicitor’s costs.\n\n73.\n\nThe raison d'être for the Solicitors Accounts Rules was emphasised in the case of Law\nSociety of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena [2005] 4 SLR(R) 320 at [19]:\n\"Solicitors have been conferred a unique statutory privilege by Parliament for\nthe purpose of facilitating the efficient discharge of their professional duties.\nThey are allowed to hold moneys belonging to clients and third parties. This\nright in turn entails serious responsibilities. The public must be confident that\nmoneys held or maintained by solicitors will be adequately safeguarded and\nlegitimately disbursed at any cost. To this end, detailed accounting rules,\npractices and conventions have been put in place through subsidiary\nlegislation and practice directions. All practicing solicitors are ipso\nfacto subject to the Solicitors' Accounts Rules and other relevant rules\nmade pursuant to the LPA. The raison d'etre for these rules is clearly to\nprotect the public against any unauthorised use of money maintained\nby solicitors and to instill in the public confidence that the legal\nprofession is effectively regulated and policed. It is not enough that a\nsolicitor conducts himself honestly in relation to the discharge of his\nprofessional duties. A solicitor also has to discharge his obligations and\nresponsibilities competently and conscientiously. Observance of the\nrelevant accounting rules, practices and conventions is a fundamental\nobligation that all solicitors must observe as a condition for their\nprivilege to practise. We find an observation of Thomson CJ in In re\nA Solicitor (1962) 3 MC 323 at 323 apposite:\nThe legal profession enjoys very great privileges. In return for these\nprivileges they owe the public a duty and that duty involves not\nonly an extremely high standard or probity but a way of\nconducting business, and particularly business in relation to\nfinancial matters, which is beyond suspicion. In particular it is\nrequired, and it is part of the price the profession must pay for its\nprivileges, that separate accounts of solicitors money and clients'\nmoney should be kept.\"\n[Emphasis Added]\n\n74.\n\nThe following facts were undisputed and/or admitted by the Respondent during crossexamination on 14 December 2022:\n18\n\n\f75.\n\na.\n\nThe $160k was client’s money and paid into client’s account;\n\nb.\n\nThe Respondent used the $160k to pay his professional legal fees and costs; and\n\nc.\n\nThe Respondent did not issue any bill of costs or any written intimidation to the\nComplainant before withdrawing the $160k from his client’s account.\n\nIn the circumstances, the DT finds the Respondent guilty of the Amended 4th Charge and the\nAlternative Amended 4th Charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The Respondent has not\ncomplied with Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) of the SAR in that he withdrew the sum of S$160,395.96, being\nclient’s money, in satisfaction of his solicitor’s costs in circumstances where:\na.\n\nNo bill of costs or other written intimation of solicitor’s costs was delivered to the\nComplainant; and\n\nb.\n\nThe Complainant was not notified that the monetary sum would be applied towards or\nin satisfaction of the Respondent’s legal costs.\n\nWhether Cause of Sufficient Gravity exist for disciplinary action.\n76.\n\nThe powers that this DT may exercise are set out under Section 83 and 93 of the LPA:Section 83 of the LPA\n“(2) Subject to subsection (7), such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor\n–\n….\n(b) has been guilty of fraudulent or grossly improper conduct in the discharge of his or her professional\nduty or guilty of such a breach of any of the following as amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor:\n(i) any usage or rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under section\n71 or by the Council under the provisions of this Act;\n…\n(h) has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the\nSupreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession;\"\n[Emphasis Added]\nSection 93 of the LPA\n“(1) After hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary Tribunal must record its and\nfindings in relation to the facts of the case and according to those facts shall determine that (a) no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 or 83A (as the case\nmay be);\n\n19\n\n\f(b) while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 or 83A (as the\ncase may be), the regulated legal practitioner should be (i) ordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed;\n(ii) reprimanded;\n(iii) ordered to comply with one or more remedial measures; or\n(iv) subjected to the measure in sub-paragraph (iii) in addition to the measure in sub -paragraph\n(i) or (i); or\n(c) cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 or 83A (as the case may\nbe).\"\n\n77.\n\nThe DT may make the following findings under Sections 93(1)(a) – (c) of the LPA as set out\nas follows:\na.\n\nNo cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83;\n\nb.\n\nWhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under that section, the\nadvocate and solicitor should be reprimanded, ordered to pay a penalty sufficient and\nappropriate to the misconduct committed and/or ordered to comply with one or more\nremedial measures; or\n\nc.\n\nCause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83.\n\n78.\n\nA finding of cause of sufficient gravity is only in instances of the “most serious cases”: see\nLaw Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR 390 at [24].\n\n79.\n\nCause of sufficient gravity will be found if, on the totality of the facts and circumstances of\nthe case, the solicitor’s conduct was sufficiently serious to warrant the imposition of sanctions:\nsee Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju and another [2017] 4 SLR 1369\nat [30].\n\n80.\n\nMore recently, the Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat\nPaglar [2021] 4 SLR 382 expounded on the principles relating to when cause for sufficient\ngravity exists at [31] – [34]:\na.\n\nThe Respondent could only be held to account for the specific misconduct charged for.\nTo hold otherwise would be prejudicial to the respondent, since it is the charge that\ninforms a lawyer facing disciplinary proceedings of the case that he or she has to meet.\n\nb.\n\nWhere a charge does not contain an allegation of dishonest conduct, it is inappropriate\nto find cause for sufficient gravity on the basis of dishonesty.\n\nc.\n\nOnly the most serious cases are heard by a Court of Three Judges; the fact that a\nlawyer’s conduct falls within one or more of the limbs of Section 83(2) of the LPA does\nnot, without more, establish cause of sufficient gravity.\n20\n\n\f18th\n\nSeptember 2023.\n\n\f","timestamp":"2024-10-11T07:00:15+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2024/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Kwa Kim Li (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Kwa Kim Li (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint by Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling (the <strong>Complainants</strong>), both executors of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s estate, on 9 September 2019.

The Respondent solicitor is Ms Kwa Kim Li. The Respondent is a\npartner in the firm of M/s Lee & Lee, and is an advocate and solicitor of more than 40\nyears’ standing.\n\n2.\n\nThe Complaint covered various matters, which came before this Disciplinary Tribunal\nthrough different procedural routes.\n\nProcedural History\n\n3.\n\nIn the Complaint by LHY and LWL, there were four heads of complaint. These were:(a) First, that the Respondent had failed to follow the instructions of the late Mr Lee\nKuan Yew (the “Testator”) to destroy his superseded wills (the “First Complaint”);\n(b) Second, that the Respondent had breached privilege and her duties of\nconfidentiality by sending emails with records of communications with the Testator\nto Mr Lee Hsien Loong (“LHL”) who was not an executor of the estate of the\nTestator (the “Estate”) (the “Second Complaint”);\n(c) Third, that the Respondent had failed to keep proper contemporaneous notes and\nrecords of all the advice given to and instructions received from the Testator (the\n“Third Complaint”); and\n(d) Fourth, that the Respondent had given false and misleading information to the\nexecutors in her emails of 4 June 2015 and 22 June 2015 (the “Fourth\nComplaint”).\n\n4.\n\nAfter consideration of the Complaint by the Review Committee, the Inquiry Committee\nand the Council of the Law Society (the “Council”), the Council determined, pursuant\nto section 87 of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (the “LPA”), that there should be a\nformal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal of only the Second Complaint. Two\ncharges were framed in relation to the Second Complaint, both framed with alternative\ncharges. The Council accordingly applied to the Chief Justice, pursuant to section 89\nof the LPA, to appoint a Disciplinary Tribunal to hear and investigate the matter. The\nStatement of Case prepared by the Law Society of Singapore (the “LSS”), containing\n1\n\n\fthe two charges and the alternatives charges, is attached as Annex A. These charges\nare referred to as the LSS Charges.\n\n5.\n\nLHY and LWL were dissatisfied with the determination of the Council in relation to\nthose parts of the Complaint that were not referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal for formal\ninvestigation. They applied to the High Court, pursuant to section 96 of the LPA, for an\norder directing the LSS to apply to the Chief Justice to the appointment of a\nDisciplinary Tribunal in respect of those matters also. As a result of that application, an\norder was made, pursuant to section 96 of the LPA, that the LSS apply to the Chief\nJustice for the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal in relation to the First and the\nFourth Complaint (in addition to the Second Complaint).\n\n6.\n\nUpon appeal by the LSS from the order made by the High Court, the Court of Appeal\nheld inter alia that there was no prima facie case in relation to the First Complaint and\nheld that the First Complaint should not be referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal for formal\ninvestigation.\n\n7.\n\nAs provided under section 97(5) of the LPA, LHY and LWL, as the complainants who\nhad obtained the order in respect of the Fourth Complaint, were to have conduct of the\nproceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal in relation to the charges brought in\nrelation to the Fourth Complaint. Subsequently the order was varied such that only\nLHY would have such conduct. The Statement of Case prepared by LHY (the\n“Complainant”), containing the additional charge, is attached as Annex B. The charge\ncontained therein is referred to as the Complainant’s Charge.\n\n8.\n\nThe LSS retained conduct of the charges brought under the Second Complaint.\n\n9.\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal 19 of 2022 (the “DT” or “DT 19”) was appointed to hear the\nmatters arising from both the LSS and the Complainant’s Statements of Case\n(comprising the Second and Fourth Complaints respectively). Mr R S Bajwa acted for\nthe LSS and Mr Abraham Vergis SC acted for the Complainant. Mr Cavinder Bull SC\nacted for the Respondent in both matters. In this Report, the following terminology will\nbe used hereafter:\n(a)\n\nStatement of Case filed by the LSS (Annex A) - LSS SOC;\n\n(b)\n\nStatement of Case filed by LHY (Annex B) - Complainant’s SOC;\n\n(c)\n\nDefence of the Respondent to Complainant’s SOC (Annex C)- Defence to\nComplainant’s SOC.\n2\n\n\fBackground to the matters before the DT\n\n10.\n\nLHY and LWL are the two younger children of the Testator and the trustees and\nexecutors of the Estate. The Testator’s eldest child is LHL, the current Prime Minister\nof Singapore. The Testator was the first Prime Minister of Singapore and widely\nacclaimed and acknowledged as the father of Singapore as a nation. The Respondent\nhad acted as the Testator’s solicitor over many years. In particular, the Respondent\nhad acted in relation to the preparation of six wills for the Testator, from 20 August\n2011 to 2 November 2012.\n\n11.\n\nOn 29 November 2013, the Testator contacted the Respondent regarding certain\ntestamentary matters. Communications continued by way of emails, and possibly by\nway of conversations, up to 13 December 2013. The nature of these communications\nand the Respondent’s characterisation of these communications are apposite to the\nComplainant’s Charge. Subsequently, a seventh will was executed on 17 December\n2013, with the involvement of LHY and his wife, Ms Lee Suet Fern, herself an\nexperienced solicitor.\n\n12.\n\nThe Testator passed away on 23 March 2015. The Testator’s will and testamentary\ndirections attracted significant public interest, in particular arising from the Testator’s\nintentions in relation to the demolition of the Testator’s home at Oxley Road. Of less\npublic interest, but probably of equal relevance to the present matters was the manner\nof apportionment of the Testator’s estate amongst his three children.\n\n13.\n\nThe LSS Charges and the Complainant’s Charge arise from two emails that the\nRespondent sent, on 4 June 2015 and 22 June 2015, in response to queries from LHL\nand LWL. These emails were sent to LHL, LWL and LHY. The LSS Charges relate to a\nbreach of confidentiality, in that the Respondent is alleged, by way of the two emails,\nto have disclosed client confidential information to parties not entitled to receive the\ninformation, namely LHL. The Complainant’s Charge relates to the allegation that the\ntwo emails were misleading responses to the queries, by omitting matters that should\nhave been included and/or by containing false and misleading representations. We will\nexamine the ingredients of the charges with greater specificity below.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Proceedings Before the DT\n\nPreliminary Directions\n\n14.\n\nDT 19 was appointed to hear the matters arising from both the LSS SOC and the\nComplainant’s SOC. We directed that both cases would be heard together, with\nwitnesses only giving evidence once, and the evidence, agreed documents and\nagreed facts being admitted in relation to both matters. Counsel for the LSS would\nlead evidence in relation to the LSS SOC and counsel for the Complainant would lead\nevidence in relation to the Complainant’s SOC. It was indicated to us that the LSS and\nthe Respondent were likely to agree on a statement of facts insofar as the LSS SOC\nwas concerned. It was also indicated that the Respondent would be making\nrepresentations to the LSS in relation to LSS charges.\n\n15.\n\nInsofar as the Complainant’s SOC was concerned, Counsel for the Complainant\nindicated that the only witness being called would be LHY. We were told that his\nevidence would be formal, and relate to the documents upon which the Complaint was\nbased. The only witness for the Respondent was to be the Respondent herself.\n\n16.\n\nGiven that the matters before DT 19 related to estate matters, the documents to be\ntendered in the course of the hearing were likely to contain private matters. Parties\nwere directed to agree on redactions to be made to documentary exhibits and agreed\ndocuments, where possible. All such redactions were made by agreement and we\nwere not required to make any determination on redactions.\n\n17.\n\nDirections were given for the filing of the Respondent’s defences, witness statements,\nan agreed bundle, opening statements, and agreed statements of facts. These\ndirections were complied with.\n\nPreliminary Issues\n\n18.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the hearing, the LSS indicated that it had received\nrepresentations from the Respondent. The LSS indicated that it would be tendering an\nagreed statement of facts in relation to an amended charge. The amended charge was\n4\n\n\fthe alternative to the First Charge in the LSS SOC, with further particularization. The\nLSS stated that this new charge, the Amended First Alternative Charge, would be\nmade out on the statement of facts agreed with the Respondent, and that it would not\nbe calling any evidence. The Respondent confirmed this position and stated that she\naccepted that the Amended First Alternative Charge was made out in law and on the\nfacts. A copy of the Amended First Alternative Charge is at Annex D and a copy of the\nAgreed Statement of Facts, agreed between the LSS and the Respondent, is at\nAnnex E.\n\n19.\n\nThere were two preliminary issues raised by the Complainant. The first was an\napplication for the Complainant to give evidence by video link. The second was\nwhether we should continue to consider both the original charges and their\nalternatives, as set out in the LSS SOC even though the LSS chose to proceed on only\none charge upon a “plea bargain” arising from representations made by the\nRespondent to the LSS. Before setting out the specifics of the two issues, and our\nconsiderations and rulings, we touch on the nature of disciplinary tribunal proceedings,\nas this informed the approach that we adopted.\n\n20.\n\nIn the normal course of events, the Council applies to the Chief Justice for the\nappointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal under section 89 of the LPA, where the Council\ndetermines under section 87 of the LPA that there should be a formal investigation, or\nwhere the Court makes an order under section 96 of the LPA. Under section 93 of the\nLPA, the Disciplinary Tribunal must, after hearing and investigating the matter, record\nits findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to those facts, make one\nof three determinations:\n(a)\n\nthat no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under sections 83\nor 83A of the LPA;\n\n(b)\n\nthat while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsections 83 or 83A of the LPA, the practitioner should be ordered to pay a\npenalty, be reprimanded, be ordered to comply with one or more remedial\nmeasures, or be subjected to a remedial measure in addition to a penalty or\nreprimand; or\n\n(c)\n\nthat cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under sections 83 or\n83A of the LPA.\n\n21.\n\nIt is clear from section 93 that the main role of the Disciplinary Tribunal is that of fact\nfinder. This is consonant with its duty to conduct a formal investigation. Upon its\n5\n\n\ffindings of the facts of the case, the Disciplinary Tribunal will form a view on the gravity\nof the case, in terms of the need for any further disciplinary action at all, or for the\nsanctions of penalty or reprimand to be imposed, or for the more serious consequence\nof referring the matter to the Court of Three Judges (“C3J”). The language of the\nvarious sections is not predicated on the Disciplinary Tribunal operating as an\nadjudicator in an adversarial hearing.\n\n22.\n\nHowever, the situation in practice and as contemplated in the Legal Profession\n(Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (“DT Rules”) is predicated on an adversarial /\nadjudication model. For example, Rule 3(2) / 3(4) and Rule 4(2) / 4(4) of the DT Rules\nrequire the Statement of Case to contain charges. Rule 8 provides for a Defence to be\nfiled. Rule 10 provides for the manner in which evidence is to be adduced. Rule 23\nprovides for the Evidence Act to apply, as it applies in civil and criminal proceedings.\nCost orders can be made against the respondent practitioner or a complainant who\nmakes a frivolous or vexatious complaint. These provisions suggest that the\nDisciplinary Tribunal “tries” the respondent practitioner on the charges in the\nStatement of Case.\n\n23.\n\nWe are of the view that, as the Disciplinary Tribunal is an investigative body, our key\nconcern should be ascertainment of facts.\n\n24.\n\nHowever, the the Disciplinary Tribunal is required to adjudicate the charges in the\nstatement of case, as modified by any decision of the LSS not to proceed on any\nparticular charge or to proceed on amended charges. The question which arises is\nwhether we should exercise our powers to investigate all facts or whether we should\nbe bound by the position taken by the LSS; in short whether the position taken by the\nLSS would circumscribe the findings that the Disciplinary Tribunal may make.\n\n25.\n\nThe C3J decision in Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar [2021]\nSGHC 27 is directly on point and extremely pertinent to the issues in this case. In that\ncase, the LSS had amended the charge originally set out in the Statement of Case,\nwhich contained an element of deceit, to a charge where the element of dishonesty\nhad been removed. Using the parlance of criminal practice, a reduced charge was\npreferred. At [31], the C3J considered the fact that the disciplinary proceedings had\nbeen conducted on the basis of the reduced charge and stated very explicitly that “It\ncannot be gainsaid that the respondent could only be held to account for the specific\nmisconduct that she had been charged for. To hold otherwise would be prejudicial to\n6\n\n\fthe respondent since it is the charge that informs a lawyer facing disciplinary\nproceedings of the case that he or she has to meet and impacts the decision he or she\nmakes as to how to respond to the disciplinary proceedings.” The C3J went on to find\nthat the Disciplinary Tribunal in that case had therefore erred in making findings that\nthe respondent solicitor had acted deceitfully, even if she had indeed done so,\nbecause the amended charge and the agreed statement of facts contained no\nallegation of dishonest conduct whatsoever, even though the original charge did. At\n[37], the C3J considered the decision in Law Society of Singapore v Yeo Khirn Hai\nAlvin [2020] 4 SLR 858, and approved the position that it was only where the “Law\nSociety has framed a defective charge that fails to reflect the substance of the\ncomplaint, that the DT lacks jurisdiction in hearing and investigating the charge and\nmaking a determination thereon, and the DT’s decision is liable to be set aside.”\n(emphasis added). The issue is therefore clearly whether the amended charges\nproceeded with still reflect the substance of the complaint. On the facts of Law\nSociety of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar, the C3J found that while the\namended charge did not capture the full extent of the respondent’s transgressions, it\nwas not so defective as to warrant setting aside the DT’s determination for want of\njurisdiction. We are therefore of the view that the question of whether the substance of\nthe complaint is proceeded with is a fact-sensitive exercise, where the proceeded\ncharge must be considered against the substance of the complaint.\n\nThe First Preliminary Issue\n\n26.\n\nWe now deal with the First Preliminary Issue. Shortly before the commencement of the\nevidentiary hearing, the Complainant applied for his evidence to be given by video link.\nThe application was supported by an affidavit. The Respondent objected to the\napplication. The reason given by the Complainant was that his “passport was currently\nbeing held by immigration authorities in connection with an immigration issue and that\nhe was unlikely to get it back in time for the Hearing.” A video hearing was held to\ndetermine the application. The Complainant submitted that he was unable to travel due\nto matters beyond his control, that there were appropriate administrative arrangements\nand technical facilities available for him to give evidence by video link, and that the\nComplainant would face unfair prejudice if the application was not granted. Despite\nrepeated requests by the DT, Counsel for the Complainant declined to state the\npurpose for which the passport had been handed over, or even when the Complainant\nhad handed over the passport. This latter question was critical as it touched the\nquestion of whether the Complainant’s inability to travel was a matter beyond his\n7\n\n\fcontrol or occasioned by his own actions. This argument was made forcefully by the\nRespondent’s counsel, who also submitted that the Respondent would be prejudiced\nby the inability to cross-examine the Complainant in person. The Complainant’s\nresponse was that the Complainant was a formal witness and that the Complainant’s\ncase was based on documents.\n\n27.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we allowed the application for the Complainant to give\nevidence by video link even though we were disturbed by the Complainant’s refusal to\ngive reasons why and the circumstances under which he did not have possession of\nhis passport. Allowing the Complainant to give evidence by video link would permit us\nto carry out our investigative function with the full benefit of all available evidence. We\nwere of the view that the Respondent would not be prejudiced by having to conduct\nthe cross-examination by video link. In making our determination, we applied the\nstandard and the tests set out in the section 281(5B) of the Criminal Procedure Code\n2010 and section 62A(2) of the Evidence Act 1893.\n\nThe Second Preliminary Issue\n\n28.\n\nAs stated above, the LSS and the Respondent had reached an agreement whereby\nthe LSS would proceed on one amended charge and the Respondent would admit to\nan Agreed Statement of Facts. The Respondent also agreed that the facts admitted to\nwould make out the amended charge. The charge proceeded with was marked as the\nAmended First Alternative Charge, attached hereto as Annex D. This was tendered\nwith an Agreed Statement of Facts, marked as ASOF-LS, and attached as Annex E.\nThe Amended First Alternative Charge related to the email of 4 June 2015 sent by the\nRespondent to LHY, LWL and LHL. The original Second Charge and its alternative\nrelated to the Respondent’s email of 22 June 2015.\n\n29.\n\nThe Complainant took the position, communicated to us by letter dated 2 February\n2023, that the Complainant was concerned about the LSS’s course of action as it\nwould result in a situation where we would not be able to investigate the original\nSecond Charge and its alternative. The Complainant went on to state that he reserved\nhis right to apply for judicial review. The Complainant did not state his position as to\nthe proper course of action we should take.\n\n30.\n\nAll parties were invited to address the point raised by the Complainant, on the first day\nof the hearing, before the evidentiary hearing commenced. The LSS’s position was\n8\n\n\fthat it was not offering evidence in relation to the original First Charge and the original\nSecond Charge and Second Alternative Charge. The LSS went further to state that DT\n19 not only should not, but could not, consider the matters set out in the original First\nCharge, the original Second Charge and the original Second Alternative Charge. The\nComplainant took the position that we could and should consider all the matters in the\nLSS SOC, even in relation to charges where the LSS chose not to offer evidence. We\nindicated that we were inclined to agree with the position taken by the LSS. However,\nthe Respondent took the position that we could consider all the matters in the LSS\nSOC, and therefore the Respondent should be permitted to file a Supplementary\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief addressing the matters in the original Second Charge. In\ndoing so, the counsel for the Respondent adverted to the fact that the Complainant\nmight take this issue further and that it was in the Respondent’s interest that she\naddress the facts relating to the LSS’s Second Charge and its alternative and that a\nfinding on the merits be made thereon.\n\n31.\n\nWe gave leave to the Respondent to file the Supplementary Affidavit of Evidence-inChief and indicated that we would consider the correct approach to be taken in relation\nto charges where no evidence was offered, in the course of our determination.\n\n32.\n\nHaving considered the matter, we are of the view that the LSS has a discretion to\nconsider representations and to weigh the merits of possible defences and consider\nfacts raised by a respondent solicitor; and thereafter to determine whether any charges\nshould be amended and whether no evidence should be offered on any charge. Where\nthere are multiple charges, we are of the view that the same approach can be taken in\nconsidering whether to offer evidence on any of the charges.\n\n33.\n\nWe have considered the strictures of the C3J in Law Society of Singapore v\nConstance Margreat Paglar that amendments [or offering of no evidence in respect\nof some of the charges] should not result in the gravamen of the complaint being so\ndiluted or modified as to result in a want of jurisdiction. In this regard, we cite its\nstatement at [39] where the C3J states, “… save to reiterate that the Law Society’s\nduty to investigate complaints referred to it implies a concomitant duty to frame\nappropriate charges that adequately reflect the gravamen of the complaint (see Alvin\nYeo at [78]). These are weighty obligations that the Law Society has been entrusted\nwith, and the principle of self-regulation in disciplinary matters makes it even more\nimperative that the Law Society thoroughly discharges these duties. Any failure to fulfil\nthese responsibilities would only serve to undermine the overriding purpose of legal\n9\n\n\fdisciplinary proceedings - to protect the public and uphold public confidence in the\nlegal profession (see Law Society of Singapore v Chia Choon Yang [2018] 5 SLR 1068\nat [41]). Having said that, the Law Society does of course retain the discretion to\namend charges in appropriate circumstances after it has considered the relevant facts\nand the law. A complainant’s view of the gravamen of the complaint may not always be\nsustainable.” (emphasis added)\n\n34.\n\nThe position taken by the LSS in not offering evidence on the original Second Charge\nand its alternative was predicated on its view that the email of 22 June 2015 was not a\nbreach of confidentiality as the email did not contain confidential information. This was\na view that could be reasonably held on an assessment of the evidence. We are not\nprivy to the substance of the representations made and form no view on the merits of\nthe representations. We find that the gravamen of the complaint (i.e., a breach of\nconfidentiality) was the subject matter of the original First Charge and its alternative,\nand was addressed by the Amended First Alternative Charge. Further, in choosing to\nproceed with the alternative to the original First Charge rather than the original First\nCharge, the Law Society was pitching its case as a breach of section 83(2)(h) of the\nLPA, as opposed to a breach of section 83(2)(b). This was a position taken after\nconsideration of the law, and was a position that could be reasonably held. The\namended charge still addressed the gravamen of the complaint, which was the breach\nof confidentiality. There was accordingly no want of jurisdiction. For the reasons set\nout in Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar at [31], we are of the\nview that it is not open to us to consider the charges which were not proceeded with\nand in relation to which evidence was not offered.\n\n35.\n\nWe bear in mind the Respondent’s concerns that our view may be wrong, and that the\nComplainant may proceed with judicial review on the question of our failure to exercise\njurisdiction on the original First Charge and the original Second Charge and its\nalternative. Accordingly, we have proceeded to consider the merits of the charges not\nproceeded with, in our discussion of the facts below.\n\nThe LSS SOC\n\n32.\n\nThe Amended First Alternative Charge (Annex C) is set out below.\n\nYou, KWA KIM LI, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that you on or about the 4th day of June 2015 by your\n10\n\n\fletter dated 4th June 2015 sent to Mr Lee Hsien Loong (“LHL”) are guilty of\nknowingly disclosing to LHL, without the consent / authority of the 2 Executors\nand Trustees named in Will No. 7 namely Ms Lee Wei Ling (“LWL”) and Mr Lee\nHsien Yang (“LHY”), the following documents and information which was\nconfidential to your client, Mr Lee Kuan Yew (“Mr Lee”), and which was acquired\nby you in the course of your engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor namely; 5 of the\nprevious Wills of Mr Lee prepared by you upon his instructions and email trails\nbetween Mr Lee and you from 11th December 2011 to 2nd November 2012\n(“Documents Set A”) and explanations as to why your client Mr Lee changed his\nprevious Wills which amounts to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161).\n\n33.\n\nThe Amended First Alternative Charge was supported by an Agreed Statement of\nFacts (Annex E). Of significance is [9] of the Agreed Statement of Facts, where the\nRespondent admits that she did not obtain the consent/authority of the 2 Executors\nand Trustees named in the Testator’s Will dated 17 December 2013 (“Will No. 7”),\nnamely LHY and LWL, prior to sending [by e-mail] the letter dated 4 June 2015 to LHL,\nLWL and LHY. We sought confirmation from the Respondent’s Counsel that the\nRespondent admitted to and accepted the facts set out in the Amended First\nAlternative Charge and Agreed Statement of Facts, and admitted that these facts\namounted to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the\nSupreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession, within the meaning of\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent so confirmed and submitted that the circumstances of this case did\nnot require referral to the C3J, and that we should issue a reprimand or impose a\nmodest penalty. The Law Society took the position that a reprimand was not sufficient\nand that a penalty of $3,000 to $5,000 should be imposed.\n\n35.\n\nBefore we deal with the substance of the Amended First Alternative Charge, we\naddress a point of difference between the LSS and the Respondent. Both parties took\nthe common position that the information and documents set out in the charge were\nconfidential to the Testator, and upon his death, to his Estate. The LSS took the\nposition that the confidentiality could not be breached unless LHY and LWL, as\nExecutors, gave permission. The Respondent took the position that they could not give\n11\n\n\fpermission until Probate was granted. Nothing turned on this as the Respondent did\nnot seek the permission of LHY and LWL in communicating to LHL.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent pitched her breach of confidentiality as a breach of the lowest level,\nsubmitting that that the Testator would have wanted her to share the information with\nLHL, LWL and LHY. Her position was that she released the information out of a deep\nsense of loyalty to the Testator, although she accepts that she did not have specific\ninstructions from the Testator, prior to his death, to release such information. The LSS\ndid not take a position on whether the Testator would have wanted the Respondent to\nrelease the information to LHL, but agreed that the Respondent’s culpability and the\nharm caused by the breach was not substantial. On consideration of all the facts, we\naccept this submission.\n\n37.\n\nWe accept that the Respondent was replying to queries by LHL and LWL under the\nnotion that she ought to respond to queries from beneficiaries, who also happened to\nbe her first cousins, with whom she grew up. We accept that the Testator had\npreviously indicated to her that he would inform his children of his intentions and the\nreasons for his testamentary dispositions. We also accept that the Respondent had a\nclose personal relationship with the Testator. We note that there is no evidence before\nus suggesting that the Respondent was acting from any improper motives.\n\n38.\n\nHowever, it would have been clear to the Respondent that she was dealing with\nsensitive family issues. The Respondent was aware that LWL had previously voiced\nunhappiness on the change from a position where she has a slightly larger share to\nequal shares. In a situation such as the present case, it is imperative that solicitors act\nstrictly within their professional boundaries and exercise care and caution. The\nRespondent’s misconduct was her failure to scrupulously safeguard the Testator’s\nconfidentiality; and this misconduct was unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n39.\n\nIn the premises, we determine pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, that while no\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83, the\nRespondent should be ordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed. Further, we are of the view that a penalty that is sufficient and\nappropriate to the misconduct committed is a penalty of $5,000. Given the DT’s role as\na filter of case, we do not think that a low culpability-low harm situation, involving\nmisconduct under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA is one that should be referred to the C3J,\nparticular in the absence of any dishonesty or deceit, or gross negligence.\n12\n\n\f40.\n\nOn the question of costs, the LSS asked for a very modest $5,000. Pursuant to section\n93(2) read with section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, we order the Respondent to pay the\nLSS’s costs in the sum of $5,000 and to bear all disbursements that have been\nreasonably incurred which are to be taxed if parties are not able to agree.\n\n41.\n\nWe now deal with the original First Charge, the original Second Charge and the\nalternative to the original Second Charge. As stated earlier, we are of the view that\nthese are not matters for our consideration. If we are wrong and should have\nconsidered these matters, there would have made no difference to our earlier\ndetermination – that while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists\nunder section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of\n$5,000 being a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed.\nAs the party framing the Statement of Case, the LSS is entitled to frame alternative\ncharges, to choose which alternative to proceed upon, and to amend the charges.\n\n42.\n\nIn any event, we are the view that the misconduct in the present case does not fall\nwithin the ambit of grossly improper conduct within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of\nthe LPA and the original First Charge would not have been made out.\n\n43.\n\nIn relation to the original Second Charge, we accept the Respondent’s submissions\nthat the contents of the 22 June 2015 letter were different in nature from that of the 4\nJune 2015 letter. The thrust of the letter was to distance the Respondent from any\ninvolvement in the preparation of Will No. 7, not to give information about that will and\nits execution. We also accept the Respondent’s submissions that the information\ncontained in the 22 June 2015 letter was already known to the parties. Specifically, the\ncontents of the 1st Will (the will of 20 August 2011, which has been referred to in other\nproceedings as the 2nd Will), which was mirrored in Will No. 7, had been discussed\nwith LHL, LWL and LHY at the time the 1st Will was executed. It was also clear that\nLHL, LWL and LHY had entered into a deed of Family Arrangement immediately after\nand predicated upon the contents of the 1st Will. In any event, even if the information\ndisclosed in the 22 June 2015 was information confidential to the Testator and his\nEstate, we do not find that the disclosure amounted to misconduct under section 83(2)\nof the LPA.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the Complainant’s position on the original Second\nCharge and its alternative was frivolous and vexatious. We do not agree. There is a\n13\n\n\fsignificant zone between a frivolous and vexatious complaint that ought not to have\nbeen made at all and a finding that misconduct has not been made out beyond\nreasonable doubt. We recognize that the Complainant had viewed the two letters as\npart of a continuum, while the LSS had analysed the two letters as two discrete acts.\nWhile we accept that the LSS’s approach is the correct one, we will not go so far as to\nstate that the Complainant’s approach was frivolous and vexatious.\nThe Complainant’s SOC\n\n45.\n\nThe Complainant’s SOC contained a single charge, as follows:\n\nYou, Mdm Kwa Kim Li, are charged that, by way of your letters dated 4 June and\n22 June 2015, you misled the Executors of the Estate of your former client Mr\nLee Kuan Yew, namely Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by omitting\nand/or otherwise failing to disclose your communications with Mr Lee Kuan Yew\nbetween November 2013 and 13 December 2013 in response to their enquiries\nand/or by making the false and misleading representation that Mr Lee Kuan Yew\nhad never instructed you to change his will dated 2 November 2012, such act\namounting to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n\n46.\n\nThe Complainant and the Respondent tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts as well,\nwhich is at Annex F, together with an Agreed Bundle of Documents. The Complainant\nand the Respondent also filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief, upon which they were\ncross-examined. We observe the following:\n(a)\n\nThe letters of 4 June 2015 and 22 June 2015 are dealt with together in a single\ncharge, without making any distinction between the different contents of the two\nletters and the different queries that were being addressed by the Respondent.\n\n(b)\n\nIn terms of the Respondent misleading LWL and LHY as executors, there are\ntwo separate averments, namely that the Respondent misled LWL and LHY by\nomitting to disclose and/or otherwise failing to disclose her communications with\nthe Testator which had taken place between November 2013 and 13 December\n2013 and/or making the false and misleading representation that the Testator\nhad never instructed her to change his will.\n\n14\n\n\f47.\n\nThe Respondent did not raise any objections as to duplicity in the charges. We are\nmindful that it is our function to formally investigate the matter and make a\ndetermination upon the facts, and the purpose of the charge is to give the Respondent\nnotice of the case to meet. Nonetheless, we are obliged to identify the specific\ningredients made out, and to make our determination only upon the facts that we have\nfound to be made out beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n48.\n\nWe identified to the Complainant and Respondent the steps that we were of the view\nwould be involved in making our determination on the Complainant’s Charge. These\nwere:\n(a)\n\nTo identify the queries that the Respondent was addressing in each of the two\nletters. The queries could be identified by evidence of what LHL and LWL asked\nthe Respondent, what the Respondent and those receiving the letters would\nhave understood the response as relating to, and what the two letters\nthemselves had set out as the queries being responded to.\n\n(b)\n\nFollowing from the findings on point (a) above, whether the responses in each of\nthe two letters were misleading, either by omission or expressly so.\n\n(c)\n\nFollowing from the findings on point (b) above, whether the responses were\nknowingly or deliberately misleading or misleading as a result of a lack of due\ncare and diligence.\n\n(d)\n\nFollowing from the findings in point (c) above, whether the Respondent’s conduct\nwas unbefitting that of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\nCourt, and if so whether a reprimand or penalty should be imposed or whether\nthe matter should be referred to the C3J.\n\n49.\n\nThe key documents in relation to this charge are:\n(a)\n\nThe email exchanges between the Respondent and the Testator dated 30\nNovember 2013, 12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent’s exchange of emails with LWL on 3 June 2013.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent’s email to LHL, LWL and LHY on 4 June 2015, which has also\nbeen referred to as the 4 June 2015 letter.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Respondent’s email to LHL, LWL and LHY on 22 June 2015, which has also\nbeen referred to as the 22 June 2015 letter.\n\n50.\n\nThe Complainant and the Respondent have characterized the background to and the\ncontents of these documents quite differently. In approaching these differences, we\nhave given weight to the plain and simple meaning of the language used in the\n15\n\n\fdocuments. In considering what the emails addressed and were intended to address,\nwe construed the actual language used. To the extent that we considered evidence of\nwitnesses, we were mindful that the two parties who raised queries, LHL and LWL, did\nnot give evidence. The party who did give evidence was the Respondent who was the\nparty to whom the queries were addressed. In the final analysis, we had to consider\nthe plain meaning of the documents, with the background as context, and consider the\nRespondent’s explanation. In doing this, we were mindful that the burden of proof on\nthe Complainant was proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n51.\n\nThe communications between the Respondent and the Testator in November /\nDecember 2013 clearly show the following:\n(a)\n\nThe Testator contacted the Respondent on 29 November 2013 and discussed\nhis concerns that the Oxley Road property would be “de-gazetted” and wished to\nmake arrangements such that any increase in value upon such “de-gazetting”\nwould be shared by LHL with LWL and LHY, and not be retained by just LHL,\nwho was to be bequeathed the Oxley property.\n\n(c)\n\nIn the week before 12 December 2013, the Respondent and the Testator had a\nfurther discussion and discussed the shares that LHL, LWL and LHY would each\nget. In doing so, the Testator indicated his wish to give all three children equal\nshares, as opposed to his existing will where LWL received an extra share.\n\n(d)\n\nIn her email of 12 December 2013, the Respondent stated that she would\nprepare a codicil to effect the Testator’s wish, for the Testator’s signature that\nweek or when he was ready. The Respondent also stated that she had “some\nthoughts” on the Oxley Road property and would call the Testator later that day.\n\n(e)\n\nOn 13 December 2013, the Testator sent an email to the Respondent asking for\na further amendment to his will, regarding the bequest of two carpets to LHY.\n\n52.\n\nThe Testator passed away on 23 March 2015. The two emails that are the subject\nmatter of the Complainant’s Charge were sent by the Respondent on 4 June 2015 and\n22 June 2015.\n\nThe 4 June 2015 Email\n\n53.\n\nThere is no evidence from LHL or LWL as to what queries were being addressed in the\n4 June 2015 email. LWL’s email of 3 June 2015 gives some indication as she stated “It\nwould be useful to have emails, and not just a summary of evolution of the Oxley\nclause”. No reference at all is made to Will No. 7, executed on 17 December 2013. The\n16\n\n\fheading was “Papa’s Wills”. The Respondent’s email of 4 June 2015 is headed\n“Chronology of 6 Wills - my file records will focus on Oxley”. This does seem to be a\nfollow up on LWL’s 3 June 2015 email. It is noteworthy that no mention is made of any\nissue in relation to any change that equalizes the shares amongst the three children.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent’s 4 June 2015 email focused entirely on the evolution of the\ndistribution amongst the children and matters relating to the Oxley Road property in the\n1st to 6th Wills, which had been prepared by the Respondent. No mention at all is\nmade of the exchange of emails and the communications between the Respondent\nand the Testator in November / December 2013.\n\n55.\n\nWe first observe that there is no extraneous evidence as to the query made by LHL or\nLWL, except for the 3 June 2015 email. We find that there is nothing in the direct\nextraneous evidence that shows that there was any query that required reference to\nthe November / December 2013 communications between the Testator and the\nRespondent as part of the answer.\n\n56.\n\nWe now consider the Complainant’s second argument; which is that the Respondent\nand the recipients knew that the context of the queries related to the execution of Will\nNo. 7 and therefore the Respondent should have included reference to the November /\nDecember 2013 communications between the Testator and the Respondent as part of\nthe answer. We note that the Respondent had started her email with the words “[LHL]\nand [LWL] have requested me for file records of your father’s previous Wills, for\nnotes/emails/information on his instructions regarding Oxley.” The Complainant reads\nthis line with emphasis on the second part, that is, the Respondent should have given\ninformation relating to the Testator’s instructions regarding the Oxley Road property.\nThe Respondent urges us to construe the query with emphasis on the first part, and to\nread the query as being limited to the 1st to 6th Wills. The Respondent also urges us to\nread the word “instructions” as being limited to a direction by a client to carry out a\nparticular task.\n\n57.\n\nIn the absence of evidence from LHL and LWL as to what their queries were, we are\nconstrained to consider the Respondent’s evidence only, and weigh it against the\nbackground evidence and the actual words in the 4 June 2015 email. As candidly\nadmitted by Counsel for the Complainant, LHY did not have any personal knowledge in\nthis regard.\n\n17\n\n\f58.\n\nAn omission, whether wilful or negligent, that amounts to professional misconduct can\nonly arise if there is a clear breach of duty to furnish that information. In the present\ncase, we are unable to find any evidentiary basis for a query that would clearly have\nrequired a response containing reference to the November / December 2013\ncommunications. We agree with the Respondent that the reference to instructions\nrelation to the Oxley Road property are circumscribed by the earlier reference to the 1 st\nto 6th Wills. This is made clear by the fact that the earlier 6 wills are identified and\ncopies were given.\n\n59.\n\nWe wish to point out that the question before us is not whether the Respondent should\nhave given details of the November / December 2013 communications in the 4 June\n2015 letter, but whether there was any query that made her failure to do so misleading.\nWe do not find sufficient evidence, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was\nany query that required a reference to the November / December 2013\ncommunications.\n\n60.\n\nThe Complainant’s alternative argument was that the great degree of detail given by\nthe Respondent would have led the recipients to conclude that all information was\ngiven. Quite apart from the absence of evidence in this regard, we are obliged to\nconsider the issue objectively and not what the recipients subjectively hoped or\nexpected to be informed about.\n\n61.\n\nSince there is no clear query established, we find that the issues relating to whether\nthe answer was misleading, and the subsequent considerations, do not arise in relation\nto the 4 June 2015 email. For completeness, we do not find that the Complainant’s\nCharge in relation to the Respondent’s 4 June 2015 email is made out on the facts.\n\nThe 22 June 2015 Email\n\n62.\n\nWe now consider the 22 June 2015 email. Again, there is a no evidence from LHL and\nLWL on the queries that they raised. However, unlike the 4 June 2015 email, the 22\nJune 2015 email itself contained clear statements as to what queries were being\nraised. The queries being addressed were:\n(a)\n\nA request for the draft will of 19 August 2011; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe background which led to the signing of Will No. 7.\n\n18\n\n\f63.\n\nGiven that Will No. 7 was a return to the will of 20 August 2011 (i.e., the 1st Will) and\nthat both the 1st Will and Will No. 7 were based on the 19 August 2011 draft, it was\nclear that the subject matter being addressed was Will No. 7. This is reinforced by the\nsecond query, requesting the background which led to the signing of Will No. 7.\n\n64.\n\nThe Complainant submitted that this was clearly a request for information relating to\nthe circumstances leading up to the execution of Will No. 7. We agree. Indeed, as the\nqueries were quite obviously a follow-up to the answers received on 4 June 2015, the\nlogical inference was that LHL and LWL were seeking information specifically in\nrelation to Will No. 7, in relation to which the Respondent had given no information in\nher earlier 4 June 2015 email. The query therefore concerns the circumstances leading\nup to the execution of Will No. 7.\n\n65.\n\nWe move on to consider the second issue, which is whether the Respondent’s\nanswers were misleading. We note that there was no reference at all to the November\n/ December 2013 communications with the Testator. In this regard, we note that that\nthe distribution of shares and issues relating to the Oxley Road property were changes\nthat were discussed in the November / December 2013 communications and were\nmatters that were addressed and changed in Will No. 7. We also note that although\nthese matters were discussed between the Respondent and the Testator, the\nRespondent stated in the email that “After your father signed Will no. 6 dated 2nd\nNovember 2012, he did not instruct me to change his Will. I first learnt about Will no. 7\nvia email from Fern and Lin Hoe.”\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent’s explanation was that her statement was true and complete as she\nwas not involved at all in the preparation or execution of Will No. 7, and that it would be\ninappropriate and irresponsible for her to guess or speculate as to the Testator’s\nreasons for the treatment of the Oxley Road property in Will No. 7. The Respondent\nsubmits that she had made it clear that she was not involved in Will No. 7. The\nRespondent submits further that the November / December 2013 communications\nwere not material to the background to the signing of Will No. 7 and did not contain any\ninstructions from the Testator about Will No. 7. The Respondent characterizes the\nNovember / December 2013 communications as relating to the possibility of preparing\na codicil to the 6th Will, but her understanding was that the Testator was still in the\n\n19\n\n\fmidst of considering or compiling possible amendments to include or provide for in the\nproposed codicil.\n\n67.\n\nWe do not agree with the Respondent’s submissions. The issues are quite simple. The\nfirst question is whether the November / December 2013 communications should have\nbeen disclosed in response to a query on the background to the signing of Will No. 7.\nThe second question is whether the omission to disclose made the response\nmisleading. The third question is whether it was true that the Respondent did not\nreceive any instructions to change the Testator’s Will.\n\n68.\n\nIt was clear that the live issue to LHL and LWL was the Testator’s mindset in terms of\nhis wishes in relation to the distribution of the Oxley Road property. The failure to\ndisclose the November / December 2013 communications, coupled with the statement\nthat the Testator did not instruct the Respondent to change his Will gave the clear and\nunequivocal impression that the Respondent had no knowledge as to how Will No. 7\ncame about. On the face of the 30 November 2013 and 12 December 2013 emails, it\nwas clear that the Respondent knew that the Testator wished to equalize the shares of\nhis childrenn and to address matters relating to the Oxley Road property. Unlike the 4\nJune 2015 email, the Respondent did not circumscribe her answers to any particular\nseries of wills or time periods. We find that the nub of the queries by LHL and LWL was\nto find out how Will No. 7 came about, and not the formalities of its execution. It is clear\nthat the Respondent knew that the Testator wanted to change the 6th Will and that the\nchanges related to the shares amongst the children in the Oxley Road property.\n\n69.\n\nWe observe that the query was for the background which led to the signing of Will No.\n7. These words clearly suggest that the answer given would be expansive and address\nthe issues in the mind of the querists.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent argues that her use of the word “instruct”, in stating that the Testator\ndid not instruct her to change the Will, was not false. The basis for this argument was\nthat there were no instructions, but only discussions, as the Respondent was not\nexpressly told to make any changes. The Complainant argues that the word “instruct”\nshould be given its dictionary meaning i.e. “To convey information as a client to an\nattorney” and “the facts and details relating to a case given by a client to his or her\n20\n\n\fsolicitor”. We are of the view that the word “instruct” should be given a meaning that\nthe parties reading the 22 June 2015 email would have understood it to mean. We\naccept the submission made by the Complainant. On that basis we find the statement\nthat the Testator did not instruct the Respondent to change his Will to be untrue. The\ninstructions may not have been finalized, but it is clear that the Respondent received\ninstructions relating to the changes that were shortly made.\n\n71.\n\nThe Complainant had further argued that instructions were in fact actually finalized for\nthe Respondent to change the 6th Will. This is based on the wording of the\nRespondent’s email of 12 December 2013 to the Testator which states “We discussed\nlast week that you would now like to sign a Codicil to change this, and to give Ling\nequal shares with Loong and Yang out of the total estate. I will prepare the codicil for\nyou to sign this week, or when you are ready.”\n\n72.\n\nThe Complainant also points to the change in caption of the emails from “your question\non the properties in your name” in the email of 30 November 2013 to “Codicil to\nequalize Ling”\n\nin the Respondent’s email of\n\n12 December\n\n2013 as an\n\nacknowledgement by the Respondent that she had received instructions to change the\n6th Will.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent disagreed with the suggestion that there were final instructions from\nthe Testator in this regard. Her explanation was that she had actually sent the email of\n12 December 2013 to the Testator to ask whether that was what he really wanted.\n\n74.\n\nHer evidence was that it was normal for her to have many discussions with the\nTestator over an issue with him changing his mind several times before coming to a\nconclusion, hence she assumed this to be part of that process when asked to recall the\ncircumstances surrounding what led her to send the Testator the email of 12\nDecember 2013.\n\n75.\n\nGiven her view that the emails (from 30 November 2013 to 13 December 2013) did not\ncontain any final instructions, her position was therefore that the statement in her 22\n\n21\n\n\fJune 2015 email that she did not receive any instructions to change the 6th Will was not\nfalse or misleading.\n\n76. We find that the Respondent’s omission to disclose the emails of 30 November 2013\nand 12 December 2013 in her email of 22 June 2015 is misleading. We further find that\nher statement in that same email that she did not receive any instructions from the\nTestator to change his Will is false. We now move on to the next stage of the inquiry,\nwhether the responses were knowingly or deliberately misleading or misleading as a\nresult of a lack of due care and diligence.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent’s subjective view that the omission of the November / December\n2013 communications from her 22 June 2015 email did not render it misleading does\nnot accord with the objective analysis of what the November / December 2013\ncommunications amounted to.\n\n78.\n\nThere was no direct evidence that the Respondent knowingly or deliberately misled the\nrecipients of the 22 June 2015 email. There was no evidence or even suggestion that\nshe chose to avoid disclosure for personal or any partisan purposes. The Complainant\nsuggested that the Respondent did not disclose her November / December 2013\ncommunications with the Testator out of embarrassment that she had been tardy in\ncarrying out his instructions. There was no evidence to support this suggestion. We\nbriefly considered the possibility that the Respondent was deliberately choosing to\ndistance herself from Will No. 7, and the issues amongst the Testator’s children in\nrelation to it. There is some evidence that LWL had reached out to the Respondent in\nrelation to her unhappiness in having her share reduced. However, this was not put to\nthe Respondent. Therefore, on the evidence before us, we do not find proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the Respondent knowingly or deliberately misled LHY and LWL\nor that she intentionally made a false statement.\n\n79.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent was communicating with the Testator’s beneficiaries on\nmatters that were obviously important to them. The Respondent was aware that LWL\nhad expressed some unhappiness in relation to Will No. 7 in terms of the change to her\nshare. Having chosen to respond to the queries, it was incumbent upon the\nRespondent to be complete and accurate in her response. We find that had the\n22\n\n\fRespondent exercised due care and diligence, she ought to have disclosed the\nNovember / December 2013 communications in the 22 June 2015 email and ought not\nhave stated that she had received no instructions to change the Testator’s Will.\n\n80.\n\nWe now consider the appropriate determination. We expressly asked Counsel for the\nComplainant to address us on the issue of harm caused by the Respondent’s breach\nof duty. We were referred to paragraph 30 of the LHY’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief,\nwherein he stated that the Respondent’s failure to disclose the fact that the Testator\nhad communicated his wishes to give his children equal shares and her failure to\ndisclose the context in which the Testator decided to include the demolition clause in\nWill No. 7 “caused unnecessary doubt and confusion about what prompted the\n[Testator] to change his 2 November 2012 Will”. Counsel for the Complainant\nconfirmed that this was the only harm alleged.\n\n81.\n\nGiven the absence of any further background or information, we assessed the harm as\nlow. We were mindful that the 22 June 2015 email was in response to a second query\nfor information and was quite specific. Accordingly, we find that the culpability was low\nto medium.\n\n82.\n\nIn the premises, we determine pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, that while no\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83, the\nRespondent should be ordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed in relation to the Respondent’s 22 June 2015 email. Further, we\nare of the view that a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct\ncommitted is a penalty of $8,000. For completeness, we set out an amended charge,\nthat encapsulates our findings, which is as follows:\nYou, Mdm Kwa Kim Li, are charged that, by way of your letter 22 June 2015, you\nmisled the Executors of the Estate of your former client Mr Lee Kuan Yew,\nnamely Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by omitting to disclose your\ncommunications with Mr Lee Kuan Yew between November 2013 and 13\nDecember 2013 in response to their enquiries and by making the false and\nmisleading representation that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had never instructed you to\nchange his will dated 2 November 2012, such act amounting to misconduct\n\n23\n\n\funbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court within\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n\n83.\n\nWe now address the question of costs. Parties made written submissions on costs on\n3 March 2023. The Complainant’s submissions sought $60,000 in costs at [1] of his\ncost submissions but sought a different figure of $15,000 in [5] of his costs\nsubmissions. Disbursements were sought in the sum of $9.182.29. Pursuant to section\n93(2) read with section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, we order that the Respondent should\npay the Complainant’s costs in the sum of $12,000 and disbursements in the sum of\n$9,182.29.\n\n84.\n\nWe would like to thank Counsel for their assistance in addressing our questions and\nconcerns, in the course of submissions.\nDated this 5th day of May 2023\n\n___________________________\n\n__________________________\n\nNarayanan Sreenivasan SC\n\nTan Kheng Ann Alvin\n\nPresident\n\nMember\n\n24\n\n\f\fIN THE MATTER OF KWA KIM LI\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n{CHAPTER 161)\n\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n. Kwa Kim Li (the \"Respondent\"), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore of 35 years' standing, was admitted to\nthe Roll of Advocates & Solicitors on 16% January 1980, and was at\nall material times, practising as an advocate and solicitor at the law\nfirm of Lee & Lee.\n\n. The Complainants are Ms Lee Wei Ling (“LWL\") and Mr Lee Hsien\nYang (\"LHY\"), and the complaint was made by a letter dated 5t\nSeptember 2018 to the Law Society of Singapore (‘the Law\n\nSociety”), supported by a Statutory Declaration declared on the\n\nsame day.\n\n. LWL and LHY were the Executors and Trustees named in the Last\nWill and Testament of Mr Lee Kuan Yew (‘Mr Lee\") dated 17\nDecember 2013 (‘Will no.7) . Probate of Will no. 7 was obtained by\n\nthe Executors and Trustees sometime in October 2015,\n\n. Rule 24 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct} Rules\n(Revised Edition 2010) (\"PCR 2010\") states:\n(1) An advocate and solicitor shall not in any way, directly or\nindirectlyi. disclose any confidential information which the\nadvocate and solicitor receives as a result of the\nretainer; or\n\nii. disclose the contents of the papers recording such\n\ninstructions\n\nunless with the consent of the client or is required by law or order\n\nof court.\n\n\f8. On 4™ June 2015, the Respondent responded to the requests from\nLHL, by way of a letterfemail addressed to LHL, LHY and LWL and\n\nprovided copies of the following documents to LHL,LHY and LWL;\n\na) The previous 6 Wills;\nb) Email trail between Mr Lee and the Respondent from 17 August\n2011 to 2% November 2012 (“Documents set A”)\n9. By the text of the 4™ June 2015 letter addressed to LHL,LHY and\n\nLWL the Respondent also expiained the background as to why Mr\nLee signed 6 Wills over 15 months and in doing so disclosed\nconfidential information that she was privy to as Mr Lee's solicitor\n\nduring the 15-month period and the duration during which she\nprepared the 6 previous Wilis on his instructions\n\n10. Further to her letter dated 4% June 2015 and upon the request of\nLHL for a copy of draft will dated 19\" August 2011 and about the\nbackground which led to the signing of Will no. 7, the Respondent\non 22% June 2015, under her covering emailfletter of the same\ndate, forwarded to LHL,LHY and LWL, the following documents:\n\na) The draft Will of Mr Lee dated 19\" August 2011 with covering\nemail;\nb) Email trails of 16 December 2013 from Lee Suet Fern;\n¢) Emait trails of 3 January 2014 from Lin Hoe;\n\n(collectively referred to as “Documents set B\")\n11.In addition to Documents Set B, the Respondent by the text of her\nletter dated 22 June 2015 also provided information to LHL, LHY\n\nand LWL that she did not receive any instructions from Mr Lee to\nchange his will after he had signed Will no.6 dated 2™ November\n2012 and that she first learnt about Will No.7 via email from Lee\nSuet Fern and Lin Hoe\n\n12.Whilst, LHY and LWL were the 2 Executors and Trustees named in\nWill no. 7 and were thereby authorised to receive the information\n\ncontained in the Respondent’s letter dated 4™ June 2015 and 22\nJune 2015 as welf as the Documents set A and Documents set B.\n\nLHL was not authorised to receive the same from the Respondent\nwithout the consent/fauthority of the 2 Executors and Trustees\n\nnamed in Will no. 7, namely, LHY and LWL.\n\n13.The Respondent did not seek nor obtain the consent/authority of\nthe 2 Executors and Trustees named in Will no.7, namely, LHY and\n\n\fLWL prior to sending the letter dated 4 June 2015 and the letter\n\ndated 22\" June 2015 to LHL\n\n14.In providing the previous 6 Wills, the documents set A and the\ndocuments set B and the background explanation to LHL without\nthe consent /authority of the 2 Executors and Trustees named in\nWilt no.7, namely LWL and LHY, the Respondent had breached the\nconfidentiality principle set out in Rule 24 of the PCR 2010.\n15.The Respondent’s disclosure of confidential information amounted\nto a breach of the confidentiality principle set out in Rule 24(1) of\nthe PCR 2010. The breach of Rule 24(1) of the PCR 2010 amounts\nto grossly improper conduct in the discharge of her professional\nduty within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession\nAct (Cap. 161)(\"LPA\")\n16.Further and/or in the alternative, the disclosure of confidential\ninformation by the Respondent amounts to misconduct unbefitting\n\nof an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or\nas a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA\n17.

LHY will therefore be referred to in these\nproceedings as the “Complainant”.\n\n1.\n\nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS\n\n5.\n\nAt the material times in or around June 2015, the relevant statutory\nprovisions in force were the Legal Profession Act (2008 Rev Ed) (‘LPA\")\nand the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (2010 Rev Ed)\n(“PCR\").\n\n8.\n\nSection 83(1) of the LPA provides that “alf advocates and solicitors shail be\nsubject to the control of the Supreme Court and shail be fiable on due cause\nshown” to be struck off the roll, suspended from practice, pay a penalty\nandfor to be censured.\n\n7.\n\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA provides that:\nSuch due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and\nsolicitor-\n\n(h) has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as & member of an\nhonourable profession;\n\n8.\n\nRule 2(2) of the PCR provides that:\n“In the interpretation of these rules, regard shall be had to the\nprinciple that an advocate and solicitor shall not in the conduct of\n\nhis practice do any act which would compromise or hinder the\nfollowing obligations:\n\n\f(a) to maintain the rule of law and assist in the administration of\n\nJustice.\n(b) to maintain the independence and integrity of the profession.”\nA solicitor has a duty and an obligation under the PCR not to do anything\nwhich would compromise or hinder their obligations to assist in the\n\nadministration of justice and to maintain the independence and the integrity\nof the honorable profession. This includes the general duty to act honestly,\ncompetently and with due care and diligence in the conduct of her\nprofessional duties.\n\n10.\n\nAs detailed below, the Respondent has on this failed to act honestly and/or\ndischarge her professional obligations with due care and diligence, which\namounts to conduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor under 83(2)(h) of\n\nthe LPA.\nCIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO THE COMPLAINT\n\n11\n\nThe original Complainants, LWL and LHY, together with Mr Lee Hsien\nLoong (\"LHL\"), are siblings and the children of Mr Lee.\n\n12.\n\nPrior to his geath, Mr Lee Kuan Yew (“Mr Lee”) executed a total of eight\nwills. Mr Lee’s initial will was prepared by his wife, Ms Kwa Geok Choo,\n\nand was signed by Mr Lee and dated 7 December 1995. Thereafter, Mr\nLee instructed the Respondent to draft and engross his next six wills\nbetween August 2011 and November 2012, each of which was signed by\n\nMr Lee and dated as follows:\na.\n\n20 August 2011 (\"First Will\"),\n\n\fb.\n\n21 December 2011 {“Second Will\"};\n\nc.\n\n6 September 2012 (“Third Will\");\n\nd.\n\n20 September 2012 (“Fourth Will\");\n\ne.\n\n4 October 2012 (“Fifth Will\"); and\n\nf.\n\n2 November 2012 {\"Sixth Will\").\n\n(collectively referred to as Mr Lee's “six wills”)\n\nIn or around end-November 2013, Mr Lee asked the Respondent to draft\nanother will to effect further amendments to his Sixth Will.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 November 2013, the Respondent sent Mr Lee an email to record the\ncontents of her discussion with Mr Lee the previous evening, and to advise\n\nMr Lee on the amendments that Mr Lee was intending to make to his last\nwilt (\"30 Nov Email”). Specifically, the email recorded that Mr Lee had\nasked the Respondent to re-cap the contents of his Sixth Will. Mr Lee had\n\nalso raised the possibility that his family home at 38 Oxley Road (\"Oxley”)\nmight be ‘de-gazetted” after his passing and sought the Respondent's\nadvice on the legal implications if that were to happen.\n\n18.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, the Respondent sent another email to Mr Lee\n\nsetting out further information regarding his Sixth Will and recorded the\ncontents of a discussion with Mr Lee the previous week (*12 Dec Email”).\n\nIn her email, the Respondent said:\n\n“Under your present will dated 2 Nov 2012, [LWL] has been given\n\n1 share more than [LHL] and [LHY], out of your total estate. This is\n\n\fbecause you reasoned that [LWL] does not have double income like\nher brothers.\nWe discussed last week that you would now like to sign a Codicil to\nchange this, and to give [LWL] equal shares with [LHL] and [LHY]\n\nout of the total estate.\n1 will prepare the codicil for you to sign this week, or when you are\nready.\n\nRegarding the Oxley property, | have some thoughts and will calf\nyou later today.”\n\n16,\n\nOn 13 December 2013, Mr Lee replied to the Respondent to request an\nadditional amendment to his will to give two carpets to LHY (“13 Dec\n\nEmail\"). The 13 December 2013 email stated:\n\n“Another amendment is a cadici to specify that two carpets: a silk\none on the wall over my PV and another a larger woollen one on\n\nthe wall above the bed in my bedroom, to go to [LHY].”\n17.\n\nThe 30 Nov Email, 12 Dec Email and the 13 Dec Email are collectively\n\nreferred to as the “Emails”.\n\nMr Lee thereafter finally determined to revert to the terms of his First Will,\nand he accordingly executed his last will and testament on 17 December\n2013 (\"Last Will\"), on terms which substantially mirrored the contents of\nhis First Will. In his Last Will, Mr Lee named LHY and LWL as the executors\nand trustees of his estate.\n\n\fMr Lee passed away on 23 March 2015. The Executors stepped into Mr\n\nLee's shoes and represented his Estate thereafter.\n\n20.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, LWL wrote to the Respondent to request information\nabout Mr Lee’s wills.\n\n21\n\nOn 4 June 2015, in response the request from LWL (and a purportedly\nsimilar request from LHL) for the Respondent’s file records of copies of Mr\nLee's previous Wills and for any notes, information and emails relating to\nor connected with Mr Lee's instructions regarding his Oxley property, the\nRespondent issued a letter to the Executors and LHL titled \"Chronology of\n6 Wills — my file records with focus on Oxley” {the \"4 June Letter”).\n\n22.\n\nIn the 4 June Letter, the Respondent set out a comprehensive account of\nMr Lee's six wills and her discussions with Mr Lee regarding his\ntestamentary wishes based on her file records.\n\n23.\n\nThe summary included Mr Lee’s instructions in respect of the preparation\nof his six wills and various drafts of the same, the changes to his\ninstructions and wishes, and correspondence with him in relation to the\n\nOxley property. The Respondent also attached copies of all six wills and\nher email correspondence with Mr Lee.\n\n24,\n\nHowever, the Respondent omitted to mention the fact that and/or failed to\ndisclose the Emails which would show that in or around 30 November 2013,\n\n\fMr Lee had given the Respondent instructions to amend the terms of his\nSixth Will by way of another will. In particular, the Respondent did not reveal\nthat Mr Lee had specifically sought the Respondent’s advice in November\n2013 on what was to be done with Oxley, nor did she disclose to the\n\nExecuters her Emails with Mr Lee on this issue.\n\n25.\n\nIt would have been evident to the Respondent that the Emails and her\n\ncommunications with Mr Lee in November to December 2013 were relevant\nto the inquiries made by LWL and LHL as:\n\na.\n\nThe Respondent issued the 4 June Letter in response to the specific\nrequests from LWL and LHL for “notes/emails/information on his\ninstructions to fthe Respondent] reqarding Oxiey’. The Emails are\nself-evidently relevant and material to the requests made to the\nRespondent.\n\nb.\n\nMr Lee had passed away in March 2015, less than 3 months before\nthe 4 June Letter was sent out. There was significant public interest\nand natiocn-wide discussion over the mainstream media and social\nmedia over whether Oxiey should be gazetted and preserved as a\nheritage site or demolished in honour of Mr Lee’s wishes. The said\nEmails recorded the fast time the Respondent had communicated\n\nwith Mr Lee in respect of Mr Lee’s testamentary intentions for Oxley,\nand immediately preceded the signing of his Last Wil These\ncorrespondences were therefore critical to understanding the\n\n\fcontext of Mr Lee's wishes and his underlying concerns regarding\nOxley, and in particular, the fact that Mr Lee had reiterated his\ntestamentary intention to ultimately have his family home at Oxley\ndemolished. Given Mr Lee’s standing as the former Prime Minister\n\nand founding father of modern Singapore and the historical\nsignificance of Oxley, the Respondent's records of her discussicns\nwith Mr Lee were both of personal importance to him and potentially\nof national importance.\n\nThe Respondent clearly understoed the scope and significance of\nthe requests made by LWL and LHL. In her 4 June Letter, she set\nout\n\na\n\ncomprehensive\n\nrecord\n\nof\n\nher\n\ndiscussions\n\nand\n\ncorrespondence with Mr Lee. The Respondent's account included\nher previous discussions with Mr Lee regarding Oxley, whether or\nnot it directly related to any of Mr Lee's wilis or resulted in any\nchanges to any of Mr Lee’s wills.\n\nShe had even put together\n\ncancelled versions of his previous wills to reconstruct all the\nrelevant events.\n\n26.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the Respondent then sent a further letter to the\nExecutors and LHL in response to further queries from LWL and LHL\n\nregarding the signing of the Last Will {the “22 June Letter”). In her email,\nthe Respondent explained\n\n“Further to my note to you dated 4 June 2015, [LHL] has asked me:\n1) For a copy of draft Will dated 19 August 2011;\n\n\f2) About the background which led to the signing of your\nfather’s last Will dated 17 December 2013 (\"Will no. 7')\"\n\n27.\n\nIt would similarly have been evident to the Respondent that Mr Lee's\ninstructions to her to amend the contents of his Sixth Will and Mr Lee’s\nrequest for her advice regarding Oxley (all of which were captured in the\nEmails between the Respondent and Mr Lee which were exchanged up to\n\n4 days before he signed his Last Will), would have been relevant to these\nspecific requests for information, and in light of the facts set out in\nparagraph 25 above. However, the Respondent omitted to disclose to the\n\nExecutors the fact of her communications with Mr Lee regarding his will\nand Oxley in November to December 2013, or the existence of the Emails\n\nbetween her and Mr Lee,\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent was also able te disclose another chain of emails dated\n16 December 2013 to 3 January 2014 relating to the execution of Mr Lee’s\nLast Will, i.e. shortly after the Emails were sent. However, she did not\ndisclose copies of the Emails or make mention of the communications\n\nbetween her and Mr Lee that were referenced in the Emails.\n\n29.\n\nInstead, in her 22 June Letter, the Respondent misrepresented to the\n\nExecutors in specific and unambiguous language that “[ajfter\n(Mr Lee Kuan\nYew] signed Wifl no. 6 dated 2™ November 2012, he did notinstruct [the\nRespondent] to change his Will'.\n\n\f1\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent’s statement was false and/or misleading, as the Emails\ndemonstrate that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had in fact instructed the Respondent\nto change his Sixth Will in his discussions with her in November to\nDecember 2013. His instructions and those discussions were recorded or\nreferenced in the Emails.\n\n31\n\nAfter the 4 June Letter and the 22 June Letter, the Respondent did not\n\nattempt to correct her misrepresentation that Mr Lee had not instructed her\nto change his will after his Sixth Will was executed or notify the Executors\nabout the existence or contents of the Emails.\n\n32.\n\nThereafter, the Executors, through their then solicitors, Rajah & Tann LLP,\nmade repeated requests to the Respondent for copies of all her documents\n\nand records on file in respect to Mr Lee’s wills. In or around March 2018, in\nresponse to the Executors’ requests, the Respondent provided copies of\n\nher records and documents to the Executors, including copies of the\nEmails. It was only then that the Executors discovered the existence of the\nEmails and learned that the Respondent had made false and/or misleading\n\nstatements in her 4 June Letter and 22 June Letter. The Respondent did\nnot disclose the existence of or copies of the Emails or make any attempt\nto correct the false and/or misleading statements in her 4 June Letter and\n22 June Letter at any time prior to March 2019.\n\n33\n\nThe Respondent's accounts in the 4 June Letter and the 22 June Letter\nwould have given the Executors the impression that Mr Lee had never\n\n\fexpressed to her his intention to change the terms of his Sixth Will or to\ndivide his estate equally between his children. This caused unnecessary\ndoubt and confusion about whether Mr Lee had intended to change his\nSixth Will, and what his concerns were in respect of Oxley prior to executing\n\nhis Last Will.\n\nThe Respondent omissions and misrepresentation to the Executors were\nmade knowingly and deliberately, or in the alternative, as a result of lack of\ncare and diligence on her part. The Respondent's actions, in knowingly and\ndeliberately making false and misleading statements and/or omitting to\nmention or failing to disclose information in response to the inquiries\nreceived from one of the Executors, would be in breach of her general\n\nduties of honesty, competence, due care and diigence under Rule 2{2) of\nthe PCR and would accordingly amount to a breach of Section 83(2)(h} of\nthe LPA.\n\n35.\n\nEven if the Respondent made false and misleading statements to the\n\nExecutors and/or had omitted disclosing information and documents in\nresponse to the Executors' specific inquiries unintentionally, be it as a result\nof carelessness, negligence and lack of due care and diligence, her\nconduct feli short of the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness\n\nexpected of a solicitor who found herself in the critical context and\ncircumstance that the Respondent was in, and would accordingly amount\n\nto a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n\fCHARGES\n36.\n\nAccordingly, the Complainant formulates the following charge against the\nRespondent.\n\nCHARGE\n\n37.\n\nYou, Mdm Kwa Kim Li, are charged that, by way of your letters dated 4\nJune and 22 June 2015, you misled the Executors of the Estate of your\nformer client Mr Lee Kuan Yew, namely Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, by omitting and/or otherwise failing to disclose your communications\nwith Mr Lee Kuan Yew between November 2013 to 13 December 2013 in\nresponse to their enquiries and/or by making the false and misleading\nrepresentation that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had never instructed you to change\nhis will dated 2 November 2012, such act amounting to misconduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(h} of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n2008 Rev Ed).\n\nDated this 25® day of July 2022\n™\n\nit\n—\nCounsel for the Complainant\nProvidence Law Asia LLC\n\n\f\fDT/18/2022\n\nIN THE MATTER OF KWA KIM LI\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n(CAP 161, 2009 REV ED)\n\nSTATEMENT OF DEFENCE\n(TO STATEMENT OF CASE OF THE COMPLAINANT)\n\nSolicitors for the Respondent\n\nMr Cavinder Bull SC\n\nMs Gerui Lim\nMs Elisabeth Liang\nDrew & Napier LLC\n10 Collyer Quay\n#10-01 Ocean Financial Centre\nSingapore 049315\n\nTel: 535 0733\nFax: 6535 4906\nRef: CAB/GRL/439722\n\nDated this 14\" day of November, 2022.\n\n\fWith regard to paragraph 14 of the SOC:\n\n(a)\n\nit is admitted that on 30 November 2013, the Respondent sent LKY\n\nan email to note the contents of an oral discussion between her and\nLKY. The discussion had taken place the previous night;\n\n(]\n\nthe second and third sentences of paragraph 14 of the SOC are\n\nadmitted, and\n\n(©)\n\nitis not admitted that LKY intended to make amendments to his last\nwill. As far as the Respondent was aware, LKY was in the midst of\nconsidering whether he would make amendments to his then-last\nwill dated 2 November 2012 (“Sixth Will\"), and also considering\npotential options available to him.\n\n[n her discussion with LKY on\n\nthe night of 29 November 2013 and in her email of 30 November\n2013, the Respondent had provided advice to LKY on potential\noptions for his consideration. As far as the Respondent was aware,\nLKY had not made any decisions nor given any instructions which\nhe wanted the Respondent to act on. In the past, LKY would\ntypically consider and discuss with the Respondent the possible\noptions available to him and consequences of any changes, and\n\ntake some time to mull over them. A number of times, he would also\ndiscuss his considerations with his children, before giving firm\ninstructions to the Respondent to act on.\n\n\fParagraph 15 of the SOC is admitted. The Respondent subsequently\ndeparted from Singapore to London on about 15 December 2013. Up till\nher departure from Singapore, the Respondent did not receive any\ncommunication from LKY to instruct her that he was ready to sign the\nproposed codicil. The Respondent did not prepare any such codicil.\n\n10.\n\nParagraph 16 of the SOC is admitted.\n\nVWhen the Respondent received\n\nLKY's email at 10.50pm on 13 December 2013, the Respondent\nunderstood LKY to mean that he was still in the midst of considering or\n\ncompiling amendments tc include or provide for in a codicil to his Sixth Will.\nAs the Respondent was departing for London shortly, she intended to have\nfurther discussions with LKY on his intentions after she returned to\nSingapore on about 21 December 2013.\n\n11\n\nHowever, as set out below, the abovementioned events were superseded\n\nby LKY’s execution of a new will.\n\n12.\n\nOn 17 December 2013 and shortly before 2.59pm, the Respondent sighted\nan email from Mrs Lee Suet Fern (“LSF\") to her dated 17 December 2013\nwhich had been sent around 1.16pm. LSF’s email stated, infer afia, “just a\n\nquick note to say this has been dealt with aiready.”\n\n13.\n\nEmbedded in LSF's email dated 17 December 2013 was an earlier email\ndated 16 December 2013 from LSF to LKY sent at around 7.08pm.\nAlthough the 16 December 2013 email had been copied to the Respondent\nand the Complainant, the Respondent had not sighted this email previously\n\n\fand did not appear to have received it. LSF's 16 December 2013 email\nstated:\n“Dear Pa Pa\nThis was the original agreed Will which ensures that all 3 children\nreceive equal shares, taking into account the relative valuations (as\nat the date of demise) of the properties each receives\nKim Li\n\nGrateful if you could please engross.\nKind regards\n\nFern”\n\n14.\n\nReading LSF’s emails dated 16 and 17 December 2013 together, the\nRespondent understood LSF's email of 17 December 2013 to mean that:\n\n(@\n\nfollowing LKY’s discussions with LSF and/or the Complainant, LKY\nhad instructed LSF to prepare a new will for his execution;\n\n(b)\n\nthe new will had since been prepared and engrossed without the\nRespondent's knowledge and involvement, and executed by LKY\n\n(\"Seventh Will\"); and\n\n(©)\n\nthe Sixth Will was accordingly revoked and superseded by LKY's\nlatest Seventh Will.\n\n15.\n\nShortly after reading LSF's emails dated 16 and 17 December 2013, the\nRespondent emailed LSF on 17 December 2013 at around 2.59pm to\ninform LSF that the Respondent did not seem to have received LSF's email\n\n\fdated 16 December 2013. The Respondent also asked whether LSF's\nemail dated 17 December 2013 meant that “[LKY] has signed a new will\nyesterday, in which case the former will which is on my record, is revoked?\nIf so, | will update my fite record.”\n\n16.\n\nLSF replied to the Respondent by an email dated 17 December 2013 sent\nat around 3.10pm. LSF stated, “Yes, he has signed already. In fact this is\ngoing back to his 2011 will so it supercedes all. He read it extremely\ncarefully before signing.”\n\n17.\n\nBased on LSF’s above statements:\n\n(a)\n\nLKY's latest testamentary wishes were set out in his Seventh Wil\n\n{b)\n\nit was implicit that LKY had decided not to proceed with the possible\ncodicil to the Sixth Will that he had previously discussed with the\nRespondent; and\n\n(¢}\n\nthere was nothing further for the Respondent to do apart from\nupdating her file record to note that the Sixth Will had been revoked\nand superseded.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent does not plead to paragraph 17 of the SOC.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent has no personal knowledge of the matters pleaded at the\nfirst sentence of paragraph 18 of the SOC and does not plead to the same.\n\n\fParagraphs 12 to 17 of the Statement of Defence {\"SOD\") are repeated.\nThe second sentence of paragraph 18 of the SOC is admitted.\n\n20\n\nThe first sentence of paragraph 19 of the SOC is admitted. The second\nsentence of paragraph 19 is admitted insofar\nas the Complainants obtained\na grant of probate on 6 October 2015 in respect of LKY's estate.\n\n21\n\nParagraph 20 of the SOC is admitted. The Respondent understood Ms Lee\n\nWei Ling’s (“LWL\") request to be for information about LKY's intentions with\nregard to his property at 38 Oxley Road (‘Oxley Property”) as expressed\nin the six wills which the Respondent had prepared for LKY and which LKY\nhad executed {\"Six Wills\").\n\n22\n\nWith regard to paragraph 21 of the SOC, the Respondent's letter dated 4\nJune 2015 was sent in response to requests from LWL and Mr Lee Hsien\n\nLoong (“LHL\") for information focusing on LKY’s intentions with regard to\nthe Oxley Property. Save as aforesaid, paragraph 21 of the SOC is denied\n\n23\n\nParagraph 22 of the SOC is denied. The Respondent's 4 June 2015 letter\ndid not purport to be a comprehensive account of her discussions with Mr\nLee regarding his testamentary wishes. The Respondent's 4 June 2015\nletter expressly stated that its purpose was to \"summarise your father’s\nWills based on my file records chronologically, focusing again on Oxley.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n\f24.\n\nParagraph 23 of the SOC is admitted insofar as the Respondent's letter\n\ndated 4 June 2015 had provided points of information and documents\nwhich were materially relevant to her summary of the Six Wills focusing on\nthe Oxley Property.\n\n25.\n\nWith regard to paragraph 24 of SOC:\n\n(@\n\nit is admitted the Respondent's letter dated 4 June 2015 did not\nrefer to or attach copies of her emails with LKY dated 3C November\n\n2013, 12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013. These emails\nwere not material to, and did not impact any of the Six Wills which\nwere summarised in the Respondent's letter dated 4 June 2015 with\na focus on the Oxley Property;\n\n(b)\n\nwhen the Respondent prepared the 4 June 2015 letter, she did not\nrecall her emails with LKY dated 30 November 2013, 12 December\n2013 and 13 December 2013. Those emails had not registered with\nthe Respondent as having any particular significance and/or\n\nmaterial import, because they had never led to any decision or\ninstructions by LKY in relation to Oxley Praperty, ncr any decision\nor instructions by LKY for the Respondent to change his Sixth Will,\n\nnor any draft instrument being prepared by the Respondent.\nParagraphs 7 to 17 of the SOD are repeated; and\n\n©\n\nsave as expressly admitied above, paragraph 24 of the SOC is\ndenied.\n\n\f26.\n\nWith regard to paragraph 25 of the SOC including subparagraphs 25(a) to\n25(c):\n\n(@)\n\nthe first sentence of subparagraph 25(a) is admitted;\n\n(b)\n\nthe first sentence of subparagraph 25(b) is admitted. The second\nsentence of subparagraph 25(b) is admitted insofar as there were\n\nsubstantial discussions in mainstream media and social media over\nthe approepriate treatment of the Oxley Property and LKY's wishes\n\nfor the Oxley Property. it is admitted that LKY's standing was as\nthe former Prime Minister and founding father of modern Singapore;\n\n(©)\n\nwith regard to paragraph 25(c), paragraphs 21, 22 and 24 of the\nSOD are repeated; and\n\n(d)\n\nsave as expressly admitted above, paragraph 25 of the SOC\nincluding subparagraphs 25(a) to 25(c) are denied.\n\n27.\n\nParagraph 26 of the SOC is admitted, save that LWL and LHY were not\nExecutors of LKY's estate at the time the Respondent sent the 22 June\n2015 letter to LHL, LWL and LHY.\n\n28.\n\nParagraph 27 of the SOC is denied. Paragraphs 7 to 17 of the SOD are\nrepeated.\n\n\f10\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent was not involved in the preparation of LKY’s Seventh Will\nand did not discuss or receive any instructions from LKY regarding the\ncontents of his Seventh Will. Where the Respondent had received further\nqueries from LHL and LWL about the “background which led to the signing\nof [LKY's] last Will dated 17 December 2013\", the Respondent’s letter dated\n22 June 2015 had accurately and truthfully conveyed the fact that any\ninstructions given by LKY for the preparation of the Seventh Will, and his\nexecution of the Seventh Will, had occurred without the Respondent’s\ninvolvement.\n\nThis was evident from two email chains enclosed to the\n\nRespondent's 22 June 2015 letter, namely:\n\n(a)\n\nthe emails from LSF pleaded at paragraphs 12 to 16 of the SOD;\n\n(b)\n\nan email dated 3 January 2014 from Mdm Wong Lin Hoe (with\ntraiting emails) which inter alia: (i) recorded that the Respondent\n\nhad merely been provided copies of the Seventh Will and a\nsubsequent codicil after they were executed “for her record\", while\nthe originals were kept in LKY's office. This differed from LKY’s\nusual practice in respect of the Six Wils prepared by the\nRespondent, where he had asked the Respondent to safekeep the\noriginals of the Six Wills for him; and (i) also showed that after LSF's\nemail dated 16 December 2013, arrangements were made for LKY\nto execute the Seventh Will without the Respondent’s involvement.\n\n30.\n\nParagraph 28 of the SOC is admitted. The Respondent's letter dated 22\nJune 2015 enclosed the email chains referred to at paragraph 28 of the\n\n\f1\n\nSOC because they were relevant to communicating the matters pleaded at\n\nparagraph 28 of the SOD above\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent’s letter dated 22 June 2015 did not enclose the emails\n\ndated 30 November 2013, 12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013,\nThese were not relevant or material to the Respondent’s responses in her\n\nletter dated 22 June 2015, which only addressed the two queries pleaded\nat paragraph 26 of the SOC. When the Respondent prepared her letter\ndated 22 June 2015, she alsc did not recall her emails with LKY dated 30\nNovember 2013, 12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013, which had\n\nnot registered with her as having any particular significance and/or material\nimport because they had never led to any decision or instructions by LKY\nfor the Respondent to change his Sixth Will, nor any draft instrument being\nprepared by the Respondent. Paragraphs 7 to 17 of the SOD are repeated.\n\n32.\n\nSave where a statement from the Respondent’s letter dated 22 June 2015\nis reproduced at paragraph 29 of the SOC, paragraphs 29 and 30 of the\nSOC are denied. It was not a misrepresentation, nor false or misleading,\n\nfor the Respondent’s letter dated 22 June 2015 to state that LKY had not\ninstructed the Respondent to change his Sixth Will. That statement was\ntruthful and accurate. Contrary to paragraph 30 of the SOC, LKY did not\n\ngive the Respondent any instructions to change his Sixth Will in his\ndiscussions with her in November to December 2013. Further, the emails\n\ndated 30 November 2013, 12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013 did\nnot contain or lead to any instructions by LKY for the Respondent to change\nhis Sixth Will. In addition, the Sixth Will was never changed by any\n\n\f12\n\ninstrument prepared by the Respondent upon LKY’s instructions, nor did\n\nthe Respondent prepare any draft instrument with the intention of changing\nthe Sixth Will. The Sixth Will was superseded by the Seventh Will which\nwas\n\ninstructed,\n\nprepared\n\nand\n\nexecuted\n\nwithout the\n\nRespondent's\n\ninvolvement. Paragraphs 7 to 17 of the SOD are repeated.\n\n33.\n\nIn respect of paragraph 31\n\nof the SOC, the Respondent did not\n\nsubsequently attempt to correct statements in her 4 and 22 June 2015\nletters because she had not misrepresented facts as alleged or at all.\n\nParagraph 31 of the SOC is therefore denied.\n\n34.\n\nThe first two sentences of paragraph 32 of the SOC are admitted. The third\nand fourth sentences of paragraph 32 of the SOC are denied, including the\nallegation that false and/or misleading statements had been made by the\n\nRespondent in her letters dated 4 and 22 June 2015.\n\n35.\n\nParagraphs 33, 34 and 35 of the SOC are denied.\n\n36.\n\nThere is no basis for the charge formulated in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the\n\nSOC. The Respondent denies the charge set out in paragraph 37 of the\nSOC.\n\nDated this 14% day of November, 2022.\n\ne\n\nSOLICITORS FOR THE RESPONDENT\nDREW & NAPIER LLC\n\n\f\f9\\\ne\n\n\\/\nAMENDED 15t ALTERNATIVE CHARGE\n\nYOU, KWA KIM Li an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\n\nof Singapore are charged that you on or about the 4™ day of June\n2015 by your letter dated 4!

She was admitted to the roll of advocates\nand solicitors on 16 January 1980.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is and was at the material times the Managing Partner of\nLee & Lee (“the Firm”).\n\n3.\n\nThe original Complainants, Ms Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang\n(“LWL” and “LHY” respectively), are the sole Executors and Trustees of the\nEstate of Mr Lee Kuan Yew (the “Executors”). LHY, LWL and Mr Lee Hsien\nLoong (“LHL”), are siblings and the children of Mr Lee Kuan Yew (“Mr\nLee”).\n\n4.\n\nPrior to his death, Mr Lee executed a total of eight wills. The Respondent\nwas Mr Lee’s solicitor who drafted and engrossed six of his wills between\nAugust 2011 and November 2012, each of which was signed by Mr Lee\nand dated as follows:\na.\n\n20 August 2011;\n\nb.\n\n21 December 2011;\n\nc.\n\n6 September 2012;\n\nd.\n\n20 September 2012;\n\ne.\n\n4 October 2012; and\n\nf.\n\n2 November 2012 (“2 November 2012 Will”).\n\n(collectively referred to as Mr Lee’s “Six Wills”)\n\n2\n\n\f5.\n\nIn or around end-November 2013 there were discussions between Mr Lee\nand the Respondent on whether he wished to draft a new will and if so,\nwhat might be included in such a further will.\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 November 2013, the Respondent sent Mr Lee an email to record the\ncontents of an oral discussion which had taken place between her and Mr\nLee the previous night (“30 November Email”). Amongst other things, the\nemail recorded that Mr Lee had asked the Respondent to re-cap the\ncontents of his 2 November 2012 Will, and that Mr Lee had raised the\npossibility that his family home at 38 Oxley Road (“Oxley Property”) might\nbe “de-gazetted” after his passing and sought the Respondent’s advice on\nthe legal implications if that were to happen. The Respondent concluded\nthe email by asking Mr Lee to “Please let [her] know [his] thoughts, and\n[she] can make the appropriate changes to the Will”.\n\n7.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, the Respondent sent an email to Mr Lee (“12\nDecember Email”) stating:\n\n“Under your present will dated 2 Nov 2012, [LWL] has been given\n1 share more than [LHL] and [LHY], out of your total estate. This is\nbecause you reasoned that [LWL] does not have double income like\nher brothers.\nWe discussed last week that you would now like to sign a Codicil to\nchange this, and to give [LWL] equal shares with [LHL] and [LHY]\nout of the total estate.\n\n3\n\n\fI will prepare the codicil for you to sign this week, or when you are\nready.\nRegarding the Oxley property, I have some thoughts and will call\nyou later today.”\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 December 2013, Mr Lee sent an email to the Respondent (“13\nDecember Email”) stating:\n\n“Another amendment is a codicil to specify that two carpets: a silk\none on the wall over my PV and another a larger woollen one on\nthe wall above the bed in my bedroom, to go to [LHY].”\n9.\n\nThe 30 November Email, 12 December Email and the 13 December Email\nare collectively referred to as the “Emails”.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent subsequently departed from Singapore to London on\nabout 15 December 2013. The Respondent did not prepare any codicil for\nMr Lee.\n\n11.\n\nWhile the Respondent was overseas, Mr Lee executed his last will and\ntestament dated 17 December 2013 (“Last Will”). In his Last Will, Mr Lee\nnamed LHY and LWL as the only executors and trustees of his estate. LHL\nwas not named as an executor and trustee of Mr Lee’s estate.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent was informed by Mrs Lee Suet Fern (“LSF”) that Mr Lee\nhad executed the Last Will. LSF sent the Respondent an email dated 17\nDecember 2013 at around 1.16pm. The email stated, inter alia, “just a quick\n\n4\n\n\fnote to say this has been dealt with already”. Embedded in LSF’s email\ndated 17 December 2013 was an earlier email dated 16 December 2013\nsent from LSF to Mr Lee at around 7.08pm. LSF’s 16 December 2013 email\nstated:\n“Dear Pa Pa\nThis was the original agreed Will which ensures that all 3 children\nreceive equal shares, taking into account the relative valuations (as\nat the date of demise) of the properties each receives.\nKim Li\nGrateful if you could please engross.\nKind regards\nFern”\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent emailed LSF on 17 December 2013 at around 2.59pm.\nHer email stated that she did not seem to have received LSF’s email dated\n16 December 2013. The Respondent also asked whether LSF’s email\ndated 17 December 2013 meant that “[Mr Lee] has signed a new will\nyesterday, in which case the former will which is on my record, is revoked?\nIf so, I will update my file record.”\n\n14.\n\nLSF replied to the Respondent by an email dated 17 December 2013 sent\nat around 3.10pm. LSF stated, “Yes, he has signed already. In fact this is\ngoing back to his 2011 will so it supercedes all. He read it extremely\ncarefully before signing.”\n\n5\n\n\f15.\n\nMr Lee passed away on 23 March 2015.\n\n16.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, LWL wrote to the Respondent to request information\nabout Mr Lee’s wills.\n\n17.\n\nOn 4 June 2015, in response to LWL’s request and a separate request from\nLHL for information focusing on LKY’s intentions with regard to the Oxley\nProperty, the Respondent issued a letter to the Executors and LHL titled\n“Chronology of 6 Wills – my file records with focus on Oxley” (the “4 June\nLetter”) with enclosures.\n\n18.\n\nThe 4 June Letter stated, amongst other things:\n“To:\nHsien Loong, Wei Ling, and Hsien Yang\n4 June 2015.\nLoong and Ling have requested me for file records of your father's\nprevious Wills, for notes/emails/information on his instructions to me\nregarding Oxley.\nI thought best to write this note addressed to the 3 of you as the only\nbeneficiaries of his Estate.\nYour father signed 6 Wills with me over the period of August 2011 to\nNovember 2012. (2 in 2011, and 4 in 2012).\nHe instructed me several times, by phone, by email and personally at\nhis office typically in the evenings before his Chinese class.\nI attach file copies of the 6 cancelled Wills, numbered 1 to 6 for ease.\nBackground why your father signed 6 Wills over 15 months.\nRegarding the 6 Wills which your father signed over August 2011 to\nNovember 2012, I would estimate that I prepared at least 15 drafts for\nhis review over that period, to take into account the many changes he\nwanted to make. There were also one or two occasions that I went to\nhis office for signing after he approved the draft Will, but he had second\nthoughts, did not sign the Will and asked for further changes. I am\ntelling you these details for you to know that your father spent much\ntime and thought on his 6 Wills.\n\n6\n\n\fMuch of the discussions and changes revolved around:\n1) Where Ling is to stay - at Oxley or in his other properties, or at Ho\nChing's Belle Vue apartment, whether or not to give Ling a life interest\nin Oxley.\n2) The division of the Estate - although he was aware that it was\nintended/agreed that he would divide his entire Estate into 3 equal\nshares for the 3 children, he asked me to prepare Wills no. 3 and 6\nwhere the Estate was to be divided unequally. He said he would talk to\nthe children to inform them why he wanted to divide the Estate\nunequally.\n3) Oxley - how to give the children least problem after he is gone.\nYou have asked me to focus on Oxley. I set out a brief 3 point\nsummary regarding the Oxley Clauses in the 6 Wills:\n…\nI now summarise your father’s Wills based on my file records\nchronologically, focusing again on Oxley…”\n19.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the Respondent sent a further letter to LWL, LHY and\nLHL in response to further queries from LWL and LHL regarding the signing\nof the Last Will (the “22 June Letter”). The letter stated:\n“Dear Hsien Loong, Wei Ling and Hsien Yang,\nFurther to my note to you dated 4 June 2015, [LHL] has asked me:\n1) For a copy of draft Will dated 19th August 2011;\n2) About the background which led to the signing of your father’s last\nWill dated 17 December 2013 (“Will no. 7”)\nWei Ling also asked me the same question 2 in May 2014.\nI thought it best to write to all of you, so that everyone has the same\nreply from me.\nAfter your father signed Will no. 6 dated 2nd November 2012, he did\nnot instruct me to change his Will.\nI first learnt about Will no. 7 via email from Fern and Lin Hoe.”\n\n7\n\n\f20.\n\nThe 22 June Letter enclosed copies of emails dated 16 December 2013 to\n3 January 2014 relating to the execution of Mr Lee’s Last Will.\n\n21.\n\nOn 6 October 2015, the Executors obtained a grant of probate in respect\nof Mr Lee’s estate.\n\n22.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, the Executors, through their then solicitors, Rajah &\nTann LLP, asked the Respondent for copies of all her documents and\nrecords on file in respect to Mr Lee’s wills. In or around 8 March 2019, in\nresponse to the Executors’ requests, the Respondent provided copies of\nher records and documents to the Executors, including copies of the\nEmails. The Emails had not been enclosed to the 4 June or 22 June Letters.\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, the Executors filed a complaint against the\nRespondent (“Complaint”). The Complaint comprised four distinct heads\nof complaint. The fourth head of complaint, namely that the Respondent\nhad given the Executors false and misleading information in her 4 June and\n22 June Letters, is the subject of the present charge.\n\nDated this 31st day of January 2023\n\n8\n\n\f","timestamp":"2024-02-12T04:00:28+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-feb-2024/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Teo Eng Thye (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-teo-eng-thye-respondent-advocate-solicitor\">In the Matter of Teo Eng Thye (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Ms Goh Yng Yng Karen (<strong>the Complainant</strong>), who was the daughter of the late Mdm Liew Khoon Fong (<strong>Mdm Liew</strong>) and executrix of Mdm Liew’s will.</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-517831161\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>The complaint arose from two Powers of Attorney (<strong>POA</strong>) dated 20 November 2017. POA 6414 was related to the sale of 107 Namly Avenue (<strong>Namly Property</strong>), while POA 6417 was related to the purchase of a condominium unit (<strong>Condominium Unit</strong>). At the material time, Mdm Liew was 87 years old.</p>\n<p>On or around 17 November 2017, Mdm Liew’s son (<strong>Kelvin</strong>), as well as Kelvin’s wife (<strong>Jacqueline</strong>), visited the Respondent to seek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew who was not present at this meeting.</p>\n<p>On Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on or around 20 November 2017. The Respondent had prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any other authority, from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her behalf.</p>\n<p>The Respondent met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time on 20 November 2017 at the Namly Property. Kelvin, Jacqueline, their sons, one Goh Eng Sheng Daniel (<strong>Daniel</strong>) and one Goh Eng Chun David (<strong>David</strong>) were present. Mdm Liew signed the POAs at this meeting.</p>\n<p>POA 6414 authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s behalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then 19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium Unit.</p>\n<p>POA 6417 authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in Mdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as a joint owner. It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from banks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if the sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also authorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and purchase agreement on behalf of Mdm Liew.</p>\n<p>On 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an Option to Purchase (<strong>OTP</strong>) to buyers for the purchase of the Namly Property. The OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017, and the Respondent was appointed by Kelvin to act as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer with respect to the sale of the Namly Property.</p>\n<p>On 1 December 2017, the OTP for the Condominium Unit was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline with the OTP being exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. The Respondent also acted for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew in this transaction.</p>\n<p>On 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been lodged against the Namly Property.</p>\n<p>On 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (<strong>Suit 45</strong>) in her capacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney to stop the sale of the Namly Property. On 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the mental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and declared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but had given evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p>Mdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020.</p>\n<p>The Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Davinder Singh SC, and Mr K Anparasan as DT member to investigate the complaint.</p>\n<p>Seven charges were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h4><strong>First Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (<strong>LPA</strong>), in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, without ensuring that Kelvin had the authority to give those instructions on behalf of Mdm Liew, and when the Respondent had no evidence of such authority, failed to obtain confirmation of the said instructions from Mdm Liew regarding the preparation and drafting of the said POAs, in breach of Rule 5(5)(a) and 5(5)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>PCR</strong>).</p>\n<h4><strong>Second Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, and permitted Mdm Liew to execute the said POAs without first taking sufficient steps to satisfy himself that Mdm Liew understood the nature and effect of the terms that were set out in the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Third Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, by failing to take sufficient steps to safeguard Mdm Liew’s interests by ensuring that he received his instructions, and explained the nature and effect of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017, to Mdm Liew without the presence of the attorney or other family members of the attorney so as to avoid any undue influence being exerted over the client, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fourth Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew, Kelvin and Jacqueline in the purchase of the Condominium Unit, where there was a diversity of interests that existed between the parties, and failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s and/or Jacqueline’s interests, by removing Mdm Liew’s name from the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rules 20(5) and 20(6) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Fifth Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect her interests in respect of the purchase of the Condominium Unit, in particular the removal of her name, the non-inclusion of Daniel’s name, and the inclusion of Jacqueline’s name, in the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sixth Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect Mdm Liew’s interests in respect of the POAs, in particular the medical report prepared by Dr Ang Yong Guan and correspondence from Templars Law LLC relating to Mdm Liew’s alleged lack of mental capacity as at the time of the execution of the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.</p>\n<h4><strong>Seventh Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor in the discharge of his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section 83(2)(h) of the Act, in that the Respondent, who had acted for Mdm Liew in respect of the matters that were the subject-matter of Suit 45, failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s interests, by failing to take Mdm Liew’s instructions or her donee’s instructions when he was served with a subpoena by solicitors acting in Suit 45, and instead taking Kelvin’s instructions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT found that the First Charge and Second Charge were made out, while the remaining Charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p>With reference to the <strong>First Charge</strong>, the DT noted that the disparity between the Respondent’s evidence about the meeting on 20 November 2017 and what was said in the Respondent’s Attendance Note was simply too huge to be credibly accounted for.

POA 6414 was related to the sale of 107 Namly Avenue (Namly Property), while POA 6417 was related to the purchase of a condominium unit (Condominium Unit). At the material time, Mdm Liew was 87 years old.\n\nOn or around 17 November 2017, Mdm Liew’s son (Kelvin), as well as Kelvin’s wife (Jacqueline), visited the Respondent to seek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew who was not present at this meeting.\n\nOn Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on or around 20 November 2017. The Respondent had prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any other authority, from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her behalf.\n\nThe Respondent met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time on 20 November 2017 at the Namly Property. Kelvin, Jacqueline, their sons, one Goh Eng Sheng Daniel (Daniel) and one Goh Eng Chun David (David) were present. Mdm Liew signed the POAs at this meeting.\n\nPOA 6414 authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s behalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then 19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium Unit.\n\nPOA 6417 authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in Mdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as a joint owner. It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from banks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if the sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also authorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and purchase agreement on behalf of Mdm Liew.\n\nOn 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an Option to Purchase (OTP) to buyers for the purchase of the Namly Property. The OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017, and the Respondent was appointed by Kelvin to act as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer with respect to the sale of the Namly Property.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, the OTP for the Condominium Unit was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline with the OTP being exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. The Respondent also acted for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew in this transaction.\n\nOn 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been lodged against the Namly Property.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (Suit 45) in her capacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney to stop the sale of the Namly Property. On 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the mental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and declared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but had given evidence at the trial.\n\nMdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020.\n\nThe Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) presided by Mr Davinder Singh SC, and Mr K Anparasan as DT member to investigate the complaint.\n\nSeven charges were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nFirst Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (LPA), in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, without ensuring that Kelvin had the authority to give those instructions on behalf of Mdm Liew, and when the Respondent had no evidence of such authority, failed to obtain confirmation of the said instructions from Mdm Liew regarding the preparation and drafting of the said POAs, in breach of Rule 5(5)(a) and 5(5)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (PCR).\n\nSecond Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, and permitted Mdm Liew to execute the said POAs without first taking sufficient steps to satisfy himself that Mdm Liew understood the nature and effect of the terms that were set out in the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.\n\nThird Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, by failing to take sufficient steps to safeguard Mdm Liew’s interests by ensuring that he received his instructions, and explained the nature and effect of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017, to Mdm Liew without the presence of the attorney or other family members of the attorney so as to avoid any undue influence being exerted over the client, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.\n\nFourth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew, Kelvin and Jacqueline in the purchase of the Condominium Unit, where there was a diversity of interests that existed between the parties, and failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s and/or Jacqueline’s interests, by removing Mdm Liew’s name from the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rules 20(5) and 20(6) of the PCR.\n\nFifth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect her interests in respect of the purchase of the Condominium Unit, in particular the removal of her name, the non-inclusion of Daniel’s name, and the inclusion of Jacqueline’s name, in the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.\n\nSixth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect Mdm Liew’s interests in respect of the POAs, in particular the medical report prepared by Dr Ang Yong Guan and correspondence from Templars Law LLC relating to Mdm Liew’s alleged lack of mental capacity as at the time of the execution of the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.\n\nSeventh Charge\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor in the discharge of his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section 83(2)(h) of the Act, in that the Respondent, who had acted for Mdm Liew in respect of the matters that were the subject-matter of Suit 45, failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s interests, by failing to take Mdm Liew’s instructions or her donee’s instructions when he was served with a subpoena by solicitors acting in Suit 45, and instead taking Kelvin’s instructions.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions\n\nThe DT found that the First Charge and Second Charge were made out, while the remaining Charges were dismissed.\n\nWith reference to the First Charge, the DT noted that the disparity between the Respondent’s evidence about the meeting on 20 November 2017 and what was said in the Respondent’s Attendance Note was simply too huge to be credibly accounted for. The DT further observed that it was not just the nature, terms and implications of the POAs which required careful explanation, but also the issues arising from the interaction between the two POAs.\n\nThe DT stated that as Mdm Liew was 87 years old at the time and had difficulty speaking, the Respondent should not only have carefully explained the relevant matters, but should also have asked if they were in line with her wishes and instructions and how she thought they were in her interests – including asking why she felt that it was in her interest for the POAs to be irrevocable. Also, as Mdm Liew was unable to communicate her understanding verbally or in writing, the Respondent should have called for a pause and asked for her condition to be reviewed by an independent medical expert or declined to act for her.\n\nTwo specific red flags were raised by the DT – (1) the fact that Mdm Liew nodded when the Respondent read the POAs to her, in light of these particular POAs that he was asked to draft by Kelvin, and the fact that one of them dealt with the disposal of her home, it should not have been accepted by the Respondent as evidence that she understood the terms, nature and consequences in the POA; (2) the fact that she did not ask any questions in light of the issues in the POAs should have raised a red flag.\n\nCrucially, the Respondent also did not take steps to meet Mdm Liew privately and without the presence of Kelvin and Daniel, who stood to benefit from the POAs, and their family members to determine whether Mdm Liew was acting under any misrepresentation, misapprehension or improper influence. The Respondent also did not ask Mdm Liew whether the POAs accorded with her wishes under any will.\n\nAs for the Second Charge, the DT found that the offending conduct was the same, hence it did not add to the Respondent’s culpability.\n\nIn the Third Charge, the DT found that this aspect of the Respondent’s conduct was insufficient to amount to a breach of Rule 5(2)(c), and his conduct should not be viewed in isolation, and was just one of the matters that has to be taken into account in determining whether the Respondent breached his duties.\n\nThe Fourth to Seventh Charges were dismissed based on the fact that Law Society had failed to discharge its burden to show that there was in law a solicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and Mdm Liew at the material time in relation to the Condominium Unit.\n\nThe Respondent was ordered to pay a financial penalty that was sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed, and the Law Society’s costs of $5,000.\n\nCouncil accepted the findings and recommendations of the DT and imposed a financial penalty of $2,000 on the Respondent.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawsoc-mc-assets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dtr-2023-06-c.pdf","pdf-content":"DT/SEC/21/2021\n\nIN THE MATTER OF TEO ENG THYE\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n(CHAPTER 161)\nBetween\nTHE LAW SOCIETY OF SINGAPORE\n....Applicant\nAnd\nTEO ENG THYE\n....Respondent\n\nMr Davinder Singh, S.C.

She is the daughter of the late Mdm\nLiew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) (“Mdm Liew”) and executrix of Mdm Liew’s\n\nwill.\nGoh Yong Chiang Kelvin (“Kelvin”) is Mdm Liew’s son. His wife is Goh Sok\nNgoh Jacqueline (“Jacqueline”). Goh Eng Sheng Daniel (“Daniel”) is one of their\ntwo sons.\n\n\fThe Respondent is Mr Teo Eng Thye. He is an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore and was admitted on 19 April 2000. He is, and was at\nall material times, a director of City Law LLC.\n\nThe Complainant’s complaints arise from two Powers of Attorney dated 20\nNovember 2017. Both were lodged with the Supreme Court of Singapore as HC/PA\n6414/2017 (“POA 6414”) and HC/PA 6417/2017 (“POA 6417”). POA 6414\nrelated to the sale of 107 Namly Avenue, Singapore 267676 (the “Namly\nProperty”) and POA 6417 related to the purchase of a condominium unit (the\n“Condominium Unit”).\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (“Suit 45”) in her\n\ncapacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney registered\non 16 September 2014 (the “2014 LPA”), inter alia, against Kelvin in relation to\nthe sale of Namly Property.\n\nOn 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the\nmental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and\ndeclared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but gave\nevidence at the trial of that Suit.\n\nTHE HEARING AND THE WITNESSES\n\nThe Disciplinary Tribunal (the “DT”) was constituted on 8 October 2021. The\nhearing took place on 4 and 5 May 2022.\n\nThe Applicant called the Complainant as its only witness.\n\nThe Respondent gave evidence on his own behalf. He did not call any other witness.\n\n\fTHE UNDISPUTED FACTS\n\n10.\n\nThe following matters are not in dispute’.\n\n11.\n\nMdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020. The Complainant was also the executrix\nof Mdm Liew’s will.\n\n12\n\nOn or around 17 November 2017, Kelvin and Jacqueline visited the Respondent to\nseek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew, who was not present at this\nmeeting. The Respondent recorded a summary of Kelvin’s instructions in a note\ndated 17 November 2017.\n\n13.\n\nOn Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on\n\nor around 20 November 2017. The Respondent accepts that Mdm Liew was his\nclient.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any\nother authority from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her\nbehalf.\n\n15.\n\nAt 12.28pm on 20 November 2017, the Respondent’s secretary emailed the two\ndraft POAs to Kelvin’s email address kjgoh@hotmail.com on the Respondent’s\nbehalf. In that email, he requested that Kelvin “go thru [sic] the drafis and let us\nhave your comments ifany.”\n\n16.\n\nAt around Spm on 20 November 2017, the Respondent visited the Namly Property.\nThere, he met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time in connection with the\nPOAs and their execution (the “Meeting”). Kelvin, Jacqueline and their sons,\n\nDaniel and Goh Eng Chun David, were present throughout.\n17.\n\nMdm Liew listened and nodded while the Respondent took her through the POAs.\n\n! The DT has in this section and others adopted in many places the language that the parties\nhave used in the pleadings, affidavits of evidence and submissions\n\n\f18.\n\nVery generally speaking, the first POA authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s\nbehalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then\n19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium\nUnit (the “1* POA™).\n\n19.\n\nBroadly, the second POA authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in\nMdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as\na joint owner (the “2™ POA”). It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from\nbanks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if\nthe sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also\nauthorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and\npurchase agreement, on behalf of Mdm Liew.\n\n20.\n\nMdm Liew signed the POAs at the Meeting. She was 87 years old at the time.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent prepared an attendance note of the Meeting (the “Attendance\nNote”).\n\n22\n\nOn 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an option to “Leow Tang Liea and/or\nnominees” to purchase the Namly Property (the “Namly OTP”). Leow Tang Lie\nwas, at the material time, a director of Pinnacle Development (Greenmead) Pte Ltd\n(“Pinnacle”). The Namly OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017. Pursuant to the\n1% POA, Kelvin appointed the Respondent as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer\n\nwith respect to the sale of the Namly Property.\n23.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, the Option to Purchase the Condominium Unit (the\n“Condominium OTP”) was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline.\n\n24.\n\nThe Condominium OTP was exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of\nKelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. On the same day, the Respondent furnished the\nsigned acceptance copy of the Condominium OTP to the seller’s solicitors, Sterling\n\n\fLaw Corporation (“SterlingLaw”). In that letter, the Respondent said he was\nacting for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. Daniel was not named as a purchaser\nin the Condominium OTP.\n25.\n\nAccording to the e-Notice of Transfer, the Condominium Unit was sold to Kelvin\nand Jacqueline on 8 December 2017.\n\n26.\n\nOn or about 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been\nlodged against the Namly Property in favour of Pinnacle. Following this discovery,\nthe Complainant instructed her lawyers, Templars Law, to write to Pinnacle’s\nsolicitors, WongPartnership, to persuade Pinnacle to defer the completion of the\nsale of the Namly Property.\n\n27\n\nOn 15 December 2017, Templars Law wrote to WongPartnership to draw attention\nto the unusual circumstances surrounding the sale of the Namly Property and asked\nthat Pinnacle agree to defer the completion of the sale until Mdm Liew’s mental\ncapacity could be determined by a medical expert. That letter also added that the\nComplainant was the sole donee under the 2014 LPA, that the Complainant\nreasonably believed that Mdm Liew’s mental capacity had significantly\ndeteriorated since September 2017, and that Kelvin had moved Mdm Liew to an\n\nunknown location?.\n28.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, Templars Law sent the 2014 LPA to WongPartnership®.\n\n29.\n\nOn 30 December 2017, Dr Ang Yong Guan issued a medical report in respect of\n\nMdm Liew’s mental capacity\".\n30.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, Templars Law wrote to WongPartnership and enclosed Dr\nAng’s report. The report stated that the 1 POA was invalid and unenforceable, and\n\n2 page 1044 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n* page 1048 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n“ page 1064 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n\n\fthat Mdm Liew lacked the mental capacity to make the decision to sell the Namly\n\nProperty. Templars Law asked that the sale be stopped®.\n31.\n\nBy an email and a letter dated 10 January 2018, Templars Law wrote to\n\nWongPartnership to ask if they had instructions to accept service of process on\n\nbehalf oftheir client’.\n32.\n\nOn 10 January 2018, WongPartnership wrote to the Respondent to ask how “[his]\n\nclient” intended to resolve the matter. They stated that, if the sale and purchase\ncould not be proceeded with, that “[his] client” would compensate Pinnacle for all\nlosses. WongPartnership enclosed Templars Law’s letters dated 15 December 2017,\n22 December 2017, 5 January 2018 (with Dr Ang’s medical report attached) and 10\n\nJanuary 20187\n33,\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced Suit 45 in her capacity as Mdm\nLiew’s donee, pursuant to the 2014 LPA, against Pinnacle and Kelvin to stop the\nsale of the Namly Property.\n\n34.\n\nOnor around 24 January 2018, the Respondent wrote to SterlingLaw. In that letter,\nthe Respondent stated his clients’ intention to withdraw Mdm Liew’s name from\nthe purchase of the Condominium Unit.\n\n35.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, Templars Law wrote to the Respondent to inform him that:\n\na.\n\nthe Complainant was the sole donee under the 2014 LPA;\n\nb.\n\nDr Ang opined that Mdm Liew had been suffering from dementia since the\nmiddle of 2017 and lacked mental capacity to make financial decisions; and\n\ns page 1062 of the Complainant's AEIC\n< page 1072 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n7 page 1074 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n\n\fc.\n\nthe Complainant had commenced Suit 45 against Kelvin for the sale of the\nNamly Property and to request a statutory declaration setting out the full\ncircumstances under which Mdm Liew came (o sign the POAs®.\n\n36.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, the Complainant’s application for an interlocutory injunction\nto restrain the sale of the Namly Property from being completed was refused. The\n\nsale was allowed to proceed on the basis that the sale proceeds would be paid into\nCourt. Eventually, the sale was completed and the sale proceeds of S$5.1m were\n\npaid into Court.\n37.\n\nOn or around 27 February 2018, the Respondent wrote to SterlingLaw. In that\nletter, the Respondent referred to a fresh Option to Purchase for the Condominium\nUnit, to be signed by the seller pursuant to the withdrawal of Mdm Liew’s name as\na joint purchaser of that unit. Kelvin and Jacqueline exercised this Option to\nPurchase, with the exercise date backdated to 8 December 2017 (the “Amended\nCondominium OTP”).\n\n38.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, Templars Law issued a subpoena in Suit 45 against the\nRespondent requiring him to attend the trial and to produce documents that they\nhad asked for in their letter of 21 January 2020. It was served on the Respondent\n\non 4 February 2020°.\n39.\n\nThe Respondent then consulted Drew & Napier, who were Kelvin’s solicitors, in\nrelation to the subpoena. According to the Respondent'’, he believed that he was\nentitled to seek instructions from Kelvin and/or his solicitors because Kelvin was\na party to Suit 45.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent informed Templars Law over the phone that he would not be\nresponding\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nComplainant’s\n\nconfidentiality'!.\n\n® page 1078 ofthe Complainant’s AEIC\n\n* page1103 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n0 paragraphs 70 of the Respondent’s AEIC\n1 paragraph 62 of the Respondent’s AEIC\n\nrequest\n\nbecause\n\nof\n\nsolicitor-client\n\n\f41.\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the Accountant-General was directed to pay out the sale\n\nproceeds of the Namly Property to Mdm Liew.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief and appeared as a witness in\nSuit 45.\n\nTHE RESPONDENT’S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION\n\n43.\n\nIn paragraph 3 of the Respondent’s Defence (Amendment No. 1) (the “Defence”),\nthe Respondent pleaded that, insofar and to the extent that any of the matters in the\n\nStatement of Case (Amendment No.1) (the “SOC”) and the charges in paragraph\n37 of the SOC go beyond or are different from the complaint, they are not within\nthe jurisdiction or remit of the DT.\n\nHowever, the Respondent does not pursue that point in his Closing Submissions.\n\n45.\n\nNotwithstanding this, we are unable to agree with this point. As the Applicant has\nargued, and as made clear from the Complainant’s complaint dated 26 October\n2020, the charges against the Respondent “encapsulate the gravamen of the\ncomplaint”: LSS v Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin and another matter [2020] 4 SLR 858 at\n\n[64]-{65].\nTHE APPLICANT’S RELIANCE ON THE JUDGMENT IN SUIT 45 AND\nPROOF OF MDM LIEW’S MENTAL CAPACITY\n\n46.\n\nIn the SOC, the Applicant pleaded Mdm Liew’s mental capacity (see paragraph\n3(b)) and referred to one Dr Ang’s medical report dated 30 December 2017, which\nthe Applicant said, “opined that Mdm Liew started sufferingfrom dementia around\nthe middle of 2017 and was progressively getting worse” (see paragraphs 26-30).\n\nThe Applicant also pleaded what it said were the High Court’s findings in Suit 45,\nincluding those in relation to Mdm Liew’s mental capacity to understand and\nexecute the POAs and the Respondent’s conduct (see paragraphs 35-36).\n\n\f47.\n\nIn the Defence, the Respondent denied paragraph 3 of the SOC (see paragraph\n43A), disputed the findings in Dr Ang’s report of 30 December 2017 (see paragraph\n67), pleaded that that report was insutticient evidence that Mdm Liew did not have\nmental capacity when she signed the POAs and agreed to the sale of the Namly\nProperty (see paragraphs 68 and 69), and that it had not been enough for Dr Ang\nto have relied solely on the information that the Complainant had provided to\nconclude that Mdm Liew lacked the mental capacity to agree to the sale of the\nNamly Property (see paragraph 69).\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent also pleaded that while the SOC reproduced the High Court’s\nfindings in Suit 45 (see paragraphs 76- 88), the findings of the High Court in Suit\n\n45 are opinion evidence (see paragraph 89).\n49.\n\nThe Applicant would have therefore been aware from the Defence that the\n\nRespondent had pleaded that the findings in Suit 45 relied on by the Applicant are\nin the nature of opinion. The Applicant would also have been aware of the\n\nDefence’s assertion that there was insufficient evidence that Mdm Liew lacked\nmental capacity when she signed the POAs and agreed to the sale of the Namly\nProperty.\n\n50.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Applicant only called the Complainant as a witness. It did\n\nnot call Dr Ang or any expert on the issue of Mdm Liew’s mental capacity.\n51.\n\nIn her Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (*AEIC”), the Complainant referred to and\nrelied on parts of the Judgment in Suit 45 (see e.g., paragraphs 16, 17, 38, 46, 53,\n\n62, 63, 65, 71, 73, 86, 89, 90, 91, 93, 94). She also referred to and relied on Dr\nAng’s reports (see e.g., paragraphs 122-124) and on Dr Ang’s opinion that “Mdm\n\nLiew was suffering from dementia which started around the middle of 2017 and\nwas progressively getting worse”.\n\n52.\n\nHowever, while the Complainant is a medical doctor, she was called as a witness\n\nof fact and not as an expert witness on Mdm Liew’s mental capacity. As she\n\n\ftestified, she was not qualified to comment on Mdm Liew’s mental capacity (TS,\n4 May 2022, page 25 lines 3-7).\n\n53.\n\nIn his closing submissions, the Respondent contended that in view of section 45 of\nthe Evidence Act, Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor JP [2000] SGHC 111 at\n[141], Trans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China (Singapore) [2003] 2\n\nSLR(R) 501 at [19], the findings of fact in Suit 45 (that were referred to and relied\non by the Complainant in her AEIC and at the hearing) are not evidence and not\n\nadmissible for their truth.\n54.\n\n‘The Respondent also submitted that the hearing before the DT was a de novo\nhearing. The Applicant did not respond to this point.\n\n55.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the DT gave the parties liberty to ask for leave to submit\nreply submissions to the other side’s closing submissions. The Applicant did not\nask for leave to respond to these submissions.\n\n56.\n\nAs per Rule 23 of the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules, the Evidence\nAct applies to proceedings before the DT in the same manner as it applies to civil\nand criminal proceedings.\n\n57.\n\nThe position under section 45 of the Evidence Act as set out in Arul Chandran and\nTrans-World was later reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in Zainal bin Kuning v\nChan Sin Mian Michael [1996] 2 SLR (R) 858 at [69], where it held that a\n“judgment determining a fact in one trial cannot be used or relied upon in another\n\ntrial’”.\n58.\n\nThis was also\n\naddressed by the Singapore International Court (“SICC”) in\n\nBeyonics Asia Pacific and others v Goh Chan Peng and another [2020] 4 SLR 215\nwhich, applying Arul Chandran, held at [33] that “evidence ofstatements made in\n\nan earlier case may be adduced in order to seek to discredit evidence given by a\n‘witness in a later case, but there is an important distinction between reliance upon\n\nstatements made in a previous action and conclusions reached by the court in that\nprevious action on the basis of those statements”.\n\n\f59.\n\nThe SICC also applied Zainal bin Kuning and held at [35] that “a finding offact in\na previous judgment cannot be relied upon to prove primary facts which have to\nbe proved in a subsequent action.\n\n60.\n\nHere, although the Respondent was a witness, he was not a party to Suit 45. Neither\nwas the Applicant. The Applicant has not submitted that any exception to section\n\n45 of the Evidence Act applies.\n61.\n\n‘While there had been an agreement in relation to the documents in the bundles of\ndocuments, it was qualified. On the first day of the hearing, Mr Peter Low for the\nRespondent informed the DT that the Respondent agreed to the documents in the\n‘bundles of documents, “subject to cross-examination”. In cross-examination, Mr\nLow challenged the assertion that Mdm Liew lacked mental capacity at the material\ntime and took issue with Dr Ang’s reports and views.\n\n62.\n\nOn the question of whether the hearing before the DT was a de novo hearing,\nalthough the Respondent did not cite any authority, his submission is supported by\nRe Parti Liyani [2020] SGHC 227 at [48] where the Honourable Chief Justice held\nthat “the Disciplinary Tribunal is obliged to hear the matter de novo”. The\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal in that case accordingly treated the hearing before it as a de\nnovo hearing: see The Law Society ofSingapore v Tan Yanying and another [2022]\n\nSGDT 6 at [20].\n63.\n\nIn the circumstances, we agree with the Respondent that the Applicant cannot rely\non the findings in the Judgment in Suit 45 to prove the existence or truth of matters\nthat the Respondent has not admitted or agreed to in this case. We also find that\n\nthere was no evidence before us of Mdm Liew’s mental capacity.\nTHE STANDARD OF PROOF\n\n64.\n\nIt is trite that the charges have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: Law Society\nofSingapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani [2006] 4 SLR 308 at [6].\n\n\fG. THE CHARGES\n\nTHE FIRST CHARGE\n65.\n\nThe First Charge is as follows:\n\nThat you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out\nin\n\nsection\n\n83(2)(b)(i)\n\nof the\n\nLegal\n\nProfession\n\nAct\n\n1966\n\nin\n\nthat,\n\nwhilst you acted for Madam Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in the\npreparation of the 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged\nwith the Supreme Court as HC/PA 6414/2017 and HC/PA 6417/2017\nrespectively with the client as the donor and one Goh Yong Chiang\nKelvin as the attomey, in breach of Rule 5(5)(a) and 5(5)(b) of the Legal\nProfession\n\n(Professional\n\nConduct)\n\nRules\n\n2015\n\nyou\n\ntook\n\ninstructions\n\nfrom Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin without ensuring that he had the authority\nto give those instructions on behalf of your client and when you had no\nevidence of such authority, you failed to obtain confirmation of the said\ninstructions from your client regarding the preparation and drafting of\n\nthe said Powers of Attorney.\nTHE PARTIES’ CONTENTIONS\n\n66.\n\nThe Applicant recounts the following: First, the Respondent met Mdm Liew for\nthe first time only at the Meeting. Second, the Meeting was his first and only\ncontact with her. Third, he did not, at the 17 November 2017 meeting with Kelvin,\n\nobtain confirmation of Kelvin’s authorisation to act for Mdm Liew in relation to\nthe POAs.\n\n67.\n\nIt is argued that although it became plain to the Respondent during the Meeting\nthat Mdm Liew was not able to communicate verbally, the Respondent should not\nhave been satisfied with Mdm Liew’s nods and smile as he went through the POAs\n\nwith her, not least because the Respondent accepted that there was a greater need\nfor him to confirm Kelvin’s instructions with Mdm Liew because Kelvin stood to\nbenefit from the POAs.\n\n\f68.\n\nThe Applicant contended the following: First, Mdm Liew’s responses were\ninsufficient to confirm her instructions. Second, the Respondent did not speak to\nher alone to confirm if Kelvin’s instructions were indeed hers. Third, the\n\nRespondent did not ask her to repeat the instructions that she had allegedly given\nto Kelvin. It argued that the Respondent could have asked Mdm Liew to confirm\nher instructions by writing them down.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent relied on the dicta in Law Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar\nNaidu [2012]4 SLR 1232 (“K Jayakumar Naidu”) to contend that solicitors should\nnot be held to the same “strict protocols appropriate in a business setting” and that\n\n“by and large, family members do not take advantage of each other”.\n70.\n\nHe also argued that there was nothing remarkable or suspicious about the\n\ncircumstances of this case.\n.\n\nThe Respondent contended that since Kelvin was Mdm Liew’s son, the Respondent\nwas entitled to assume that Kelvin had the authority to give him instructions on her\nbehalf. He contended that at the 17 November 2017 meeting he informed Kelvin\nthat he needed to personally take Mdm Liew’s instructions and to witness her\n\nexecution of the POAs.\n72.\n\nThe Respondent said that at the Meeting, he took instructions from Mdm Liew\npersonally, verified Kelvin’s instructions, and also confirmed Mdm Liew’s own\ninstructions. According to him, after explaining the terms of the POAs, he not only\nasked Mdm Liew if she understood what he had said but also asked her why she\nwanted to move out and if she wanted to buy a single-storey condominium unit to\n\nlive in. He contended that he was satisfied that she possessed mental capacity at\nthe time.\n73.\n\nThe Respondent further argued that he witnessed her execution of the POAs,\n\nadding that he even observed her taking off her glasses and reading them before\nsigning.\n\n\f74.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that he was entitled to rely on Mdm Liew’s nodding\nas confirmation of her instructions, and for that purpose relied on section 5(1)(d)\nof the Mental Capacity Act (“MCA”). He said that he had used simple language\nwhen explaining the terms of the POAs, that Mdm Liew was able despite her\nphysical limitations to sit upright on her own, and that she even took off her glasses\n\nto read the POAs before signing them. He added that if he had stated anything\nincorrect, Mdm Liew would have corrected him, just as she was able to correctly\nidentify the members of her family and even referred to Kelvin by his nickname.\n\n75.\n\nInsofar as section 5(1)(d) of the MCA is concemed, the Applicant’s position was\nthat nodding is insufficient where, as here, Mdm Liew did not ask any questions or\nmake any amendments to the POAs.\n\n76.\n\nBoth parties relied on a number of authorities, which we have considered. Some of\nthem were cited for more than one of the charges.\n\n.\n\nOUR\nFINDINGS\n\n77.\n\nSection 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (the “Act”) concems, inter\n\nalia, a breach of any rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council.\n\n78.\n\nRule 5(5) is the subject of the First Charge. That Rule provides that where a legal\npractitioner is given instructions purportedly on behalf of his or her client, the legal\npractitioner must, under Rule 5(5)(a), ensure that the person giving those\ninstructions has the authority to give those instructions on behalf of the client or,\nunder Rule 5(5)(b), if there is no evidence of such authority, obtain the client’s\n\nconfirmation of those instructions within a reasonable time after receiving those\ninstructions.\n\n79.\n\nIt is alleged that the Respondent breached both Rule 5(5)(a) and Rule 5(5)(b).\n\n80.\n\nInsofar as Rule 5(5)(a) is concerned, it is not in dispute that the Respondent met\nMdm Liew for the first (and only) time on 20 November 2017. That means that the\nRespondent was unable to ensure at that meeting that Kelvin had Mdm Liew’s\n\n\fauthority to give instructions to him in relation to the POAs when he met Kelvin\nand Jacqueline on 17 November 2017 and when his assistant secretary emailed, on\nhis behall, the drafis of the POAs (o Kelvin at Kelvin's email address\n<kjgoh@hotmail.com> at around 12.28pm on 20 November 2017 requesting that\n\nKelvin “go thru the drafts and let us have your comments if any”.\n81.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that Rule 5(5)(a) was breached. Rule 5(5)(b) shows\nthat in cases where it is not possible to obtain evidence of such authority, the\nsolicitor must obtain the client’s confirmation of those instructions within a\nreasonable time after receiving those instructions.\n\n82.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent acted reasonably and in compliance with Rule 5(5)(a).\nIt was the Respondent’s uncontested evidence that at the 17 November 2017\n‘meeting, he told Kelvin to bring Mdm Liew to his office to enable him to take her\ninstructions and witness her execution of the POAs, and that when Kelvin asked if\nthere was another way for the Respondent to do that since Mdm Liew was unable\nto walk and had trouble speaking, he informed Kelvin that he could visit Mdm\nLiew at the Namly Property.\n\n83.\n\nThe Meeting was arranged for Monday 20 November 2017, the first working day\nafter 17 November 2017, which was a Friday. In his contemporaneous note of the\n\n17 November 2017 meeting'?, the Respondent recorded “To visit client 20/11/17\nevening 5-6pm to the house”.\n84.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Meeting was arranged for him to meet Mdm\nLiew for the Respondent to take her instructions and witness her execution of the\n\nPOAs\".\n85.\n\nIn the circumstances, we do not agree that there was a breach of Rule 5(5)(a).\n\n2 see paragraph 10 of the Respondent’s AEIC and TAB-1 of TET-1\nsee paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Respondent’s AEIC\n\n\f86.\n\nThe next question we will address is whether at the Meeting, the Respondent had\n\nobtained Mdm Liew’s confirmation of Kelvin’s instructions.\n87.\n\nThe Court of Appeal’s observations in Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline\n(Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners) [2010] 4 SLR 373 at [60]\non the duty of solicitors who undertake the task of preparing and/or witnessing the\nexecution of wills are instructive:\n\n“In our view, this case demonstrates that solicitors who undertake the task of\npreparing wills and/or witnessing the execution of wills must take the necessary\nprecautions or steps in order to fulfil their duties to their clients. The precautions\nare not complicated nor are they time consuming. In any case, as solicitors, they\nmust do what is required, however complicated or difficult the task may be. The\n\ncentral task is to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the wishes ofthe testator.\nHow this is done depends on the circumstances of each case. In every case, the\nsolicitor should be cautious about taking instructions from any person who is to be\nnamed as a beneficiary in the will.”\n\n88.\n\nAt [61], the Court of Appeal in the same case reiterated the following points that\nwere made in Low Ak Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR (R) 1079:\n\n“73. The preparation of a will involves serious professional responsibilities,\nwhich solicitors must uncompromisingly observe and discharge. Regrettably,\nit seems to us that, all too often nowadays, solicitors appear to consider the\npreparation of a will to be no more than a routine exercise in form filling.\nThis is wrong. Before preparing a will, the solicitor concerned ought to have a\nthorough discussion with the testator on all the possible legal issues and\npotential complications that might arise in the implementation of the terms\n\nof the will. The solicitor ought to painstakingly and accurately document his\ndiscussions with and his instructions from the testator. He should also\nconfirm with the testator, prior to the execution of the will, that the contents\n\nof the will as drafied accurately express the latter’s intention.”\n\n\f89.\n\nIn Law Society ofSingapore v Tan Phuay Khiang [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [95], the\n\nCourt of Three Judges held, in relation to a solicitor’s duty when asked to prepare\na Power of Atlorney o be executed by the client, that:\n\n“The respondent was obliged to take reasonable care to advise and ensure that the\ncomplainants understood the implications of executing a power of attorney in the\nprevailing circumstances”.\n\n90.\n\nIn Tan Phuay Khiang at [97], the Court also observed that where “there was a real\npossibility that the execution of a power of attorney had not been initiated by the\n[clients] themselves, but at a third party’s behest instead....it was imperative for\n\nthe [solicitor] to have privately met with the [clients] and ensured that the [clients]\nwere not acting under any misrepresentation or improper influence and could\n\ncommunicate with him freely”.\n91.\n\nIn K Jayakumar Naidu, the Law Society decided not to pursue the charge relating\n\nto the respondent’s failure to advise his client on the nature, purport and\nconsequence of the Power of Attorney. In that context, the Court of Three Judges\n\nsaid at [44] and [45]:\n“44. The gravamen ofthe first charge relates to the respondent’s allegedfailure to\nadvise HCS on the nature, purport and consequence of the power of attorney.\n\n45. As the Law Society eventually did not pursue this charge we need not dwell on\nthis save to make the following observation. To require solicitors to hold their\nclients’ family members to the same strict protocols appropriate in a business\n\nsetting would place them in an untenable attitude of opposition with their clients’\nfamilies and would not be in the interest of the client. Nor would it accord with the\ncommon experience that, by and large, family members do not take advantage of\neach other. The Law Society was therefore correct in eventually submitting that\nthere was nothing remarkable or suspicious about the circumstances in which HBS\napproached the respondent to prepare the power ofattorney. At that stage, he need\nnot have done anything more than confirm that HCS wanted to sell the flat and that\n\nhe wanted HBS to act on his behalf.”\n\n\f92.\n\nHowever, the Court also said this at [1]:\n\n“A solicitor should also ensure that the client understands sufficiently any risks\nthat may arise. This duty is elevated when a solicitor has reason to suspect that\n\nthere are special risks or unusual pitfalls involved in the subject transaction.\nNaturally, the extent ofthis duty depends on the precise identity, sophistication and\ncircumstances ofthe client: a vulnerable client, such as one who is mentally and/or\nphysically disadvantaged, uneducated or impecunious, may require comprehensive\nand comprehensible advice for even the simplest of matters; in contrast, a client\nwho is a seasoned businessman or a corporate entity with an in-house risk\nmanagement team may be reasonably presumed to have greater situational\nawareness. In a similar vein, the extent of the duty will also vary with the client’s\napparent\n\nfamiliarity with\n\na proposed transaction.\n\nAll solicitors\n\nalso\n\nowe their clients a fundamental duty of undivided loyalty to ethically\nadvance their client’s interests and not place themselves in a position of\n\nconflict.”\nGoh Yng Yng Karen v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin [2021] 3 SLR 896'* held at [119]\nthat:\n\n“It is well established that what amounts to a transaction that calls for an\nexplanation is a “fact-sensitive inquiry” where “much would depend on the\nstrength of inferences to be drawn from the circumstances”: Moh Tai Siang v Moh\nTai Tong and another [2018] SGHC 280 at [80]. I note also the observation in\nRoyal Bank of Scotland plc v Etridge (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 773 at [22] citing with\napproval the view of Lindley LJ in Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145 at 185\nthat a transaction calls for an explanation where it cannot “be reasonably\naccounted\n\nJor\n\non\n\nthe\n\nground\n\nof\n\nfriendship,\n\nrelationship, charity or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act.”\n\n“ which is being relied on for the law as set out by the Court\n\n\f93.\n\nAfter considering Muriel Chee and Low Ah Cheow, the High Court opined that in\ncases involving a solicitor’s duty in connection with a client’s disposal of property\nto his or her successors, there is no material distinction between a situation\n\ninvolving wills and one which involved the making of an inter vivos gift.\n\n94,\n\nIn view of these authorities, the question whether there was a breach of Rule 5(5)(b)\nis a “fact-sensitive inquiry” where “much would depend on the strength of\ninferences to be drawn from the circumstances”. 1t is important therefore to\nconsider all the circumstances. In doing that, it must be borne in mind that this case\ninvolved family members (see Jayakumar Naidu). This requires a consideration of\nthe circumstances leading to and what happened at the Meeting.\n\n9s.\n\nThe starting point is what the Respondent said happened.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Respondent'’, during the meeting on 17 November 2017, Kelvin\ninformed him that Jacqueline and their family were residing with his mother, Mdm\nLiew, at the Namly Property. Furthermore, Mdm Liew had instructed him that she\n\nwanted to move out of the Namly Property as soon as possible for two principal\nreasons: First, that as she was wheelchair-bound, it was inconvenient for her to\nmove up and down the stairs in the Namly Property, as well as to and from her\n\nbedroom to the toilet. Second, that as she spent most of her time at the Namly\nProperty, Mdm Liew was affected by ongoing construction work in the\nneighbouring properties which generated noise, dust, and pollution, causing her\ndiscomfort and affected her sleep during the day. As such, she suggested that she,\nKelvin, and his family move to a single-storey condominium unit where she would\nbe able to move freely and more independently in her wheelchair. Further, Kelvin,\nhis family, and their domestic helper would be on the same floor and thus be able\n\nto respond to her needs more easily.\n97.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, at the 17 November 2017 meeting, Kelvin had told\nhim that Mdm Liew had instructed him to engage a lawyer to prepare two Powers\nof Attorney for Kelvin to act on her behalf in the sale of the Namly Property and\n\ns paragraph 9 of the Respondent’s AEIC\n\n\fthe purchase of a single-storey condominium unit. She had also instructed that the\nPowers of Attorney should allow for the following:\n\na.\n\nKelvin to sell and absolutely dispose of the Namly Property;\n\nb.\n\nKevin to request for all sale proceeds to be issued to Daniel to be held on\ntrust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the single-storey condominium unit.\n(Mdm Liew wanted to give the Namly Property to Daniel, her favourite\ngrandson), and;\n\nc.\n\nKevin to purchase the single-storey condominium unit in her and Daniel’s\nnames with the option to include Kelvin as a joint owner.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent also said that at the 17 November 2017 meeting, Kelvin requested\nthat he prepare the Powers of Attorney for the sale of the Namly\nProperty and for the purchase of a single-storey condominium unit.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent said'® that he also asked Kelvin whether Mdm Liew had a history\nof mental illness or had ever been admitted to the Institute of Mental Health\n(“IMH”) or any other mental health facilities and Kelvin informed him that Mdm\nLiew was in perfect mental health and that he could verify the same after meeting\nher. The Respondent also said that he did not sense anything was amiss, given that\nhe had adult children approaching him on their parents’ behalf before and that\nKelvin had identified himself to the Respondent as a medical doctor. He said he\nhad trusted Kelvin when he said that Mdm Liew was in perfect mental health and\nhad never been admitted to IMH or any other mental health facilities. He added\nthat he was satisfied that he would be able to verify Mdm Liew’s mental capacity\n\n‘himself and to take her instructions when he met her on 20 November 2017.\n100. According to the Respondent, at the Meeting, the Respondent met Mdm Liew.\nKelvin, Jacqueline and their two sons were present throughout.\n\nparagraphs 13 and 14 of the Respondent’s AEIC\n\n\f101, The Respondent said'? that Kelvin had begun the Meeting by introducing him to\nMdm Liew as the lawyer who he had approached to act for her. The Respondent\n\nexplained (0 Mdm Liew that he was there because Kelvin had told him that Mdm\nLiew had asked Kelvin to engage a lawyer to prepare legal documents to give\nKelvin the power to sell the Namly Property and purchase a single-storey\ncondominium unit, and for the lawyer to act in the sale of the Namly Property and\nthe purchase of the single-storey condominium unit. Mdm Liew nodded her head\nin affirmation of the Respondent’s explanation.\n102. The Respondent also said that upon meeting Mdm Liew, he had introduced himself\nand asked for her name. As Mdm Liew had difficulty speaking audibly, the\nRespondent was unable to decipher her response. He then read out Mdm Liew’s\nname from her NRIC card, which Daniel handed him. Mdm Liew confirmed her\nidentity by nodding and smiling.\n\n103. The Respondent then asked Mdm Liew if she recognised the people around her.\nShe said yes, and introduced him, one by one, to her family members who were\npresent, in the following order: Kelvin, Jacqueline, Daniel and David, and lastly\nher domestic helper. She was able to softly refer to Kelvin as “Vin”, which the\nRespondent understood was her affectionate nickname for him. She also correctly\nidentified each individual present in the room.\n\n104. Following the confirmation of Mdm Liew’s identity, he then asked Mdm Liew\nthree times if she was comfortable having the Meeting in the presence of Kelvin,\nhis family members, and the domestic helper. Mdm Liew nodded her head in\n\nresponse each time she was asked, indicating that she was comfortable.\n105. The Respondent then proceeded to ascertain if Mdm Liew possessed mental\ncapacity by first asking her if she had a history of mental illness or if she had ever\n‘been admitted to IMH or any other mental treatment facilities. In response, Mdm\nLiew shook her head, indicating that she did not have a history of mental illness\n\n¥ paragraphs 21-37 of the Respondent's AEIC\n\n\fand that she had not ever been admitted to IMH or any other mental treatment\nfacilities.\n\n106. The Respondent tumed to Kelvin and asked the same questions in Mdm Liew’s\n\npresence. Kelvin confirmed that Mdm Liew had no history of mental illness, nor\nhad she ever been admitted to IMH or any other mental treatment facilities. The\n\nRespondent proceeded to ask Mdm Liew if she understood the purpose of the\nMeeting. Mdm Liew nodded her head, indicating that she understood the purpose\nof the Meeting.\n\n107. Throughout their interaction, the Respondent observed that Mdm Liew was fully\nalert, and was able to understand and respond to his questions although she was\n\nunable to walk and had difficulty speaking audibly. As such, the Respondent was\nsatisfied that Mdm Liew possessed mental capacity.\n\n108. The Respondent asked her if the Namly Property was suitable for her to continue\n\nresiding in. In response, Mdm Liew shook her head, indicating that the Namly\nProperty was not suitable for her to continue residing in. He also asked if the noise\n\nfrom the construction from the neighbouring properties was one of the reasons why\nthe Namly Property was no longer suitable for her to live in. Again, Mdm Liew\nnodded her head.\n109. The Respondent asked if Mdm Liew had difficulty manoeuvring up and down the\nstairs in the Namly Property, and in response, she nodded her head.\n\n110. He asked Mdm Liew if she wished to move to a single-storey condominium unit to\navoid having to manoeuvre up and down stairs and to avoid the noise from the\nneighbouring properties, and Mdm Liew nodded her head again.\n111. The Respondent asked Mdm Liew to confirm that she wished to appoint Kelvin as\nher attomey to sell the Namly Property and to purchase a single-storey\ncondominium unit. She nodded. He then proceeded to explain the following, inter\nalia, in respect of the POAs to Mdm Liew:\n\n\fo\n\nHe explained to Mdm Liew that the sale proceeds of the Namly Property\nwere to be used to purchase a single-storey condominium unit in the joint\nnames of hersell and Daniel. He also explained the meaning and\nconsequences of Daniel holding the sale proceeds on trust for Mdm Liew. He\nfurther explained that as Daniel was not 21 years of age, his share in the\nproperty would be held on trust by Kelvin and that usually for trust matters,\na separate trust deed would be drafted. However, as at the time of the\nexecution of the two POAs, the address of the single-storey condominium\nunit was not yet known, the trust deed could not yet be drafted;\n\n@ The Respondent explained the meaning of joint tenants and tenants-incommon and the implications. To explain the concept of a joint tenancy and\nthe right of survivorship to Mdm Liew, he employed a hypothetical situation\n\nin which persons A, B and C were joint tenants of a property. He explained\nthat if A passed away, B and C would be the owners of the entire property.\nLikewise, if B passed away, A and C would be owners of the entire property,\n\nand if C passed away, A and B would be owners of the entire property. He\nthen explained that in a tenancy-in common, each tenant possesses their own\nshare which can be distributed according to their will or by intestacy;\n\n3)\n\nHe explained that if the sale proceeds of the Namly Property were insufficient\nto purchase the single-story condominium unit, Kevin’s name would be\nincluded as a joint tenant for the purposes of obtaining a bank loan to finance\nthe remaining balance of the purchase price. He then asked Mdm Liew if she\nwanted Kelvin’s name to be included as a joint tenant in the event a bank\nloan is required to finance the balance purchase price. Mdm Liew nodded,\nindicating her assent and that she understood the above. The Respondent then\nexplained to Mdm Liew that the two POAs had the effect of giving the Namly\nProperty to Daniel, and asked Mdm Liew if she intended to give the Namly\nProperty to Daniel. Mdm Liew nodded. He asked Mdm Liew if she intended\nto give the Namly Property to David. Mdm Liew shook her head, indicating\nthat she did not wish to give the Namly Property to David; and\n\n\f(4)\n\nHe said that Kelvin’s consent would be required to revoke the two POAs. He\ninformed Mdm Liew that the two POAs were irrevocable without written\napproval from Kelvin or the Family Justice Courts. He explained that this\nmeant that Mdm Liew could not withdraw, cancel, or amend the two POAs\nafter their execution, and asked if she understood. Mdm Liew nodded,\n\nindicating that she understood.\n\n112. The Respondent said he repeated these explanations twice. Mdm Liew nodded her\nhead in response to each explanation, indicating that she understood the terms and\nthe consequences of the two POAs. When the Respondent finished his explanation,\n\nhe asked Mdm Liew if she understood what he had said. She nodded her head.\n113. He asked Mdm Liew once more if she wanted to move out of the Namly Property\nbecause it had become inconvenient for her to stay there, and that she wanted to\nbuy a single storey condominium unit to live in instead. Mdm Liew nodded her\nhead again.\n\n114. The Respondent was satisfied that she had mental capacity to sign the two POAs.\nHe then placed the two POAs in front of Mdm Liew, who removed her glasses and\n\ntook some time to read them before signing them in his presence. The Respondent\nthen affixed his stamp to the two POAs and countersigned against them.\n\n115. He observed that during the Meeting, Mdm Liew appeared relaxed, alert and\nshowed no signs of discomfort or that she was not acting on her own.\n\n116. ‘We are unable to accept the Respondent’s evidence of what happened during the\n\nMeeting for the following reasons:117. First, this evidence does not accord with the Respondent’s Attendance Note of the\nMeeting which he prepared at around 6.15pm when he returned to his office after\n\nthe Meeting'®. According to the attendance note:\n\nsee paragraph 39 of the Respondent’s AEIC and TAB 5 of TET-1\n\n\fa.\n\nMdm Liew is recorded as the client;\n\nb.\n\nThe Meeting took place between 5pm to 5.45pm;\n\nc.\n\nThe Meeting concemed “2x Powers ofAttorney at 107 NamlyAve\";\n\nd.\n\nThe Respondent “saw Mdm Liew around 5Spm and read the POA to her”;\n\ne.\n\n“Shewas aware that her son had told me to come and she had given\ninstruction to her son”. Her response, if any, was not recorded;\n\nf.\n\nThe Respondent “askfed] her whether she understand what I was saying\nand whether she recognise the people around her”. Mdm Liew’s response,\nif any, was not recorded;\n\ng\n\nThe Respondent “ask[ed] her whether she was admitted to woodbridge or\nmental clinic before, she said No™;\n\nh.\n\n“She said that staying here is inconvenient and want to move out”;\n\ni\n\n“She was relaxed ... and no sign ofoppression or discomfort”; and\n\ni\n\n“end 5.45pm”.\n\n118. The Respondent sought to explain the difference between his evidence and the\nAttendance Note by saying that the latter did not fully reflect his communications\nwith Mdm Liew.\n\n119. ‘While we accept the Attendance Note was not, and could not have been, meant to\n‘e a verbatim note of what was said at the Meeting, the fact is that the Respondent\n‘was conscious of the need to have a contemporaneous record of what he considered\nto be the main and important aspects of the Meeting. Further, the fact that he\nprepared it immediately after the Meeting meant that his memory of the Meeting\n\nwas fresh at that time.\n\n\f120. The disparity between his evidence about the Meeting and what is said in the\nAttendance Note is simply too huge to be credibly accounted for.\n\n121. According to the Attendance Note, the Respondent “read the POA to her”. There\nis nothing about him explaining the POAs (let alone more than once) in the manner\nthat he claimed in his evidence. There is also nothing in the Attendance Note about\n\nhim explaining the nature and effect of the POAs to Mdm Liew. The Applicant\nsubmitted that the Respondent accepted that he did not say any of this in his\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief in Suit 45 (his “45 AEIC”).\n\n122. In his Defence, the Respondent also claimed that he explained the nature and\nconsequences of joint ownership of the Condominium Unit by Mdm Liew, Kelvin\nand Daniel. This was not in the Attendance Note. The Applicant submitted that the\n\nRespondent did not say this in his 45 AEIC.\n123. The Respondent also took the position that he explained the meaning\nand consequences of Daniel holding the sale proceeds of the Namly Property\non trust for Mdm Liew and that as Daniel was below 21 years of age, his\n\nshare in the property would be held on trust by Kelvin. This was not in the\nAttendance Note. The Applicant submitted that this was different from what the\nRespondent said in his 45 AEIC where the Respondent said that he explained that\nthe sale proceeds would be held by Daniel on trust for her to purchase the\n\nCondominium Unit.\n124, As the Applicant pointed out, the Respondent’s own understanding of the legal\neffect of the 2™ POA was inaccurate and that Kelvin could, at his own discretion,\n\nadd himself as a joint tenant to the purchase of the Condominium Unit. It was also\nnot correct that Kelvin would be added as a joint tenant to the purchase of the\nCondominium Unit only if there were insufficient funds to finance the purchase the\nCondominium Unit from the sale proceeds of the Namly Property.\n\n125. According to the Attendance Note, Mdm Liew “was aware that her son had told\nme to come and she had given instruction to her son”. However, her response, if\nthere was any, was not recorded. This also begged the question whether she\n\n\funderstood what the Respondent was talking about when he said that “she had\n\ngiven instructions to her son”.\n126. The Attendance Note also said that the Respondent “ask/ed/ her whether she\nunderstand what I was saying and whether she recognise the people around her”.\nThis presents a particular difficulty because the POAs had unusual clauses and\n\nfeatures that gave rise to various issues that needed very careful explanation,\nparticularly to an 87 year old lay person who could not readily interact because of\nher speaking difficulties.\n\n127. In fact, it was not just the nature, terms, and implications of the two POAs which\nrequired careful explanation but also the issues arising from the interaction between\nthe two POAs. They raised, inter alia, the following issues or concerns:\n\na.\n\nThe concept of joint tenancy;\n\nb.\n\nThat Mdm Liew would be making an inter-vivos gift to Daniel to the\nexclusion of others;\n\nc.\n\nHow that intention could still be fulfilled if Kelvin included his name in the\npurchase of the Condominium Unit;\n\nd.\n\nThe fact that she could not on her own change her mind;\n\ne.\n\nThat Daniel was a minor (the Respondent knew that Daniel was about 19\n\nyears old at the time'? and cannot be a trustee);\n£\n\nWhat the terms of the trust would be and how would they affect Mdm Liew\nand her rights;\n\n9 NE dated 25 February 2020, page 79, line 16, Tab 19 ofExhibit KG-1 at page 720\n\n\fg.\n\nWhat would happen if after the Namly Property was sold, complications\narose in relation to the purchase of the Condominium Unit e.g., because\nDaniel refused to allow the sale proceeds to be used, and;\n\nh.\n\nThe fact that Kelvin could choose to be one of the purchasers of the\nCondominium Unit at a consideration of his own choosing, which might\n\ncreate a conflict of interest.\n128. Mdm Liew was 87 years old at the time. She had difficulty speaking. The\nRespondent should not only have carefully explained these matters but should also\nhave asked if they were in line with her wishes and instructions and how she\nthought they were in her interests, including asking why she felt that it was in her\ninterest for the POAs to be irrevocable by her. In this connection, the Applicant\npointed out that it was the Respondent’s evidence in his 45 AEIC that Mdm Liew\ndid not provide reasons for the POAs to be irrevocable and he did not see any\nnecessity to ask her about that.\n\n129. If Mdm Liew was unable to communicate her understanding verbally or in writing,\nthen the Respondent should have called for a pause and asked for her condition to\n\nbe reviewed by an independent medical expert or declined to act:-\n\na.\n\nThe fact that Mdm Liew nodded when the Respondent read the POAs to her,\nin light of these particular POAs that he was asked to draft by Kelvin and the\nfact that one of them dealt with the disposal of her home, should not have\n‘been accepted by the Respondent as evidence that she understood their terms,\nnature and consequences; and\n\nb.\n\nThe fact that she did not ask any questions in light of the issues and concerns\nreferred to above should have raised a red flag.\n\n130. The Respondent said that because his 45 AEIC was drafted for a different purpose\nfrom present proceedings, it did not contain as many details as his AEIC in these\nproceedings. We are unable to accept that. Although he was not a party to Suit 45,\nthe question whether the Respondent properly explained the POAs to Mdm Liew\n\n\fat the Meeting and whether she executed the two POAs with a full understanding\nof their terms and effect was an important issue of fact in that case. Therefore, it\nwould have been important for the Respondent to be as comprehensive as possible\nin his evidence at the High Court Trial about what happened at the Meeting.\n\n131. The Respondent also did not take steps to meet Mdm Liew privately and without\nthe presence of Kelvin and Daniel, who stood to benefit from the POAs, and their\nfamily members to determine whether Mdm Liew was not acting under any\nmisrepresentation, misapprehension, or improper influence. The Respondent also\n\ndid not ask Mdm Liew whether the POAs accorded with her wishes under any will.\nIn this connection, we were shown photos of the Meeting that were taken by\nJacqueline which showed that Kelvin stood or sat in front of Mdm Liew, to her\nright, and that David and Daniel stood directly in front of Mdm Liew®. The\nproximity was vexing and should have alerted the Respondent to insist on a private\n‘meeting with Mdm Liew.\n\n132. If the Respondent’s account of what he did at the Meeting is correct, then the\nMeeting could not have taken around 45 minutes (around Spm to 5.45pm).\n\n133. ‘We note that the Respondent’s evidence in these proceedings about what he\nclaimed to have explained to Mdm Liew was given after he would have read the\nHigh Court’s decision in Goh Yng Yng Karen, where he gave evidence and findings\nwere made about him and his conduct, and which highlighted what he omitted to\ndo at the Meeting.\n\n134. In coming to these findings, we were conscious of the obiter dicta in K Jayakumar\nNaidu which has been referred to above about family settings. However, even\nthere, the Court recognised that there may be remarkable or suspicious\n\ncircumstances or situations where family members may seek to take advantage of\neach other. We are satisfied that for the reasons set out above, including the unusual\nclauses and features of the POAs, Kelvin and Daniel’s benefits as well as the fact\n\nphotos at Tab 21 KG-1 at pages 804-806 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n\n\fthat Mdm Liew could not by herself revoke the POAs, this situation called for\n\nspecial vigilance and care.\n135. ‘We are unable to agree with the Respondent’s position on the MCA?!,\n136. Section 4 of the MCA states that a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if\nat the material time the person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself\nbecause of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or\nbrain. Section 5(1)(d) of the MCA provides that for the purposes of section 4, a\n\nperson is unable to make a decision for himself or herself if the person is unable to\ncommunicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any\nother means).\n\n137. Al that section 5(1)(d) does is to list visual illustrations of when it can be said that\na person is unable to make a decision for herself. It does not say, and does not\namount to legislative endorsement, that if a person can communicate by sign\nlanguage or other means, she is able to make a decision for herself. The latter does\n\nnot flow from the former.\n138. We are also unable to accept the Respondent’s reliance on evidence of other events\ninvolving Mdm Liew which, according to him, show that Mdm Liew had mental\n\ncapacity. As he accepted??, he did not know about these other events at the Meeting.\n139. In coming to our decision, we have not had any regard to the question of whether\n\nMdm Liew had mental capacity at the material time. Unlike Suit 45, where expert\nevidence was led, there was no expert evidence on that issue before us.\n\n140. In the circumstances, we find that the Respondent breached Rule 5(5)(b) as alleged\nin the First Charge.\n\nparagraph 121 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n2 paragraph 107 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\fTHE SECOND CHARGE\n\n141. The Second Charge is as follows:\n\nThat you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out\nin\n\nsection\n\n83(2)(b)(i)\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nLegal\n\nProfession\n\nAct\n\n1966\n\nin\n\nthat,\n\nwhilst you acted for Madam Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in the\npreparation of the 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged\nwith the Supreme Court as HC/PA 6414/2017 and HC/PA 6417/2017\nrespectively with the client as the donor and one Goh Yong Chiang\nKelvin as the attorney, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015\n\nyou failed to act with reasonable\n\ndiligence and competence in the provision of services to your client, in\n\nthat you permitted your client to execute the said Powers of Attorney\nwithout first taking sufficient steps to satisfy yourself that your client understood\nthe nature and effect of the terms that were\nset out in the said Powers of Attorney.\n\n142, ‘Under Rule 5(2)(c), a legal practitioner must act with reasonable diligence and\ncompetence in the provision of services to the client.\nTHE PARTIES® POSITIONS\n\n143. According to the Applicant, solicitors breach their duty to advance their clients’\ninterests with diligence and competence if they fail to advise on the issues peculiar\nto the matter at hand and to ensure that the client understands any risks that may\narise: K Jayakumar Naidu at [1].\n\n144, The Applicant argued that there was a breach of Rule 5(2)(c) on two grounds: first,\nthat the Respondent failed to ascertain that Mdm Liew had sufficient mental\ncapacity to make a decision with respect to the POAs; and second, that the\n\n\fRespondent failed to render proper advice for Mdm Liew to understand her position\nand the risks with respect to the nature and effect of the POAs.\n\n145. The Respondent’s position on the first ground was that there was no evidence of\n\nmental incapacity and that in any event he relied both on his own independent and\nin-person assessment that Mdm Liew was mentally competent as well as Kelvin’s\nconfirmation that Mdm Liew was mentally competent. The Respondent’s own\n\nassessment of Mdm Liew’s mental capacity was based on the fact that Mdm Liew\n'was able to communicate by nodding her head.\n146. With regard to his position on the second ground, the Respondent maintained that\nhe acted consistently with his duties.\n\n1.\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n147. For the reasons set out under our discussion in relation to the First Charge, we find\nthat the Respondent breached Rule 5(2)(c) as alleged in the Second Charge.\n148. However, we should add that because the offending conduct in First Charge and\nthe Second Charge is the same, our finding under the Second Charge does not, in\nour view, add anything to the Respondent’s culpability.\n\nTHIRD CHARGE\n149. That you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\n\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out\nin section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161) 1966 in that,\nin breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules 2015, you failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence\nin the provision of services to your client Madam Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew\nFong) by failing to take sufficient steps to safeguard the interests of your client by\nensuring that you received your instructions and explained the nature and effect of\nthe 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged with the Supreme Court\nas HC/PA 6414/2017 and HC/PA 6417/2017 respectively with the client as the\n\n\fdonor and one Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin as the attorney, to the client without the\npresence of the attorney or other family members of the attorney so as to\navoid any undue influence being exerted over the client.\n\nTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n150. The Applicant contended that the Respondent should have met Mdm Liew,\nexplained the POAs, and taken her instructions in Kelvin’s and his family’s\nabsence. Kelvin and Daniel were beneficiaries and the Respondent should have\n\nbeen concerned that Mdm Liew could not have been able to communicate her\nwishes in front of them. It relied on Jayakumar [68] and Tan Puay Khiang [97].\n\n151. The Respondent argued that he had asked Mdm Liew thrice if the Meeting could\nproceed in the presence of Kelvin and his family. He said that Kelvin was, after all,\n\nMdm Liew’s son and his family were her family members. He contended that he\nobserved that Mdm Liew appeared relaxed, alert and showed no signs that she was\nnot acting on her own free will.\n\n1L\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n152. Rule 5(2)(c) has been set out above.\n\n153.\n\nIn our discussion above under the First Charge, we said that all the circumstances\nhad to be considered. The allegation that the Respondent should have received his\ninstructions and explained the POAs without the presence of the attorney or other\nfamily members of the attorney cannot be viewed in isolation and was just one of\nthe matters that has to be taken into account in determining whether the\n\nRespondent breached his duties. We are not satisfied that a charge based only on\nthis one aspect of his conduct is sufficient to amount to a breach of Rule 5(2)(c).\n\n154.\n\nIn the circumstances, we dismiss this charge.\n\nTH C]\n\nGl\n\n\f155. That you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out\nin section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (Cap. 161) in that,\nwhilst you acted for Madam Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew\n\nFong),\n\nYong Chiang Kelvin and Goh Sok Ngoh Jacqueline in the purchase of 1\nArdmore Park #36-02, Singapore 259962, where there was a diversity of\ninterests that existed between the parties, you failed to advance Mdm Liew Khoon\nFong’s (alias Liew Fong) interests unaffected by the interest of Goh Yong Chiang\nKelvin and/or Goh Sok Ngoh Jacqueline, by removing Mdm Liew’s name from\nthe Option to Purchase dated 1 December 2017 in respect of the said\nproperty, which is a breach of Rule 20(5) and Rule 20(6) of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015.\n\nTHE PARTIES” POSTIONS\n156. The Applicant argued that the Respondent’s position that he was acting only for\nKelvin in the purchase of the Condominium Unit is mistaken because he admitted\nthat he was acting for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew when the Condominium\nOTP was exercised. This was also seen in his letter of 8 December 2017 to\n\nSterlingLaw when the Condominium OTP was exercised”*. He therefore was under\nan obligation to inform Mdm Liew, his client, when her name was removed as a\npurchaser of the Condominium Unit.\n\n157.\n\nIt contended that a diversity of interests arose when Kelvin instructed the\n\nRespondent to remove Mdm Liew’s name as a purchaser and that that removal was\nto Mdm Liew’s disadvantage and conversely to the advantage of Kelvin and\nJacqueline. Further, as the Respondent would have been aware that Kelvin’s\n\ninstructions conflicted with the 2 POA, he should have directly informed Mdm\nLiew of Kelvin’s instructions, which would result in Mdm Liew losing her most\n\nsignificant asset, the Namly Property?.\n\nparagraphs 76, 77 and 78 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n* paragraphs 81 and 82 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n\n\f158.\n\nThe Complainant testified that the Respondent should have informed Mdm Liew,\nhis client, that her name was to be removed under the Amended Condominium\nO'P and that as a result, she would no longer own a property under her name. The\nRespondent should also have ceased to act in the conveyancing transaction or\nceased to act for Mdm Liew and obtain her informed consent, in writing, for him\n\nto continue to act in the conveyancing transaction®.\n159.\n\nInstead, the Respondent sent the 24 January 2018 letter to seek the vendor’s\nconsent for Mdm Liew’s name to be removed although he was aware that Mdm\n\nLiew might be prejudiced?.\n160.\n\nThe Respondent made the same arguments for the Fourth Charge and the Fifth\nCharge.\n\n161. He denied there was a conflict of interests in representing Mdm Liew, Kelvin and\nJacqueline because Mdm Liew received fair consideration for the sale of the Namly\nProperty. Thus, there was common interest among the three to purchase the\nCondominium Unit for the family’s residential purposes and Kelvin and Jacqueline\n‘became the Respondent’s clients as purchasers of the Condominium Unit only after\nthe original plan to purchase that unit under the terms of the 2™ POA, read with the\n\n1% POA, was aborted?’.\n162. He argued that the Option to Purchase that was exercised on 8 December 2017 was\nnot exercised pursuant to the 2™ POA. By that time, he had been told that the\n“money most likely will not come in”. In any event, the 2° POA was contingent on\nthe sale proceeds of the sale of the Namly Property being used to purchase the\nCondominium Unit?*. He was also of the view that, as Mdm Liew would no longer\nbe a party to the purchase of the Condominium Unit, there would be no prejudice\n\nparagraph 109 of the Complainant’s AEIC\nparagraph 89 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\no paragraphs 146 and 154 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n= paragraph 156 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\fto her and as such there was no need for him to cease acting for Mdm Liew or the\n\nothers as there was no conflict of interests.\n163. The Respondent also contended that, since he believed that the POAs were valid\nand enforceable, he was entitled to take instructions from Kelvin as Mdm Liew’s\n\nattorney in the purchase of the Condominium Unit.** He also pointed out that the\nproceeds of sale were to be used for the purchase of a single-storey condominium\n\nunit and the 2° POA did not specify any particular address of that unit.*!\n164. The Respondent said that when he wrote the letter dated 24 January 2018 to\nSterlingLaw, he acted in his capacity as Kelvin’s solicitor in the purchase of the\nCondominium Unit. This, according to him, was because the Complainant had\ncommenced Suit 45 against Kelvin who had informed him that Mdm Liew would\nno longer be a party to the purchase of the Condominium Unit which would be\npurchased in the names of Kelvin and Jacqueline, that that purchase would be\n\nfinanced by his and Jacqueline’s own savings and that he wanted the Respondent to\n\nact for Kelvin and Jacqueline in the purchase of the Condominium Unit*2.\n165. The Respondent also said that as the 2014 LPA had not been activated at the time,\n\nthere was no need to inform Mdm Liew of the removal of her name, the non-\n\ninclusion of Daniel’s name, and the inclusion of Jacqueline’s name?>.\nII.\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n166. Rules 20(5) and 20(6) provide that where a legal practitioner acts for 2 or more\ndifferent parties in a matter or transaction, and a diversity of interests arises between\nthose parties during the course of the retainer for the matter or transaction, he or she\nmust throughout the remainder of the course of the retainer for the matter or\ntransaction continue to be vigilant of any conflict or potential conflict between the\n\n2 paragraph 146 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n* paragraph 140 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n1 paragraphs 140 and 142 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n% paragraphs 58 and 59 of the Respondent’s AEIC\n» paragraphs 141 and 142 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\finterests of any of the relevant parties and inform each relevant party in the matter\nor transaction if, in the course of the retainer, the legal practitioner has difficulty in\n\nadvising on and dealing with the relevant parties” divergent interests competently,\nevenly and consistently.\n\n167. The following discussion is on the assumption that there was in law a solicitor-client\n\nrelationship between the Respondent and Mdm Liew. We will come back to that\nbelow.\n\n168. Before 24 January 2018, when the Respondent wrote to SterlingLaw to say that his\nclients intended to withdraw Mdm Liew’s name from the purchase of the\nCondominium Unit, he had been aware of the letters from Templars Law to\nWongPartnership\ndated 15 December 2017, 22 December 2017, 5 January 2018 and\n10 January 2018.\n\n169. The Respondent was also aware of the following: First, the Complainant claimed to\n\ne the sole donee under the 2014 LPA, and that she claimed that Kelvin had moved\nMdm Liew to an unknown location. Second, Dr Ang had issued a medical report\nwhich said that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia which started around the\n\nmiddle of 2017*. Third, the Complainant’s position was that the 1% POA was\ninvalid and unenforceable, that Mdm Liew lacked the mental capacity to decide to\nsell the Namly Property, and that her lawyers had asked that the sale be stopped and\n‘'ad asked WongPartnership if they had instructions to accept service of process on\n\nbehalf of their client.\n170. He therefore found himself in a position where, in acting for Mdm Liew, Kelvin\nand Jacqueline, he had secured for her an interest in the Condominium Unit and\nKelvin was now asking him to divest one of his clients of her interest. Those\ninstructions could not have been given under the POAs meant to facilitate the sale\nof the Namly Property and the purchase, with Mdm Liew being one of the buyers,\nof a single-storey condominium unit. The Respondent would also have known that\n\npage 1070 of the Complainant’s AEIC\n\n\fthe fact that Daniel’s name was not added to the Condominium OTP was not\nconsistent with Mdm Liew’s alleged intention to make a gift to him.\n171. Further, he had been put on notice of the matters in Templars Law’s letters. He\nwould have known that, should the 1% POA be said to be invalid because of Mdm\nLiew’s alleged mental condition, that would also call into question the validity of\n\nthe 2 POA which was signed at the same time.\n172. He therefore found himself in a position where if the POAs were valid, and he\nwithdrew Mdm Liew’s name, he would affect her interests. If the POAs were not\nvalid, he could not act on Kelvin’s instructions, which were purportedly given under\nthe POAs, to remove her name.\n\n173. In these circumstances, he was under a duty to check the position with Mdm Liew\nto ensure that there was no divergence of interests between her on the one hand and\nKelvin and his family, on the other. He was under a duty to satisfy himself that she\ncontinued, after the POAs, to have the mental capacity to instruct him in the sale of\nthe Namly Property and the purchase of the Condominium Unit, as well as ask Mdm\nLiew if the purchase in Kelvin, Jacqueline and her names was consistent with her\n\nintention to make a gift to Daniel, and whether she agreed with giving up her interest\nin the Condominium Unit. If the Respondent had not been given access to her or\nwas unable to properly obtain instructions, he should have ceased acting for all his\n\nclients.\n174. However, this does not mean that the Fourth Charge has been made out.\n175. These Rules, and the Fourth Charge, are premised on there being a retainer and a\n\nsolicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and Mdm Liew at the material\ntime. In fact, the Applicant’s Closing Submissions emphasise the Respondent’s\n\nduty to his “client™.\n\n* see eg paragraph 88\n\n\f176. It is not the Applicant’s case that the Rules apply even where there is no retainer\n\nbut that a solicitor believed that there was one.\n177. If, as is the Complainant’s case, the POAs were null and void, and the High Court\nin Suit 45 has found them to be null and void, then the question which arises is\n\nwhether there was in law a solicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and\nMdm Liew after she signed the POAs which have been found by the High Court to\nbe null and void.\n178. The fact that he informed SterlingLaw that he acted for Mdm Liew and that he\n\npurported to act for Mdm Liew when the Condominium OTP was accepted and\nthereafter does not mean that there was that relationship in law or that in law, he\nhad been retained by her.\n179. As this issue was not addressed by either the Applicant or the Respondent, at a posthearing conference on 19 July 2022, we raised this for the parties to consider their\n\npositions on it since it affected the 4™ to 7 Charges. We asked the Applicant’s\ncounsel whether it wished to proceed with these charges. The Applicant’s counsel\nsaid that he will consider the matter and take instructions and get back to us. The\nRespondent’s counsel said that he did not address this point because of an oversight.\n180. By a letter dated 26 July 2022, the Applicant’s counsel said that the Applicant would\nlike to proceed on these charges. In that letter, the Applicant’s counsel referred to\n‘Mahidon Nichiar bte Mohd Ali and others v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin [2015] 5\nSLR 62 and the disciplinary proceedings which followed from that decision,\n\nreported as The Law Society of Singapore v Harjeet Singh [2016] SGDT 9. He\nargued that in light of these cases, the Applicant was of the view that there “could\nstill be a breach” of the relevant Rules referred to in these charges.\n181. ‘With respect, we are unable to see how cither case is of assistance. In Mahidon,\nthere was a solicitor-client relationship between the appellants and the solicitor\nbefore the deed in issue, i.e., the RBI Deed, came to be executed: see [17]. It was in\nthat context that the Court of Appeal considered the scope of the solicitor’s duties\n\nand whether he had breached them. Those findings had no impact on the solicitor-\n\n\fclient relationship. Unlike the present case, it was not a situation where the\nsolicitor’s authority was based on the very document which the solicitor was found\nnot to have properly advised.\n182. As we set out above, the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. We are not\nsatisfied that the Applicant has discharged that burden to show that even though the\nPOAs have been found to be null and void, there continued thereafter to be a\nsolicitor-client relationship in law between the Respondent and Mdm Liew.\n183. For these reasons, we dismiss the Fourth Charge.\n\nFIFTH CHARGE\n184. That you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\n\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section\n83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 in that, whilst you acted for Madam\nLiew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in the purchase of 1 Ardmore Park #36-02,\nSingapore 259962, you failed to inform the client of all information known to you\nthat may reasonably affect the interests of the client in respect of the purchase of 1\nArdmore Park #36-02, Singapore 259962 in particular of the removal of her name,\nthe non-inclusion of the name of Daniel Goh Eng Sheng and the inclusion of the\nname of Goh Sok Ngoh Jacqueline from the Option to Purchase dated 1 December\n2017 in respect of the said property, which is a breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015.\n\n1.\n\nTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n\n185. The Applicant argued that the Respondent had failed to inform Mdm Liew that her\ninstructions under the 2 POA were not being followed by Kelvin, the attorney,\nbecause the Condominium Unit was purchased with Jacqueline and not Daniel. It\nalso argued that the Respondent had assumed a responsibility to Mdm Liew to\n\npurchase the Condominium Unit*.\n\n% paragraphs 89 and 94 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n\n\f186. The Respondent made the same arguments as he did in relation to the Fourth\nCharge.\n\n1L\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n187. Rule 5(2)(b) has been set out above.\n\n188. This charge is premised on there being a solicitor-client relationship between the\nRespondent and Mdm Liew at the time of the alleged failure.\n\n189. For the reasons set out under the Fourth Charge in relation to whether the Applicant\nhas discharged its burden to show that there was in law a solicitor-client\n\nrelationship, we dismiss this charge.\nSIXTH CHARGE\n\n190. That you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section\n\n83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 in that, whilst you acted for Madam\nLiew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in the preparation, execution and registration\nof 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged with the Supreme Court\nas HC/PA 6414/2017 and HC/PA 6417/2017 respectively with the client as the\n\ndonor and one Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin as the attorney, you failed to inform the\nclient of all information known to you that may reasonably affect the interests of\nthe client in respect of the said Powers of Attorney in particular of the medical report\nprepared by Dr Ang Yong Guan dated 30 December 2017 and correspondence from\nTemplars Law LLC dated 12 February 2018 relating to the alleged lack of mental\ncapacity of the client as at the time of execution of the said Powers of Attorney,\nwhich is a breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\n\nRules 2015.\n\n\fTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n191. The Applicant contended that the Respondent knew from correspondence which\n\nwas forwarded to him that the Complainant had challenged Mdm Liew’s mental\n\ncapacity®’. It argued that the Respondent was privy to the Dr Ang’s medical report\ndated 30 December 2017 which said that Mdm Liew’s mental capacity had\nsignificantly deteriorated since the middle of 2017 and of the Complainant’s\n\ncomplaint that Kelvin had concealed Mdm Liew from her®®.\n192, The Applicant contends that, in spite of the above, the Respondent failed to inform\n\nMdm Liew of this challenge and instead informed Kelvin®.\n193. The Applicant further said that the Respondent should have been put on notice of\nthe possibility that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia which started around\n\nthe middle of 2017 and did not inform her of that to obtain her instructions. It was\nwrong for the Respondent to assume that the Complainant’s concerns were entirely\n\nwithout substance and did not even consider that there was a risk that Mdm Liew\nhad not authorised Kelvin to find a lawyer to prepare the POAs and yet proceeded\n\nto forward the correspondence to Kelvin®.\n194, The Respondent argued that when he received the letter dated 10 January 2018 from\n\n‘WongPartnership, he forwarded it to Kelvin, who was Mdm Liew’s attorney, to ask\nif there had been a change in Mdm Liew’s mental capacity since the Meeting.\n\nKelvin denied that there was any change*!.\n195. Insofar as Templars Law’s letter dated 12 February 2018 was concemed, the\nRespondent maintained that as the information sought was protected by solicitor-\n\nclient privilege and as the Respondent was of the opinion that the 2014 LPA had\n\n¥ paragraph 100 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n* paragraphs 98 and 104 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n* paragraph 100 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n\n“ paragraph 108 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n“ paragraph 158 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\fnot been properly activated, there was no need for him to respond and therefore no\n\nneed for him to take Mdm Liew’s instructions on that letter.\n1L\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n196. Rule 5(2)(b) has been set out above.\n\n197. This charge is premised on there being a solicitor-client relationship between the\nRespondent and Mdm Liew at the time of the alleged failure.\n198. For the reasons set out under the Fourth Charge in relation to whether the Applicant\n\nhas discharged its burden to show that there was in law a solicitor-client\nrelationship, we dismiss this charge.\nSEVENTH CHARGE\n\n199. That you, Teo Eng Thye, are charged with misconduct unbefitting of an\nadvocate and solicitor in the discharge of your professional duties as an\n\nadvocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in\nsection\n\n83(2)(h)\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nLegal\n\nProfession\n\nAct\n\n1966\n\nin\n\nthat,\n\nwhilst you had acted for Madam Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in\n\nrespect of the matters that were the subject-matter of Suit No 45 of 2018,\nwhere in the said Suit your client was the plaintiff and one Goh Yong\n\nChiang Kelvin was a defendant, you failed to advance her interests\nunaffected by the interests of Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin, by failing to take the\n\ninstructions of your client or her donee when you were served with a\nsubpoena by the solicitors acting for your client in the said Suit and\ninstead taking the instructions of Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin.\n\nL\n\nTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n\n\f200. The Applicant argued that whether the Respondent complied with the subpoena is\n\nimrelevant to this charge®?. It said that the Respondent should not have sought\ninstructions in relation to the subpoena from Kelvin because he had no authority to\nmake decisions and act for Mdm Liew with respect to the subpoena. Further, since\nKelvin was a defendant in Suit 45, it was improper for the Respondent to take advice\n\nfrom Kelvin’s solicitors*.\n201. The Complainant said* that the Respondent had conceded during the hearing before\nthe Inquiry Committee (Transcript dated 25 March 20121 page 56) that he should\n\nhave taken instructions from Mdm Liew and not from Kelvin, who was represented\nby Drew & Napier. She also said that the Respondent did not advance Mdm Liew’s\n\ninterests as he disclosed the subpoena to Kelvin and obtained advice from Kelvin’s\nlawyers as to the manner in which he should comply with the subpoena, even though\n\nKelvin was a defendant in Suit 45. She said that since the Respondent had received\nthe 2014 LPA by then, he should have known that Kelvin had no authority to make\ndecisions and act for Mdm Liew with respect to the subpoena.\n\n202. The Respondent argued that he believed that he was entitled to take instructions\nfrom Kelvin and/or his solicitors because Kelvin was a party to Suit 45, the\n\ndocuments that were requested were protected by solicitor-client privilege and that\nthe POAs were valid and enforceable. Further, because Suit 45 was to determine\nwhether Mdm Liew had mental capacity, he continued to take instructions from\n\nKelvin®.\nI\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n203. Section 83 (2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 states that due cause may be\nshown by proof that an advocate and solicitor has been guilty of such misconduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a\n\n‘member of an honourable profession.\n\n“2 paragraph 113 ofthe Applicant's Closing Submissions\n\nparagraph 115 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n“ paragraphs 145 and 146 of the Complainant's AEIC\n* paragraphs 167 and 170 ofthe Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\f204. We do not agree that this Charge has been made out.\n20s. When the Respondent was served with a subpoena, his interests were potentially\ndivergent from those of the Complainant, who was representing Mdm Liew. Suit\n45 was an action to nullify the POAs. The Respondent’s conduct was going to be\n\nsquarely in issue, and he would likely be criticised. In our view, he was fully entitled\nto speak to whoever he wished, including Kelvin and any law firm which felt able\n\nto advise him on his own position and exposure.\n206. ‘We disagree with the assertion that the Respondent should have taken instructions\nfrom Mdm Liew, who was effectively the plaintiff in Suit 45, through the\n\nComplainant who initially acted pursuant to the 2014 LPA and later as executrix of\nMdm Liew’s estate, and therefore on the other side of the Suit.\n\n207. There is another reason we do not agree that this charge has been made out. This\ncharge is premised on there being a solicitor-client relationship between the\nRespondent and Mdm Liew at the time of the alleged failure.\n208. For the reasons set out under the Fourth Charge in relation to whether the Applicant\nhas discharged its burden to show that there was in law a solicitor-client\nrelationship, we dismiss this charge.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n209. In conclusion, we find that the First and Second Charges have been made out. We\n\ndismiss the remaining Charges.\n210. In considering whether cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists, we\nhave had regard to the fact that it was not the Applicant’s case and was not put to\n\nthe Respondent that he acted with any deliberation, dishonesty, or for improper\nmotives. It appears from the Respondent’s evidence that he appears to have been\ninfluenced about the scope of his obligations by the small fee that he would eam\nfrom preparing and attending to the execution of the POAs. That was an unfortunate\n\n\f24th\n\n\f","timestamp":"2023-06-10T04:00:28+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jun-2023/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Carolyn Tan Beng Hui (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-carolyn-tan-beng-hui-respondent\">In the Matter of Carolyn Tan Beng Hui (Respondent), <strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>On or about 2 May 2017, sale proceeds from the sale of a residential property were deposited with the Respondent’s law firm, Tan &amp; Au LLP (<strong>TALLP</strong>).

defects in respect of the charges. He submitted that\nthe First Charge and the Third Charge (and their corresponding alternative charges)\nform what is essentially a single offence and/or are sufficiently close as to constitute\na unitary offence for the purpose of sentencing. 1 He raised the issue again at the\nHearing\nthe Tribunal asked Counsel for the Law Society, Ms Fong, whether she had received\ninstructions on the points raised and her reply was that she had not as the objections\nwere raised about only a week before the Hearing. The Tribunal therefore granted her\ntime to obtain instructions from the Law Society on the objections.\n\n1\n\n\f6\n6.\n\nWhen the Hearing resumed, Ms Fong informed the Tribunal that the Law Society had\nconsidered the matter and her instructions are to withdraw the first, second, third and\nAlternative 1st\nAlternative 2nd Charge\n\nCharge\npro\n\nProceeded Charges\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent thereupon claimed trial on the Proceeded Charges.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent also confirmed that he admits to the facts as stated in the Agreed\nASOF\nthough he had claimed trial on the Proceeded Charges.

He said that according\nto her, the Statutory Demand had been served on 27 October 2015 and as such,\nshe had 14 days to set it aside. He advised that the due date was therefore 10\nNovember 2015.\n\n(iii)\n\nOn 4 November 2015, the Respondent followed up by email time-stamped\n1.44pm, which reminded the Complainant to reply to his queries as the\ntimelines were continuing to run. He also emphasised that he needed these\nanswers in order to prepare the originating summons and supporting affidavit\nto set aside the Statutory Demand. On the same day, at 1.51pm, the\nComplainant provided further answers to the Responden\nshe would provide the rest of the answers in later emails.\n\nquestions and said\n\n\f8\n(iv)\n\nBy email on 4 November 2015 at 11.22pm, the Complainant sought to provide\n\nWhatsapp messages. On 9 November 2015, the Complainant asked for an\nupdate and the Respondent said that he was studying her case.\n\n(v)\n\nOn 10 November 2015, which was the deadline the for setting aside, the\nComplainant sent a Whatsapp message to enquire as to the status of the filing.\nShe noted that the deadline had arrived, to which the Respondent said that her\nunderstanding was correct. He then said\nfor extension of time so long as filed within a reasonable period. BTW today\nis a public holiday. Happy\n\n(vi)\n\nAs there was no further word from the Respondent, the Complainant followed\nup by Whatsapp on 1 December 2015, asking about her\nand expressing a hope to have updates soon. The Respondent replied, saying\nthat he was in court. He also said\nShe responded, asking if there was a deadline. There was no reply from\nthe Respondent.\n\n(vii)\n\nThe Complainant then sent an email on 2 December 2015, time-stamped\n5.12pm, again inquiring about the deadline for submission of the setting aside\napplication.\n\n\f9\n(viii)\n\nThat same day, the Respondent replied via email with time-stamp 5.51pm,\nassuring the Complainant that he was applying for extension of time to file the\nsetting aside application and that\n\n(ix)\n\nHowever, as at the time of the deadline to set aside the Statutory Demand (i.e.\n10 November 2015), the Respondent had not in fact prepared the application.\nHe had also not filed any ap\n\nEOT\n\nApplication\n\n(x)\n\nAccordingly, as the Statutory Demand had remained unsatisfied and/or\nunchallenged, the Complainant was presumed to be unable to pay her debts.\nA bankruptcy application was filed against the Complainant on 25 November\n2015.\n\n(xi)\n\nOn 4 December 2015, the Respondent sent a Whatsapp message to the\nComplainant stating\n\nvery\n\nbusy with court hearings this week. I will complete drafting all court papers\nand call you when I am\n\n(xii)\n\nOn 24 December 2015, a bankruptcy order was made against the Complainant.\n\n(xiii)\nengagement.\n\n\f10\n(xiv)\n\nOn 19 January 2016, the Respondent returned the deposit of $7,000.00 to the\nComplainant.\n\n(xv)\n\nthe\nbankruptcy order issued against the Complainant was annulled and the\nStatutory Demand was set aside.\n\nA.\n\nDOCUMENTS TENDERRED AT THE HEARING\n\n12.\n\nThe following Affidavits of Evidence in Chief were filed and referred to at the\nHearing:\n\n(i)\n2022; and\n(ii)\n2022.\n\n13.\n\nBoth Affidavits of Evidence in Chief AEICs\n\nwere brief. The\n\nmerely referred to the ASOF as being true and accurate. The\n\nAEIC\nAEIC also\n\nmerely confirmed the contents of the ASOF. He had added that he verily believed that\nhis conduct that is the subject matter of these proceedings does not amount to\nmisconduct that warrants sanction pursuant to the Act, and on this basis, he\nrespectfully requested that this Tribunal acquit him of the charges made against him.\n\n\f11\n14.\n\nThe following bundles were tendered at the Hearing:\n\n(i)\n\nAgreed Bundle of Documents dated 7 March 2022, which included the ASOF\nat pages 407-412 (the ABOD\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\n2022;\n\n(iv)\n\nand\n\n(v)\n\n2022.\n\nB.\n\n15.\n\n2022;\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nAt the Hearing, Counsel for the Law Society, Ms Fong, had summarised the salient\nbackground facts with some details which were not found in the ASOF. However,\n\nmind. Mr Sreenivasan S.C. for the Respondent confirmed that he does not dispute\nthese facts even though they were not in the ASOF.2 In any case, the facts were\ndocumented in the ABOD.\n\n16.\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena [2013] SGHC 5 ( Selena\nChiong ) wa\nbe sufficiently grave and could be considered to be a breach of an essential duty of an\nadvocate and solicitor such that it is inexcusable and would constitute professional\nmisconduct.3 Ms Fong also cited a textbook authority authored by Jeffrey Pinsler SC.4\n\n2\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 32 at line 17 and page 33 at line 2, where Counsel for the Respondent was\ndealing with the limited issue of the emails of 4 November 2015.\n3\n[14].\n4\n[17].\n\n\f12\n\n17.\n\nThe decision of Zhou Tong v Public Prosecutor\n\nZhou Tong\n\nwas next referred to. Members of the profession have to be competent and diligent in\nadvising their clients when representing their interests. This fundamental professional\nresponsibility requires every solicitor to thoroughly familiarise himself with the facts\n, analyse the issues carefully, research the applicable law and then\n. Professional incompetence and\n\nconsider how best to\n\nindolence are no less a cause for concern as compared with cases of dishonesty.\n\n18.\n\nIt was submitted that the Commentary on the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules 2015 at [05.047] summarised what professionalism encompasses in the context\nof competence and diligence pursuant to rule 5 of the Legal Profession (Professional\nLPPCR\n\n5\n\nMs Fong noted that in the same commentary\n\nat [05.041], it was said that the duty of reasonable diligence also involved completing\nwork for the client as soon as reasonably possible. It was said that this is also\nprescribed in rule 17(2)(b) of the LPPCR.6\n\n19.\nWritten Submissions, it was urged that we should make a finding that the\n\ndo, namely, to set aside the Statutory Demand. He was aware of the deadline as\nevidenced by the correspondence. Yet, after the Complainant had provided the further\ninformation on 4 November 2015 to address the\n\n5\n6\n\n[19].\n[20].\n\ncomments and\n\n\f13\nquestions about the background facts relating to her case, there was simply no\nresponse from or follow-up by him. It was the Complainant who followed up and\nsought updates.7\n\n20.\nqueries and requests in a manner that disclosed a lack of care and truthfulness. The\nfollowing are some instances:8\n\n(i)\n\nIn his response on 9 November 2015, he said that he was studying [her]\ncase\".\n\n(ii)\n\nOn 10 November 2015, he acknowledged that the deadline to set aside had\narrived but merely sought to assure the Complainant that an extension of\ntime could be sought so long as it is filed within a reasonable time\n\n(iii)\n\nWhile the Respondent told the Complainant in his email response on 2\nDecember 2015 that he was applying for an extension of time to file the setting\naside application, no such step was in fact taken. The Respondent s written\nexplanation dated 26 February 2021 to the Inquiry Panel, had confirmed this\nfact.\n\n(iv)\n\nEven up to 18 January 2016, when the Complainant realised that she had been\nmade a bankrupt, it was pointed out that the Respondent had continued to\nstring the Complainant along. There was no attempt on the Respondent\nto explain the delay. Instead, he sought to pin the blame on the Complainant.\n\n7\n8\n\n[22].\n\n\f14\n21.\n\nIt was contended that the Respondent was very much aware that the failure to set aside\nthe Statutory Demand could result ina bankruptcy application being taken out against\nthe Complainant. Notwithstanding this, he took no steps to advance the Complainant s\ncase nor to protect her interests beyond the initial enquiry for the chronology and\nto study the\ncase\nto have, at the very least, written to the creditor s solicitors to inform them that the\nComplainant was disputing the debt and would be applying to set aside the Statutory\nDemand or steps would be taken to apply for an extension of time.9 He was aware of\nthe need to set aside but had simply not made any attempt to prepare the application.10\nCourt searches were not even done to ascertain if the creditor had commenced\nbankruptcy proceedings.11 It was argued that the draconian consequences resulting\nfrom failure to set aside the Statutory Demand would have left the Complainant\nirremediably prejudiced. In fact, she was adjudged bankrupt on 24 December 2015\nand had to spend the next two and a half years or so instituting proceedings to set aside\nthe Statutory Demand and annul the bankruptcy order made against her.\n\n22.\n\nThe Law Society also contended that given the scope of the retainer (which was to set\naside the Statutory Demand) it was incumbent on the Respondent to make the\napplication, and if necessary, to seek an extension of time to do so. The\ninitial inquiries to understand the case and subsequent silence (apart from furnishing\nfalse assurances when pressed for updates) were not sufficient to discharge his\nprofessional responsibility.12\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n[24].\n\n\f15\n23.\n\nIn respect of the Alternative 1st Charge, Counsel for the Law Society stated that the\nthe retainer (i.e. to set aside the\nStatutory Demand within the prescribed time) and the gross delay in his management\nof the case would clearly fall afoul of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, given that an\n\nLPA.13\n\n24.\n\nIn respect of the Alternative 2nd Charge, the Law\n\ncase is that the Respondent\n\nfailed to keep the Complainant reasonably informed of the application to set aside the\n\nfailure to apply for extension of time was patently unbefitting of an advocate and\nsolicitor under Section 83(2)(h). He was well aware of the avenue of applying for an\nextension if he needed more time to understand the matter.14\n\n25.\n\nCounsel for the Law Society further noted that the present case bears striking\nsimilarity to the cases of Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R)\n466 Ng Chee Sing and Selena Chiong. In Ng Chee Sing, the Court of Three Judges\nhad found that the solicitor had failed to carry out what he had been instructed to do\nunder his retainer. In Selena Chiong, the respondent had made false representations as\nto the status of the matter.15 In both cases, the solicitor was found guilty of grossly\nimproper conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Act and/or misconduct unbefitting of\nan advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(h) of the Act. 16 In our case, it was\nsubmitted that the Alternative 2nd Charge was similarly made out.\n\n13\n14\n\n[38].\n[39].\n\n15\n16\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 105 at lines 15-18.\n\n\f16\n\n26.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Tribunal informed counsel for the Law Society that we were\nminded to hear arguments for sentencing at the same sitting. Counsel for the Law\nSociety stated that her instructions were to await the outcome before arguing on\nsentencing. Nonetheless, should the Tribunal find that sanctions were necessary, she\nsubmitted that there should at least be a fine, subject to instructions from the Law\nSociety.17\n\nC.\n\n27.\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nAt the outset, Counsel for the Respondent stressed that the standard of proof\nbeyond reasonable doubt 18 It was argued that\nif the Law Society was arguing that there was untruthfulness that elevated the various\ncommunications into misconduct, the burden rested on it to prove its case. There\nshould be no adverse inference to be drawn against the Respondent.19\n\n28.\n\nIt was noted that the necessity of adhering to the criminal standard was because\nmoral censure and professional disapprobation cast upon the solicitor [upon a finding\nas\nwas stated in Law Society of Singapore v Dhanwant Singh [2020] 4 SLR 736.20\n\n17\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 105 at lines 15-18.\n\n18\n19\n20\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 105 at lines 19-22.\n\n\f17\n29.\n\nThe case of Law Society of Singapore v Harjeet Singh\n\nHarjeet\n\nthat:21\n\nSingh\n\negregious than\ns 83(2)(h) which was\ndescribed in Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466\n\nnot fall within any of the other enumerated grounds but is nevertheless\nconsidered\n\n30.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent also highlighted that mere negligence does not amount to\nmisconduct and does not warrant sanction under the Act. There are different degrees\nof negligence. Whether or not a particular degree of negligence amounts to\nmisconduct must be determined by viewing the gravity of the negligent act in the\ncontext of the matter whilst taking into account all the circumstances of the case. It\nwas observed in Law Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar [2012] 4 SLR 1232 that an\n\ncompensation but not censure. The professional lapse must be grave if it is to attract\ndisciplinary sanction (see [1] above). Plainly, several serious lapses in the course of\na professional engagement would invite serious consequences, including disciplinary\nsanction(s). 22\n\n21\n22\n\n-[34].\n\n\f18\n31.\ndoes not amount to misconduct that warrants sanction pursuant to the Act. The\nfailure to file the Setting Aside Application and/or the EOT Application\nwas his one lapse and would, at worst, amount to a one-off act of innocent bungling\nwant of skill 23\n\n32.\n\nIn this regard, the present case can be distinguished from Selena Chiong.24 It was also\nnoted that the respondent in Selena Chiong committed several lapses in her\nengagement with the complainant. The lapses included providing the complainant\nwith inappropriate advice, failing to advice the client as well as misleading the\ncomplainant. The Court of Three Judges had noted that there was a pattern of chronic\n\nas a solicitor\n\n33.\n\n25\n\nIt was submitted that in contrast, the Respondent here had only committed one lapse,\ni.e. his failure to file the setting aside application or the application to seek extension of\ntime to do so. Unlike in Selena Chiong, his conduct does not involve the failure to\nproperly advise the Complainant, or misleading her. He was not guilty of any pattern\nof chronic irresponsibility or problem of attitude. The Respondent had also not\nattempted to provide excuses for his conduct or justify his actions. He has admitted to\nthe factual averments of these charges. He initiated the filing of the ASOF to assist\nwith streamlining these proceedings so that the Complainant would not be subjected\nto prolonged proceedings.26\n\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\ns Closing Submissions at [55].\n-[57].\n[57].\n[57].\n\n\f19\n\n34.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent also submitted that while it is true the Respondent did not\ndo as he had promised, it did not make him dishonest. Counsel for the Respondent\nspecifically referred to an email communication dated 2 December 2015 where he told\nthe Complainant that\n\nare applying for extension of time to file the setting aside\n\napplication. Should not be a problem.

In this\nregard, Counsel for the Respondent cited several cases that stand for the proposition\ncases involving grossly improper conduct without dishonesty or deceit will\n\n27\n\nAgreed Bundle of Documents at page 462.\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 95 at line 8.\n29\n[66].\n28\n\n\f20\ngenerally attract a monetary penalty\n\n30\n\nHe also reserved his right to file a mitigation\n\nplea at the appropriate juncture, if necessary.31\n\n38.\n\nMr Sreenivasan SC urged the Tribunal to apply Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine\nGowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR 390.32 He argued that no cause of sufficient\ngravity exists, as the present case does not fall within the category of the\nof complaints that should be referred to the Court of Three Judges.33\n\n39.\n\nInstead, it was submitted that a reprimand or a fine should be imposed. Notably, the\nfine, if imposed, should be on the lower-end.34 The reasons for his submissions are as\nfollows:\n\n(i)\n\nThe charges are closely connected and arise out of the same transaction;\n\n(ii)\n\nThe Complainant terminated her engagement with the Respondent shortly\nafter she found out that a Bankruptcy Order had been made against the\nRespondent. The Respondent therefore did not have the opportunity to remedy\nthe situation;\n\n(iii)\n\nThe Respondent received no financial advantage. He returned to the\nComplainant the Deposit paid and did not charge the Complainant for any\nwork done;\n\n30\n31\n32\n\nRespondent's Bundle of Authorities, Tab 11.\n\n33\n34\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 99 at line 24.\n\n\f21\n(iv)\n\nThe Bankruptcy Order was eventually annulled and the Statutory Demand set\naside;\n\n(v)\n\nThe motive of the Complainant is called into question. The Complaint was\nfiled more than two years after the Bankruptcy Order had been annulled and\nthe Statutory Demand set aside, and almost five years after the Bankruptcy\nApplication had been filed. The Complainant had not offered an explanation\nas to why there was an inordinate delay in the filing of the Complaint. Any\ncomplaint she wished to make ought to have been filed earlier;\n\n(vi)\n\nNo allegations of dishonesty have been raised against the Respondent;\n\n(vii)\n\nThe Respondent has no antecedents; and\n\n(viii)\n\nIn admitting to the factual averments of the Proceeded Charges, the\nRespondent has not unnecessarily prolonged these proceedings but has instead\nshown remorse.\n\nThe main question before the Tribunal is whether the facts as adduced from the\ndocuments in the ABOD and the ASOF are sufficient to establish that the Respondent\nis guilty of misconduct unbefitting on advocate and solicitor as alleged in the\nProceeded Charges.\n\nBurden of Proof\n\n40.\n\nAt the outset, Counsel for the Respondent submitted that even if the evidence before\nus would have established negligence on the part of the Respondent, they are\n\n\f22\ninsufficient to find him guilty of misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor\nAct\n\n41.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the Law Society to establish that the documents would prove\nnot merely negligent but\nsuch that it would amount to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n42.\n\nThe Law Society on the other hand contended that the evidence is clear that the\nRespondent was guilty of misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor. He had\nfailed to apply to set aside the Statutory Demand made against his client and to apply\nfor an extension of time after the deadline to set aside the Statutory Demand had\npassed. This resulted in a Bankruptcy Order being made against the Complainant.\n\n43.\n\nIt is trite law that the standard of proof is to show that the Respondent was guilty of\nthe charges beyond reasonable doubt. 35 We would refer to the case of Public\nProsecutor v GCK and another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 where it was held as\nfollows:36\n\nconceptualised\nin two ways. First, a reasonable doubt may arise from within the case mounted\nby the Prosecution. As part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce\nsufficient evidence to establish the accused\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt on at least a prima facie basis. Failure to do so may lead to a finding\n\n35\n36\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James [2013] 3 SLR 221 at [50].\nPublic Prosecutor v GCK and another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 at [149].\n\n\f23\nthat the Prosecution has failed to mount a case to answer, or to an acquittal.\nIn those situations, the court must nevertheless particularise the specific\n\nthe threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n(f)\n\ncase,\n\nnot been able to discharge its overall legal burden.\n\n(g)\n\nThe second way in which a reasonable doubt may arise is on an\n\nassessment of the totality of the evidence. The inquiry here is intimately\n\npreferred over the evidence put forth by the accused person where it is a case\n\n(h)\n\nThe assessment of the\n\nevidence under the\n\nstandard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence,\nwhich logically includes the case mounted by the Defence. The evaluative task\nis not just internal to the\n\ncase, but also comparative in nature.\n\nWhere the evidential burden lies on the Defence and this has not been\ndischarged, the court may find that the Prosecution has discharged its burden\n\n\f24\nof proving its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. At\n\n(i)\n\nWhat the Defence needs to do to bring the\n\ncase below the requisite\n\nthreshold is to point to such evidence as would generate a reasonable doubt. That\nevidence need not necessarily be raised by the Defence; what matters is that a\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n44.\n\nThus, the burden on the Law Society is to adduce sufficient evidence which must\nestablish the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a prima facie basis and that\nthe Respondent has to show at the end of the trial that a reasonable doubt exists on the\nevidence adduced.\n\nDid the acts and/or omissions of the Respondent amount to misconduct unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession?\n\n45.\n\nWith that in mind, we proceed to examine and assess the facts and evidence before us\nin order to arrive at our decision.\n\n46.\n\nThe Proceeded Charges were both made under s 83(2)(h) of the Act. In this regard,\nthe Tribunal is mindful that in the case of The Law Society of Singapore v Harjeet\nSingh [2016] SGDT 9, it was stated that s 83(2)(h) is a catch all provision which can\n\n\f25\nbe invoked when the conduct does not fall within any of the other enumerated grounds\nbut is nevertheless considered unacceptable\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the\n\n37\n\ncontention that there are degrees of negligence\n\nand whether a particular degree of negligence amounts to misconduct must be\ndetermined by viewing the gravity of the negligent act in the context of the matter\nwhilst taking into account all the circumstances of the case. 38 Not all cases of\nnegligence support a finding of due cause.39 Innocent bungling which prejudices the\ngrave\nnature. Several serious lapses would invite disciplinary sanction.\n\n48.\n\nWe would therefore examine the undisputed material, correspondences and other\ndocuments contained in the ABOD read with the ASOF to evaluate if the conduct was\njust mere negligence or whether it was sufficiently grave to amount to misconduct on\nthe part of the Respondent in the discharge of his professional duty.\n\n49.\n\nOn 31 October 2015, the Respondent had requested for documents, information and a\nstudy, then to do legal\nresearch and then draft affidavit. Fighting a case is not like making instant noidle. It\nhas to be carefully thought over and researched. 40\n\n37\n38\n\nRe Lim Kiap Khee; Law Society of Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee [2001] 2 SLR(R) 398 at [19].\nLaw Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar Naidu [2012] 4 SLR 1232 at [79].\n40\nABOD at page 424.\n39\n\n\f26\n50.\n\nOn 1 November 2015, the Complainant responded to the Respondent in an email,\nproviding whatever responses she could to the Respondent.41\n\n51.\n\nOn 2 November 2015, the Respondent emailed the Complainant, raising further\nquestions on the chronology provided in the Compla\n201542 and commented on the insufficiency of the chronology:43\n\nSimply put, the chronology of facts you have given to me has too many\nunexplained holes and lacks sufficient details.

In these emails, she notably stated that she\nwould provide the Respondent the slips and loan agreement between her and one\nSheraz in later emails.\n\n55.\n\nOn 4 November 2015 at 11.53pm, the Complainant forwarded to the Respondent an\nemail she had previously received on 14 May 2015 from the law firm representing\nSheraz, which had forwarded a Supplementary Agreement for her comments.47 In the\n\nfor applying the credit line with bank of China\n\nbe\n\nof help.

At the same time, however, she\n\n45\n\nABOD at page 435.\nSee ABOD at page 436-442.\n47\nABOD at page 444.\n48\nABOD at page 452.\n46\n\n\f28\nenquired about her case. To this query, the Respondent specifically responded that he\nstudying your case\n\n58.\n\n49\n\nUp to this point, we find that all the Complainant was told was that the Respondent\nthat neither the Setting\nAside Application nor the EOT Application was ever made.50 Further, no drafts of\neither the Setting Aside Application or EOT Application were ever shown to have\nbeen prepared during the period he was acting for her.\n\n59.\n\nIt ought to be borne in mind that the Respondent was at all times fully aware that the\ndeadline was 10 November 2015.

We are satisfied that the conduct\nwas grave enough to amount to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n61.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent had, in his submissions, also attempted to characterise the\nRespondent as having [dropped] the ball only on 2 December 2015.51 We disagree.\n\nviewed as a whole. We do not accept that he\n\nthe\n\nonly from 2 December\n\n2015 onwards.

In\nparticular, he told the Complainant not to worry as he could apply for an\nextension of time giving the impression that such an extension would be\ngranted as a matter of course. This amounted to an assurance to the\nComplainant that so long as an application to extend time is made within a\nreasonable period of time, there is no cause to worry. We are unable to accept\nthis as mere negligence. As an experienced lawyer, the Respondent ought to\nknow that an extension of time is granted at the discretion of the Court and\nthat it would depend on the reasons given to convince the Court to exercise the\ndiscretion in favour of the applicant.\n\n(iii)\nserious consequences that would follow if the extension of time was not\ngranted and the Statutory Demand not set aside. Furthermore, there was no\nevidence adduced to show that the Respondent had even initiated a search to\ndetermine if ABKL had taken steps after the expiry of the Statutory Demand\ndeadline to enforce it. There was not even a suggestion or an attempt made to\nwrite to the solicitors acting for ABKL on the matter to state the\ncase or to ask for time to respond.\n\n64.\n\nThe same pattern of conduct continued well after 10 November 2015. On 28\nNovember 2015 (i.e. 18 days after the deadline to set aside the Statutory Demand had\nexpired), the Complainant sent a WhatsApp message to the Respondent as she had not\n\n\f31\nheard from him, to request for updates on her case. There was no response to this\nmessage.53\n\n65.\n\nMorning Gregory, do you\nresponse.54\n\nhave time to talk\n\n66.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Complainant once again messaged the Respondent,\nrequesting an update regarding the Statutory Demand. This time, the Respondent\nFor your setting aside, not yet\".55 The Complainant thereafter\nenquired if there wa\n\nthe setting aside\n\nthis\n\nmessage.56\n\n67.\n\nOn 2 December 2015 at 5.12pm, the Complainant sent an email to the Respondent,\nrequesting a receipt for her fee payment of $7,000.00 and again asked whether there\nwas a deadline for setting aside the Statutory Demand. 57 He responded to this email\non the same day at 5.51pm, stating that he was applying for an extension of time which\nnot be a problem\n\nreceipt\n\nall the court papers which [she would] have to sign at [his] offices\non a date to be fixed\n\n68.\n\nall the court papers 58\n\nWe find that this response gave the impression that the Respondent was ready to\nproceed with the matter and that the relevant court papers would soon be ready for the\n\n53\n\nABOD at page 455.\nABOD at page 455.\n55\nABOD at page 455.\n56\nABOD at page 456.\n57\nABOD at page 461.\n58\nABOD at page 462.\n54\n\n\f32\nComplainant to sign. However, as stated previously, the evidence before the Tribunal\nhas showed that in fact no court papers were prepared nor were they sent to the\nComplainant even though the Respondent had stated he would have them at his office\nfor her to sign on a date to be fixed.\n\n69.\n\nAfter 2 December 2015, there appears to be no further communication between the\nComplainant and the Respondent until 15 January 2016 when the Complainant\nemailed the Respondent requesting him to set aside the Statutory Demand\nimmediately.59\n\n70.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, by an email timestamped 12.50pm, the Complainant terminated\n\nhad her phone line cut off and her bank account suspended because of his negligence.\nShe also noted in the same email that:60\n\nYou have not even had the courtesy to respond to my email of 15 January and\nmy registered letter dated 16th January. I am most disappointed by your\nderelict attitude.\n\n71.\nstated that it was defamatory of the Complainant to accuse him of negligence. He\naccepted the termination of his services and agreed to return the $7,000.00 deposit\npaid to him.61\n\n59\n\nABOD at page 463.\nABOD at page 464.\n61\nABOD at page 466.\n60\n\n\f33\n\n72.\nand unwavering. The Respondent was engaged to set aside the Statutory Demand.\nThis is shown from the\n\ninstructions from the time the Respondent was\n\nfirst appointed to act for her62 and throughout the entire retainer period.63 Both the\nEOT Application and Setting Aside Application are inextricably linked and the\n\nwhole.\n\n73.\n\nWe find that while the Respondent was correct to seek further information from the\nentirely coherent\nthereby contributing to his inability to prepare the Court papers, it would still be the\nRe\nproceed in good time. We find instead that it was in fact the Complainant who was\nmaking regular inquiries on the state of the application with no meaningful response\nreceived from the Respondent. This was conceded by the Respondent. 64 He had\nrepeatedly assured the Complainant that he was in the midst of preparing the necessary\ncourt papers, giving no impression that anything more was needed from the\nComplainant.65 Therefore, on the assumption that the information provided by the\n\nApplication and the EOT Application forthwith on an urgent basis in view of the tight\ntimeline. On the evidence before us, it was clearly shown that he had taken absolutely\nno action right up to the date his engagement was terminated.\n62\n\nASOF at [4].\nASOF [11]64\nABOD at page 379-380.\n65\nABOD at pages 453, 462 and 466.\n63\n\n\f34\n\n74.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Respondent was unaware of the bankruptcy proceedings filed\nagainst the Complainant,66 it is clear that he had not even made an effort to establish\nif a bankruptcy application had been filed after the deadline had passed. This was\nadmitted by Counsel for the Respondent.67 We are of the view that the Respondent\nought to have known that bankruptcy proceedings would be the next step to be taken\nby ABKL (on 15 January 2016 at the latest) if they receive no response from the\nComplainant. An urgent search would reveal the status of the matter at the material\ntime.68\n\n75.\n\nIf negligence is involved, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that there is always\na need to discern and differentiate the various degrees of negligence, taking into\naccount all the facts of the case69 and that the degree of negligence must still be found\nto be sufficiently grave for the purposes of a finding of misconduct under s 83(2)(h)\nof the Act. Otherwise, every negligent act or omission would be tantamount to\nmisconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n76.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Selena Chiong provided helpful guidance of the standard\nrequired for a charge under s 83(2)(h) of the Act:\n\nwe do have some difficulties in relation to the misconduct complained of in\nthe first and second charges, which misconduct smacks more of incompetence,\ndisorganisation or lack of care on the part of Chiong rather than any deliberate\n66\n67\n\nTranscript of the Hearing, page 58 at lines 12-13.\n\nen Submissions at [25].\nABOD at page 466.\n69\nRe Lim Kiap Khee; Law Society of Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee [2001] 2 SLR(R) 398 at [19].\n68\n\n\f35\n\nwould be more appropriate to regard the misconduct set out in the first and\nsecond charges as\n\nunbefitting of an advocate and\n\nwithin\n\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n77.\n\nIn a similar vein, the High Court in Zhou Tong stated that professional incompetence\nand indolence is a cause for concern. It is indeed a fundamental responsibility of the\n\nconscientiously and conscionably.70 We are of the view that the Respondent had failed\nthe test in the present case.\n\n78.\n\nWe also agree with Counsel for the Respondent that unlike the respondent in Selena\nChiong, the Proceeded Charges in our case do not involve any failure to advise the\nComplainant, the failure to appropriately advise the Complainant or misleading the\nComplainant.71 The irresponsibility displayed by the respondent in Selena Chiong\ncase\n\n79.\n\nHowever, this does not\namount to misconduct under the Proceeded Charges. As established in Selena Chiong,\na lack of care and incompetence, despite not being deliberate, can still amount to\nmisconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(h)\n\n70\n71\n\nZhou Tong v Public Prosecutor [2010] 4 SLR 534 at [1].\n\n\f36\nof the Act. In this regard, we find that his failure in acting competently for the\n\nnegligence can be said to be relatively short as he was on retainer from 28 October\n2015 to 18 January 2016, the point to emphasise is that he did fail to file the Setting\n\ninstructions knowing all along the consequences that would follow should he fail to\ndo so on time. For that, we find that the Respondent displayed a total lack of care\n\nof time should not present a problem.72 The Respondent was irresponsible to give the\nimpression to the Complainant that an extension of time would be granted if it was\napplied for within a reasonable time without advising her that it has to be on grounds\nacceptable to the Court.\n\n80.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent had failed to keep the Complainant reasonably informed\nabout her case at least from on or around 6 November 2015 onwards. Notably, the\nRespondent did not provide any updates to the Complainant after he replied to her\nchaser on 10 November 2015 (i.e. the period from 11 November 2015 to 30 November\n2015).73 This was in spite of the fact that there was a real possibility of bankruptcy\nproceedings being commenced as the deadline for the Setting Aside Application was\ndue to expire on 10 November 2015. In our view, this period of silence from the\nRespondent was inexcusably lengthy and puts the Complainant at risk of being made\na bankrupt.\n\n72\n73\n\nABOD at page 462.\nASOF at [11]-[12].\n\n\f37\n\n81.\n\nFor completeness, we note that Counsel for the Law Society appeared to be hinting at\nan element of dishonesty specifically at the Hearing, and untruthfulness in relation to\n\nApplication.74 In response, Counsel for the Respondent pointed out that any\nuntruthfulness\nall the court\npapers\n\n75\n\nSimilarly, he had sent a Whatsapp message\n\nto the Complainant on 4 Dece\n\nwill complete drafting all\n\ncourt papers and call [her] when [he was] ready 76\n\n82.\n\nWe find that an allegation of untruthfulness is a grave accusation against a solicitor.\nHowever, we are unable to make a finding of fact in respect of the\n\nstate\n\nof mind relating to untruthfulness solely by reference to the documents and without\ncross-examination of the Respondent. In any event, we find that it is unnecessary to\nfind untruthfulness against the Respondent for the purposes of the Alternative 2nd\nCharge. The fact is that no such Court papers were produced and we are satisfied that\nthe Respondent had by his own admission no further excuse to allege that he needed\nfurther information in order to draft the court papers.\n\n83.\n\nIn the light of our findings, we are satisfied that the Proceeded Charges (i.e. the\nAlternative 1st Charge and the Alternative 2nd Charge) have been proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt and that the Respondent is guilty as charged.\n\n74\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 77-79 and 103.\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 93-94.\n76\nABOD at page 150.\n75\n\n\f38\n\nAPPROPRIATE SENTENCE\n\n84.\ndetermination under either s 93(1)(b) or (c) of the Act.\n\n85.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent helpfully drew our attention to the decision of the Court\nof Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel [2010]\n3 SLR 390 in which the function of a Disciplinary Tribunal was set out:\n\nsorts, thereby ensuring that only the most serious complaints are referred to\nthe court of three Judges... the Disciplinary Tribunal may find that the conduct\nof the advocate and solicitor concerned does fall within one or more of the\nlimbs of s 83(2).. but feels that the conduct itself, whilst technically within the\nambit of one or more of these limbs\n\nsanction pursuant to s 93(1)(b) of the Act\n\n86.\n\n77\n\nHere, we are of the view that even though we find that the Respondent is guilty as\ncharged, we would agree with Counsel for the Respondent that the present case does\nnot fall within the category of the most serious of complaints.78 Indeed, we accept that\n\nLaw Society.\n\n77\n78\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR 390 at [28] and [39].\n\n\f39\n\n87.\n\nWe have considered the mitigating factors raised by Counsel for the Respondent.

Plainly, in the short period of his retainer, the\nRespondent was negligent and had displayed a lack of professionalism in the way he\n\nexpected of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n88.\n\nWe also note that the\n\nactions had caused the Complainant suffering and\n\ninconvenience as she was adjudged a bankrupt. Bankruptcy is undoubtedly a traumatic\nexperience and the Complainant must have suffered during her period of bankruptcy.\nHowever, to attribute the\n\nlengthy period of suffering (approximately\n\n2.5 years of bankruptcy) solely to the Respondent is unjustifiable. No evidence was\nadduced to explain why it had taken approximately 2.5 years for the bankruptcy order\nto be annulled.79\n\n89.\n\nIn light of all our findings, and pursuant to s 93(1)(b)(i) of the Act, we determine that\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 83 of the Act,\nthe Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000.00, which in our view is\nsufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed\n\n90.\n\nPursuant to s 93(2) of the Act, we award costs of $2,500.00 to be paid by the\nRespondent to the Law Society.\n\n79\n\nTranscript

The charges levied against him in these proceedings arise from\nthose breaches as well as events which are alleged to have occurred after those\nbreaches were discovered.\n\n3.\n\nHaving carefully considered the facts of the case, the evidence of the witnesses and the\nparties’ respective submissions, we find that:\n\n(a)\n\nCause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists:\n\n(i)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, Rev Ed 2009)\n(the “Act”) in respect of the First Charge (as defined below);\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nThe Law Society’s Closing Submissions (“LSCS”) [31].\nThe Respondent’s Closing Submissions (“RCS”) [1].\nRCS [1].\n\n1\n\n\f(ii)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(j) of the Act in respect of the Second Charge (as defined\nbelow); and\n\n(iii)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(h) of the Act in respect of the Alternative First Charge,\nthe Alternative Second Charge and the Third Charge (all as defined below),\nand\n\n(b)\n\nThe Fourth, Alternative Fourth, Fifth and Alternative Fifth Charges (all as defined\nbelow) were not made out.\n\n4.\n\nWe set out our grounds below. We deal first with the Second Charge, which the Law\nSociety described as setting out “the crux of the misconduct of the Respondent”4. We\nthen deal with the First Charge and remaining three charges in numerical order.\n\nThe Second Charge and Alternative Second Charge\n\n5.\n\nThe Second Charge alleges: 5\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of contravening Rule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Admission) Rules 2011, by being the supervising solicitor during the practice\ntraining periods of [Mr Lim] and [Ms Sunil], who were practice trainees serving their\nrespective practice training periods under separate practice training contracts with\nFoxwood LLC, while having in force a practicing certificate of a period of less than 5\nout of the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the commencement of your\nsupervision of Mr Lim and [Ms Sunil] which warrants disciplinary action within the\nmeaning of Section 83(2)(j) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n4\n5\n\nThe Law Society’s Statement of Case (Amendment No. 2) (the “SOC”) page 8.\nSOC page 13.\n\n2\n\n\f6.\n\nThe Law Society also alleged in the alternative that the conduct described in the Second\nCharge amounted to “misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession” within the meaning of\nSection 83(2)(h) of the Act (the “Alternative Second Charge”).6\n\n7.\n\nTo succeed in these charges, the Law Society must establish that (a) Mr Lim and Ms\nSunil were practice trainees serving their respective practice training periods under\nseparate training contracts with Foxwood LLC, (b) the Respondent purported to act as\ntheir supervising solicitor during their respective practice training periods, and (c) the\nRespondent was not qualified to do so by reason of not having a valid practicing\ncertificate for at least five out of the seven years immediately preceding the respective\ncommencement dates of Mr Lim’s and Ms Sunil’s training contracts.\n\n8.\n\nEach of these facts are admitted. The Respondent admits that he acted as Mr Lim’s\nsupervising solicitor “with effect from 16 December 2019” and as Ms Sunil’s supervising\nsolicitor “with effect from 2 January 2020”.7 He also admits that he held a practicing\ncertificate for a total of only two years and 10 months as at 1 October 2019.8\n\n9.\n\nRule 18(1) of the Admission Rules prohibits a solicitor from acting as a supervising\nsolicitor of a practice trainee unless (i) he is in active practice in a Singapore law practice,\nand (ii) has had in force a practicing certificate for a total of “not less than 5 out of the 7\nyears immediately preceding the date of commencement of his supervision of the\npractice trainee”.\n\n6\n7\n8\n\nSOC page 14.\nDefence [10] read with SOC [15].\nDefence [9] read with SOC [14].\n\n3\n\n\f10.\n\nThere is therefore no question that the Respondent has breached Rule 18(1) of the\nAdmission Rules.\n\nThe only question therefore is whether his conduct warrants\n\ndisciplinary action within the meaning of Section 83(2)(j) of the Act for the purposes of\nthe Second Charge and/or amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor\nas an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession for the\npurposes of the Alternative Second Charge.\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent submits that both questions ought to be answered in the negative.9\nWe shall deal with each of his arguments in turn.\n\nAlleged mitigating circumstances\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent points to what he describes as mitigating circumstances. First, he says\nthat he admitted to having acted as supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil “even\nthough an alternative would have been to argue that they had in fact no Supervising\nSolicitor”, and that his admission therefore “resolved this issue in [the Law Society’s]\nfavour, even though the position was ‘grey’, stepping up to shoulder the blame”.10\n\n13.\n\nDuring oral closing arguments, the Respondent’s counsel clarified that the Respondent’s\nargument was simply that he could have argued that there was no supervising solicitor\nin law – i.e. as defined under the Act.11 However, this argument also does not take him\nvery far. The fact there was no supervising solicitor for the purposes of the Act is\nundeniable given that the Respondent did not satisfy the requirements under the Act.\nThe critical fact is that he admits to having acted as Mr Lim’s and Ms Sunil’s supervising\n\nRCS [59].\nRCS [46].\n11 Transcript 7 Dec 2021, 42(9) to 44(6).\n9\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\fsolicitor despite not having satisfied the requirements under the Act. This is the very\nsubstance of the breach before us.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent appeared to us to be seeking credit for admitting that he had acted as\nsupervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil – i.e. for telling the truth. Telling the truth\nis not mitigatory – it is the absolute minimum expected of any advocate and solicitor. To\nclaim that he ought to be given credit for not arguing that Mr Lim and Ms Sunil had no\nsupervising solicitor (an argument that he must know to be false given his pleaded\nadmission) is an appalling submission, and one which we completely reject.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, he argues that the responsibility for ensuring that the practice trainees taken in\nby Foxwood LLC are properly supervised is shared between the Respondent and\nFoxwood LLC’s sole director at that time Mr Goh Keng How (“Mr Goh”).12 He argues\nthat it would therefore be unfair to pin the effect of this “lapse” solely on him.\n\n16.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent appears to suggest that Mr Goh should bear most of the blame\nfor alleged systemic regulatory and compliance failures at Foxwood LLC.13 He argues\nthat Mr Goh was “responsible for regulatory and compliance matters”14 but (i) “did not\nraise any concerns regarding regulatory compliance”15 despite the Respondent having\nkept him in the loop on the hiring of practice trainees, and (ii) “failed to provide any form\nof guidance or policy relating to the employment of trainees”16 by Foxwood LLC.\n\n17.\n\nMr Goh testified on behalf of the Law Society. He admitted that he had not familiarized\nhimself with the Admission Rules and was not aware that the Respondent was not\n\nRCS [47].\nRCS [48].\n14 Ibid.\n15 Ibid.\n16 Ibid.\n12\n13\n\n5\n\n\fqualified to act as supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil. It was also patently\nclear to us from Mr Goh’s testimony that he was not someone who placed a great deal\nof importance on the need to comply strictly with the applicable rules and regulations\ngoverning practice.\n\n18.\n\nHowever, Mr Goh’s conduct is not the subject of these proceedings. Even if Mr Goh’s\nconduct had fallen below the standard expected of advocates and solicitors (on which\nissue we make no finding), it does not mitigate the Respondent’s culpability.\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society correctly highlighted that all solicitors ought to be familiar with the rules\nmade under the Act and will at any rate be deemed to be aware of their existence and\napplicability: Law Society of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena (“Selena Chiong”).17\nIt follows therefore that each advocate and solicitor bears personal responsibility to\nensure that the applicable rules of practice are strictly adhered to in all areas of his\npractice.\n\n20.\n\nIt was incumbent on the Respondent to familiarize himself with the relevant rules\ngoverning his practice as an Advocate and Solicitor. In particular, he ought to have\nfamiliarized himself with the rules governing the supervision of practice trainees before\nhiring Mr Lim and Ms Sunil as practice trainees. He ought, at the very least, to have\nsatisfied himself that he met the statutory requirements for being a supervising solicitor.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent patently failed to do so – he admits he failed to familiarize himself with\nthe relevant rules relating to being a supervising solicitor.18 Indeed, the evidence before\nus suggests that he simply did not care whether there were any rules and, if so, what\n\n17\n\n[2005] 4 SLR(R) 320, referred to at LSCS [48].\n\n18\n\nTranscript 17 Dec 2021, 26(29) to 27(2).\n\n6\n\n\fthey were. He claimed that he assumed that someone in the firm (presumably Mr Goh)\nwould have told him if what he proposed to do contravened any applicable rules. That\nargument does not assist him. The onus was on him to ensure he complied with all\nrelevant rules and regulations governing his practice. His failure to do so is not mitigated\nby any failing on the part of Mr Goh or anyone else in the firm.\n\n22.\n\nThird, he claims that he always believed that “he had a shield” on regulatory issues –\nnamely, that Mr Goh “would take care of regulatory and compliance issues”.19 This is\nessentially the same argument as above and is rejected for the same reasons.\n\n23.\n\nFourth, the Respondent claims that he did “all he could to rectify the mistake and\nalleviate the situation for [Mr Lim]”20 by trying “to find solutions to [Mr Lim’s]\npredicament”21. Mr Lim did not agree that the Respondent had been of much help in\nresolving the predicament he found himself in. However, while we are prepared to\naccept that the Respondent did take some steps to try and help, we do not think these\nsteps have much mitigatory value. Mr Lim eventually secured a training contract with\nanother firm through his own endeavors and not because of anything that the\nRespondent did.\n\n24.\n\nWe therefore find that none of the alleged mitigatory circumstances raised by the\nRespondent are of any assistance to him in diminishing his culpability.\n\n19\n20\n21\n\nRCS [49].\nThe Respondent’s AEIC, at [51].\nThe Respondent’s AEIC, at [54].\n\n7\n\n\fThe Respondent’s state of knowledge\n\n25.\n\nThe Law Society argues that the Respondent was aware from “at least November\n2019”22 that he did not meet the requirements to act as a supervising solicitor for\ntrainees. This is a serious allegation. If true, it would mean the Respondent knew he\ndid not satisfy the requirements under the Act before either Mr Lim or Ms Sunil\ncommenced their training period.\n\nIt would also mean that the Respondent had\n\ndeliberately ignored the provisions of the Admission Rules and then dishonestly alleged\nin these disciplinary proceedings that the breach had been inadvertent.\n\n26.\n\nThe Law Society relies on the evidence of Mr Tan Yong Xian, Selwyn (“Mr Tan”) and Mr\nGiam Zhen Kai (“Mr Giam”). Both Mr Tan and Mr Giam are Advocates and Solicitors.\nMr Tan practiced at Foxwood LLC between September 2019 and April 2020. Mr Giam\npracticed at Nair & Co. LLC with the Respondent from February 2019 before moving\nwith the Respondent to Foxwood LLC in July 2019 and practicing there until November\n2019.\n\n27.\n\nMr Tan’s evidence was that when he learnt that two practice trainees would be joining\nFoxwood LLC’s dispute resolution team in December 2019, he “had some concern that\n[the Respondent] would be the supervising solicitor for these [two] trainees” since he\nwas the only partner who handled litigation and dispute resolution at the firm.23\n\n28.\n\nMr Tan said that these concerns prompted him to check the applicable rules and the\nRespondent’s LinkedIn profile, and that he then concluded that “it was unlikely that [the\nRespondent] would be able to meet the criteria” under the Rules. He said that during a\nbreak in trial proceedings sometime in November 2019, he had highlighted the\n\n22\n23\n\nLSCS [42].\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Tan Yingxian, Selwyn (“Mr Tan’s AEIC”), at [8] and [9].\n\n8\n\n\fapplicable rules to the Respondent and had “asked [the Respondent] directly if he had\nsufficient years of practice with a practicing certificate in force to supervise trainees”. Mr\nTan said that Respondent had replied that “there would be ‘no issue’” and that Mr Goh\nwould be the trainees’ supervising solicitor. 24\n\n29.\n\nMr Giam testified that soon after he joined Nair & Co. LLC in February 2019, he was told\nthat the reason Mr Suresh Nair was his supervising solicitor (and not the Respondent)\neven though he spent “the vast majority of [his] practice training period assisting [the\nRespondent]” was because the Respondent was not qualified to act as supervising\nsolicitor.25\n\n30.\n\nMr Giam said that during the period when the Respondent was considering joining\nvarious other firms, the Respondent had assured him that his practice training “would\nnot be affected as [the Respondent] would be able to assign qualified persons to be [his]\nsupervising solicitor in those firms”.26\n\n31.\n\nMr Giam also said that he had accompanied the Respondent to interview Mr Lim\nsometime in early October 2019, and that he had asked the Respondent shortly after\nthe interview whether the Respondent would be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor. Mr Giam\nsaid the Respondent replied that “he would not be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor and that\none of the other partners of Foxwood LLC would be named as Mr Lim’s supervising\nsolicitor”.27\n\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nMr Tan’s AEIC at [12] to [14].\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Mr Giam Zhen Kai (“Mr Giam’s AEIC”) at [5] and [6].\nMr Giam’s AEIC at [7] and [8].\nMr Giam’s AEIC at [10] to [12].\n\n9\n\n\f32.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the admission of these portions of the evidence of Mr Tan\nand Mr Giam and applied to strike them out on several grounds, namely (i) that these\nconversations had taken him by surprise as they were material facts that ought to have\nbeen, but were not, pleaded; (ii) that the evidence was not relevant, (iii) that he did not\nknow the specific charge(s) to which this evidence relates, and (iv) that the evidence\nwas being raised late in the day.\n\n33.\n\nHaving heard parties, we dismissed these objections and allowed the evidence in. The\nobjection that the conversations were not pleaded was misconceived. The material\nallegation was that the Respondent knew or ought to have known that he was not\nsufficiently qualified. This was pleaded. The conversations referred to by Mr Tan and\nMr Giam formed part of the evidence tendered by the Law Society in support of that\nmaterial allegation. It is trite that evidence need not be pleaded.\n\n34.\n\nThe objection as to the relevance of the evidence is equally unfounded. The issue of\nwhether the Respondent knew he was not qualified is pleaded and in issue. While the\nRespondent admits that he was not qualified, the main plank of his mitigation is that his\nbreach of the relevant regulation had been purely inadvertent – i.e. he had not known\nthat he was not qualified. The conversations, if proved, would go towards undermining\nthat assertion of inadvertence and are therefore plainly relevant.\n\n35.\n\nAs to the objection that the Respondent did not know which charge(s) the evidence\nrelated to, there is no requirement for each piece of evidence to be tagged to a particular\ncharge. In any event, the nature of the conversations make it quite apparent which\ncharge(s) they relate to.\n\n36.\n\nFinally, the evidence was not adduced late in the day.\n\nThe evidence of the\n\nconversations is contained in the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of Mr Tan and Mr Giam,\n10\n\n\fboth of which were exchanged together with the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of all the\nother witnesses.\n\nThe Respondent’s main complaint appears to be that the\n\nconversations should have been raised at the pleading stage. For the reasons stated\nabove, we disagree.\n\n37.\n\nHaving dismissed the Respondent’s objections, we nonetheless granted him leave to\naddress these alleged conversations either by way of a supplementary affidavit of\nevidence-in-chief or via oral testimony. The Respondent chose to do so by way of oral\nevidence. He claimed that his relationship with Mr Tan and Mr Giam had soured towards\nthe end of their time with Foxwood LLC and suggested that this soured relationship\ntainted their evidence against him.\n\n38.\n\nBoth Mr Tan and Mr Giam candidly admitted that their relationship with the Respondent\nhad soured. However, they steadfastly maintained that their evidence, particularly in\nrespect of the respective conversations with the Respondent, was true. We would also\nbe slow to find that two Advocates and Solicitors would lie under oath, especially when\nthey had absolutely nothing to gain from doing so and could face severe repercussions\nif they did so and were found out.\n\n39.\n\nCritically, the Respondent did not deny the conversations with Mr Tan and Mr Giam but\nsaid that he could not recall if they had taken place.28 At the hearing, the Respondent\ndid not directly challenge the evidence of Mr Tan and Mr Giam in respect of these\nrespective conversations. Instead, he sought to undermine their evidence on this issue\nby challenging their evidence on the events that led to these alleged conversations.\nSpecifically, he challenged Mr Tan’s evidence on when and why he had searched the\n\n28\n\nRCS [82].\n\n11\n\n\fRespondent’s LinkedIn profile29 and Mr Giam’s evidence on how he had come to learn\nthat the Respondent was not qualified to act as supervising solicitor.30\n\n40.\n\nWhile we accept that they were some inconsistencies in the evidence of both Mr Tan\nand Mr Giam, we find that these inconsistencies do not detract from their unchallenged\nevidence on their respective conversations with the Respondent. Both Mr Tan and Mr\nGiam were unwavering in their evidence that they had each, on separate occasions, had\nconversations with the Respondent about whether he was qualified to act as a\nsupervising solicitor. Having reviewed all the evidence on this issue, we conclude that\nthe conversations alleged by Mr Tan and Mr Giam did take place.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that the conversations had not registered in his mind even\nif they had taken place.31 He points to certain concessions made by Mr Tan and Mr\nGiam during cross-examination in support of this assertion. Mr Tan agreed that his\nconversation with the Respondent had occurred during an intensive trial and the\nRespondent could have been preoccupied with the trial.32 Mr Giam agreed that his\nconversation with the Respondent was not an extended one and he could not provide\ndetails of the conversation save that it had occurred shortly after the interview with Mr\nLim sometime in October 2019.33\n\n42.\n\nWe are unable to conclude with the necessary degree of certainty that these\nconversations had registered in the Respondent’s mind or that he was otherwise aware,\nprior to 6 January 2020, that he was not qualified to act as a supervising solicitor for\npractice trainees. We highlight several factors in this regard. First, the fact that the\n\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n\nRCS [82(g)] to [82(l)].\nRCS [82(b)] to [82(f)].\nRCS [83].\nTranscript 28 Oct 2021 46(21) to 46(22).\nTranscript 28 Oct 2021 7(5) to 8(18).\n\n12\n\n\fconversations were one-off, coupled with the concessions by Mr Tan and Giam, suggest\nit is possible that the conversations had not in fact registered in the Respondent’s mind.\n\n43.\n\nSecond, there is no other contemporaneous evidence (apart from the conversations)\nthat the Respondent was aware that he was not sufficiently qualified. As stated above,\nthe Respondent’s evidence is that he was not aware of the relevant regulations and had\nnot bothered to check. There is no evidence to suggest that this is untrue.\n\n44.\n\nThird, the Respondent informed Mr Lim that he was not qualified to be his supervising\nsolicitor on or around 14 January 2020, shortly after he says he discovered his lack of\nqualifications on 6 January 2020. If the Respondent had in fact been aware all along\nthat he was not qualified, there is no reason why he should suddenly choose to admit\nthis fact to Mr Lim in January 2020. The fact that he did so is more consistent with him\nonly having discovered this fact shortly before, as he claimed.\n\nIs Section 83(2)(j) of the Act satisfied?\n\n45.\n\nThe Second Charge asserts a breach of Section 83(2)(j) of the Act, which relates to\ncontraventions of the provisions of the Act that warrant disciplinary action.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent contends that his conduct did not cross the threshold to warrant disciplinary\naction.34\n\n46.\n\nWe make two observations. First, while the section refers to provisions of the Act, it\nmust necessarily extend to and encompass contraventions of subsidiary legislation and\nregulations promulgated under the Act.\n\nSecond, a plain reading of the provision\n\nsuggests that some contraventions of provisions of the Act may not warrant disciplinary\n\n34\n\nRCS [59].\n\n13\n\n\faction. It follows that the mere fact that the Respondent may have contravened a\nprovision of the Act does not necessarily mean that his conduct warrants disciplinary\naction.\n\nThis is not controversial and is consistent with the general tenor of the\n\ndisciplinary framework established under the Act.\n\n47.\n\nFor the reasons set out below in our discussion in relation to the Alternative Second\nCharge,35 we find the Respondent’s conduct in breaching Rule (1)(b) of the Admission\nRules to be of sufficient severity to warrant disciplinary action and that the Law Society\nhas therefore made out the Second Charge.\n\nIs Section 83(2)(h) of the Act satisfied?\n\n48.\n\nThe Alternative Second Charge asserts a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of the Act, which\nrelates to conduct that amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession. The\nRespondent contends that his actions do not amount to such misconduct.36\n\n49.\n\nThe standard of unbefitting conduct is met if a solicitor’s conduct is such as would render\nhim unfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession, and the relevant test is\nwhether reasonable people, on hearing what the solicitor had done, would have said\nwithout hesitation that as a solicitor he should not have done it: The Law Society of\nSingapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer (“Ezekiel Peter”).37\n\n35\n36\n37\n\nParagraphs 48 to 52 below.\nRCS [59].\n[2019] 4 SLR 92, [38].\n\n14\n\n\f50.\n\nThe Respondent describes his conduct as “a case of simple negligence”.38 He says he\nmade an honest mistake. During oral closing arguments, the Respondent’s counsel\nexplained that the mistake was “in failing to familiarize himself with the relevant rules\nrelating to … being a supervising solicitor”.39\n\n51.\n\nWe disagree. This was not a case of a mistake or oversight. A mistake would have\nbeen if (for example) the Respondent had incorrectly calculated the number of years he\nhad been in practice and thereby wrongly conclude that he was sufficiently qualified.\nThat was not what happened. The evidence clearly showed that the Respondent did\nnot know what the qualifying requirements were to be a supervising solicitor and did not\nbother to check. In fact, he admitted as much.\n\n52.\n\nWhile the Respondent repeatedly claimed he had acted under a mistaken belief that he\nwas qualified to act as a supervising solicitor, he could not provide an answer when\nasked what the basis of that belief was. Indeed, it would appear from his evidence that\nthe first time he familiarized himself with the relevant rules was sometime on 6 January\n2020 while waiting for a flight back from Perth.40\n\n53.\n\nApplying the test set out in Ezekiel Peter, when asked whether an Advocate and Solicitor\nshould have taken on the role of supervising solicitor for practice trainees without first\nfamiliarizing himself with the applicable rules and ensuring that he was qualified to take\non the role (which is what the Respondent admits happened in this case), we have no\ndoubt that a reasonable person would have said that he should not.\n\n38\n39\n40\n\nRCS [61].\nTranscript 17 Dec 2021 26(30) to 27(2).\nRespondent’s AEIC [36].\n\n15\n\n\f54.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent’s conduct as particularized in the Alternative\nSecond Charge amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an\nofficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession and that the\nLaw Society has made out the Alternative Second Charge.\n\nThe appropriate sanction\n\n55.\n\nThe function of a Disciplinary Tribunal is to act as a filter to determine if there is ‘cause\nof sufficient gravity’ that could, on a finding by the Court of Three Judges, be ascertained\nto constitute ‘due cause’ that merited the imposition of one of the range of sanctions\nprescribed in Section 83(1) of the Act: Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani\nd/o Daniel (“Jasmine Daniel”).41\n\n56.\n\nIt is not for us to determine whether ‘due cause’ has been established in this case – that\ndetermination lies solely within the purview of the Court of Three Judges. Our role is to\ndecide whether ‘cause of sufficient gravity’ has been established, and for that we need\nonly be satisfied that there was a prima facie case on the relevant evidence that ‘due\ncause’ might be present: Jasmine Daniel.42 There are three options open to us pursuant\nto Section 93(1) of the Act:\n\n(a)\n\nDetermine that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists;\n\n(b)\n\nDetermine there while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists,\nthe legal practitioner should be reprimanded or ordered to pay a penalty sufficient\nand appropriate to the misconduct committed; or\n\n41\n\n[2010] 3 SLR 390, at [37].\n\n42\n\nIbid., at [31].\n\n16\n\n\f(c)\n\nDetermine that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists, in which\ncase the Law Society is obliged pursuant to Section 94 of the Act to make an\napplication under Section 98 of the Act to the Court of Three Judges.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent submits that his conduct evinces no cause of sufficient gravity. He\nargues that his conduct was merely a mistake or an oversight. We have explained above\nwhy we disagree.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to and relies on two cases (The Law Society of Singapore\nv Anand K Thiagarajan43 and The Law Society of Singapore v Anand Kumar s/o Toofani\nBeldar)44 which he submits are factually akin to the present case and where the\nrespective Disciplinary Tribunals found there to be no cause of sufficient gravity.\n\n59.\n\nWe do not think these cases take the Respondent very far. Neither of these cases deal\nwith breaches of the Admission Rules. In any event, it is trite that whether cause of\nsufficient gravity is made out in any given case must necessarily turn on the specific\nfacts and circumstances of that case.\n\n60.\n\nTurning to the appropriate sanction, we are acutely conscious of the importance of\nensuring that members of the public have access to quality legal advice. The framework\nfor the training of advocates and solicitors seeks to ensure the quality of persons being\ncalled to Bar by way of the following three-pronged framework:\n\n43\n\n[2009] SGDT 2.\n\n44\n\n[2011] SGDT 12.\n\n17\n\n\f(a)\n\nStringent criteria for those wishing to become a ‘qualified person’ as defined in\nSection 2(1) of the Act, including limiting the number of universities whose law\ndegrees are recognized in Singapore;\n\n(b)\n\nRequiring them to successfully complete the Preparatory Course leading to Part\nB of the Singapore Bar Examinations, as well as Part A of the Singapore Bar\nExaminations for those who obtained their law degree from a recognized foreign\nuniversity; and\n\n(c)\n\nRequiring them to undertake and complete six months of relevant legal training,\nrelevant legal practice or work. The Admission Rules specify that such relevant\nlegal training must be carried out under the supervision of suitably qualified\nperson. This includes a solicitor in active legal practice for “a total of not less than\n5 out of the 7 years immediately preceding the date of commencement of his\nsupervision”.45\n\n61.\n\nThe aim of these requirements is plainly to ensure that anyone granted the privilege of\nadmission to the Bar is equipped with the relevant skills to provide clients with legal\nadvice of the requisite standard. Rule 18(1) of the Admission Rule is therefore an\nimportant pillar in the framework for ensuring the quality of advocates and solicitors\ncalled to the Bar. This in turn helps ensure that the broader public interest of ensuring\nthe quality of legal advice available to clients is met.\n\n62.\n\nViewed in this context, the Respondent’s breach of Rule 18(1) of the Admission Rule is\nnot simply one of “oversight in failing to familiarize himself with the applicable rules”.46\n\n45\n\nRule 18(1) of the Admission Rules.\n\n46\n\nRCS [61].\n\n18\n\n\fThe undisputed facts evince a complete disregard for and disinterest in the rules\ngoverning his suitability to act as supervising solicitor. Not only did he not know the\napplicable rules, he also did not (and could not be bothered to) check. Such conduct\nimperiled the careful framework put in place to ensure the quality of advocates and\nsolicitors admitted to the Bar.\n\n63.\n\nWe therefore find that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists in respect\nof both the Second Charge and the Alternative Second Charge.\n\nThe First Charge and Alternative First Charge\n\n64.\n\nThe First Charge alleges: 47\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching rule 36(2)(a)(ii)\n\nof the Legal Profession\n\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 …, as part of the management of a Singapore\nlaw practice known as Foxwood LLC, by failing to ensure that [Mr Lim] and [Ms\nSunil], who were practice trainees serving their respective practice training periods\nunder separate practice training contracts with Foxwood LLC, were supervised\nduring each of their practice training periods with Foxwood LLC by a supervising\nsolicitor who had in force a practicing certificate for a total of not less than 5 out of 7\nyears immediately preceding the date of the supervision of each of the said practice\ntrainees, which amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor\nwithin the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).”\n\n65.\n\nThe Law Society also alleged in the alternative that the conduct described in the First\nCharge amounted to “misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\n\n47\n\nSOC page 8.\n\n19\n\n\fthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession” within the meaning of\nSection 83(2)(h) of the Act (the “Alternative First Charge”).48\n\n66.\n\nThe Responded raised a preliminary objection to the First Charge and Alternative First\nCharge, arguing that they were unnecessarily duplicative given the Second Charge.49\nHe relied on Section 308(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the “CPC”), which states:\n“Limit of punishment for offence made up of several offences\n308 – (1) Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which\nparts is itself an offence, the person who committed the offence shall not be punished\nwith the punishment of more than one of such offences unless it is expressly\nprovided.\n(2)\n\nWhere –\n(a)\n\nanything is an offence falling within 2 or more separate definitions of\nany law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or\npunished; or\n\n(b)\n\nseveral acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or\nthemselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different\noffence,\n\nThe person who committed the offence shall not be punished with a more severe\npunishment than the court which tries him could award for any one of such offences.”\n\n67.\n\nThe objection is misconceived. A plain reading of Section 308(1) of the CPC clearly\nshows that it does not prevent a person facing multiple charges arising from the same\nset of facts. Rather, it is meant to regulate the punishment that can be meted out to\nsuch an individual. There is therefore nothing improper with the First Charge and\nAlternative First Charge arising from the same facts as the Second Charge.\n\n68.\n\nThe First and Alternative First Charges assert a breach of Rule 36(2)(a)(ii) of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the “PCR”), which states:\n\n48\n49\n\nSOC page 12.\nRCS [7] to [10].\n\n20\n\n\f“Responsibilities to practice trainees in law practice\n36 – (2) The management of a law practice must ensure that all of the following\napply to each practice trainee who serves the practice training period under a\npractice training contract with the law practice:\n(a)\n\n69.\n\nThe practice trainee is supervised by a supervising solicitor who –\n(i)\n\nis in active practice in the law practice; and\n\n(ii)\n\nhas in force a practicing certificate for a total of not less than 5\nout of the 7 years immediately preceding the date the supervision\nof the practice trainee starts.”\n\nRule 36(2)(a) of the PCR imposes an obligation on the management of a law practice in\nrespect of the supervision of practice trainees. It is common ground that this obligation\nwas breached in relation to Mr Lim and Ms Sunil. The only issue therefore is whether\nthe Respondent was part of the management of Foxwood LLC at the material time.\n\n70.\n\nThe Law Society argues that the Respondent was a “de-facto director of Foxwood [LLC]\nor was in any event part of [its] management”.50\n\nIt argues that the fact that the\n\nRespondent had not been formally appointed as a director of Foxwood LLC and had not\nbeen notified as such to the Law Society was irrelevant, and that the substance of the\nRespondent’s role must trump its form.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent argues that he was neither a de facto director of Foxwood LLC nor\notherwise part of its management, but was at all times only a “high-level employee”.51\nWhile he accepts that he effectively ran Foxwood LLC’s dispute resolution department,\nhe claims that Mr Goh retained overall control of the department and the rest of the firm\nand that he did not have “visibility or access to Foxwood [LLC’s] bank accounts,\naccounting information and clients outside of the [dispute resolution department]”.52\n\n50\n51\n52\n\nLSCS [60].\nRCS [19].\nRCS [20].\n\n21\n\n\f72.\n\nMr Goh’s evidence53 was that the Respondent ran the entire dispute resolution practice\nof Foxwood LLC – hiring his own staff, taking on his own clients and running the practice\nas he saw fit. Mr Goh explained that Foxwood LLC would supply back-end support (e.g.\nsoftware, payroll and human resource services) but would be compensated for these\nservices. The Respondent would be “entirely responsibly for the profit, losses and\nsustainability of the dispute resolution practice”.54\n\n73.\n\nMr Goh’s evidence is supported by a Partnership Agreement between Foxwood LLC\nand the Respondent (the “Agreement”).55 While the copy of the Agreement in evidence\nwas undated and unsigned, the Respondent does not dispute that he entered into the\nAgreement with Foxwood LLC. Indeed, the Respondent refers to and relies on some of\nthe terms of the Agreement in support of his argument that he was not part of the\nmanagement of Foxwood LLC56 - an argument we deal with below.57\n\n74.\n\nThe Agreement expressly states that Foxwood LLC and the Respondent had entered\ninto the Agreement “in order to govern their relationship as stakeholders in [Foxwood\nLLC] and the management and the affairs of [Foxwood LLC], in particular, the Dispute\nResolution Division”.58 Clause 2 of the Agreement states as follows:\n\n“2.\n\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION DIVISION\n\n2.1\n\n[The Respondent] shall be responsible for starting, heading and maintaining\nthe Dispute Resolution Division.\n\n53\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Goh Keng Haw (“Goh’s AEIC”), at [14].\n\nIbid..\nExhibit GKH-2 of Goh’s AEIC.\n56 See, for example, [15] and [16] of the Respondent’s AEIC.\n57 See paragraphs __ to __.\n58 Recital C, at page 16 of Goh’s AEIC.\n54\n55\n\n22\n\n\f2.2\n\n[The Respondent] shall have authority to, and be responsible for:\n(a)\n\nAccepting and opening files from new clients and commencing work on\nbehalf of such clients, subject always to satisfactory client due diligence\nand conflicts check;\n\n(b)\n\nSigning off on all correspondences (only with respect to the Dispute\nResolution Division) for and on behalf of [Foxwood LLC]; and\n\n(c)\n\nHiring, employing and terminating [employees of the Dispute Resolution\nDivision].\n\n2.3\n\nIn consideration of the above, [Foxwood LLC] shall pay [the Respondent] a\npartnership fee, to be paid out from the office account … only, as and when\ninstructed by [the Respondent].\n\nThe amount of partnership fee shall be\n\ndetermined solely by [the Respondent].”\n\n75.\n\nClause 3.1 of the Agreement states that the Respondent would pay Foxwood LLC a\nmonthly Administrative Fee of S$1,500 for each fee-earner in the Dispute Resolution\nDivision. Clause 3.2 of the Agreement obliged the Respondent to pay Foxwood LLC a\nrefundable Deposit calculated by multiplying the gross monthly salary of each employee\nof the Dispute Resolution Division by that employee’s notice period in months. In\nconsideration for the payment of the Administrative Fee and the Deposit, Foxwood LLC\nwas required pursuant to Clause 3.4 of the Agreement to provide the Respondent and\nthe Dispute Resolution Division with the following services:\n\n“(a)\n\nCosts and use of the following software:\n(i)\n\nMicrosoft 365;\n\n(ii)\n\nLawnet (two users);\n\n(iii)\n\nE-litigation;\n\n(iv)\n\nWaveapp;\n\n(v)\n\nClio; and\n\n(vi)\n\nNuance Power PDF.\n\n23\n\n\f76.\n\n(b)\n\npay-roll and Human Resource services;\n\n(c)\n\nStationaries, such as name cards, pens and papers;\n\n(d)\n\nClient onboarding and invoicing;\n\n(e)\n\nMarketing efforts through digital and traditional means;\n\n(f)\n\nGeneral administrative work in relation to application for practicing\ncertification, professional indemnity insurance, employee benefit.”\n\nThe picture that emerges is that the Respondent was clearly responsible for the\nmanagement of Foxwood LLC’s dispute resolution department even if he had not been\nformally appointed as a director of the firm. As part of this role, he made the hiring\ndecisions concerning lawyers and trainees for the dispute resolution department.\n\n77.\n\nThis is apparent from the process by which both Mr Lim and Ms Sunil joined Foxwood\nLLC as trainees in the dispute resolution department. Mr Lim’s evidence was that he\nsent his application for a training contract directly to the Respondent and was eventually\ninterviewed by the Respondent and the offer to join the firm as a trainee was made by\nway of a letter on the firm’s letterhead signed by the Respondent as “Head of Dispute\nResolution”.59 Ms Sunil went through the same process as well.60 Both Mr Lim and Ms\nSunil dealt with the Respondent. There is no evidence that Mr Goh or anyone else at\nFoxwood other than the Respondent made the final decision on whether to offer them\ntraining contracts.\n\n78.\n\nWe agree with the Law Society that we must look at the substance and not the form of\nthe Respondent’s role at Foxwood LLC in determining whether he was part of its\nmanagement. Similarly, whether a solicitor is part of a firm’s management for the\n\n59\n60\n\nMr Lim’s AEIC, [9] to [14].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC, [10] to [21].\n\n24\n\n\fpurposes of Rule 36 of the PCR cannot be determined by simply asking whether he held\nthe title of director or partner. One must look at the actual role he performed in the\nrunning of the firm.\n\n79.\n\nIn this case, it is clear to us that the Respondent was part of the firm’s management\ninsofar as he called the shots in the dispute resolution department. As we described\nabove, it was the Respondent who made the decision to offer Mr Lim and Ms Sunil\ntraining contracts with the firm and it was he who put himself forward as their supervising\nsolicitor. It is not the Respondent’s case that Mr Goh or anyone else at Foxwood LLC\nhad made those decisions, and there is certainly no evidence that that was the case.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Agreement does not “give the Respondent control to\nGoh’s exclusion”61 and that the Agreement did not state that Goh had no control over\nthe dispute resolution department. He contends that Mr Goh, as the sole director of\nFoxwood LLC, always had the power to veto any decisions the Respondent made in\nrelation to the dispute resolution department.\n\n81.\n\nThis may have been the case in theory, but the Respondent did not adduce any evidence\nof specific occasions when Mr Goh had done so. All the evidence before us points to\nthe Respondent having been given a free hand to manage the dispute resolution\ndepartment in accordance with the arrangement set out in the Agreement. It bears\nnoting that the Respondent accepts that ensuring that practice trainees are properly\nsupervised is a shared responsibility by the management of the firm, and he admits that\nhe must take responsibility for his part.62\n\n61\n62\n\nRCS [19].\nRCS [47].\n\n25\n\n\f82.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent was part of the management of Foxwood LLC at\nthe material time and that Rule 36(2)(a)(ii) of the PCR was breached as pleaded in the\nFirst Charge and the First Alternative Charge.\n\n83.\n\nWe note that Rule 36 places the responsibility for providing supervised training on the\nmanagement of the law firm. While we have found that the Respondent was part of the\nmanagement of Foxwood LLC, he was certainly not the only person in management. Mr\nGoh, as the sole director of the firm, was certainly part of management as well.\nHowever, neither Mr Goh nor any other individuals are before us and we therefore make\nno comment on their respective roles or potential culpability.\n\nHas Section 83(2)(b) of the Act been satisfied?\n\n84.\n\nSection 83(2)(b) of the Act provides (among other things) that due cause may be shown\nby proof that an advocate and solicitor has been guilty of such a breach of “any usage\nor rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under section 71 or by the\nCouncil under the provisions of [the] Act”63 as amounts to improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor.\n\n85.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the breach (as we explained in dealing with the Second and\nAlternative Second Charges above), we find that the Respondent’s conduct did amount\nto improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor and that the First Charge\nhas therefore been made out.\n\n63\n\nSection 83(2)(b)(i) of the Act.\n\n26\n\n\fHas Section 83(2)h) of the Act been satisfied?\n\n86.\n\nThe Alternative First Charge asserts a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of the Act, which\nrelates to conduct that amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\n87.\n\nApplying the test in Ezekiel Peter, we find that the Respondent’s conduct as set out in\nthe Alternative Second Charge amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\nWe repeat our remarks at paragraphs 48 to 52 above in relation to the Second and\nAlternative Second Charges in this regard.\n\nThe Alternative Second Charge has\n\ntherefore been made out.\n\n88.\n\nThe failure to ensure that Mr Lim and Ms Sunil were supervised during their respective\ntraining contracts by a solicitor who was sufficiently qualified is a serious breach. We\nfind that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists in respect of both the\nFirst and Alternative First Charges.\n\nThe Third Charge\n\n89.\n\nAt the hearing for oral closing submissions on 17 December 2021, Counsel for the Law\nSociety highlighted that the Law Society was considering making amendments to the\nThird Charge. Subsequently, on 31 December 2021, we allowed an amendment to the\nThird Charge pursuant to an agreement between the parties. The amended Third\nCharge alleges: 64\n\n64\n\nLaw Society’s Further Submissions (“LCFS”) [7].\n\n27\n\n\f“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore have behaved in a manner inconsistent with the public interest by being\nthe supervising solicitor during the practice training periods of [Mr Lim] and [Ms\nSunil], who were practice trainees under separate practice training contracts\ncontracts with Foxwood LLC, when you did not have in force a practicing certificate\nof a period of not less than 5 out of the 7 years immediately preceding the date of\nthe commencement of your supervision of Mr Lim and [Ms Sunil] as required under\nRule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 …, which amounts to\nmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court\nor as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the\nLegal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n90.\n\nThe crux of the charge is that advocates and solicitors have “a duty to behave in a\nmanner consistent with the public interest” 65 and the Respondent had breached this\nduty by purporting to act as the supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil when he\nwas not qualified to do so.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to dispute the existence of such a duty. His argument\ninstead is that “the public interest is not engaged every time a lawyer makes a mistake”\n66\n\nand that the conduct complained of in the Third Charge did not amount to a breach of\n\nthat duty.\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent’s arguments in response to this Charge focus on his claim that he had\nnot held himself out to be a supervising solicitor in an advertisement published on the\nLaw Society’s practice training website on 18 November 2019 (the “Advertisement”).67\nWe are prepared to accept the Respondent’s argument on this issue. However, this\nfinding does not assist him.\n\n65\n\nRespondent’s Further Written Submissions (“RFWS”) [3].\n\n66\n\nSOC page 15.\n\n67\n\nRFWS [5] to [15].\n\n28\n\n\f93.\n\nThe Respondent’s focus on addressing the Advertisement appears to arise from the\npleaded particulars to the charge, the majority of which assert that the breach arose\nbecause the Respondent held himself out to be a supervising solicitor in the\nAdvertisement. However, the Respondent has not addressed the body of the charge,\nwhich asserts that he had purported to act as supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms\nSunil while not qualified to do so – something the Respondent admits.\n\n94.\n\nAs we explained above in dealing with the Second Charge and Alternative Second\nCharge, the Respondent’s conduct imperiled the framework put in place to ensure the\nquality of advocates and solicitors admitted to the Bar. Such conduct clearly offends the\npublic interest.\n\n95.\n\nWe therefore find that the Third Charge has also been made out and that cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists in respect of this charge.\n\nThe Fourth Charge and Alternative Fourth Charge\n\n96.\n\nThe Fourth Charge and Alternative Fourth Charge both relate to the Respondent having\nallegedly demanded that Ms Sunil pay a sum of $2,000 pursuant to her practice training\ncontract with Foxwood LLC.\n\n97.\n\nThe Fourth Charge alleges: 68\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(a) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 …, by taking unfair advantage of [Ms Sunil] by\ndemanding that she pay Foxwood LLC the sum of $2,000 when this sum was not\nrecoverable by due process of law, which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an\n\n68\n\nSOC page 17.\n\n29\n\n\fadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n98.\n\nThe Fourth Charge asserts a breach of Rule 8(3)(a) of the PCR, which requires a legal\npractitioner to “not take unfair advantage of any person”. The Law Society alleges that\nthe Respondent took unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by demanding that she pay Foxwood\nLLC a sum of $2,000 that was “not recoverable by due process of law”.\n\n99.\n\nThe Alternative Fourth Charge reads:\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodaong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 by acting in a manner contrary to your position\nas a member of an honourable profession by demanding that [Ms Ann] pay Foxwood\nLLC the sum of $2,000 under the terms of a practice training contract under which\nyou agreed to be [Ms Sunil’s] supervising solicitor during her practice training period\nwhen you knew or ought to have known that you did not meet the requirements to\nbe [Ms Sunil’s] supervising solicitor under rule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Admission) Rules … as of the commencement of your supervision of [Ms Sunil]\nduring her practice training period under the terms of that practice training contract,\nwhich amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning\nof s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n100. The Alternative Fourth Charge asserts a breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR, which\nrequires a legal practitioner to “not act towards any person in a way which is fraudulent,\ndeceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as a member of an\nhonourable profession”. The Law Society alleges that the Respondent acted in a manner\ncontrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession by allegedly\ndemanding that Ms Sunil make the $2,000 payment.\n\n30\n\n\fDid the Respondent demand payment from Ms Sunil?\n\n101. The threshold question therefore is whether the Respondent had in fact demanded that\nMs Sunil pay a sum of $2,000 to Foxwood LLC.\n\n102. Ms Sunil had signed a practice training contract with Foxwood LLC. The terms of this\ncontract were set out in the letter of offer dated 11 October 2019 which the Respondent\nsigned on behalf of Foxwood LLC and which Ms Sunil signed and accepted on 12\nOctober 2019.69 Clause 2 of the contract stated her gross monthly salary as $2,000 and\nClause 3 permitted either party to terminate the contract “with 1 month prior notice in\nwriting”. 70\n\n103. Ms Sunil officially started her employment with Foxwood LLC on 2 January 2020.71 On\n4 January 2020, she decided to leave Foxwood LLC immediately for personal reasons\nthat had nothing to do with the Respondent. 72 She informed the Respondent of this\nover a telephone conversation on 5 January 2020 – the Respondent being overseas at\nthat time. Ms Sunil’s evidence was that during this conversation, the Respondent asked\nif she could serve the entire one-month notice period set out in her training contract. Ms\nSunil said she told the Respondent that she wanted to leave immediately,73 and that the\nRespondent then told her that she would have to pay “1 month’s salary in lieu of notice\nwhich would be $2,000.00 … within seven days of [her] last day at Foxwood LLC. 74\n\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n\nAB 33 & 34.\nAB 33.\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Ms Trinisha Ann Sunil (“Ms Sunil’s AEIC”) [30].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [33].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [35(c)].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [35(e)].\n\n31\n\n\f104. Ms Sunil said that she understood from her conversation with the Respondent that “she\nwould have to pay damages in lieu of notice if [she] could not serve the 1 month notice\nperiod”.75 She explained that while she “had doubts on whether [she] was contractually\nobliged to pay this money”, she believed the Respondent must be right as “he was a\nlawyer, a partner at Foxwood LLC and [her boss]”. 76\n\n105. Later that day, after having discussed the matter with her family, Ms Sunil sent the\nRespondent a WhatsApp message stating that she had “decided that it would be best if\n[she] terminate [her] contract here and pay the full month of salary in lieu of notice”.77\nShe was subsequently informed by one of the secretarial staff at Foxwood LLC that the\namount she had to transfer to Foxwood was $1,793.13,78 which she believed was\nderived by deducting from $2,000 a sum of $86.95 for each of her three workings days\nat Foxwood LLC.79\n\n106. On 9 January 2020, the Respondent sent her a WhatsApp message asking her to\n“please kindly make payment towards [her] notice period to clear up the remaining issue\non [her] employment”.80 She responded to say that would only be able to do so later in\nthe week but would do so with the seven-day period he had mentioned.81 Ms Sunil\neventually paid the sum of $1,793.13 on 11 January 2020.82\n\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [35(f)].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [37].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [39]; AB 48.\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [47].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [48].\nAB 237.\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [52]; AB 50.\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [57].\n\n32\n\n\f107. The Respondent denies having made any demands. He says that given Ms Sunil’s\ndesire to leave immediately, he had merely given her the option of doing so by paying a\nmonth’s salary in lieu of notice83 and she had voluntarily accepted this option. 84\n\n108. It is therefore common ground that the Respondent had informed Ms Sunil that she\nwould have to pay one month’s salary in lieu of notice if she wanted to terminate her\nemployment immediately. Whether this is characterized as a demand or merely the\nprovision of an option is, in our view, irrelevant.\n\nDid the Respondent take unfair advantage of Ms Sunil?\n\n109. The material question insofar as the Fourth Charge is concerned is whether the\nRespondent can be said to have taken unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by requiring her to\npay one month’s salary in lieu of notice to immediately terminate her employment with\nFoxwood LLC.\n\n110. The Respondent denied having taken advantage of Ms Sunil. He repeated his position\nthat all he had done was to offer her the option of immediately terminating her\nemployment with Foxwood LLC by paying one month’s salary in lieu of notice.\n\n111. The Law Society asserts that the Respondent took unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by\n“demanding the sum of $2,000 from her when this sum was not recoverable by due\nprocess of law”.85 During oral closing submissions, Counsel for the Law Society clarified\nthat what was meant by the $2,000 not being “recoverable by due process of law” was\nthat there was no enforceable contract because the fact that none of the lawyers at\n\n83\n84\n85\n\nRCS [94].\nRespondent’s AEIC [31].\nLSCS [103].\n\n33\n\n\fFoxwood LLC were qualified to act as supervising solicitors for practice trainees meant\nthat the training contract could not be performed and was therefore a nullity.86\n\n112. To show that the Respondent had taken unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by demanding\npayment of the $2,000, the Law Society must establish that he knew at the material time\nthat the training contract was void. That in turn would require knowledge that none of\nthe directors of Foxwood LLC were able to act as Ms Sunil’s supervising solicitor. The\nLaw Society argued that it had cleared this threshold.\n\n113. First, the Law Society relied on Selena Chiong for the proposition that each Advocate\nand Solicitor is taken to know of the relevant Rules governing his practice, and argued\nthat the Respondent therefore must be taken to have known that he was not qualified to\nact as Ms Sunil’s supervising solicitor.\n\n114. We accept the principles set out in Selena Chiong – an Advocate and Solicitor cannot\nrely on any alleged ignorance of the relevant regulations to avoid liability. However, we\ndo not think that fundamental principle is directly applicable for the purposes of this\ncharge. For the purposes of showing an unfair advantage, the Law Society must show\nthat the Respondent had actual (as opposed to imputed) knowledge of his lack of\nqualifications to be Ms Sunil supervising solicitor and that the training contract was\ntherefore a nullity.\n\n115. The evidence in this case does not go that far, certainly not enough to make the point\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n86\n\nWe have explained above why we cannot say with\n\nTranscript 17 Dec 2021 19(8) to 20(2).\n\n34\n\n\fsufficient certainty that the Respondent’s conversations with Mr Tan and Mr Giam were\nsufficient to bring this fact to his attention.87\n\n116. Second, the Law Society points out that even if we accept the Respondent’s evidence\nthat he only realized that he was not qualified on 6 January 2020, it would mean that the\nRespondent had the requisite knowledge when he repeated his demand for the $2,000\nin his 9 January 2020 WhatsApp message to Ms Sunil.\n\n117. The Respondent says that the WhatsApp message was merely a reminder and the fact\nthat the training contract “does not hold and therefore there is no basis to … make a\nreminder” was not operative on his mind at that time.88 Based on the totality of the\nevidence, we cannot say with the requisite certainty that the Respondent’s version\ncannot be believed.\n\n118. Third, the Law Society referred to and relied on the case of Law Society of Singapore v\nOng Teck Ghee89 for the principle that “an advocate and solicitor has to be scrupulously\nbeyond reproach in terms of his integrity, honesty and fairness”.90\n\n119. While we accept this statement of principle, we do not see how the case assists the Law\nSociety. The facts of Ong Teck Ghee bear no resemblance to the present case, the\nrespondent in that case having entered into prohibited borrowing transactions by\nentering into loan agreements with his client.\n\n120. We therefore find that the Fourth Charge has not been made out.\n\n87\n88\n89\n90\n\nSee paragraphs __ to __ above.\nTranscript 28 Oct 2021 127(16) to 127(25).\n[2014] SGDT 4.\nLSCS [89].\n\n35\n\n\fDid the Respondent act in a manner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable\nprofession?\n\n121. For the Alternative Fourth Charge, the material question is whether the Respondent had\nacted in a manner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession in\nrequiring Ms Sunil to pay one month’s salary in lieu of notice to immediately terminate\nher employment with Foxwood LLC.\n\n122. For the reasons set out above in relation to the Fourth Charge, we accept the\nRespondent’s explanation that he had merely provided Ms Sunil with an option and had\nnot sought to take advantage of her. We therefore find that the Alternative Fourth\nCharge is also not made out.\n\nThe Fifth Charge and Alternative Fifth Charge\n\n123. The Fifth Charge and Alternative Fifth Charge stems from the allegation that the\nRespondent represented to Mr Lim that he would qualify to serve as Mr Lim’s supervising\nsolicitor by May 2020 (the “Alleged Representation”). Both charges assert that the\nmaking of the Alleged Representation amounted to a breach of the requirement under\nRule 8(3)(b) of the Rules that a legal practitioner “not act towards any person in a way\nwhich is fraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as\na member of an honourable profession”.\n\n124. The Fifth Charge states: 91\n\n91\n\nSOC page 21.\n\n36\n\n\f“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodaong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 …, by acting in a manner which is deceitful by\nrepresenting to [Mr Lim], a practice trainee of Foxwood LLC, that by May 2020 you\nwould meet the requirements under Rule 18(1) of the Legal Profession (Admissions)\nRules 2011 … to be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor during his practice training period\nwhen you knew this to be false, which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n125. The Fifth Charge therefore asserts that by making the Alleged Representation, the\nRespondent had breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the Rules by acting in a manner that was\ndeceitful, and that this breach amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\n126. The Alternative Fifth Charge states: 92\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodaong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 … by acting towards [Mr Lim], a practice trainee\nof Foxwood LLC, in a manner which is contrary to your position as a member of an\nhonourable profession by representing to Mr Lim that by May 2020 you would meet\nthe requirements under Rule 18(1) of the Legal Profession (Admissions) Rules 2011\n… to be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor during his practice training period when you\nknew this to be false, which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n127. The Alternative Fifth Charge therefore asserts that by making the Alleged\nRepresentation, the Respondent had breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the Rules by acting in a\nmanner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession, and that this\n\n92\n\nSOC page 25.\n\n37\n\n\fbreach amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the\nSupreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\nDid the Respondent make the Alleged Representation?\n\n128. The threshold question therefore is whether the Respondent had in fact made the\nAlleged Representation.\n\n129. Mr Lim’s evidence on this issue was as follows:93\n“[The Respondent] told me that he would meet the requirements to be a supervising\nsolicitor by May 2020. [The Respondent] mentioned in passing that he would have\nto ‘check’, but it was unclear what exactly he felt needed to ‘check’. He never said\nthat he would have to check to see if he would qualify by May 2020. I recall with\ncertainty that he did inform me that he would qualify by May 2020. The impression\nthat [the Respondent] gave me was that he would qualify in May 2020 even though\nhe may have been uncertain as to the actual date of qualification.”\n\n130. This evidence is consistent with what Mr Lim had stated on two earlier occasions. The\nfirst was in an email dated 16 January 2020 to Professor Eleanor Wong from the NUS\nLaw Faculty, where Mr Lim stated that the Respondent had told him on 14 January 2020\nthat “he will qualify as a supervising solicitor in May 2020”.94\n\n131. The second occasion was in an affidavit dated 4 August 2020 that Mr Lim had deposed\nin support of his application to abridge time for the filing of documents for admission to\nthe Bar, where he stated that “[the Respondent] further informed [him] that he would only\nqualify as an supervising solicitor in May 2020.” 95\n\n93\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Mr Lim Teng Jie (“Mr Lim’s AEIC”) [37(a)].\n\n94\n\nAB 249.\n\n95\n\nAB 88, at [9].\n\n38\n\n\f132. The Respondent’s evidence is that after he discovered that he was not qualified to act\nas Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor, he had informed Mr Lim of this fact and had given him\nthe following options for moving forward. One of those options was to continue with\nFoxwood LLC as a paralegal until May 2020, commence practice training with Foxwood\nLLC in May 2020 and be called in November 2020. His evidence in this regard was as\nfollows:96\n\n“[One option was to] offer Mr Lim the position of a paralegal and if I was to qualify as\na supervising solicitor in May 2020, to commence practice training with Foxwood\nLLC and to be called to the [Bar] 6 months thereafter. I informed Mr Lim that I would\nneed to check with the Law Society and SILE on whether I would qualify as a\nsupervising solicitor in May 2020. That is because I did not have the exact dates for\nwhich I was holding a practicing certificate and intended to check on those matters,\nif this was proposal was to be advanced. I recall that I had also mentioned June or\nJuly 2020 depending on how the SILE/Law Society would respond to me.\nAs I did not want Mr Lim to suffer financially from the mistake, I also mentioned that\nif Mr Lim went with this proposal and proceed to become a paralegal, I would ensure\nthat he would not be financially worse off compared with his peers in major firms by\npaying him the big firm rate, which I understood to be $5,600 per month.”\n\n133. In short, the Respondent admits having mentioned being qualified in May 2020 but says\nhe qualified that by saying he would have to check with the Law Society and SILE.\n\n134. Mr Lim struck us as an earnest and truthful witness, and we have no doubt that Mr Lim\ngenuinely believed that the Respondent had made the Alleged Representation to him\non 14 January 2020. His contemporaneous email to Professor Wong supports his\nevidence to the Tribunal and we see no reason why he would say that the Respondent\nhad made the Alleged Representation if he did not believe it had been made. The only\n\n96\n\nRespondent’s AEIC [38(d)] and [38(e)].\n\n39\n\n\fquestion therefore is whether the Respondent had qualified the Alleged Representation\nas he claims to have done.\n\n135. On this issue, we note that Mr Lim accepts that the Respondent had mentioned that he\nwould have to ‘check’ and says that it was unclear exactly what the Respondent felt\nneeded to be checked. The Respondent maintains that he meant that he would have to\ncheck with the Law Society and SILE. It is therefore quite possible on the evidence\nbefore us that there had been a degree of miscommunication or misunderstanding\nbetween Mr Lim and the Respondent as to whether the Respondent had given an\nunqualified representation that he would be qualified to act as supervising solicitor from\nMay 2020.\n\n136. In the circumstances, we are unable to conclude with sufficient certainty that the\nRespondent had in fact made the Alleged Representation. We therefore find that the\nFifth Charge and the Alternative Fifth Charge are not made out.\n\nConclusion\n\n137.

At the start of the hearing before us,\nthe iteration of the charges facing the Respondent was set out in the Law Society's\nStatement of Case (Amendment No. 1).\n\nThe Respondent pleaded guilty to the\n\nfollowing part of the Fifth Charge and to the whole of the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth\nCharges:\n\n\"Fifth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 3 April 2018, at about 8pm, at the office of\nSamuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore, have\nconducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or practice as\nan advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Act by\nbreaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (being\na rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section 71 of\nthe Act), in that you:\n\n(ij\n\n(ii)\n\nThreatened to take a knife to kill Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel.\n\nSixth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 17 April 2018, at about 5:54pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\n2\n\nSOC, at [21].\n\n2\n\n\f.'\n\nhava conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of.conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you used criminal force against one Ms Kang Pei Shan\nRachel by using your finger to jab her forehead, and by pushing the files that Ms\nKang Pei Shan Rachel was holding against her chest.\n\nSeventh Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 17 April 2018, at about 5:54pm, atthe office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n'71 of the Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nVoluntarily causing hurt to one Ms Kong Shing Ying Brenda by grabbing her\narms, pushing her against a table, repeatedly slapping her, jabbing your\nfinger at Ms Kong's forehead and pushing Ms Kong with your shoulder such\nthat she lost balance and fell backwards; and/or\n\n(iO\n\nVerbally abused Ms Kong Shin Ying Brenda by aggressively berating her\nand screaming at her.\n\nEighth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 17 April 2018, at about 5:58pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nUsed criminal force against one Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene by pushing her\nwith such force that she fell to the floor; and/or\n\n3\n\n\f.\n\n'\n\n(ii)\n\nVerbally abused Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene by aggressively berating her and\nscreaming at her.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent initially contested the First to Fourth Charges and the remaining part\nof the Fifth Charge, as well as the alternatives to each of these charges.\n\nWe\n\nproceeded to hear evidence from witness for both the Law Society and the\nRespondent in two tranches, from 14 to 16 August 2019 and on 26 and 27 September\n2019. We then directed parties to submit their respective closing submissions by 25\nOctober 2019, and scheduled a hearing for oral closing submissions on 19 November\n2019. 3\n\n8.\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the Law Society sought leave to further amend their Statement\nof Case, and informed us that the Respondent was prepared to plead guilty to the\nremainder of the charges as set out in the proposed amendments. 4 The Respondent\n5\n\nconfirmed this, and we allowed the proposed amendments. 6\n\n9.\n\nAt the hearing on 19 November 2019, the Law Society sought, and was granted, leave\nto file a further amended Statement of Case incorporating one minor amendment. The\nRespondent subsequently pleaded guilty to the First to Four Charges and the\nremainder of the Fifth Charge (and their alternatives) as set out in the Statement of\nCase (Amendment No. 3). These Charges read:\n\n\"First Charge\n\n3\n\n4\n\nThe Tribunal's directions made at the end of the hearing on 26 September 2019.\nLetter dated 1 November 2019 from The Law Society's solicitors Allen & Gledhill LLP to the\nSecretariat.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nEmail dated 1 November 2019 from the Respondent's solicitors Eugene Thuraisingam LLP to the\nSecretariat.\nThe Tribunal's directions dated 4 November 2019.\n4\n\n\f,\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 16 March 2018, at or about 7pm, at the\noffice of Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01,\nSingapore, have conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper\nconduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section\n- 83{2)(b) of the Act by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules {being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council\nunder Section 71 of/he Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nConducted yourself in an intemperate and/or boorish manner towards one\nMs Kang Pei Shan Rachel by throwing files and boxes on the floor in her\ngeneral direction, and/or by screaming at her; and/or\n\n(ii)\n\nVerbally abused Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by screaming at her.\n\nSecond Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 26 March 2018, sometime in the afternoon,\nat the office of Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01,\nSingapore, have conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper\nconduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section\n83(2)(b) of the Act by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules {being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council\nunder Section 71 of the Act), in that you conducted yourself in an intemperate\nand/or boorish manner towards one Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by throwing a metal\nstapler on the floor in her general direction.\n\nThird Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 28 March 2018, at about 3pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2){b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3){b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you conducted yourself in an intemperate and/or boorish\nmanner towards one Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by throwing a metal stapler on the\nfloor in her general direction.\n\n5\n\n.\n\n\f..\n\nFourth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 28 March 2018, at about 9pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nA_ct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you:\n\n(ij\n\nConducted yourself in an intemperate and/or boorish manner towards one\nMs Kang Pei Shan Rachel by advancing towards her in an aggressive\nand/or threatening manner such that she stumbled and fell to the floor,\nand/or by shouting at her; and/or\n\n(iij\n\nVerbally abused Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by shouting at her.\n\nFifth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 3 April 2018, at about 8pm, at the office of\nSamuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore, have\nconducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or practice as\nan advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Act by\nbreaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (being\na rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section 71 of\n\nthe Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nConducted yourself in an intemperate and/or ~?orish manner towards one\nMs Kang Pei Shan Rachel by repeatedly throwing your wallet in her\ngeneral direction; and/or\n\n(ii)\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent therefore admitted the facts as set out in the Statement of Case\n(Amendment No. 3) and pleaded guilty to all of the Charges and Alternative Charges\n\n6\n\n\f..\nproffered against him. The Respondent's admissions mean that it is common ground\nbetween the parties that the Respondent's conduct as described in: 7\n\n(a)\n\nThe Charges amounted to improper conduct under Section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Act;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nThe Alternative Charges amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor under Section 83(2)(h) of the Act.\n\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\n11.\n\nThe function of a Disciplinary Tribunal is to act as a filter in order to determine whether\nor not there is 'cause of sufficient gravity' that could, on a finding by the Court of Three\nJudges, be ascertained to constitute 'due cause' that merited the imposition of one of\nthe range of sanctions prescribed in Section 83(1) of the Act: Law Society of\nSingapore v Jasmine Gowrimani dlo Daniel (\"Jasmine Danief'). 8\n\n12.\n\nIt is not for us to determine whether or not 'due cause' has been established in this\ncase - that determination lies solely within the purview of the Court of Three Judges.\nOur role is to decide whether 'cause of sufficient gravity' has been established, and for\nthat we need only be satisfied that there was a prima facie case on the relevant\nevidence that 'due cause' might be present: Jasmine Danie/. 9 If we conclude that\n'cause of sufficient gravity' has been established, the Law Society is obliged pursuant\nto Se.ction 94 of the Act to make an application under Section 98 of the Act to the\nCourt of Three Judges.\n\n7\n\nSee also the Agreed Statement of Facts (Amendment No. 1).\n\n8\n\n[201 OJ 3 SLR 390, at [37].\n\n9\n\nIbid., at [31 ].\n\n7\n\n\f13.\n\nWe are also mindful that the fact that it is common ground that while the Respondent's\nconduct fell within the ambit of limbs (b) and (h) of Section 83(2), this does not\nnecessarily mean that 'cause of sufficient gravity' had been established: Jasmine\nDanie!. 10\n\n14.\n\nWe turn to consider the parties' respective submissions in light of these principles.\n\nTHE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE CASES\n\n15.\n\nThe options available to us at the close of proceedings are set out in Section 93(1) of\nthe Act:\n\n\"93 (1)\n\nAfter hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary\n\nTribunal shall record its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to\nthose facts shall determine that -\n\n(a)\n\nno cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83_ or 83A (as the case may be);\n\n(b)\n\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83 or 83A (as the case may be), the regulated legal\npractitioner should be -\n\n(i)\n\nordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to\nthe misconduct committed;\n\n(ii)\n\nreprimanded;\n\n(iii)\n\nordered to comply with one or more remedial measures; or\n\n(iv)\n\nsubjected to the measure in sub-paragraph (iiij in addition to\nthe measure in sub-paragraph (ij or (iij; or\n\n10\n\nIbid., at [39].\n\n8\n\n\f(c)\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section\n83 or 83A (as the case may be).\"\n\n16.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action, within\nthe meaning of section 93(1)(c) of the Act, had been shown to exist. Its grounds on\nwhich it bases its case can broadly be summarized as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n11\n\nThe nature of the Respondent's conduct is sufficiently serious by itself to amount\nto a prima facie case of \"due cause\" under Section 83 of the Act;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent was in a position of authority vis-a-vis the victims, who were his\nemployees;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent's conduct was part of a pattern of intemperate, boorish and\nbelligerent conduct, and were not isolated incidents; and\n\n(d)\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent has not shown genuine remorse for his actions.\n\nThe Respondent argued that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\nexisted, but that the circumstances nonetheless warranted him bein·g ordered to pay a\nfine of S$20,000. He described such a fine as the \"most proportionate sanction in this\ncase\", 12 claiming in mitigation that:\n\n(a)\n\n\"little if any harm was caused\" to the individual victims in this case;\n\n11\n\nThe Law Society's Skeletal Submissions on Sanction (the \"LSS' Submissions\"), at [42].\n\n12\n\nThe Respondent's Submissions on Sentence (the \"Respondent's Submissions\"), at [8].\n9\n\n\f18.\n\n(b)\n\nhe was suffering from \"Adjustment Disorder\" at the relevant time;\n\n(c)\n\nhe is \"deeply and genuinely remorseful for his behavior'; and\n\n(d)\n\nhis conduct had caused little harm to the integrity of the legal profession.\n\nThe Law Society's arguments referred to in paragraphs 16(a) to (c) above and the\nRespondent's argument referred to in paragraph 17(a) above all broadly relate to the\nseverity of the Respondent conduct. We shall therefore deal with this issue first.\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS\n\n(a)\n\nThe severity of the Respondent's conduct\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society highlighted several facts which they claimed underscored the severity\nof the Respondent's conduct. First, the Seventh and Eighth Charges relate to overt\nacts of physical violence inflicted by the Respondent on Ms Kong Shin Ying Brenda\n\n(\"Ms Kong\") and Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene (\"Ms Tan\"). 13\n\n20.\n\nWhile Ms Tan did not seek medical treatment after the incident, Ms Kong did do so\nand was assessed by the examining doctor at Parkway .East Hospital to have\nsustained \"multiple soft tissue injuries as a result of the assaulf'.\n\nThe examining\n\ndoctor also noted tenderness, bruising and abrasions on various parts of Ms Kong's\nhead and body. 14\n\n13\n\nThe Respondent's Submissions on Sentence (\"Respondent's Submissions\"), at [8].\n\n14\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [47].\n\n10\n\n\f, ,\n\n21.\n\nSecond, it is plain from the video recording of the incident that the Respondent was\nmuch larger than both Ms Kong and Ms Tan, and was clearly the aggressor in both\naltercations. 15\n\nIt is also clear from the video that the Respondent would have\n\ncontinued attacking Ms Kong and Ms Tan, and most likely have inflicted more severe\ninjuries on both of them, if not for the fact that he had been physically restrained by\nother employees and thereby prevented from doing so.\n\n22.\n\n16\n\nThird, the attacks had been triggered by a fairly trivial matter - namely, that the\nRespondent had to meet a client with an associate from the firm but that associate was\napparently not in the office at that time. It had nothing to do with any act or omission\non the part of either Ms Kong or Ms Tan.\n\n23.\n\n17\n\nFourth, the Sixth Charge relates to physically aggressive conduct by the Respondent\nagainst Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel (\"Ms Kang\"). The Respondent has been charged\nwith an offence of using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code for using\nhis finger to jab Ms Kang's forehead knowing that such action would illegally cause\nannoyance to Ms Kang. 18\n\n24.\n\nFifth, the First to Fifth Charges relate to intemperate and/or boorish conduct by the\nRespondent directed towards Ms Kang on five separate occasions. These incidents\ninvolved (i) throwing files, boxes, a metal stapler and his wallet in Ms Kang's general\n\ndirection, (ii) shouting at, and advancing towards, Ms Kang in an aggressive and/or\nthreatening manner, and (iii) threatening to take a knife to kill Ms Kang.\n\n15\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [50].\n\n16\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [59(a)].\n\n17\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [51].\n\n18\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [62].\n\n19\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [66].\n11\n\n19\n\n\f25.\n\nSixth, the Respondent was charged under Section 3(1 )(a) of the Protection from\nHarassment Act with using threatening words against Ms Kang with intent to cause\ndistress. This was in relation to the Respondent's threat to take a knife to kill Ms Kang,\nwhich also forms part of the Fifth Charge.\n\n26.\n\nThe Law Society referred to and relied on the decision of the Court of Three Judges in\nLaw Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee (\"Wong Sin Yee\"). 20 That case involved an\n\nincident of what is commonly termed 'road rage'. and the respondent advocate and\nsolicitor in that case was charged and convicted in the State Courts under the then\nSection 323 of the Penal Code for having voluntarily caused hurt to a member of the\npublic, as well as under Section 13A(1 )(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order\n· and Nuisance) Amended Act for uttering insulting words to a member of the public.\n\n27.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in that case found that the respondent advocate and\nsolicitor's behavior \"constitute[d] a defect of character and render[ed] him unfit to be an\nadvocate and solicitor'. and that his conduct fell within the ambit of Section 83(2)(a) of\n\nthe Act. 21 He was consequently suspended from practice for two years.\n\n28.\n\nThe Law Society relied on the decision in Wong Sin Yee to support its contention that\nthe Respondent's acts of physical violence and verbal abuse towards the various\nindividuals were sufficient to constitute 'cause of sufficient gravity'. The Law Society\nsubmits that, as was the case with the respondent advocate and solicitor in Wong Sin\nYee, the Respondent here had also demonstrated a serious lack of self-restraint. 22\n\n20\n\n[2003] 3 SLR(R) 209.\n\n21\n\nIbid., at [15].\n\n22\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [57].\n12\n\n\f, ,\n\n29.\n\nThe Law Society also submitted that the Respondent's conduct had not been borne\nout of mere frustration with Ms Kang's work performance.\n\nThey argued that the\n\nseverity and persistence of the Respondent's physical aggression towards Ms Kang\n(by throwing objects in her general direction and advancing towards her in an\naggressive and threatening manner) was evidence of something more, and in fact\namounted to bullying. 23\n\n30.\n\nThey also argued that the severity of the Respondent's scolding of Ms Kang (in terms\nof volume, frequency and vituperation) was out of proportion to any perceived\nshortcomings in her work performance, and that there were in any event more\nappropriate options for dealing with any such shortcomings. 24\n\n31.\n\nThese facts are not disputed. Taken as a whole, we agree with the Law Society that\nthey paint a clear picture of physical and verbal abuse by the Respondent.\n\n32.\n\nIt is common ground that as their superior at work, the Respondent was in a position of\nauthority vis-a-vis each of Ms Kang, Ms Kong and Ms Tan.\n\nThe Respondent's\n\nphysically and verbally abusive conduct towards these individuals was therefore an\nabuse of his position of authority over them.\n\n33.\n\nWe also note that the conduct set out in the Charges (which Respondent admitted) did\nnot involve \"isolated incidents or momentary lapses\".\n\nInstead, as the Law Society\n\nargues, they appear to be indicative of a pattern of intemperate, boorish and\nbelligerent conduct on the Respondent's part. 25\n\n23\n\nLSS's Submissions, at [72(a)].\n\n24\n\nLSS's Submissions, at [72(b)].\n\n25\n\nLSS's Submissions, at [75].\n\n13\n\n\f' '\n\n34.\n\nWhen all these facts are considered together, the picture that appears is one that\nshows the Respondent physically and verbally abusing his subordinates in a manner\nthat was not 'one-off' of the resulted of momentary lapses.\n\nOn any analysis, such\n\nmisconduct cannot be described as anything other than serious.\n\n35.\n\nThe seriousness of the Respondent's misconduct and the fact that it contravened both\nSection 83(2)(b) and 83(2)(h) of the Act would in our view suffice to constitute cause of\nsufficient gravity within the meaning of Section 93(1 )(c) of the Act in the absence of\nany valid mitigating factors. We therefore turn next to consider whether there are any\nsuch mitigating factors.\n\n(b)\n\nHarm caused. and impact on. the victims\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent argues there was little, if any, harm caused to Ms Kang, Ms Kong\nand Ms Tan. He points to the fact that Ms Tan did not suffer any injuries as a result of\nthe Respondent's conduct described in the Eighth Charge (which is the only Charge\nthat relates to her).\n\n37.\n\nHe also relies on two statements from Ms Kang and Ms Kong dated 28 May 2019 26\nand 26 June 2019\n\n27\n\nrespectively (collectively, the \"Statements\").\n\nIn Ms Kang's\n\nstatement, she states that she \"did not suffer any injuries as a result of [the\nRespondent's] actions on 17 April 2018\". 28\n\n38.\n\nSimilarly, Ms Kong states that \"although the incident may have appeared violent, [she]\nonly suffered minor injuries such as a scratch and bruise\". She describes the incident\n\n26\n\nThe Respondent's Bundle of Documents \"RBOD\") Tab 1.\n\n27\n\nRBOD Tab 2.\n\n28\n\nRBODTab1.\n\n14\n\n\f'I\n\nas \"no more than a noisy and dramatic altercation caused by loud shrieking and some\nshoving\". 29 The Respondent also relies on the fact that both Ms Kang and Ms Kong\n\"have wholeheartedly chosen to forgive the Respondent and continue to affirm him\". 30\n\n39.\n\nThe Law Society objected to these Statements, arguing that they are inadmissible\nbecause the Law Society did not have the opportunity of cross-examining the makers\nof the Statements as they were only tendered as part of the Respondent's closing\narguments. The Law Society also argued that even if admissible, the Statements are\nirrelevant to the question of whether or not sufficient cause of gravity exists.\n\n40.\n\nHaving considered the parties' arguments and authorities on this issue, we find that\nthe Respondent is entitled to tender and refer to the Statements. However, having\nconsidered the contents of the Statements, we find that they are of not much\nassistance to the Respondent in mitigating the seriousness of his conduct.\n\n41.\n\nTaken at face value, the Statements simply set out the purported impact of the\nRespondent's conduct on Ms Kang and Ms Kong, and that they have both forgiven the\nRespondent. Two factors are relevant when considering these Statements. First, both\nMs Kong and Ms Kang may well have been motivated to speak out in support of the\nRespondent in these proceedings because the former is his niece and the latter\nremains an employee of his company.\n\n42.\n\nSecond, the video of the 17 April 2018 incident clearly shows that the Respondent had\nto be physically restrained from further attacking Ms Kong and Ms Tan. Had he not\nbeen so restrained, he would very likely have inflected more serious injuries on them.\nThe fact that Ms Kong's injuries were relatively minor was likely purely fortuitous.\n\n29\n\nRBOD Tab 2.\n\n30\n\nRespondent's Submissions, at [12].\n\n15\n\n\f' '\n\n43.\n\nThe relevance of the Statements is therefore (at best) minimal when considered in the\ncontext of these factors.\n\n(c)\n\n'Adiustment Disorder'\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent argues that he has been \"diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder at the\ntime of the offences\" and that this \"contributed to the commission of the offences\". 31\nHe relies in this regard on two medical reports dated 21 August 2019 32 and 13\nSeptember 2019 33 (the \"Medical Reports\") from Dr Tan Chue Tin, a clinical\npsychotherapist.\n\n45.\n\nDr Tan states in his first report that the Respondent \"suffered from Adjustment\n,--a-.-, ·-\n\nDisorder at the time of the altercation recorded in the audio-video clips of April 2018 I\n2019\". 34 He expands on this in his second report, saying that the Adjustment Disorder\n\"contributed to the commission of the offences as depicted'' in the video of the 17 April\n2018 incident. 35\n\n46.\n\nThe Law Society also objected to these Medical Reports on the same grounds as the\n-\n\nStatements. As with the Statements, we find that while the Respondent is entitled to\ntender and refer to them as part of his mitigation, they do not assist him very much.\n\n47.\n\nWe note that Dr Tan first saw· the Respondent only _in May 2019, more than a year\nafter the incidents that formed the subject of the charges. Yet the Medical Reports do\n\n31\n\nRespondent's Submissions, at [14].\n\n32\n\nRBOD Tab 3.\n\n33\n\nRBOD Tab 4.\n\n34\n\nRBOD Tab 3, at page 10.\n\n35\n\nRBOD Tab 4, at [3].\n\n16\n\n\fnot contain any explanation as to how Dr Tan was able to ascertain that the\nRespondent suffered from Adjustment Disorder at the time of the incidents.\n\nMore\n\nimportantly, Dr Tan does not explain exactly what Adjustment Disorder is and how it\npurportedly contributed to the Respondent's behavior during the incidents.\n\nWe\n\ntherefore found the Medical Reports to be of very little assistance.\n\n(d)\n\nRemorse\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent claimed that he was \"deeply and genuinely remorsefuf' for his\nbehavior. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated:\n\n\"Lastly, I acknowledge and take full responsibility for my inability to manage my\nanger. I am also, by nature, a flamboyant and animated person. When I lose my\ntemper, I often scream and shout and throw things about. However, I wish to state\nthat despite my anger management problem, I have never intended to hurt anyone.\n\nI regret and unreservedly apologise for my actions.\n\nI am undergoing medical\n\ntreatment to ensure that this does not happen again.\" [Respondent's emphasis]\n\n49.\n\nThe Law Society. contends that the Respondent has not shown genuine remorse for\nhis actions, arguing that this is clear from his contemporaneous conduct. They point in\nparticular to the following:\n\n(a)\n\nWhen first confronted with the complaints, the Respondent did not admit any\nwrongdoing but instead claimed that Ms Kang had been manipulated by one Mr\nRobert Raj Joseph and Mr Lew Shaun Marc.\n\nThe Respondent's letter of 2\n\nOctober 2018 to the Inquiry Committee36 sought to downplay the physical\naltercation with Ms Kong on 17 April 2018 and sought to justify his conduct by\nalleging that she had hit him first.\n36\n\nLaw Society's Supplemental Bundle of Documents (\"LS Supp BOD\") Tab 7, at [88] to [99].\n17\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn an interview with the Today newspaper published on 17 May 2018, 37 the\nRespondent sought to downplay the incident which forms the subject of the\nSeventh Charge, claiming that Ms Kong had \"shoved him first and he had then\nslapped her for being rude\". He described the incident as a \"typical family type\nof fighf' (Ms Kang being the Respondent's niece).\n\n(c)\n\nIn that same interview, he claimed that he had not shoved Ms Tan to the ground\nbut had rather \"accidentally knocked her to the ground when he turned around'.\nThis is materially different from the facts set out in the Eighth Charge, which the\nRespondent now admits. The Respondent admitted to the quotes attributed to\nhim in this interview.\n\n(d)\n\nIn an interview with 8 Days magazine published on 31 May 2018, the\nRespondent is quoted as having denied punching people, throwing things or\nhurting people. His denial of having been physically violent is clearly untrue in\nlight of his admissions in these proceedings. The Respondent admitted to the\naccuracy of the quotes attributed to him.\n\n(e)\n\nIn posts on his Facebook page dated 26 April 2019 38 and 6 June 2019, 39 the\nRespondent sought to downplay the events which are the subject of some of the\nCharges. He admits having made these posts.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent's conduct from the time of the incident is clearly relevant to\nascertaining whether he is truly remorseful for what happened.\n\n37\n\nLaw Society's Bundle of Documents (\"LSBOD\") Tab 14.\n\n38\n\nLS Supp BOD Tab 3.\n\n39\n\nLS Supp BOD Tab 4.\n\n18\n\nA review of the\n\n\fRespondent's conduct reveals a clear difference in his conduct before and after April\n2019, when the video of the 17 April 2018 incident was made public.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent's correspondence with the Inquiry Committee and the interviews\nreferred to in paragraph 49(a) to (d} above all pre-dated the public disclosure of the\nvideo.\n\nFar from expressing remorse, the Respondent seeks to deflect blame and\n\nresponsibility. His approach changed once the video was made public, as evidenced\nby the social media posts referred to in paragraph 49( e) above.\n\nThe Respondent\n\nexpressly referred to the video and sought to downplay the severity and significance of\nthe events. His conduct at the material time therefore does not reflect any degree of\nremorse on his part.\n\n52.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent's contemporaneous conduct does not support\nhis assertion that he is genuinely remorseful about the incidents that are the subject of\nthe complaints.\n\n(e)\n\nThe Respondent's other arguments\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent also makes two broad arguments in support of his submission that no\ncause of sufficient gravity exists and that a high fine would be the appropriate sanction\nin this case.\n\nFirst, he argues that he \"manifests a high potential for rehabilitation\n\nbecause he demonstrates insight into his psychiatric condition\" 40 (his emphasis). He\n\nrelies on the fact that he voluntarily sought psychiatric help and \"is receiving help from\nDr Augustine Tan, an experienced psychotherapisf'.\n\n40\n\nRespondent's Submissions, at [19].\n19\n\n\f.\n\n_,\n\n54.\n\nWe find it self-serving for the Respondent to claim that he has a high potential for\nrehabilitation. We note that while he relies on the fact that he sought medical help, he\ndid not do so until more than a year after the incidents and only after the video of the\nincident had been made public. We also note that we do not have the benefit of Dr\nAugustine Tan's views on this issue.\n\n55.\n\nIn any event, we do not think that the Respondent's potential for rehabilitation is a\nfactor for us to consider in deciding whether 'cause of sufficient gravity' exists on the\nfacts of this case.\n\nThat may well be relevant for the Court of Three Judges'\n\nconsiderations on the appropriate sentence should they find that 'due cause' has been\nestablished. Even if we are wrong, and the potential for rehabilitation is a factor that\nwe should consider at this stage, there is no evidential basis for us to conclude that the\nRespondent has a high potential for rehabilitation.\n\n56.\n\nSecond, the Respondent refers to the judgment of the Court of Three Judges in Law\nSociety of Singapore v Ravi s/o Madasamy (\"Ravi Madasamy''), where the Court\noutlined the principles governing the imposition_ of sanctions in disciplinary proceedings\n- namely (i) the need to protect members of the public, (ii) the need to uphold public\nconfidence in the integrity of the profession, (iii) the need to deter the same or other\nsolicitors from similar behavior, and (iv) the need to punish the particular solicitor\ninvolved.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these factors, when considered in the context of the facts\nof this case, support his submission that the imposition of a fine would suffice.\n\n58.\n\nWe do not agree. In our view, the Respondent's reference to and reliance on Ravi\nMadasamy is misplaced. The Court of Three Judges in that case set out the principles\ngoverning the sentencing of advocates and solicitors where 'due cause' is found to\n\n20\n\n\f\\\n\nhave been established. That is plainly evident from the principles themselves, which\ninclude considering the impact on members of the public as well as the legal\nprofession as a whole.\n\n59.\n\nSuch considerations are not within our remit. Our role is limited to deciding whether\n'cause of sufficient gravity' has been established to warrant the referral of this matter to\nthe Court of Three Judges. If we answer that question in the affirmative, it would then\nbe for the Court of Three Judges to decide whether 'due cause' has been established,\nand if so to impose the appropriate sentence having considered the various principles\ndiscussed in Ravi Madasamy.\n\n60.\n\nWe therefore find that the arguments raised by the Respondent in mitigation are not\nsufficient to persuade us that the severity of his misconduct does not amount to 'cause\nof sufficient gravity'.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n61.\n\nWe therefore find and determine, within the meaning of Section 93(1 )(c) of the Act,\nthat cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83(2)(b) of\nthe Act in respect of each of the First to Eighth Charges.\n\n62.\n\nWe also find and determine, within the meaning of Section 93(1)(c) of the Act, that\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83(2)(h) of the\nAct in respect of each of the Alternative First to Eighth Charges.\n\n21\n\n\f63.\n\nWe also order, pursuant to Section 93(2) of the Act, that the Respondent pays the Law\nSociety's costs in relation to these proceedings, such costs to be taxed by the\nRegistrar if not agreed.\n\nfl,\n\nDated this\n\n/0\n\nSiraj Omar, C\nPresident\n\nday of March 2020\n\nPradeep Pillai\nAdvocate\n\n22\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-12-05T02:00:23+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-dec-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Yeo Poh Tiang [Yang Baozhen] (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Yeo Poh Tiang [Yang Baozhen] (Respondent), </strong><strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from a complaint lodged by one Mdm Koh Hwee Miem (<strong>Complainant</strong>).</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-1942529441\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>On 12 February 2020, the Complainant paid Yeo &amp; Associates LLC (<strong>the Firm</strong>) a sum of fees to utilise the services offered on an online portal developed by the Respondent to facilitate and expedite uncontested divorces (<strong>the Portal</strong>).</p>\n<p>On 5 March 2020, the Complainant requested for a full refund of fees paid as there had been no communication with either the Firm or the Respondent following the payment made on 12 February 2020.

Sreenivasan SC,\nand Ranita Yogeeswaran from M/s Straits Law Practice LLC.\n\nProcedural History\n\n6\n\nThese proceedings involve 2 charges for breaches of Rule 17(3) as well as Rule 5(2) of\n\nthe Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (\"Rules\"), which amount to\nimproper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2Xb) of the\n\nLPA, with 2 altemative charges for misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor\nunder Section S3(2)(h) of the LPA. In essence, the l't Charge under Rule 17(3) of the\n\nRules alleges that the Respondent failed to inform the Complainant that fees paid for\nservices were charged on a non-refundable basis, while the 2nd Charge under Rule 5(2)(c)\n\nand (h) of the Rules alleges that the Respondent failed to provide/contact/instruct the\n\n\fa\nJ\n\nComplainant in respect of the services after 22 days even though the services were\nrepresented as\n\n7\n\noofast\n\nand expedient\".\n\nPursuanl tu the tlircul.iurrs of this Triburral, the Defenus was filcd ul 1 1 August 2021, tlte\n\nLists of Documents were filed on26 August 2021, the Affidavits of Evidence in Chiel\nBundles of Documents and Bundles of Authorities were filed on 28 September 202I,the\n\nOpening Statements were filed on 14 October 2011 and the matter was scheduled for\nhearing from 20 to 22 October 2021. On the 1't day of the hearing, Counsel for the Law\n\nSociety sought leave to amend the Statement of Case and in particular, to clarifir the\nelements of the 2 charges, and to separate the altemative charges. Counsel for the\nRespondent had no objections. The Tribunal granted leave for the amendments and the\n\nhearing was completed on the 2\"d day after receiving testimony from the Complainant\nand the Respondent. Following the hearing and as directed by the Tribunal in consultation\n\nwith the parties, the parties submitted and exchanged their respective written closing\nsubmissions on 2 December 2021 as well as written reply closing submissions on 23\nDecember 2021.\n\nBackground\n\n8\n\nThe Firm owns and operates \"DivorceBureau@\" a\n\nwebsite\n\n(WUirUdjyr:Ioelglgglf.gQ.n.sg) described as a \"Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Portal\" (o'Portal\")\ndeveloped by the Respondent to facilitate and expedite uncontested divorces at lower\n\ncost. DivorceBureau@ Service (\"DBS\") was the basic service to assist users with\ngenerating the necessary Court documents. The Portal offered the \"PLUS Service\" (also\n\nreferred to as \"PLUSS\") to assist users with filing the Court papers and the \"Legal\n\nAdvice Service\" (also referred to as \"LAS\") to provide a consultation with a \"senior\nfamily lawyer\". DBS costs 5$599, PLUSS costs 5$380 and LAS costs S$150.\n\n9\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the Complainant opted for the DBS, PLUSS and LAS and paid the\nsum of S$1,129 to the Firm through the Portal. Thereafter, the Complainant did not\n\ncomplete the online forms and had no communication with the Firm and/or the\n\n\f-4Respondent until the Complainant requested a full refund on 5 March 2020, ie,22 days\nlater.\n\n10. On 6 March 2020, the Firm's staff replied to reject this request and despite the\nComplainant's appeal, the Firm maintained that the payment was \"non-refundable\". On\n11 March 2020, there was further communication with the Complainant and the Firm's\n\nstaff highlighted the disclaimer that the payment was \"considered fully utilised\" with\naccess to the subsequent pages and extended this position beyond DBS to include PLUSS\n\nand LAS as well.\n\nl1\n\nOn 1 I March 2020, the Complainant attempted to contact the Respondent to no avail and\nreplied to the Firm and Respondent via email. The Complainant called the Firm, but the\n\nstaff was unwilling to discuss the matter fuither. On 12 March 2020, the Complainant\nand Respondent communicated via email. However, there was no amicable solution or\n\nresolution to this issue.\n\n12. On 15 March 2020, the Complainant informed the Firm to stop work (if any) and the\nRespondent reiterated the previous position and the \"terms and conditions\" of the Portal.\n\nThe Complaint\n\n13. By way of a letter to the Law Society of Singapore dated 13 May 2020, the Complainant\nlodged the Complaint against the Respondent for:\n\n(a) acting in a way which was contrary to a legal practitioner's position by using\nintimidating language and accusing her of harassment when she repeated her\nrequest for a refund of fees for services which, from her point of view, had not been\n\nprovided;\n\n(b) lacking honesty about the services covered by the fees which the Complainant had\npaid for, and for refusing to provide services which the Complainant had already\npaid for; and\n\n\f-5-\n\n(c) failing to act with reasonable diligence in the provision of services, as no\ndocuments were prepared and no appointment had been made for legal\nconsultationo and the services were not completed by the time the Respondent\nrequested a refund on 5 March 2020, which was 22 days after she paid for the\nservices through the Portal.\n\nLaw Society's Case\n\n14. The Law Society took the position that the Complainant became a client of the Firm and\nthe Respondent upon making payment for legal services (DBS, PLUSS and LAS) on 12\n\nFebruary 2020. The Law Society submitted that the purported disclaimers relied on by\n\nthe Respondent: (i) did not negate the solicitor-client relationship, and (ii) did not\nadequately inform the Complainant that the legal fees were paid on a\n\noonon-refundable\"\n\nbasis. The Law Society further submitted there was a failure to act with reasonable\ndiligence and competence and to provide timely advice since the Respondent did not\ncontact the Complainant for 22 days and the Portal represented that the process would be\n'ofast and easy\". The Tribunal notes that the Law Society has not proposed a particular\n\nsanction but highlighted relevant precedents that supported a reprimand for breach of\n\nRule 17(3) and a fine for breach of Rule 5(2) of the Rules. The Tribunal understood the\n\nLaw Society's position to be that there was no dishonesty and no cause of sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action under Section 83 of the LPA.\n\nRespondent's Case\n\n15. The Respondent contends there was no solicitor-client relationship with the Complainant\nbecause the Portal provided \"DIY services\" and sought to separate the distinct services.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Complainant was a litigantin-person and that\nthe purported disclaimers highlighted: (i) there was no solicitor-client relationship, and\n\n(ii) the payments were \"fully utilized\" upon access to the Portal pages. The Respondent\nexplained that the Complainant would have been contacted after 30 days if the forms had\nnot been submitted because the Portal allowed users to \"edit the online form for the next\n\n30 days\" and that the Complainant did not request for PLUSS and LAS. The Tribunal\n\n\f6notes that the Respondent has proposed a fine or reprimand if one or both charges are\nestablished.\n\nTribunal's Determination\n\n16. During the hearing, the Tribunal heard the testimony of the Complainant and the\nRespondent and after the hearing, the Tribunal has considered the written submissions\nand written reply submissions of the parties in arriving at its findings on the pertinent\nissues. From the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Charges do not include DBS and relate\n\nto PLUSS and LAS only. The Charges (as amended) are set out below.\n\nFIRST CHARGE\n\nT'hat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\n\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") Iocated at I0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People's Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are charged that you had, on or around I 2 February 2020, breached\nRule l7(3) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, in that you hadfailed\n\nto inform Koh Hutee Miem that the fees which she paid on 12 February 2020 for the\n\"PLUS Service\" and \"Legal Advice Service\" were being charged on a non-refundable\nbasis, such breach amounting to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\n\nsolicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.\n\nALTERNATIVE FIRST CHARGE\nThat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") located at l0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People's Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are cltarged that you had, on or around l2 February 2020, failed to\ninform Koh Hwee Miem that thefees which she paid on 12 February 2020for the \"PLUS\n\nService\" and \"Legal Advice Service\" were being charged on a non-refundable basis,\nand are thereby guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an\n\n\f-7 -\n\nfficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the\nmeaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act.\n\nSECOND CHARGE\nThat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") located at I0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People's Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are charged thatyouhad, between I2 February 2020 and 5 March\n2020, breached Rule 5(2)(c) and (h) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules, in that you hadfailed to provide tlte services which Koh Hwee Miem had paid.for\n\non l2 February 2020, includingfiling of court documents in Court under the \"PLUS\nService\", and providing legal advice under the \"Legal Advice Service\", ond that no\ndocument had beenfiled and no appointment had beenfixed with Koh Hwee Miem even\n\nafter a period of 22 days had passed, despite the fact that the aforesaid services were\nstated to be fost and expedient; further, that you had failed to contact Koh Hwee Miem\n\nin respect of the services that had beenpaidfor on 12 February 2020 or instruct Koh\nHwee Miem on how to avail herself of the qforesaid services, such breach amounting to\n\nimproper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section\n83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.\n\nALTERNATIVE SECOND CHARGE\nThat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") located at I0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People.'s Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are charged thatyouhad, between 12 February 2020 and 5 March\n2020, failed to provide the services which Koh Hwee Miem had paidfor on I2 February\n\n2020, including /iling of court documents in Court under the \"PLUS Service\", and\nproviding legal advice under the \" Legal Advice Service \" , and that no document had been\n\nfiled and no appointment had beenfixed with Koh Hwee Miem even after a period of 22\ndays had passed, despite the foct that the aforesaid services were stated to be fast and\n\n\f-8expedient; .further, that you had failed to contact Koh Hwee Miem in respect of the\nservices that had been paidfor on I2 February 2020 or instruct Koh Hwee Miem on how\n\nto avail herself of the aforesaid services, and are thereby guilty of such misconduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an fficer of the Supreme Court or as a member\n\nof an honourable profession within the meaning of Section S3(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act.\n\n17. Based on the Portal and the available evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that a solicitorclient relationship was established between the Complainant and the Respondent upon\npayment being made on 12 February 2020. There is no dispute that the DBS service was\n\nprovided by and that the payment was received by the Firm, as a consequence of which\nthese payments would constitute legal fees for legal services. On the facts, the Tribunal\n\nfinds that the purported disclaimers do not negate the presence of a retainer and that the\nComplainant engaged the Firm and the Respondent via the Portal and paid for legal\nservices. The Tribunal notes that the legal fees for PLUSS and LAS have not been\nrefunded.\n\n1't Charge - Rule 17(3) of the Rules\n\n18. Rule 17(3)(a) of the Rules provides as follows:\n(3) A legal practitioner must\n\n-\n\n(a) inform his or her client of the basis on whichfees for professional services will be\ncharged, and of the manner in which those fees and disbursements (f any) are to be\n\npaid by the client;\n\n19. The Respondent places heavy reliance on 2 disclaimers, the first of which is referred to\nas \"the Page 180 Disclaimer\", which stated:\n\n\"... Clients are able to take as much time as they need to complete the forms. Thus,\nyour payment is considered fully utilized when you access the subsequent pages for\nthe paid service.\"\n\n\f9-\n\nThe Page 180 Disclaimer can be found in Exhibit YPT-4 to the Respondent's affidavit\n\nof evidence-in-chief (\"AEIC \") at p180.\n\n20. The Page 180 Disclaimer, which is set out right before the Payment section on the\noolnformations\n\n[sic] & Payment\" page, stated as follows:\n\n\"Divorcebureau.com.sg seel<s to provide assistance to the best of our ability to help users\n\nprepare and generate the legal document necessary to .file for divorce in the Family\nJustice Courts of Singapore but is not responsible.for the content of the legal document\ngenerated from our website, neither are we responsible for the rejecting of the said\ndocuments by the Singapore Courts due to inaccurate input or false information, or qny\n\nreasons whatsoever.

All correspondence\nby registered users will have to be via email only.\"\n\n2L The Page 180 Disclaimer did not state that no solicitor-client relationship was formed\nbetween the Firm and users of the Portal. This was acknowledged by the Respondent\n\nunder cross-examination. In fact, the Page 180 Disclaimer, as highlighted above,\nsuggested that a solicitor-client relationship was formed, as it referred to registered users\nas \"clients\" on three occasions. In a similar vein, there were numerous references to users\n\nbeing \"clients\" elsewhere on the Portal:\n\n\f- 10-\n\n(a) The header of every page of the Portal stated: \"Contact our client care specialist\nat +65 8588 8824for 24 hr/weekends support\".\n\n(b) The link to access the DivorceBureau@ Service, which was included in the header\nof every page of the Portal, was titled \"Client Login\".\n\n(c) The 'oContact Us\" Page of the Portal stated: \"Complete the [Client SupportJ form\nbelow and afamily lawyer will contact you within lworking day\".\n\n22. Thus, the Page 180 Disclaimer did not negate a solicitor-client relationship between the\nFirm and users of the Portal; to the contrary, it indicated that users are clients of the Firm.\n\n23. The second disclaimer relied on by the Respondent is referred to as oothe Page 135\nDisclaimer\", which essentially provided that there was no solicitor and client relationship\nfor the DBS, and which stated as follows:\n\n\" DivorceBureau. com. s g Dis claimer\n\nDivorceBureau.com.sg seeks to provide assistance to the best of our ability to help users\n\nprepare and generate the document necessary to file for divorce in the Family Justice\nCourts of Singapore but is not responsible for the content of the document generated\n\nfrom our website, neither are we responsible for the rejection of the said documents by\nthe Singapore Courts due to inaccurate input or folse information, or any reqsons\nwhatsoever.

However, there was no contemporaneous evidence before the Tribunal to show that the\nPage 135 Disclaimer was in fact incorporated into the Portal when the Complainant\naccessed it on 12 February 2020. Furthermore, the Page 135 Disclaimer was never\n\nbrought to the attention of users like the Complainant.\n\n25. Unlike the Page 180 Disclaimer, which was set out in full before the Payment section on\nthe \"Informations [sic] & Payment\" page on Page 180 of the Respondent's AEIC, the\n\nPage 135 Disclaimer was purportedly accessible only when users clicked on a\n\"Disclaimer Details\" link which was hidden in the footer of each page of the Portal. In\nshort, taking the Respondent's argument at its highest, not only was the Page 135\nDisclaimer not highlighted on each page of the Portal, it was also hidden and buried in\nthe \"Disclaimer Details\" link in the footer of each page of the Portal.\n\n26. As the Tribunal sees it, there are two possible reasons why the second paragraphof the\nPage 135 Disclaimer, which informed users that no solicitor-client relationship was\nestablished, was not reflected in the Page 180 Disclaimer:\n\n(a) the Page 135 Disclaimer did not exist on 12 February 2020 v,rhenthe Complainant\naccessed the Portal; or\n\n\f-t2(b) the Respondent did not want to highlight to users, immediately before they made\npayment on the 'olnformations [sic] & Payment'o page on Page 180 of the\nRespondent's AEIC, that it was intended that no solicitor-client relationship exist\n\nin respect of the Divorce Bureau Service.\n\n27. The Tribunal is not convinced that the Page 135 Disclaimer existed as of 12 February\n2020, when the Respondent accessed the Portal as the provision therein for the absence\n\nof a solicitor- client relationship would be contrary to the language in the Page 180\nDisclaimer which referred to users of the Divorce Bureau Service as clients of the Firm.\nEven if it existed then, the Tribunal would not give effect to the Page 135 Disclaimer as\n\nit was not brought to the attention of users such as the Respondent prior to the making of\nany payment for the Divorce Bureau Service. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the\n\nComplainant had become a client of the Respondent and the Firm from the time she\naccessed and used the Portal and made payment on 12 February 2020.\n\n28. The Tribunal also notes that the Page 180 Disclaimer did not inform users that their\npayments were non-refundable. Stating that a payment was \"considered fully utilized\"\n\ndid not mean that the payment would be non-refundable.\n\n29. As the Respondent had admitted under cross-examination, even monies which the\nRespondent considered to be \"fully utilized\" could still be refunded by the Firm on a\n\ngoodwill basis. In fact, the Respondent's evidence was that she and the Firm would have\nbeen willing to consider a partial refund, if the Complainant had requested for a refund\n\nin respect of the PLUS Service and the Legal Advice Service, as demonstrated in\nparagraph 34 below. Thus, even if the Respondent was entitled to treat any payment as\n\nfully utilised, it did not follow that such payment was non-refundable.\n\n30. Moreover, the Respondent's reasoning that the payment was considered fully utilised\nbecause \"fc]lients are able to take as much time as they need to complete the forms\"\n\ncould at best only apply to the DBS, which involved users accessing the Portal and\ncompleting the forms. The reasoning could not apply to the PLUSS and the LAS, which\n\ndid not entail accessing the Portal and filling in forms. Moreover, as the Respondent\n\n\f-13admitted, nowhere in the text of the Page 180 Disclaimer does it refer to the PLUSS or\nthe LAS.\n\n31\n\nOn thc stand, the Respondent tried tu uxplain LhaL the Page 180 Disclaimer extended to\nthe PLUSS and the LAS because, immediately below the Page 180 Disclaimer, users\nwere given the option of selecting the PLUSS and the LAS.\n\n32. However, this explanation/argument by the Respondent is untenable. Whether users had\nthe option of selecting the PLUSS and LAS has no bearing on and does not alter the\nmeaning conveyed by the clear words of the Page 180 Disclaimer, which clearly stated,\n\nfor the DBS, with no reference to the PLUSS and LAS, that\"your payment is considered\n\nfully utilized when you access the subsequent pages for the paid service.\"\n\n33. The Tribunal also noted that, even when the Respondent was questioned by the Tribunal\nabout the logic behind payment for the PLUS Service being utilised when no filing\nservices was provided, the Respondent was unable to provide any logical justification for\n\nthis. The relevant extract from the transcript of the hearing on 21 October 2021reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n'oPresident\n\nsorry, can we then go to page 180? I am struggling to understand how you say or\nlogically iustify a position that payment of the PLUS Service could be utilised if no\nservice has been done and tlte user has simply accessed the subsequent pages of the\n\nportal. How do you justify that?\n\n.. My question was simply this: IIow do you justify saying or taking the position, right,\n\nthat the paymentfor the PLUS Service is utilised if a user has accessed the subsequent\npages on the paid service, but no service---no filing has been done?\n\nWitness\n\n\f-14Yes, because in---as l---as I mentioned, is to make it hassle free for them. At the time\n\nwhen they complete the generation of their documents, the next logical step is to file it.\nSo when---we want them to be responsible when they use our services. ll/hen they click\n\nonto this PLUS Service, then they already decide that they want someone else to file it\n\nfor you because they want to save the hassle to file your own divorce papers, they click\non it. So tf they click on it, it means that it is fully utilised, and it's not refundable\nbecause users have to be responsible, in a way, on the segment that they cltoose.\n\nPresident:\n\n--for the.filing service. Your position is still the same, \"Once you've opted for it, it's\nconsidered utilised, even though nothing is done in relation to the service\"?\n\nWitness\n\nYes, at that time, it was the concept that everything is based on the---the responsibility\n\nof the users as well on what they think they want. So eventually, it didn't materialise\ndue to many reasons, For our website, it's considered as utilised, no refunds. But as\n\nI\n\nsaid, I always said, there's always a better practice, and I'm constantly looking at\nimproving it because it is reallyfor the benefit of myself; there's no reason that I don't\nimprove it, I'm happy to improve it. And I also said before, on the hindsight, if, at the\ntime, Ms Koh has askedfor the refund of these two parts, I might have considered.\"\n\n34. Clearly, the Page 180 Disclaimer did not inform users that their payment was nonrefundable. Apart from the Page 180 Disclaimer, the Respondent does not assert that any\nother part of the Portal informed users that their payments were non-refundable.\n\n35. With respect, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's explanation that the phrase\nin the Portal (\"your payment is consideredfully utilized when you access the subsequent\npages for the paid service\") adequately conveys that the legal fees were paid on a non-\n\nrefundable basis because a \"fully utilized\" payment can still be refunded. Even if the\n\n\f-15phrase \"fully utilized\" could be equated with \"non-refundable\", the Tribunal finds that\nthe Page 180 Disclaimer would refer and relate to DBS only and not to PLUSS and LAS.\n\n36. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the 1't Charge has been made out.\n2nd Charee\n\n- Rule 5(2) of the Rules\n\n31. Rule 5(2)(c) and (h) of the Rules provide as follows:\n(2) A legal practitioner must\n\n-\n\n(c) act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to the\nclient;\n\n(h) provide timely advice to the client;\n\n38. With respect, the Tribunal does not accept the Law Society's position that the Respondent\nfailed to act with reasonable diligence and competence and to provide timely advice to\nthe Complainant. There was no dispute that the Complainant did not complete the forms\nand that the Portal allowed users to \"edit the online forms for the next 30 days\". There\n\nis also no dispute that the Complainant did not reach out to the Firm or the Respondent\n\nto request specifically for the LAS during this 30-day period. If the forms had been\ncompleted, PLUSS could have been available. If advice had been requested, LAS could\nhave been provided. The Tribunal accepts that the Respondent did not act unreasonably\n\nin waiting 30 days for the Complainant to edit the forms and there was no impediment\nfor the Complainant to contact the Firm and Respondent during this period. Accordingly,\nTribunal finds that the 2\"d Charge has not been made out.\n\nAppropriate Sanction\n\n39. In The Law Society of Singapore v. Huang Lui IDT 11120201, the regulated practitioner\npleaded guilty to a charge under Rule 17(3) of the Rules and the Tribunal determined that\n\n\f-t6the regulated practitioner should be reprimanded and ordered to pay the Law Society's\ncosts of those proceedings fixed at 5$5,000 plus reasonable disbursements. In that case,\n\ncounsel for the Law Society directed the tribunal's attention to two cases: The Law\nSociety of Singapore v Anand K Thiagarajan [2009] SGDT 2 and The Law Society of\n\nSingapore v Chung Kok Soon 120021SGDSC 2. In both those cases, a breach of the\nobligation to inform a client of the basis on which fees for professional services would\nbe charged attracted a reprimand and an order that the Respondent pay the Law Society's\n\ncosts of the Disciplinary Tribunal proceedings.\n\n40. Considering all the relevant facts of the case, the findings made by the Tribunal and the\nrelevant precedents, Tribunal recommends that the Respondent be reprimanded.\n\n41. Further, given the materials filed, the duration of the hearing, the extent of the written\nsubmissions and the fact that the Law Society had made out the 1't Charge but not the 2nd\n\nCharge, the Tribunal considers that cost in the sum of $8,000, plus reasonable\ndisbursements, to be fair and reasonable and should be paid by the Respondent to the\n\nLaw Society.\n\n42. In conclusion, the Tribunal makes the following determination that:\n(a) pursuant to Section 93(1Xb) of the LPA, while no cause of sufficient gravity for\ndisciplinary action exists under Section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be\nreprimanded; and\n\n(b) pursuant to Section 93(2) of the LPA, the Respondent is ordered to pay the Law\nSociety's costs of these proceedings fixed at 5$8,000 plus reasonable\ndisbursements.\n\nDated this\n\nMr Andre Yeap S.C\nPresident\n\n4th\n\nday of May 2022\n\nMr Anand Nalachandran\nMember\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-11-08T04:00:17+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-nov-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Ooi Oon Tat (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-ooi-oon-tat-respondent\">In the Matter of Ooi Oon Tat (Respondent), <strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Mr Lim See Meng (the <strong>Complainant</strong>).</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-1254461404\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>The Complainant was a taxi driver who was involved in an accident with one Mr Chong Chun Siong (<strong>Mr Chong</strong>). The Complainant suffered some physical injuries. The Complainant, through his then solicitor, commenced DC Suit 2679/2015 (the <strong>Suit</strong>). The Respondent formally took over conduct of the Suit on 2 May 2016. United Legal Alliance LLC (<strong>ULA</strong>) represented Mr Chong.</p>\n<p>ULA wrote to the Respondent on 15 June 2016, and had requested for certain documents in relation to the Complainant’s case (<strong>Discovery Request</strong>). About two weeks later, the Complainant went to the Respondent’s office, and provided some documents to enable the Respondent to reply in part to the Discovery Request.</p>\n<p>On 30 June 2016, the Complainant sent a reminder to the Respondent via e-mail to respond to the Discovery Request. As the Complainant did not receive any update from the Respondent, he engaged a different solicitor in January 2017, who did a search of the Court’s file and informed the Complainant that the Suit was struck out.</p>\n<p>The Complainant’s claim for personal injury, if commenced in a fresh suit at the time it was struck out on 20 January 2017, would have potentially been time-barred. The Complainant eventually commenced civil proceedings against the Respondent for professional negligence, and the Respondent was found liable to pay the Complainant’s costs and disbursements, as well as $72,879.03 in damages.</p>\n<p>In relation to the complaint, the Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC and Mr Andrew Chan Chee Yin as DT member.</p>\n<p>Three charges (and its alternatives) were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h3><strong>First Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (<strong>LPA</strong>) in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent was aware of information that would reasonably affect the Complainant’s interests in the Suit, but failed to reasonably inform the Complainant of such information and/or the progress of the Suit, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) and/or Rule 5(2)(e) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (<strong>Rules</strong>).</p>\n<h3><strong>First Alternative Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent was aware of information that would reasonably affect the Complainant’s interests in the Suit, but failed to reasonably inform the Complainant of such information and/or the progress of the Suit.</p>\n<h3><strong>Second Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services; provide timely advice and/or use all legal means to advance the Complainant’s interests to the extent that the Respondent may reasonably be expected to do so, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c), Rule 5(2)(h) and/or Rule 5(2)(j) of the Rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Second Alternative Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services; provide timely advice and/or use all legal means to advance the Complainant’s interests to the extent that the Respondent may reasonably be expected to do so.</p>\n<h3><strong>Third Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent had failed to follow the lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that the Complainant was competent to give, which included failing to follow the Complainant’s instructions in his email to the Respondent dated 30 June 2016, in breach of Rule 5(2)(i) of the Rules.</p>\n<h3><strong>Third Alternative Charge</strong></h3>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to follow the lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that the Complainant was competent to give, which included failing to follow the Complainant’s instructions in his e-mail to the Respondent dated 30 June 2016.</p>\n<h3><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT; Council’s Sanctions</strong></h3>\n<p>The DT found that all three main charges (and its alternatives) were proven beyond reasonable doubt.

The Complainant suffered some physical injuries. The Complainant, through his then solicitor, commenced DC Suit 2679/2015 (the Suit). The Respondent formally took over conduct of the Suit on 2 May 2016. United Legal Alliance LLC (ULA) represented Mr Chong.\n\nULA wrote to the Respondent on 15 June 2016, and had requested for certain documents in relation to the Complainant’s case (Discovery Request). About two weeks later, the Complainant went to the Respondent’s office, and provided some documents to enable the Respondent to reply in part to the Discovery Request.\n\nOn 30 June 2016, the Complainant sent a reminder to the Respondent via e-mail to respond to the Discovery Request. As the Complainant did not receive any update from the Respondent, he engaged a different solicitor in January 2017, who did a search of the Court’s file and informed the Complainant that the Suit was struck out.\n\nThe Complainant’s claim for personal injury, if commenced in a fresh suit at the time it was struck out on 20 January 2017, would have potentially been time-barred. The Complainant eventually commenced civil proceedings against the Respondent for professional negligence, and the Respondent was found liable to pay the Complainant’s costs and disbursements, as well as $72,879.03 in damages.\n\nIn relation to the complaint, the Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) presided by Mr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC and Mr Andrew Chan Chee Yin as DT member.\n\nThree charges (and its alternatives) were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nFirst Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (LPA) in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent was aware of information that would reasonably affect the Complainant’s interests in the Suit, but failed to reasonably inform the Complainant of such information and/or the progress of the Suit, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) and/or Rule 5(2)(e) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (Rules).\n\nFirst Alternative Charge\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent was aware of information that would reasonably affect the Complainant’s interests in the Suit, but failed to reasonably inform the Complainant of such information and/or the progress of the Suit.\n\nSecond Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services; provide timely advice and/or use all legal means to advance the Complainant’s interests to the extent that the Respondent may reasonably be expected to do so, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c), Rule 5(2)(h) and/or Rule 5(2)(j) of the Rules.\n\nSecond Alternative Charge\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of legal services; provide timely advice and/or use all legal means to advance the Complainant’s interests to the extent that the Respondent may reasonably be expected to do so.\n\nThird Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent had failed to follow the lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that the Complainant was competent to give, which included failing to follow the Complainant’s instructions in his email to the Respondent dated 30 June 2016, in breach of Rule 5(2)(i) of the Rules.\n\nThird Alternative Charge\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that whilst acting for the Complainant in the Suit, the Respondent failed to follow the lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that the Complainant was competent to give, which included failing to follow the Complainant’s instructions in his e-mail to the Respondent dated 30 June 2016.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT; Council’s Sanctions\n\nThe DT found that all three main charges (and its alternatives) were proven beyond reasonable doubt. There appeared to be no mitigating factors, while aggravating factors were present in this case.\n\nThe DT was of the view that the Respondent could have complied with the Discovery Request but simply failed to, eventually causing the Suit to be struck out while leaving the Complainant in the dark.\n\nThe DT emphasised that the Respondent’s conduct was egregious, and sounded its strong disapprobation of the same. Further, the DT also expressed its displeasure at the Respondent who failed and/or refused to file his Defence, List of Documents, and his Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief despite several reminders and extensions given by the DT.\n\nAfter considering the cases of The Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2019] SGDT 4 and The Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar S/O Sethuraju [2012] SGDT 4, the DT was of the view that this present case was more egregious than the 2 precedents above due to the Respondent’s contumelious and repeated failure to reasonably inform Mr Lim of his discovery obligations which ultimately led to the Suit being struck out.\n\nThe DT found that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed, with the Respondent to be referred to the Court of 3 Judges (C3J). The DT had also awarded costs amounting to $8,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to the Law Society.\n\nCouncil adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and on 1 July 2022, the C3J ordered the Respondent to be suspended from practice for a period of five (5) years commencing 1 July 2022, and to pay the Law Society’s costs of $18,000 (inclusive of disbursements) with the costs orders made by the DT to remain.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Oct_22_DT_Ooi_Oon_Tat.pdf","pdf-content":"DT 10 OF 2021\nIN THE MATTER OF OOI OON TAT,\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n(CHAPTER 161)\n\nDECISION OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal\nMr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC President\nMr Andrew Chan Chee Yin Member\n\nCounsel for the Law Society\n\nCounsel for the Respondent\n\nMr Adrian Wong Soon Peng\nMr Wayne Yeo (Yang Weien)\n\nRespondent acting in person\n\nRajah & Tann Singapore LLP\n9 Straits View\n#06-07 Marine One West Tower\nSingapore 018937\nDated this 20th day of December 2021\n\n\fDT 10/2021\n\nBetween\n\nTHE LAW SOCIETY OF SINGAPORE\n(No ID Exists)\n\nAnd\n\nOOI OON TAT\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 June 2020, Mr Lim See Meng\n\nMr Lim\n\na taxi driver lodged his complaint1\n\nagainst his former solicitor Mr Ooi Oon Tat the Respondent practising as a sole proprietor\nunder the law firm name of M/s Judy Cheng & Co J&C .

In his email dated\n\n1 June 2021 to the Secretariat, the Respondent requested more time as he claimed that his\npersonal computer had crashed some time ago and he had difficulty retrieving documents. By\nemail dated 8 June 2021 from the Secretariat to the Respondent, the Tribunal asked the\nRespondent to provide his proposed deadlines to meet all filing obligations before the Tribunal\ndecided on whether to grant the appropriate extensions of time for the 3 filings.\n\n31.\n\nBy email dated 21 June 2021, the LSS requested the Respondent to reply to the\nemail dated 8 June 2021 on the deadlines the Respondent would be proposing\n\nin complying with the filing obligations. It was a generous and conciliatory act on the part of\nthe LSS in writing this email, and yet, the Respondent did not give any reply thereto, nor to\nthe Secretariat\n\n32.\n\nearlier email.\n\nThen, by letter dated 28 June 2021,\n\nRule 22\n\nof the DT Rules for extensions of time, the Tribunal directed that the\n\nefence\n\nbe filed by 6 July 2021, the list of documents of parties be filed by 30 July 2021, and the AEICs,\nBundle of Authorities BA and B\n\nBD be filed by 10 September 2021.\n\nThe Tribunal warned that if the\n\nwas not filed by 6 July 2021, the\n\nTribunal would nonetheless advance the proceedings and might take into account the conduct\nof the Respondent for any defence filed late.\n\n33.\n\nA pre-hearing conference took place on 13 July 2021. At that hearing, the Tribunal\n13\n\n\fexpressed its displeasure to the Respondent for again failing to file his defence, and gave yet\na further opportunity to the Respondent to file his defence, this time by 19 July 2021. The\nTribunal also directed parties to file their list of documents by 30 July 2021, and AEICs, BA\nand BD by 20 August 2021, and fixed the evidential hearing on 15 and 16 September 2021.\nBy letter dated 14 July 2021, the Tribunal also directed the opening statements of both parties\nto be filed by 8 September 2021.\n\n34.\n\nWhilst the LSS duly fulfilled all its filing obligations in time, the Respondent did not at\n\nall. When the matter came up for the evidential hearing on 15 September 2021, the Tribunal\nagain expressed its displeasure that the Respondent had failed and ignored his filing\nobligations of his defence, list of documents, AEIC and opening statement. The Tribunal\nsought an explanation. The Respondent apologised profusely saying: I really have no good\nexcuse other than I just have difficulty getting the whole out (sic).25 The Tribunal was unsure\nwhether it was a case where the Respondent was mentally unable to conduct the defence of\nhis own case or was simply not revealing his case to the LSS until the hearing. For whatever\nreason, the directions of the Tribunal were not complied with.\n\n35.\n\nIn its Closing Submissions dated 18 October 2021, the LSS pointed to an earlier\n\nprosecution against the Respondent in The Law Society of Singapore v Ooi Oon Tat [2018]\nSGDT,26 in which he was charged with causing\n\nof $138,148.11 to be deposited\n\ninto the office account of J&C (of which he was the sole proprietor\naccount. There, he was held to be in breach of Rule 3(1) of the\nAccounts) Rules. The Court of Three Judges suspended the Respondent from practice for 1\nyear with effect from 9 September 2019. However, that is not the reason why we have referred\nto that earlier prosecution against him.\n\n25\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 3 (ln 1-2)\n\n14\n\n\f36.\n\nWhat is relevant to this Tribunal is that the earlier Tribunal had similarly expressed\ndid not comply with any of the timelines and failed to file any\n\ndefence, provide any documents or evidence\n\nchosen not to comply\n\nwith the procedures prescribed in the rules which govern disciplinary proceedings or accept\nthe latitude the DT has offered him to properly defend himself given the serious nature of these\nproceedings\nhearing and gave further directions for the Respondent to file his defence and AEIC by an\nextended date. And again, the Respondent chose to ignore those directions and the hearing\nproceeded without the proper filing. Thus, it was disturbing to this Tribunal that in these\nproceedings, the Respondent likewise ignored\n\nseveral directions to file his\n\ndefence, list of documents, AEICs and opening statement. The Respondent also did not file\nany written closing submissions by 18 October 2021 as directed by the Tribunal at the close\nof the evidential hearing, saying during oral closing submissions I have no real excuse 27\n\nEvidential hearing on 15 and 16 September 2021\n\n37.\n\nOn the first day of the evidential hearing on 15 September 2021, the Respondent\n\ntendered a bundle of documents RB which he had apparently produced earlier before the\nInquiry Committee. The Tribunal asked why those documents could not have been tendered\ntimeously as the documents before the Inquiry Committee would not be before this Tribunal.\nNo sensible explanation was given. The documents comprised WhatsApp and SMS\nmessages from\n\nhandphone, and emails from his personal computer which\n\nhad allegedly crashed.\n\n38.\n\n27\n\nAs the Respondent did not file his defence nor his AEIC, the counsel of the LSS rightly\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 6 (ln 17-19)\n\n15\n\n\fobjected to the manner in which the Respondent started to make various allegations in the\ncourse of cross-examining Mr Lim.\n\nany prior notice of his\n\ncase also obliged the Tribunal to take greater effort to understand the Respondent defences\nto the charges. Be that as it may, the Tribunal proceeded to hear the evidence.\n\n39.\n\nMr Lim provided an AEIC dated 27 August 2021. The Respondent cross-examined Mr\n\nLim at length on issues, the relevance of which was at times difficult to understand and, at\nother times, clearly irrelevant to the charges against the Respondent.\n\n40.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent claimed that he had orally informed Mr Lim of the progress\n\nof the Suit and the orders made against him.28 Mr Lim denied that strenuously. The only\nrelevant admission Mr Lim\n\nto J&C\n\nof 17 August 2016, which admission led to the\ndeleting reference to this letter (see [25] above). The Respondent also sought to prove that\nMr Lim and he had reached an agreement on the reinstatement of the Suit at a meeting\nsometime in February 2017. In that regard, he cast blame on Mr Lim for having a bad case in\nthe Suit on the basis that the injuries Mr Lim suffered in the November 2012 accident were\nsimilar to the injuries he suffered in the March 2012 accident and Mr Lim had provided very\npoor testimony in relation to the same in MC 228. He had given Mr Lim written advice on this\nafter the Suit was struck out and claimed that Mr Lim had agreed with him to reinstate the Suit\nonly after more progress was made in the assessment of damages in MC 228.29\n\n41.\n\nWe however do not see how this is relevant to the charges of the Respondent failure\n\nto inform and advise his client Mr Lim timeously of the Discovery Request and subsequent\norders made in relation thereto.\n\n28\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 89 (ln 17-32) and p. 125 (ln 1-9)\n\n29\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 9 (ln 17-19)\n\n16\n\n\f42.\n\nWhat instead is clear to the Tribunal is that Mr Lim as the client was very keen to make\n\nsure that the Suit was prosecuted properly and expeditiously. This is shown by his visit to the\nR\n\noffice on 27 June 2016 when he handed over to the Respondent his IRAS\n\nnotices of assessment, CPF statements and signed clinical abstract form. This was followed\nreminder email on 30 June 2016 that the Respondent expedite matters and reply\nto ULA and copy him in the process. This evidence is undisputed, and the Respondent\n. Whilst the Tribunal\ngave the Respondent ample opportunity to explain why he did not send out those documents\nto ULA to fulfil the Discovery Request, he had no real answer.30\n\n43.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Respondent failure to provide ULA with any of the documents\nDiscovery Request led to a discovery application in DC/SUM 2793/2016 on 29 August\n\n2016,31 which in turn led to an order for discovery against Mr Lim in DC/ORC 3529/2016 on 4\nOctober 2016\n\nDiscovery Order .32 The Respondent admitted to having attended the\n\nhearing and receiving the Discovery Order on 4 October 2016.33 Yet, he appeared to have\ndone nothing about it.\n\n44.\n\nIn oral closing submissions and in his evidence, the Respondent admitted that he had\n\nmost if not all of the documents requested by ULA and ordered by the court.34 This admission\nmade it more incomprehensible as to why the Respondent did not comply with the Discovery\nRequest and later the Discovery Order. When probed on this, the Respondent said he could\n\n30\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 70 (ln 9-32), p. 71 (ln 1-18), p. 72 (ln 22-32), p. 73 (ln 1-2), p. 83 (ln 7-30), p. 84 (ln 31-32) and\n\np. 85 (ln 1-30)\n31\n\n2PB at p. 609\n\n32\n\n2PB at pp. 640-642\n\n33 NE 16 Sep at p. 89 (ln 15-21)\n34\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 70 (ln 9-32), p. 71 (ln 1-18), p. 72 (ln 22-32), p. 73 (ln 1-2) and p. 83 (ln 7-30); NE 1 Nov at p.\n\n40 (ln 18-32) and p. 41 (ln 5-16)\n\n17\n\n\fnot think of any reason and that\n(sic).35 He also chose to ignore\n\n31 October 2016 which then\n\nled to an application for an unless order against Mr Lim in DC/SUM 3586/2016 filed on 8\nNovember 2016.36 The unless order was made on 13 December 2016 in DC/ORC 94/2017\nUnless Order .37 The Respondent attended that critical hearing.\n\n45.\n\nThe Unless Order gave Mr Lim up to 10 January 2017 to comply with the Discovery\n\nOrder failing which his claim in the Suit would be struck out. But nothing seemed to have been\ndone by the Respondent to comply with the strict terms of the Unless Order, let alone inform\nMr Lim of the same.\n\n46.\n\nOn 20 January 2017, the Suit was struck out.38\n\ncommenced in a fresh suit at that time would have potentially been time-barred.39\n\n47.\n\nThus, a prima facie case of breaches of professional obligations was made out by the\n\nLSS on all 3 charges against the Respondent.\n\n48.\n\nThe LSS drew our attention to the case of Vijayalakshmi Sivaprakasapillai v Mrinalini\n\nPonnambalam [2009] SGHC 183, a case in which the respondent was then practising in M/s\nSalem & Ibrahim & Partners as counsel for the plaintiff. There, the r\n\nhad\n\nfailed to comply with an unless order. The High Court held that in order for the action to be\nrestored, the plaintiff must give a proper explanation to establish good reasons for failure to\n\n35\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 41 (ln 9-16)\n\n36\n\n2PB at p. 644-645\n\n37 2PB at p. 655\n\n38 2PB at p. 658-659\n39 Under Section 24A(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163), an action for damages in respect of personal injuries\ncannot be brought after the later of 3 years from the date the cause of action accrued or 3 years from the earliest\ndate on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the\nrelevant injury.\n\n18\n\n\fcomply with a peremptory order and that no further breach of a court order would occur again.\nThe LSS drew our attention to this case to show that the Respondent ought to have known\nthe seriousness of any unless order.\n\n49.\n\nWhilst that case is instructive, even without it, it must be obvious to every advocate\n\nand solicitor that he must help a client to comply with discovery orders, even more so where\nthere is an unless order against the client, as failing to comply with it carries very serious\nconsequences for the client. And\n\nCertainly for a lawyer of the\n\nstanding with some 27 years experience at the material time, his failure to\ncomply with the Discovery Order and Unless Order was incomprehensible to the Tribunal,\nparticularly when considered in the light of his admission that he had the documents in his\noffice all the while and could have complied to avert the consequence of the Unless Order.40\n\n50.\n\nIn Law Society of Singapore vs Mahtani Bhagwandas [2021] SGHC 170, the Court of\n\nThree Judges clarified that whilst the LSS bears the burden to proof the elements of a charge\nlegal burden (at [79(a)]).\nWhere the LSS has proven a prima facie case that the Respondent has failed in his duties to\nhis client based on the facts\n\nevidential burden\n\nondent to prove\n\notherwise. Thus, in this case, the LSS has indeed proven a prima facie case that the various\nletters, applications and court orders had not been advised to Mr Lim timeously and properly,\nand that the Respondent had not properly advised and assisted Mr Lim in complying with the\nOrders of Court. The evidential burden therefore shifts to the Respondent. He has to satisfy\nthe Tribunal that he has given notice of these documents to his client and advised his client\non the progress of the Suit, additionally advising and assisting his client to meet the Discovery\nOrder and related Unless Order, among other things.\n\n40\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 42 (ln 11-21)\n\n19\n\n\f51.\n\nThe LSS rightly complained that given\n\nfailure to file a defence, list of\n\ndocuments and AEIC, he should not be permitted to assert a positive case against Mr Lim\ncomplaint forming the crux of the charges. However, the Tribunal gave the Respondent much\nleeway given that these proceedings were very serious in nature such that, if the LSS could\nnot proceed, we would consider whether giving the LSS an adjournment of the proceedings\nat the cost of the Respondent would be appropriate. The LSS was however able to deal with\nall the evidence, arguments and assertions put forward by the Respondent in his defence and\ndid not seek any adjournment. This defence (which was never tendered) is based on what the\nh\n\nTribunal could deduce from (i) the\n\ncross-examination of Mr Lim, (ii) the evidence\n\ngiven by the Respondent when he was cross-examined, (iii) and his oral closing submissions,\nwhich is as follows:\n\na)\n\nHe had orally advised Mr Lim on the letters, applications and orders of court;41\n\nb)\n\nHe claimed that there were no attendance notes to verify this because at\ntimes, he did not record a note, and on other occasions, when he did, he had\nlost them when allegedly his personal computer crashed in around July\n2018;42\n\nc)\n\nHe believed that there might have been written advice to his client through\nemails but they were lost in the computer crash.43 He claimed that he did not\nhave back-up copies of the emails in his server; and\n\n41 NE 16 Sep at p. 89 (ln 17-32), p. 125 (ln 1-9); NE 1 Nov at p. 30 (ln 1-10)\n42\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 83 (ln 25-30); NE 16 Sep at p. 11 (ln 2-14); NE 1 Nov at p. 30 (ln 11-30)\n\n43\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 69 (ln 13-24), p. 77 (ln 26-32) and p. 90 (ln 1-28); NE 1 Nov at p. 31 (ln 1-7)\n\n20\n\n\fd)\n\nAs for the hard copy documents, he had destroyed the correspondence file in\n2018 (though the file was less than 6 years old).44 Yet, he claimed that he kept\nthe cause papers and documents files of the Suit45. He further claimed that\ndespite knowing Mr Lim was going to commence a civil claim against him, he\nnevertheless proceeded to destroy the correspondence file.46\n\n52.\ncredible at all. We much preferred the clean and consistent evidence of Mr Lim that he had\nreceived no updates or advice despite his email reminder on 30 June 2016, up to the time he\nfound out about the Suit being struck out when he instructed another lawyer (Mr Lee) to take\nover the file from J&C in around January 2017.\n\n53.\n\nWe now deal with the RB which the Respondent tendered at the opening day of the\n\nevidential hearing on 15 September 2021. It comprised SMS messages between the\nRespondent and Mr Lim in 2 periods, between August 2016 to March 2017 and between June\n2017 to April 2018; emails between them in 2 periods, between November 2016 to December\n2016 and September 2017 to April 2018; and finally WhatsApp messages between them from\nApril 2017 to September 2019.\n\n54.\n\nA perusal of the SMS messages, since they cover the relevant period of August 2016\n\nto January 2017, shows that there were various messages from Mr Lim asking the Respondent\nRB relates more\nto MC 228 with only passing reference to the subject Suit, and it does not speak to the Suit\nand the charges.47\n\n44\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 16 (ln 1-18) and p. 22 (ln 20-24)\n\n45 NE 16 Sep at p. 151 (ln 17-20)\n46\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 23 (ln 1-4)\n\n47\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 4 (ln 20-32)\n\n21\n\n\f55.\n\nWe think otherwise. It in fact throws more light on how Mr Lim continued to press the\n\nRespondent for updates on the progress of his Suit and that there was written advice on\noccasions from the Respondent on other matters, except that they do not support the\n\ncompliance with the discovery related matters.\n\n56.\n\nIn one such SMS dated 13 September 2016 where Mr Lim asked: Hi Mr Ooi this is\n\nLim See Ming..can you update me the hearing today to consolidate tq (sic), the answer from\nthe Respondent was: Later follow up. Adjourned (sic). Another was on 7 November 2016\nwhen Mr Lim asked: Hi mr.Ooi this peter can I call you to tele to discuss the AFFIDAVIT from\ndefendant now? (sic), to which the Respondent replied: Busy. Later in the afternoon (sic).\nNeither party referred to this in much detail at the evidential hearing and we will not presume\nwhat happened.\n\n57.\n\nIn an email dated 16 December 2016 from Mr Lim to the Respondent, there was further\npursuit of the Respondent to attend to his case. This email was sent 3\n\ndays after the Respondent attended the hearing where the Unless Order was made against\nMr Lim, and is helpful to reproduce:\nDear Mr Ooi,\n1. I have sent you 2 text message on 15th Dec 2016. I wonder if you have receive.\n2. I would like to hold a meeting with you with regards to my 2 cases.\n3. Kindly update me of the latest developments to my 2 cases.\n4. As I have been discharged from hospital, I would like to send you the bills of\nmy accident claim to be sent to the defendant.\nThank you.\n58.\n\nThe Respondent provided no document to evidence how the concerns of Mr Lim were\n\nmet and whether his requests for a meeting were acceded to. There was also no document\nshowing that the Respondent informed Mr Lim of any Unless Order. No attendance notes exist\nof any meeting. There was written advice from the Respondent on the issue of consolidation\nof MC 228 and the Suit in an email on 7 December 2016, but the issue of advice on\n22\n\n\fconsolidation does not speak to the present 3 charges.\n\n59.\n\nThe WhatsApp messages pertained to a later period of April 2017 to September 2019.\n\nAgain, a perusal of those messages suggests a recurring theme of Mr Lim chasing the\nRespondent for a meeting to discuss his matters. On 31 July 2017, we see one such message\nwhere Mr Lim states Hi Mr. Ooi can I know when can we meet to discuss about the matter\nof two cases? Please reply thank you (sic).\n\n60.\n\nIn the course of the evidential hearing, the Respondent produced a further document\n\n(marked RB85 ), containing an undated exchange of messages apparently between a\ncomputer technician and the Respondent over the crash of his personal computer which he\nclaimed happened and resulted in the loss of most if not all of his relevant documents. But a\nplain reading of the messages does not suggest that. For instance, in the message at 1:34 pm\n(undated), the person (unidentified) wrote: Those which r kept on mail server is there. If not\nwrong, last time ur system was using POP3, so technically, all emails are on that hard disk\n(sic). The Tribunal asked why the Respondent did not call the relevant technician to testify on\nthe crash and loss of documents. He had no good answer.\n\nanations as\n\nto why records which would have exculpated him could not be found elsewhere, for example\non a server, physical files or carbon copied to Ms Cheng, are also difficult to believe and were\nriddled with inconsistencies. For instance, the Respondent admitted that there could have\n\ncomputer despite the Respondent offering to purchase the computer from Ms Cheng. It is also\nto be noted that the alleged sale of the computer by Ms Cheng took place well after the\nRespondent alleged he lost information due to his computer crash.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent also sought to suggest, without basis, that the LSS might not have\n\nobtained all relevant evidence from Mr Lim. The LSS strenuously objected to the casting of\naspersion on the LSS of improper conduct. This objection was rightly made by the LSS.\n23\n\n\f62.\n\nLastly\n\nample opportunities to do so, coupled with his convenient assertion that he was unable to\nproduce any exculpatory documents as he lost them to a computer crash (although still being\nable to produce certain emails in his RB), leads us to draw an adverse inference against the\nRespondent pursuant to Rule 20 of the DT Rules, specifically that he has no real defence to\nthe 3 charges, whereas the prima facie evidence is wholly against him.\n\nThe decision of the Tribunal\n\n63.\n\nUnder Section 93(1) of the\n\nLPA , the Tribunal shall\n\nrecord its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to those facts shall\ndetermine that:\n\na)\n\nThere is no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section 83\nof the LPA;\n\nb)\n\nWhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section\n83 of the LPA, the legal practitioner should be: (i) ordered to pay a penalty\nthat is sufficient and appropriate; (ii) reprimanded; or (iii) ordered to comply\nwith one or more remedial measures. The Tribunal may administer the\nsanction in (iii) in addition to the sanctions in (i) or (ii); or\n\nc)\n\nThere is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section 83 of\nthe LPA.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided by the\n\nsubmission that in the case of The Law Society of\n\nSingapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2019] SGDT 4, where there was a failure to attend a single\n24\n\n\f, it constituted an occasion of being\na cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\n\nupheld by the\n\nCourt of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2020] 4 SLR 1173\nwhich sentenced that lawyer to a 2 year\n\n65.\n\nsuspension ([6]).\n\nIn a less serious case of The Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar S/O Sethuraju\nhis client and to keep the client\n\ninformed was also a cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action which led the Court of\nThree Judges to sentence the lawyer to a 3 months suspension.\n\n66.\n\nIn this case, quite clearly, the Respondent\n\ncontumelious and repeated failure to\n\nreasonably inform Mr Lim of his discovery obligations which ultimately led to the Suit being\nstruck out, seemed far worse than the above 2 precedents. In our view, all 3 charges have\nbeen made out on the evidence.\n\n67.\n\nT\n\nand lackadaisical conduct is seen over a prolonged period\n\nbetween August 2016 to January 2017, when there were several occasions the Discovery\nRequest, Discovery Order and finally the Unless Order could have been complied with. The\nconduct regrettably brings dishonour to the profession and falls far below the\nconduct expected of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n68.\n\nIn our view, all 3 main charges of improper conduct in the discharge of the\namounting to improper conduct or practice as an advocate\n\nand solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA have been proven against\nthe Respondent beyond all reasonable doubt. There appeared to be no mitigating factor, and\nthere were aggravating factors in this case.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds in the alternative that the alternative framing of the 3 charges,\n25\n\n\fas amounting to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor in the discharge of his\nprofessional duty as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, has also been made out. The\n\nstated above and it would no doubt constitute misconduct that is unbefitting. We would sound\nstrong disapprobation of such conduct. It bears repeating the disturbing fact that the\nRespondent could have complied with the Discovery Request and several orders but simply\nfailed to, eventually causing the clien\n\nall this while leaving the client\n\nin the dark.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that where a Respondent pleads guilty to charges, it is good\n\npractice that alternative charges be withdrawn. In Law Society of Singapore v Chan Chun\nHwee Allan [2018] 4 SLR 859, the Honourable\n\nthe\n\nresult of the Resp\ncharges fell away as a matter of course\n\nShe\n\nthe practice of\n\nwithdrawing alternative charges based on the same conduct as those to which a solicitorrespondent has pleaded guilty, is to be encouraged . However, as this is not a case of a plea\nof guilt, the Tribunal also finds that the alternative charges as framed are made out.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal thus determines, pursuant to Section 93(1)(c) of the LPA, that that there\n\nare obvious causes of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section 83 of the LPA on\nall 3 main and alternative charges.\n\nCosts\n\n72.\n\nUnder section 93(2) of the LPA, the Tribunal has the power to make an order for the\n\npayment of costs where it finds cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action:\nWhere a Disciplinary Tribunal makes a determination under subsection (1)(b)(i),\n26\n\n\f(ii) or (iv) or (c), the Disciplinary Tribunal may make an order for payment by any\nparty of costs, and may, in such order, specify the amount of those costs or direct\nthat the amount be taxed by the Registrar.\n73.\n\nThe LSS sought a sum of S$8,000 inclusive of disbursements which the Tribunal thinks\n\nis fair and reasonable. The Respondent did not challenge the sum but asked the Tribunal to\nbe lenient. The Tribunal does not think the sum is in any way unfair to Respondent. The matter\ninvolved a 2 day\n\nhearing and a half day of oral closing submissions. Further regard\n\nis also had to\n\ncontumelious disregard\n\nfiling orders which\n\nresulted in a greater task for the LSS to\n\nDated this 20th day of December 2021\n\nMr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC\n\nMr Andrew Chan Chee Yin\n\n(President)\n\n(Member)\n\n27\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-10-08T04:00:58+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Mohammad Nizam Bin Ismail (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Mohammad Nizam Bin Ismail (Respondent), </strong><strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from a complaint filed by RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP (now known as RHTLaw Asia LLP), a limited liability partnership (<strong>RHTLaw</strong> or <strong>Complainant</strong>).

He was clinically depressed at\nthe time of the criminal offences, and his depressed mood, poor emotional regulation\nand inadequate coping skills were likely to have contributed significantly to his poor\njudgment and lack of self-control at the material time.\n\n2\n\nTo ensure that he did not relapse into drug use, he attended numerous psychiatric\nconsultations, counselling sessions, pastoral sessions and recovery support meetings.\nConsequently, he has fully recovered from the disorder and did not require any antidepressant medication for a year. He has also been abstinent from drugs for almost four\nyears. The risk of relapse is low.\n\n3)\n\nThe Respondent fully cooperated with the Law Society and the Attorney-General’s\nChambers. In particular, in October 2021, he promptly agreed to the conditions\nimposed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers in relation to his application for a\npracticing certificate.\n\n“)\n\nPrior to the commission of the criminal offences, the Respondent had no antecedents.\nThe offences were not committed in the course of his duties as an advocate and solicitor.\nThere was no dishonesty or deception involved in his professional capacity as an\nadvocate and solicitor.\n\n()\n\nThe Respondent has good personal character and exemplary conduct. The criminal\noffences committed were highly uncharacteristic of him. They were caused by his\ndepressed mental condition.\n\nOur Finding\n\n9.\n\nHaving considered the Law Society’s Statement of Case and the Respondent’s mitigation plea,\nwe are of the view that in the present case, no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\nexists under section 83 of the LPA. Our reasons are as follow:\n\n©)\n\nThe Respondent was not a drug addict or trafficker.\n\n@)\n\nIt was due to a major depressive disorder that he committed the criminal offences.\n\n\f()\n\nThe offences had no connection with his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor;\nthey were not committed in the course of such duties. In fact, he was not practising at\nthe time of the criminal offences in March 2018.\n\n4)\n\nThe impact of the offences was limited to the Respondent himself and his family, but\nnot any third party.\n\n)\n\nThere was no dishonesty or deception involved' in his professional capacity as an\nadvocate and solicitor.\n\n(6)\n\nHe pleaded guilty to the criminal charges as well as the three charges formulated by the\nLaw Society and agreed to have two other charges taken into consideration for the\npurpose of sentencing) — this shows that he was remorseful and contrite.\n\n(7\n\nHe promptly agreed to the conditions imposed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers in\nrelation to his application for a practising certificate.\n\n®)\n\nHe made diligent efforts to ensure that he did not relapse into drug use by attending\nnumerous psychiatric consultations, counselling sessions, pastoral sessions and\nrecovery support meetings. The likelihood of re-offending is low.\n\n©)\n\nThe offences and the surrounding circumstances of the case did not imply a defect of\ncharacter which makes the Respondent unfit for the profession within the meaning of\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n10.\n\nFor the above reasons also, and given that the Respondent has already been punished with\nimprisonment, we find that a reprimand would serve the ends of justice in this case.\nConsequently, and pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(ii) of the LPA, we determine that while no cause\nof sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent\nshould be reprimanded.\n\n11.\n\nAt the Hearing, Mr. Suressh asked us to award disbursements to the Law Society. Pursuant to\n\nsection 93(2) of the LPA, we make an order for disbursements to be paid to the Law Society.\nThe amount of the disbursements is to be agreed by the parties, failing which the amount is to\nbe taxed by the Registrar.\n\n\f14th\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-07-09T02:00:31+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jul-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Naidu Priyalatha (Respondent) Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<p><strong>In the Matter of Naidu Priyalatha (Respondent)</strong><br>\n<strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></p>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Ms Wong Siew Lan (<strong>the</strong> <strong>Complainant</strong>).</p>\n<p>The Complainant was an employee and shareholder of a company, which operated a wanton mee stall (<strong>the Company</strong>).

Naidu.\n\n3\n\nAs a consequence of the Complaint, the Law Society brought the following charges\nagainst the Respondent:\n\nCharge\n\nThat you, Naidu Priyalatha, are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the\ndischarge of your professional duty within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of\n2\n\n\fthe Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) to wit, that, on 18 April 2017, despite\nhaving given your solicitor's undertaking not to release a cashier's order for\nthe sum of $26,896.45 made in favour of Balestier Hui Kee Pte Ltd to your\nciients (Ng Kar Kui and Chang Lien Siang) until a comprehensive agreement\nhad been reached between your clients, and Wong Siew Lan and Seah Sai\nHong, in full and final settlement of all issues and claims between them, you\nin breach of your solicitor's undertaking released the said cashier's order to\nyour clients when no such agreement had been reached between your clients,\n\nand Wong Siew Lan and Seah Sai Hong.\n\nAlternative Charge\n\nThat you, Naidu Priyalatha, are guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\n\nhonourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Chapter 161) in that you, on 18 April 2017, despite having\ngiven your solicitor's undertaking not to release a cashier's order for the sum\nof $26,896.45 made in favour of Balestier Hui Kee Pte Ltd to your clients (Ng\nKar Kui and Chang Lien Siang) until a comprehensive agreement had been\nreached between your clients, and Wong Siew Lan and Seah Sai Hong, in full\nand final settiement of all issues and claims between them, you in breach of\nyour solicitor's undertaking released the said cashier's order to your clients\nwhen no such agreement had been reached between your cfients, and Wong\nSiew Lan and Seah Sai Hong.\n\nOn 7 June 2021, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the Charge of grossly improper\nconduct in the discharge of her professional duty within the meaning ofs 83(2)(b) of\n\nthe Legal Profession Act (“the LPA\").\n\n\fAgreed Statement of Facts\n\n5.\n\nThe parties signed an Agreed Statement of Facts on 4 June 2021, which was tendered\nat the hearing on 7 June 2021. The following are the undisputed facts forming the\nbackground to the Charge, as stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts.\n\nThe Complainant, Ng Kar Kui (“Ng\"), and Chang Lien Siang (“Chang\") were the\nshareholders and directors of Balestier Hui Kee Pte Ltd (“the Company”). Ng and\nChang (who were married to each other) each held 30% of the shares of the Company,\nand the Complainant held 40% of the shares of the Company.\n\nSubsequent to the incorporation of the Company, the Complainant was employed by\nthe Company as a cook. The Complainant engaged Seah Sai Hong (\"Seah”)\nas an\n\nassistant to be employed by the Company\n\nFactual Background\n\nThe Company operated a wanton mee stall, and the Complainant and Seah worked at\nthe stall.\n\nInitially, the Company’s cash takings from the stalt were deposited into the Company's\nbank account.\n\nHowever, the Complainant and Seah had a dispute with Ng and Chang. The\nComplainant made allegations that Ng and Chang had issued cheques from the\n\nCompany's bank account without the knowledge or consent of the Complainant. The\n\n\fComplainant stopped depositing the Company's cash takings from the stall into the\nCompany's bank account.\n\nThe Respondent acted for Ng and Chang.\n\nMessrs Linus Law Chambers initially acted for the Complainant and Seah.\n\nBy their without prejudice letter dated 28 February 2017 to the Respondent’s firm,\nMessrs Linus Law Chambers proposed a settlement on behalf of the Complainant and\n\nSeah which included a term that they would pay the cash takings from the stall for the\nperiod 19 December 2016 to 11 February 2017 amounting to the sum of $26,896.45\nby way of a cashier's order in favour of the Company (“the Cashier's Order\"), and\nprovide a detailed statement of accounts for that period.\n\nBy her letter dated 29 March 2017 to Messrs Linus Law Chambers, the Respondent\n\nasked for, inter alia, the Cashier's Order by 6 pm that day, failing which legal action\nwould be commenced.\n\nThe Undertaking\n\nBy their letter dated 29 March 2017 to the Respondent, Messrs Linus Law Chambers\nstated that the Cashier’s Order was being handed over to the Respondent subject to\nan undertaking by the Respcndent not to release the Cashier's Order to her clients\nuntil a comprehensive agreement was reached bythe parties in full and final settlement\n\nof all issues and claims between them (\"the Undertaking”).\n\nIn her letter dated 30 March 2017 to Messrs Linus Law Cambers, the Respondent\nstated that she would not release the cashier's order to her clients. The Undertaking\n5\n\n\fwas given by the Respendent, as the sole proprietor of her firm, in her capacity as\nsolicitor.\n\nOn 24 April 2017, Ng and Chang commenced\n\nlegal proceedings against the\n\nComplainant and Seah in DC/DC 1100/2017 (“the DC Suit”).\n\nOn 2 May 2017, Messrs Allen & Gledhill LLP entered an Appearance for the\n\nComplainant and Seah in the DC Suit.\n\nBreach of Undertaking\n\nBy their letter dated 4 May 2017 to the Respondent, Messrs Allen & Gledhill LLP asked\nfor the return of the Cashier's Order given that Ng and Chang had commenced the\nsaid legal proceedings.\n\nBy her letter dated 9 May 2017 to Messrs Allen & Gledhill, the Respondent stated that\nshe had held the Cashier’s Order until 18 April 2017, and that the Cashier's Order was\nthen deposited by her clients into the Company’s bank account to pay for the\nCompany’s overheads that have fallen due.\n\nThe above release of the Cashier's Order by the Respondent to her clients when there\nwas no comprehensive agreement reached by the parties in full and final settlement of\nall issues and claims between them amounted to a breach of the Undertaking by the\nRespondent.\n\nIt was about 1 year and 7 months later in April 2018 during the Court Dispute\nResolution Process in the State Courts before a District Judge that a settlement was\nreached between the Respondent’s clients and the Complainant and Seah.\n6\n\n\fThe Parties’ Submissions\n\n6.\n\nThe parties filed their respective submissions and further submissions on sanction on\n\n10 June 2021 and 25 June 2021, with both parties taking the position that (a) no cause\nof sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 83 of the LPA, and (b) a penalty\n(or in the alternative a reprimand, as submitted by the Respondent) be imposed in this\ncase.\n\n7s\n\nThe Applicant submits that there is no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\nin this case for the following reasons:\n\na.\n\nThe Cashier's Order, which the Respondent had undertaken not to release to her\n\nclients, did not represent monies that belonged to the Complainant, rather, the monies\nbelonged to the Company. When the Respondent released the Cashier's Order to her\nclients in breach of the Undertaking, the monies were paid to the Company.\n\nb.\n\nReference was made to the Respondent's response submitted to the Inquiry\nCommittee that she was under a lot of pressure from her clients to release the\nCashier's Order to them. There does not appear to be any dishonesty on the part of\nthe Respondent.\n\n[\n\nWhen the Complainant subsequently settled her dispute with the Respondent’s clients,\nit was the Complainant who had to pay a further sum of $18,703 to the Respondent’s\nclients, as agreed.\n\n8.\n\nThe Applicant in its first submissions directed attention to three cases as reference\npoints as to whether the Respondent’s breach of the Undertaking should be regarded\n7\n\n\fas a cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action: Re Lim Kiap Khee, Law Sociely\nof Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee [2001] 2 SLR(R) 398 (“Lim Kiap Kee\"); Law Society of\nSingapore v Tham Kok Leong Thomas [2006] 1 SLR(R) 775 (“Thomas Tham”) and\nLaw Society of Singapore v Chan Chun Hwee Allan {2016} SGDT 3 (“Allan Chan’).\n\nIn Lim Kiap Kee, the respondent solicitor, who acted for the sub-purchaser of a\nproperty, gave an undertaking to hold 13% of the purchase price as stakeholder, and\nto release 8% and 5% of the purchase price to the developer on certain dates. The\nrespondent solicitor failed to release the 8% and the 5% of the purchase price on the\nspecified dates. He released the 8% only after considerable delay and reminders. He\nreleased the 5% only after enforcement action had been taken out by the developer\n(including the institution of bankruptcy proceedings). The disciplinary tribunal found the\n\nthat there was cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action against the respondent\nsolicitor.\n\n10.\n\nIn Thomas Tham, the complainant needed banking facilities to import cars into\nThailand. The complainant approached the respondent solicitor's client, Dr Wang, who\nrepresented a company which could assist opening letters of credit for a fee. The\nparties agreed that the complainant would deposit US$60,000 with the respondent\nsolicitor to be released to Dr Wang's company upon the issue of a letter of credit for\nthe import of cars. The respondent solicitor confirmed to the complainant’s solicitors\nthat his law firm would hold the US$60,000 and release it only when the letter of credit\nwas issued. After the sum was deposited with the company, Dr Wang requested that\nthe respondent solicitor release US$54,000 to him that very same day. The respondent\n\nsolicitor relented on the condition that Dr Wang give him a personal cheque for\nUS$54,000 and an indemnity in favour of the respondent solicitor's law firm.\nSubsequently, the respondent solicitor released the remaining US$6,000 to Dr Wang\nwith a similar requirement ofa cheque and indemnity from Dr Wang. The respondent\n8\n\n\fsolicitor had breached his undertaking by releasing the US$54,000 and USS6,000 to\nDr Wang. The disciplinary tribunal found that there was cause of sufficient gravity for\ndisciplinary action.\n\n1.\n\nIn contrast, in Alfan Chan, the disciplinary tribunal found that the breach cof undertaking\nby the respondent solicitor was not cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action. In\nAltan Chan, the respondent solicitor provided undertakings to the complainant to\nprovide security for costs in the total sum of $35,000 in an appeal, when his client had\nnot put him in funds. His client thereafter changed lawyers and withdrew the appeal\nThe Court ordered his former client to pay costs of $30,000 to the complainant. The\nrespondent solicitor only paid costs of $5,000. After the complaint was made, the\nrespondent paid the balance $25,000 with interest before the matter came up for\n\nhearing at the inquiry committee; an investigation by the disciplinary tribunal later\nensued. The disciplinary tribunal found the respondent solicitor guilty of grossly\nimproper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within the meaning of s\n83(2)(b) of the LPA for his breach of undertaking, but determined that tnere was no\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action; the respondent solicitor was ordered\n\nto pay a penalty of $15,000 and costs of $5,000 .\n\n12\n\nThe Applicant in its further submissions referred to another instance where the\ndisciplinary tribunal had found that a breach of undertaking by a respondent solicitor\nwas not cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action. In Law Society of Singapore\nv Shanmugam [1988] SGDSC 14 (“Shanmugam”), the complainant complained that\nthe respondent solicitor did not pay him $2,500 that he had deposited with the\nrespondent salicitor. The respondent solicitor had given a written undertaking to the\nchairman of the inquiry committee that he would pay the $2,500 tc the complainant.\nAs a result of the undertaking, the inquiry committee reported to the Council that the\ncomplaint did not merit formal investigation by a disciplinary tribunal. The respondent\n9\n\n\fsolicitor however breached his undertaking and did not pay the complainant tilt after a\n\ncomplaint by the Law Society for the respondent solicitor’s breach of undertaking was\nbefore the disciplinary tribunal.\n\n13.\n\nThe respondent solicitor explained that he had taken steps to pay the $2,500. He was\nresident in London and had asked Ms Irene Tan who was resident in Singapore and\nwas holding some monies for the respondent solicitor to pay the $2,500 on his behalf.\nMs Tan however had a nervous breakdown and did not make the payment. The\nrespondent solicitor did not receive notice of the Law Society's complaint of his breach\nof undertaking till after it had been referred to the disciplinary tribunal for investigation;\nhe made payment thereafter.\n\n14.\n\nThe Applicant in essence submits that the Respondent's breach of the Undertaking is\nless serious than the breaches in Lim Kiap Kee and Thomas Tham, and she is less\n\nculpable than the respondent solicitors in those two cases. In the two cases, the\nmonies that the respondent solicitors held belonged to the complainants. In the present\ncase, the cashier's order that the Respondent held did not represent monies that\nbelonged to the Complainant; rather they belonged to the Company. When the\nRespondent released the cashier’'s order to her clients in breach of her undertaking,\nthe monies were paid to the Company.\n\n15.\n\nThe Applicant therefore submits that the Respondent should be ordered to pay a\npenalty of $15,000 and costs of $6,000 (inclusive of disbursements) to the Applicant.\nThe Applicant appears to be using Allan Chan as a reference point: there the penalty\n\nwas stated as $15,000 and costs of $5,000 {inclusive of disbursements).\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent’'s reasons for her submission that there is no cause for sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action in her case are as follows:\n10\n\n\fThe breach of the Undertaking was not deliberate. It was essentially a bare breach or\na technical breach, which did not cause \"any turmoil in anyone [sic] lives, the standing\nof the Law Society, or that of the Bar or that of anyone of us”.\n\nThe Respondent contended that in determining whether there has been a breach of\nundertaking the court will put itself in the position of the parties in the exact\ncircumstances at the time the undertaking was given and accepted.\n\nIn this regard, the Cashier's Order which was the subject of the Undertaking was made\nin favour of the Company, and not the Respondent or her firm. There was “no\nprolonged delay of any sort\". The delay was that of the Complainant in levying the\nComplaint.\n\nThe Respondent did not benefit from the funds as these belonged to the Company.\nThere was no loss suffered by anyone.\n\nAlthough the Cashier's Order was not to be released until a comprehensive settlement\nwas reached by the parties, no settlement was forthcoming. “... [W]hat other alternative\n\ndoes the Respondent have but to give the [cashier's order to her clients] since the very\npurpose of the undertaking was to have a meeting for a ‘comprehensive agreement’\nthat was never achieved given ... the Complainant was prevaricating”.\n\nWhen Allen & Gledhill LLP wrote to the Respondent on 4 May 2017 for the return of\nthe Cashier's Order, the Respondent replied in writing on 9 May 2017 stating that the\nCashier's Order had since been deposited into the Company’s bank account. There\nwas no surreptitiousness in this case, unlike the facts of Thomas Tham.\n\n\fThe performance of the Undertaking by the Respondent was impossible as the\nCashier's Order had already been deposited into the Company's bank account.\n\nThe Respondent's conduct in releasing the Cashier's Order was not so egregious as\nto bring dishonour to the profession. Her conduct was also not such that it lacked the\nqualities of character and trustworthiness which are necessary attributes of a person\nentrusted with the responsibilities of\na legal practitioner.\n\nThe Respondent, like the Applicant, referred to Allan Chan, as a reference point, and\n\ncontended that there was no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action.\n\nThe Respondent in her further submission also referred to Shanmugam and contended\nthat as in the case of Shanmugam, there was no dishonesty on the part of the\nRespondent in her breach of the Undertaking.\n\nThe Tribunal’s Determination\n\n17.\n\nA solicitor's word is her bond; all the more so when the solicitor gives a formal\nundertaking.\n\n18.\n\nAs the Court of Three Judges in Lim Kiap Khee made clear at [21]: “..It is of utmost\nimportance that a solicitor should abide by the undertaking he formally gives. It is the\nvery foundation of an honourable profession that its members act honourably. To\ndeliberately breach an undertaking solemnly given would seriously undermine the\nintegrity of the profession and bring it into disrepute...\"\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Thomas Tham at [29] repeated the above passage from\nLim Kiap Kee.\n\n12\n\n\f20.\n\nIn determining whether there is sufficient cause for disciplinary action, the evidence\nbefore us was confined to the Agreed Statement of facts. Although the parties had filed\nAffidavits of Evidence-in-Chief, they were not admitted in evidence\n\n21.\n\nOn the evidence before us, the Respondent gave the Undertaking in the context of\nfacilitating the resolution of the dispute between her clients on the one hand, and the\n\nComptainant and Seah on the other.\n\n22,\n\nThe Complainant and Seah did not want to deposit the cash takings of $26,896.45\nearned from the stall into the Company’s bank account as they alleged that the\nRespondent’s clients were issuing cheques from the Company's bank account without\nthe knowledge or consent of the Complainant.\n\nThe Respondent held the Cashier's\n\nOrder, which embodied the cash takings of $26,896.45, as a stakeholder; she was not\nto release the Cashier's Order to her clients until a comprehensive settlement had been\nreached by the parties.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent however released the Cashier's Order to her clients on 18 April 2017,\n\nand her clients deposited it into the Company’s bank account to pay for the Company’s\noverheads that had fallen due.\n\n24,\n\nThe Respondent admits that the release of the Cashier's Order by her when there was\nno comprehensive agreement reached by the parties in full and settlement of all the\n\nissues and claims between them amounts to a breach of the Undertaking by her.\n\n25.\n\nWe accept that the Respondent did not act dishonestly when she breached the\nUndertaking. She was forthright in telling Allen & Gledhill, when they requested the\nreturn of the Cashier's Order, that she had released the Cashier's Order to her clients.\n\n13\n\n\fThe Respondent did not benefit personally from her reiease of the Cashier’s Order: it\nwas made out in the name of the Company and deposited into the Company's bank\naccount.\n\n26.\n\nWe do not accept the Respondent’s submission that her breach of undertaking was\n\nnot defiberate. The Agreed Statement of Facts do not refer to any uncertainty on the\npart of the Respondent, or any dispute by her as to the meaning of the Undertaking.\nHer handing over the Cashier's Order to her clients was a deliberate act, as opposed\n\nto an accidental or inadvertent act.\n\n27.\n\nWe also do not accept the Respondent's submission that any breach was a bare or\ntechnical breach as there was no settlement forthcoming, and she had no alternative\nbut to give the Cashier's Order to her clients as the purpose of the Undertaking to have\na meeting for the comprehensive agreement, was not achieved.\n\n28.\n\nFirst, it is not correct that the Respondent had no alternative but to give the Cashier's\n\nOrder to her clients. She could have continued to hold on to the Cashier's Order to\nmaintain the contemplated platform for the parties to resolve their disputes, or she\ncould have simply retumed the Cashier's Order to Messrs Linus Law Chambers.\nInstead, she chose to release the Cashier's Order to her clients on 18 April 2017, less\n\nthan a month after the Cashier's Order had been given to her.\n\n29.\n\nSecondly, of the alternatives she had, the choice to release the Cashier's Order to her\nclients was not open to her; the very purpose of the Undertaking was to ensure that\n\nthe Respondent would not release the Cashier's Order to her clients if there was no\ncomprehensive agreement.\n\n\f30.\n\nWe further do not accept the Respondent’s submission that it was impossible for her\n\nto perform the Undertaking as the Cashier's Order had already been deposited into\nthe Company’s bank account. With respect, this submission has no merit whatsoever\n\nSuch impossibility was created by the Respondent's act of handing over the Cashier's\nOrder to her clients in breach of the Undertaking.\n\n31.\n\nWe now address the submission made by both the Applicant and the Respondent that\nin the present case no loss was suffered by the breach of the Undertaking as the\nCashier's Order did not represent monies that belonged to the Complainant (or Seah);\nrather the monies belonged to the Company, and the monies were paid into the\n\nCompany's bank account. The Applicant also submitted that when the parties finally\nagreed to a settlement, it was the Complainant who had to pay a further sum of $18,703\nto the Respondent's clients.\n\n32.\n\nIn our view, the fact that Cashier's Order did not represent monies that belonged to the\nComplainant or Seah is not central to the culpability of the Respondent’s breach of the\nUndertaking. The dispute among the parties was whether the Respendent’s clients\nwere entitled to issue cheques from the Company's bank account without the\nComplainant’s knowledge or consent. The Complainant and Seah accordingly cid not\n\nwant to deposit the cash takings of $26,896.45 into the Company’s bark account until\nthere was a comprehensive agreement of all issues and claims between them and the\nRespondent's clients. The Undertaking therefore requirec the Respondent to hold the\nCashier's Order which embodied the $26,896.45 as stakeholder. By breaching the\nUndertaking, the Respondent facilitated her clients paying the $26,896.45 into the\nCompany’s bank account which was precisely what the Complainant and Seah had\nobjected to in the absence of a resolution of the disputes.\n\n15\n\n\f33.\n\nSave that a settlement among the parties was reached during the Court Dispute\nResolution Process in the State Courts before the District Judge in April 2018 — about\na year after proceedings were started — no details of the settlement were provided in\nthe Agreed Statement of Facts. We however take into consideration the Applicant’s\nadmission in its submissions that at the settlement, the Complainant agreed to pay the\nRespondents $18,703. The context of the negotiations which led to the settlement in\n2018 has however changed from the context of any negotiations in 2017 when the\n$26,896.45 had not been paid into the Company’s bank account. Any settlement may\nwell have taken a different form or contained different terms if the Cashier's Order had\nnot been released by the Respondent in breach of the Undertaking.\n\n34.\n\nThe Complainant had entrusted the Respondent to hold on to the Cashier's Order in\naccordance with the Undertaking. However, the Complainant lost any benefit she may\nhave had in being able to negotiate a settlement while the Cashier's Order remained\nunbanked into the Company's bank account when the Respondent breached the\nUndertaking.\n\n35.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Lim Kiap Kee at [28] drew a distinction between a breach\nthat was an oversight and one that was deliberate. In our view, the Respondent in the\npresent case had deliberately breached the Undertaking.\n\n36.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Thomas Tham made clear that even in that case where\nthe respondent solicitor did not intend to benefit personally from a breach of\nundertaking but wanted to facilitate the performance of the transaction (at [32]), it\ncannot be lost sight of that the respondent solicitor “had disregarded the trust reposed\nin him” by the party to whom he had given his undertaking (at [29]).\n\n16\n\n\f37.\n\nAlthough the Applicant and the Respondent invited us to draw similarities between the\n\npresent case and Allan Chan, and Shanmugam (especially the former), in our view\nboth cases can be distinguished from the present case.\n\n38.\n\nIn Aflan Chan the respondent solicitor had furnished an undertaking for security for\ncosts for an appeal to prevent his erstwhile client's case from being struck out by an\nunless order as the client was overseas at the time, on the faith of his client’'s promise\n\nto put him in funds in due course (at [13]). He has given his undertaking due to the\nurgency of the appeal timeline. There was no such urgency or Court deadline to meet\nin the present case.\n\n39\n\nThe respondent solicitor had ultimately made good on his undertaking by paying the\n\ncomplainant with interest (at [6(8)] and [16]), and the Complainant was prepared to\nwithdraw her complaint (at [18]). The Respondent in the present case has not made\ngood on the Undertaking, and indeed cannot make good on the Undertaking because,\nby her own act of handing over the Cashier's Order to her clients in breach of the\nUndertaking, she has rendered any compliance by her with the Undertaking impossible.\n\n40.\n\nThe Disciplinary Tribunal in Alian Chan found that the respondent solicitor had through\nhis own misjudgement or foolishness extended his undertaking on costs without first\nsecuring from his client the funds necessary to make good on the undertaking in the\nevent it was called on. He was unfortunately placed in a position where he was obliged\nto honour his undertaking without any assurance of repayment from his client (at [29]).\nThis is not the case in the present matter: there is nothing in the Agreed Statement of\nFacts or any assertion by the Respondent that she had breached the Undertaking out\nof misjudgement or foolishness.\n\nit/\n\n\f41,\n\nAs for Shanmugam, the respondent solicitor had taken steps to pay the $2,500 he had\nundertaken to pay,\n\nbut the amount\n\nremained\n\nunpaid\n\nbecause of unexpected\n\nintervening circumstances; he did eventually make good his undertaking and paid the\namount. In the present case, the Respondent has not taken any step to make good\nthe Undertaking, because, as stated previously, by her own act of handing over the\nCashier's Order to her clients in breach of the Undertaking, she rendered compliance\nof the Undertaking by her impossible.\n\n42,\n\nIt bears repeating that it is the foundation of an honourable profession that a member\n\nabides by her undertaking. A deliberate breach by a member will seriously undermine\nthe integrity of the profession.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent was entrusted to hold on to the Cashier's Order in accordance with\nthe Undertaking. She disregarded the trust reposed in her as she breached the\nUndertaking.\n\n44.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, notwithstanding the submissions of the\n\nApplicant and the Respondent to the contrary, we find that on the scale of culpability,\nthere is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA in\nrelation to the Charge.\n\nConclusion\n\n45,\n\nFor the reasons set out above, and based on the Respondent's acceptance that she\nis guilty of the Charge, the Tribunal determines, pursuant to s 93(1)(c) of the LPA, that\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 83 of the LPA.\n\n18\n\n\f1 October 2021\n\n\f\f","timestamp":"2022-07-09T02:00:31+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jul-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Zheng Shengyang Harry (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-zheng-shengyang-harry-respondent-advocate-solicitor\">In the Matter of Zheng Shengyang Harry (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from a complaint lodged by one Lee Kuan Fung (<strong>Complainant</strong>).

The\nRespondent solicitor is Zheng Shengyang, Harry (NRIC No. SXXXX809G)\n(the “Respondent’), an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore. He was called to the Singapore Bar in 2015.\"\n\n2.\n\nThe primary facts in this matter are not in dispute. We must commend both\ncounsel for the Law Society and counsel for the Respondent for the\nfocussed, concise and fair manner in which they conducted their respective\ncases. This has greatly assisted us in dealing with the issues in this case.\n\nBackground Facts to the Complaint\n\n3.\n\nThe complainant, Lee Kuan Fung (the “Complainant”), is an individual\nresident in a Housing Development Board flat at 18 Joo Seng Road, #08-\n\n159, Singapore 360018 (the “Complainant’s Flat\").?\n\n4.\n\nOn or about 7 October 2020, the Respondent's law firm, Ark Law\nCorporation, issued a letter (the “7 October Letter’) to the Complainant\nand Chua Chim Kang.® The 7 October Letter contained:\n\n(1M\n\nthe Complainant’s name and address;\n\n(2)\n\nChua Chim Kang’s name and address; and\n\n1 Statement of Case at [1] and Defence (Amendment No. 1) at [2]\n2 Statement of Case at [2] and Defence (Amendment No. 1) at [3]\n3 Statement of Case at [3] and Defence (Amendment No. 1) at [5]\n2\n\n\f(3)\n\ninformation relating to the company known as Homing Holdings Pte\nLtd (a company ostensibly incorporated for the purposes of a joint\nventure between the Respondent’s client, the Complainant and\nChua Chim Kang), and the dispute between the Respondent’s\nclient, the Complainant and Chua Chim Kang.\n\n5.\n\nOn 7 October 2020 at 1218h, the Respondent sent a copy of the 7 October\nLetter to the Complainant, as an attachment to an email from the\nRespondent to the Complainant (the “Respondent’s Email”).*\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent also caused a process server to attempt to serve the 7\nOctober Letter on the Complainant personally, at the Complainant’s Flat, on\n7 October 2020 at 1959h. The process server was informed that the\nComplainant was not around.\n\n7.\n\nOn 7 October 2020 at 2115h, the Complainant acknowledged receipt of\nRespondent’'s Email by way of an email from the Complainant to the\n\nRespondent.®\n\n8.\n\nAlthough the Complainant had, by this time, acknowledged receipt of the\nRespondent’s Email:\n\nM\n\nThe Respondent caused a process server to make a second\nattempt to serve the 7 October Letter on the Complainant\npersonally, at the Complainant’s Flat, on 8 October 2020 at 1958h.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Respondent instructed a process server to, on 9 October 2020\n\n4 Statement of Case at [4] and Defence (Amendment No. 1) at [8]\n5 Statement of Case at [6] and Defence (Amendment No. 1) at [9]\n3\n\n\fat 1937h, to post the 7 October Letter on the main door of the\n\nComplainant’s Flat. Upon the instruction, the 7 October Letter was\npasted, without an envelope on the wall beside the main door. .5\n\n9.\n\nThe Complainant lodged a complaint against the Respondent dated 29\nOctober 2020 (the “Complaint”). The Complaint states (amongst other\nthings) that the conduct of the Respondent, in exposing the 7 October Letter\nto the public, caused the Complainant to feel humiliated, disturbed,\nannoyed and intimidated.\n\nThe Charge\n\n10.\n\nThe Law Society formulated the following charge against the Respondent:\n\nCHARGE\nThat you, Zheng Shengyang, Harry (NRIC No. SXXXX809G), of Ark Law\nCorporation of 6 Shenton Way #22-08, OUE Downtown 2, Singapore\n068809, are charged that you, on or about 9 October 2020, did cause a\n\nletter of demand, addressed to one Lee Kuan Fung and one Chua Chim\nKang prepared by Ark Law Corporation on behalf of its client, to be openly\nposted at 7:37 pm on 9 October 2020, on a wall beside the main door of\n\nthe said Lee Kuan Fung’s flat at 18 Joo Seng Road, #08-159, Singapore\n360018, in plain view of the public, when you knew or ought to have known\nthat there was no necessity or legal basis to do so, and have acted towards\n\n6 Statement of Case at [7] and Defence (Amendment No. 1) at [10]\n4\n\n\fLee Kuan Fung in a way which is contrary to your position as a member of an\nhonourable profession in breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015, and you are thereby guilty of such\nmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as a member of an honourable\nprofession under Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161).\n(The Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015, shall hereinafter be\nreferred to as “the PCR” and the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161) shall\nhereinafter be referred to as “the LPA\".)\n\n11.\n\nThe Law Society identified the factual and legal elements that it had to prove\nas follows:\n\n(i)\n\nThat the 7 October Letter was a Letter of Demand;\n\n(i)\n\nThat it had been openly posted in plain view of the public;\n\n(iii)\n\nThat the Respondent knew or ought to have known that there was no\n\nnecessity or legal basis to do so;\n\n(iv)\n\nThat the Respondent had acted towards the Complainant in a way that\nwas contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession in\nbreach of Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR; and\n\nwas therefore guilty of misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as a\nmember of an honourable profession under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.”\n\n7 Law Society Closing Submissions (“‘LSCS\") at [4]\n\n\f12.\n\nThe Respondent has defined the elements in a similar way, with the added\nsubmission that the mens rea element was the intention of the Respondent in\nposting the 7 October Letter in plain view of the public when he knew that there\nwas no necessity or legal basis to do s0.2 We note that neither the charge nor\n\nthe mens rea that the Respondent has distilled from the charge has specifically\nset out an intention to cause embarrassment or harm or the knowledge of the\npossibility of embarrassment or harm to the Complainant as an ingredient.\nHowever, the intention to post in plain public view is accepted by the Law Society\nand the Respondent as the necessary mental element in the charge.\n\n13.\n\nIt is trite law and there is no dispute between the parties that the burden of proof\nrested with the Law Society and that the standard of proof for factual issues was\nproof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe Contentions of the Parties\n\n14.\n\nIn summary, the Law Society’s position was as follows, namely that:\n\n(i)\n\nThe 7 October Letter was clearly a letter of demand because it set out\nallegations, required the addressees to carry out certain actions and\nthreatened legal proceedings if there was no compliance.®\n\n(i)\n\nThe 7 October Letter was openly posted in plain view of the public in that\nit was taped to a wall (without an envelope) beside the main door of the\n\nComplainant.™\n\n8 Respondent’s Closing Submissions (‘RCS”) at [4]\n9LSCS at [5] to [9]\n0| SCS at [10] to [13]\n\n\f(iii)\n\nThere was no factual necessity to deliver the physical copy by posting,\nespecially as the Complainant had already acknowledged receipt of a\n\ncopy sent by e-mail.\"\n\n(iv)\n\nThere was no legal basis to serve by posting and that there was no law\npermitting such posting. In this regard, the Law Society accepts that the\nabsence of a legal basis or a law permitting posting would not make\nposting of a letter of demand, in itself, a breach of the PCR; however, the\n\nLaw Society asserts that such absence will constitute a breach in the\nparticular circumstances of the present case.'?\n\n15.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent’s position is as follows, namely that:\n\n(i)\n\nThe 7 October Letter was not a letter of demand, but a proposal for\nsettlement.’?\n\n(ii)\n\nAlthough the 7 October Letter was posted openly, there was no harm to\nthe Complainant and that the complaint did not arise from a genuine\ngrievance but was motivated by the Complainant to get back at the\nRespondent for his actions in acting for his client (the counter party to\n\nthe Complainant).'*\n\n(i)\n\nThere was no evidence of harm to the Complainant.®\n\n1 LSCS at [14] to [17]\n12 LSCS at [18] to [26]\n13 RCS [12] to [15]\n14 RCS [17] to [19]\n15 RCS [21]\n\n\f(iv)\n\nThe Respondent had no intention to expose the 7 October Letter\n\npublicly.'®\n\n(v)\n\nThe Law Society has not proved that there was no necessity or legal\n\nbasis to post the 7 October Letter.\"”\n\n(vi)\n\nOn the facts, there was no breach of the PCR which amounted to conduct\n\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor.\n\nFactual Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal\n\n16.\n\nSome of the issues in this matter can be determined easily, while others are\ncertainly more nuanced. This is particularly so as both Rule 8 (3) (b) of the PCR\nand section 83(2)(h) of the LPA do not precisely set out the types of elements of\nthe behaviour that is to be sanctioned. In this regard, both counsels have very\n\nhelpfully set out the authorities and commentaries, which will be considered in\ndetail further below. The state of mind of the Respondent is also an important\nissue in this case.\n\n17.\n\nWe shall deal with the factual issues first. We find as follows:\n\n(i)\n\nThe question of whether the 7 October Letter'® is or is not a letter of\ndemand can and should be determined from an examination of the 7\n\nOctober Letter itself and from its contents. We find that it is clearly a letter\n\n16 RCS [27] to [30]\n7 RCS [35] to [41]\n18 The 7 October Letter is exhibited at pages 34 to 38 of the Complainant’s affidavit\n\n\fof demand as it requires action on the part of addressee and threatens\nlegal proceedings as a consequence of failure to take the action\ndemanded. The 7 October Letter sets out the alleged breaches, the\nassertion of a right to wind up the company in question and the proposed\nrelief of a buy out, which is the statutorily provided alternative relief to a\nwinding up. All letters of demand, if complied with, will resolve matters\nand the distinction that the Respondent has attempted to make, between\na letter of demand and an attempt to settle, in this case, is somewhat\nfarfetched. In this regard, we also note that the 7 October Letter was not\n\nmarked “Without Prejudice” and the intention of service was to use the\nfact of service and delivery in subsequent proceedings.\n\n(i)\n\nDuring the hearing, some attempts were made by the Respondent to\nshow that the posting was not in a public place as the main door of the\nComplainant’s flat was not in a common corridor, but in a stairwell with\n\njust two units. We accept the factual assertions made, that is that the\nComplainant’s flat was in a stairwell with only one other unit at that level.\nHowever, we find that the posting was in a public place as the stairwell\nwas open to and intended for public access, not just to the opposite unit\nbut also to members of the public using that set of stairs.\n\n(iii)\n\nThe Complainant gave evidence that she was distressed and humiliated\nand embarrassed' However, we accept the Respondent’s submissions\nthat the harm done, if any, was limited by the location of the main door\nin a stairwell and we accept that there is no evidence that the openly\nposted 7 October Letter was actually seen by any member of the public\n\n19 Complainant’s affidavit at [20], [21] and [23]\n\n\for even the Complainant’s family members.?° Whether this goes towards\nculpability in the context of an adverse finding of guilt on the charge itself,\nor towards culpability and harm in relation to the appropriate sanction if\nthe Respondent is found guilty, is dealt with further below. In this regard,\nit is apposite to note that the Respondent, at the time he gave\ninstructions, did not know the precise location of the unit and main door,\nand how “public” that location was.\n\n(iv)\n\nOn the questions of necessity to post, the legal basis for posting, if any,\nand whether the law permitted such posting, we find that there is no legal\nrequirement for posting the 7 October Letter, even if the fact of delivery\nof the letter was to be relied upon in subsequent proceedings. The 7\nOctober Letter was not an originating process or statutory notice. It is\nnoted that while there was no legal requirement to post, and there is no\nlaw expressly permitting such posting, the Law Society did not adduce\nevidence or make submissions that such a posting is prohibited. In any\nevent, we find the question of whether there was a legal basis or law\npermitting such posting to be a moot point in the present case. If posting\nwas required, which it was not, that would be a defence. If posting was\nprohibited, which it was not, that would make out the Law Society’s case.\nThe real issue is whether the posting on the wall in the factual\ncircumstances of this case breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR and\nwhether such breach amounted to conduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor contrary to section 83(2)((h) of the LPA.\n\n20 RCS at [21], [23] and [24]\n\n10\n\n\fPeripheral Issue\n18.\n\nThe Respondent has made extensive submissions that the Law Society had put\na case beyond what is set out in the Charge and in the Statement of Case. The\nRespondent submits?', with relevant and well-researched authorities, that a\nconviction on a basis other than the Charge and Statement of Case should not\nbe allowed. We accept the legal principles put forward by the Respondent as\ncorrect and applicable.\n\n19.\n\nHowever, we do not find that the four iterations in relation to the Respondent’s\n\nstate of mind that was put to him by counsel for the Law Society go beyond the\nCharge or Statement of Case. They were questions put in cross-examination to\ntest the state of mind of the Respondent to ascertain his intentions in giving\ninstructions for the 7 October Letter to be posted. We note that the Respondent\n\ndenied each of the four iterations put to him. We are mindful that the Law\nSociety’s case in the Charge and in the Statement of Case is pitched at the lower\nlevel of culpability, in that the intention to openly post the 7 October Letter in\npublic view is in itself sufficient to make out the offence, because the Law Society\n\nhas taken the position that the gravamen of the charge is the unfairness to the\nComplainant by the public posting of the 7 October Letter.?\n\nAnalysis of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA and Rule 8(3)(b) the PCR\n\n20.\n\nSection 83(2) of the LPA sets out the conduct and acts that render an advocate\nand solicitor liable for the sanctions set out in section 83(1) of the LPA. Specific\nreference to breaches of the PCR is made in section 83(2)(b) of the LPA where\nsuch breach amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\n\n21 RCS [5] to [11]\n\n22 |_SCS [38] and [39]\n\n11\n\n\fsolicitor. However, this is not the section that the Respondent is being dealt with.\n\nThe Charge is pursuant to section 83(2)(h) of the LPA under which the charge\nis made out if the Respondent has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court of member of an\nhonourable position. Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA does not make reference to a\nbreach of the PCR.\n\n21.\n\nCounsel for the Law Society and the Respondent made extensive submissions\non the application of the test laid out in section 83(2)(h) of the LPA. We do not\nneed to consider these submissions extensively as both counsel submitted that\nthe test is the test laid down by the Court of Three Judges in Wong Sin Yee.?®\nWe set out the test:\n\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA is broader than section 83(2)(b). It is a ‘catch all\nprovision’ operating when a solicitor’s conduct does not fall within any of the\nother subsections of s 83(2) but is nonetheless considered unacceptable (Law\nSociety of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2001] 1 SLR(R) 466 (“Ng Chee Sing”) at\n[40]). The standard of ‘unbefitting conduct’ is less strict, and a solicitor only\nneeds to be shown to have been guilty of such conduct as would render him\nunfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession. As a practical guide,\nit may be asked whether reasonable people, on hearing what the solicitor had\ndone, would have said without hesitation that as a solicitor he should not have\n\ndone it. (Ng Chee Sing at [41], citing Wong Kok Chin v Singapore Society of\nAccountants [1989] 2 SLR (R) 633 at [17]). It is sufficient that if his misconduct\nbrings him discredit as a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a\nwhole.\n\n23[2018] 5 SLR 1216at [24] cited by Law Society at LSCS at [44] and by the Respondent at RCS at\n\n(61]\n\n12\n\n\f22.\n\nAt first blush, the first part of the test set out by the Court of Three Judges\nappears to set a very high bar for section 83(2)(h) of the LPA to be made out that the conduct renders the advocate and solicitor unfit to remain as a member\nof an honourable profession, suggesting conduct so reprehensible that striking\nout may be called for. However, the Court of Three Judges had described a\n\nbreach of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA as being less serious than breaches of\nother sub-sections of section 83(2) of the LPA. In the latter part of the passage\ncited and set out above, the Court of 3 Judges has given us the practical test,\nwhich we will apply. The practical test has two elements. The first is whether\nreasonable people, on hearing what the solicitor had done, would have said\nwithout hesitation that as a solicitor he should not have done it. The second\n\nelement is whether his misconduct brings him discredit as a lawyer or brings\ndiscredit to the legal profession as a whole. (emphasis added)\n\n23.\n\nWe note that the charge is not one pursuant to section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, even\nthough that sub-section specifically refers to breaches of the PCR. We note that\nsection 83(2)(b) of the LPA does not sanction every breach of the PCR, but only\nsuch breaches which amount to improper conduct or practice. By not proceeding\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, the Law Society has pitched the alleged\nbreach in this case at the lower level of culpability of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA,\nthat is of unbefitting conduct, rather than a breach of a higher level of culpability\nthat is improper conduct or practice.\n\n24,\n\nOne issue that has not been raised by parties, but which we address for\ncompleteness, is whether a breach of the PCR can be dealt with under section\n83(2)(h) of the LPA, where the PCR is not expressly mentioned, even though\nsuch breaches are expressly addressed under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA. We\n\n13\n\n\fare of the view that section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, as a catch-all clause, would\ncover PCR breaches that show unbefitting behaviour which does not amount to\nimproper conduct or practice. We are mindful that the Law Society has chosen,\nin the Charge and in the Statement of case to narrowly state the unbefitting\nbehaviour to be the breach of a specific rule, that is Rule 8(3) of the PCR.\nAccordingly, in considering whether the Respondent’s conduct is unbefitting, we\nwill not consider whether it is unbefitting conduct even if the specific rule is not\nbreached.\n\n25.\n\nFollowing upon the above analysis, the Law Society has to satisfy us that:\n\n(a) On the facts, the Respondent breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR.\n\n(b) On the facts, the breach is such that reasonable people, on hearing what the\nRespondent had done, would have said without hesitation that as a solicitor\nhe should not have done it, and that his conduct had brought him discredit\nas a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a whole.\n\n26.\n\nWe now consider Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR. The starting point is the general\nguiding principles set out in Rule 4 that apply to the entire PCR. We set out the\nsalient portions of Rule 4:\n(c) A legal practitioner has a duty to discharge honourably and with integrity all\nof the legal practitioner’s responsibilities to any tribunal before which the\nlegal practitioner appears, the legal practitioner’s clients, the public and other\nmembers of the legal profession.\n\n(f) A legal practitioner must be fair and courteous towards every person in\nrespect of the legal practitioner’s professional conduct.\n\n14\n\n\f27.\n\nRule 8 of the PCR sets out a further set of guiding principles, specific to Rule 8.\nThe salient portions are:\n(a) A legal practitioner who deals with any person must, regardless of whether\nthat person is involved in any matter with which the legal practitioner is\nconcerned, be honest and courteous, and behave in a manner befitting the\n\nlegal practitioner’s professional standing.\n\n(b) ...\n\n28.\n\nRule 8(3)(b) provides that:\n3) A legal practitioner\n—\n(a) ...\n(b) must not act towards any person in a way which is fraudulent, deceitful or\notherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as a member of an honourable\nprofession.\n\nDetermination\n\n29.\n\nWe now frame the question that we need to address:\n\nWas the Respondent’s conduct in giving instructions to post the 7 October\nLetter openly in public view contrary to his position as a member of an\nhonourable profession such that that reasonable people, on hearing what the\nRespondent had done, would have said without hesitation that as a solicitor\n\nhe should not have done it, and that his conduct had brought him discredit\nas a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a whole.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted that the meaning of “otherwise contrary to the legal\n\n15\n\n\fpractitioner’'s position as a member of an honourable profession” should be\ninterpreted in the context of the earlier words, that refer to fraudulent or deceitful\n\nconduct.?* On this argument, a breach is only constituted if the extent of departure\nfrom the practitioner's position as a member of an honourable position is akin to\nfraudulent or deceitful conduct.\n\n31.\n\nThe Law Society has submitted that the guiding principles in Rule 4 and Rule 8(1)\nof the PCR should be applied in interpreting Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR, citing\nextensively from the commentary by Pinsler.?® The Law Society has also cited the\ncase of Law Society v Seow Theng Beng Samuel where physical and verbal\nabuse amounted to a breach of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA and the case of Law\nSociety v Carolyn Tan-Au, where exerting unfair pressure by failing to consider\nthe ethical propriety of her conduct resulted in the advocate and solicitor being\n\nreprimanded.?®\n\n32.\n\nWe are of the view that an interpretation of the phrase “contrary to the legal\npractitioner’s position as a member of an honourable profession” in Rule 8(3)(b) of\nthe PCR does not require a finding of culpability akin to fraud or deceit,\nnotwithstanding the use of these words in the earlier part of the Rule. Such an\napproach will be inconsistent with both the general guiding principles in Rule 4 of\nthe PCR and the specific guiding principles in Rule 8(1) of the PCR. Further, the\nspecific use of the words “or otherwise contrary” clearly intend to indicate a\ndeparture from the earlier parts of the rule and to distinguish this third limb from the\nearlier limbs of fraud and deceit.\n\n24 RCS at [44] to [49]\n25 | SCS at [29] and [30]\n\n26| SCS at [32] and [36]\n\n16\n\n\f33.\n\nThe Law Society has submitted that the gravamen of the Charge is unfairness to\nthe Complainant in that unfair pressure was being brought to bear upon her, and\nthat this was sufficient to make out the charge. We find that the instruction to post\nthe 7 October Letter would have the effect of putting unfair pressure on the\nComplainant, whether this was intended or otherwise. However, this in itself does\nnot dispose of the matter. It is a necessary condition, given the reliance on Rule\n8(3)(b) of the PCR, but it is not sufficient in itself. The test set out for a breach of\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA must also be satisfied.\n\n34.\n\nThe crucial argument upon which the Respondent has rested his case is the failure\nof the Law Society to show that he had the intention to be unfair to the Complainant\nor to embarrass her. The Respondent’s evidence is that he did not think of the\nconsequences of giving the instruction to post and that his omission is one of simple\nneglect. The crux of the argument is that a mistake does not bring discredit to the\nprofession and therefore cannot be misconduct.?” The Respondent submits that in\nthe present case, his instruction to post the 7 October Letter arose from his failure\nto apply his mind to the issue of whether the 7 October Letter was placed in an\nenvelope, stating “if | had applied my mind to it if | had thought about it, | would not\nhave posted it openly because for me it's not regular to send letters without an\nenvelope ... “. The short point made by the Respondent is that he made an\nunthinking mistake and that not all mistakes amount to professional misconduct.\nThe Respondent submits that the current situation is akin to simple negligence and\nrelies on the Law Society v Iskander bin Rahmat?® for the proposition that simple\nnegligence or want of skill does not amount to misconduct under section 83(2) of\nthe LPA.2®\n\n27 RCS at [63]\n28 |skandar bin Rahmat v Law Society of Singapore [2021] SGCA 107\n\n2 RCS at [62]\n\n17\n\n\f35.\n\nThe Law Society argues that the gravity of the act must be viewed in the context of\nthe circumstances of the case and that it is in the public interest to adopt a standard\nwhich would encourage members of the profession to maintain a high degree of\ndiligence and professionalism at all times®°, citing Iskandar and Law Society of\nSingapore v Lim Kiap Khee.\n\n36.\n\nThe issue is, in essence, whether the actions of an advocate and solicitor should\n\nbe viewed objectively or whether the subjective intentions of the advocate and\nsolicitor should be considered. We are of the view that the test should be one from\nthe view of the objective observer. First, the law is clear that what reasonable people\nwould make of the conduct is the primary criterion. This clearly points to an objective\ntest and not the state of mind of the solicitor concerned. Second, the question of\n\nbringing discredit to the profession or the potential risk of such discredit is a question\nthat must be answered objectively. Third, the question of whether third parties have\nbeen dealt with fairly must be answered with reference to the act alleged to be\nmisconduct and the effect of that act, not the intent behind it.\n\n37.\n\nAfter considering all the evidence, we find that the Respondent did not intentionally\ncause embarrassment to the Complainant or intentionally indulge in unfair conduct.\nWe appreciate that the Complainant does feel very strongly that the Respondent\ndid have such an intention and sees the open posting in public view as a deliberate\nstep in the Respondent’s efforts on behalf of his client. However, having seen and\nheard the Respondent’s evidence and having considered his explanation, we are\nnot satisfied that the Complainant’s position on the Respondent’s subjective intent\nis made out. However, for the reasons set out in [36] above, that is not the end of\n\n30 | aw Society Reply Closing Submissions (LSRCS) at [18]\n\n18\n\n\fthe inquiry.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted that the precedents relate to cases which were\nmore egregious, that is cases where letters of demand were copied to bankers and\nauditors or to immediate supervisors.3! We agree that the present case is certainly\nless serious, but the question still remains as to whether the line of unbefitting\nconduct has nonetheless been crossed.\n\n39.\n\nWe find that the Respondent did breach Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR in that openly\nposting the 7 October Letter in public view was unfair to the Complainant and was\nin breach of the duty of fairness and courtesy and that the breach was contrary to\nthe Respondent’s position as a member of an honourable profession. Letters of\ndemand are assertions by one party against the other, and there was no reason in\nlaw for publication. Although there was no applicable prohibition in the present case,\non the facts, there was no reason to post the 7 October Letter in the manner that it\nwas done. The 7 October Letter contained both personal details and matters in\ndispute that had to be resolved between the parties and a public display of its\ncontents would clearly embarrass and put pressure on the Complainant. While we\naccept that intent to cause such pressure and embarrassment has not been proven,\n\nthe very act of public display is clearly likely to cause such a consequence.\n\n40.\n\nWe further find, on the facts of the present case, that the breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of\nthe PCR amounts to unbefitting conduct contrary to section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\nThe Respondent knowingly gave instructions for posting of the 7 October Letter.\nPosting on the door (or beside the door) would inevitably mean that the contents of\nthe 7 October Letter would be and could be seen by any member of the public\n\n31 RCS at [56] and RCS Annex A\n\n19\n\n\fpassing by. The assertion by the Respondent that it did not occur to him that the\n\nletter would be posted outside of any envelope does not excuse the Respondent.\nThe Respondent did not address his mind to this possibility and did not cast his\nmind on the manner of posting. A reasonable person considering the conduct of the\nRespondent, and the consequences of his failure to address his mind to what his\ndirection to post would result in, would unhesitatingly say that he should not have\ndone it and that he fell short of the standards of an honourable profession. Legal\nmatters and disputes are serious matters and usually not a matter of routine for\nparties. Having a letter of demand posted openly is a drastic measure and using\nsuch a measure without thought brings discredit to the profession. In the present\ncase,\n\nthe\n\nabsence of any legal\n\nrequirement to do so and the express\n\nacknowledgment by the Complainant of receipt of the 7 October Letter by email\ndispels any lingering doubt that we have that the Respondent’s conduct crossed\nthe line into unbefitting conduct contrary to section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n41.\n\nWe accordingly find that the Respondent is guilty of the charge.\n\nAppropriate sanction\n\n42.\n\nWe now consider the appropriate action to be taken upon our finding, as provided\nfor in section 93 of the LPA. We note that the Law Society has taken the position\nthat no cause of sufficient gravity exists for reference to the Court of Three Judges\nand that the Respondent should be reprimanded.\n\n43.\n\nWe agree with the position taken by the Law Society. We have been referred to\nprecedents where a reprimand has been ordered. We find that the culpability in the\npresent case is lower than the precedents. We also find that that the harm\noccasioned by the breach is at the lowest end of the scale, as no direct harm to the\n\n20\n\n\fComplainant has been shown. The harm in the present case is the discredit brought\nto the profession. That harm is sufficiently addressed by the fact of prosecution and\nconviction, which serves as a deterrent to the Respondent and sends the\n\nappropriate message to others - that we as lawyers have to constantly bear in mind\nthat the way we go about our duties requires us to consciously apply the PCR and\nits guiding principles. In this respect we take note of the Respondent’s submission\nthat he has been subject to the disciplinary process for more than a year, with the\nattendant stress and personal embarrassment.> We also note that the\nRespondent's conduct is one-off and that he is a fairly junior practitioner.\n\n44,\n\nIn the premises, this Tribunal, having heard and investigated this matter,\n\ndetermines that while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists\nunder section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be reprimanded pursuant to\nsection 93(b)(ii) of the LPA.\n\n45,\n\nCosts of Disciplinary Tribunal proceedings normally would follow upon a finding of\nguilt and there are no reasons in the present case to depart from this norm.

Following the findings or remarks of the High Court from [59]\nto [65] in BOK v BOL [2017] SGHC 316\n\nBOK v BOL , Victor lodged his\n\ncomplaint against Peter resulting in DT 12.\n\nII.\n\nTHE CHARGES IN DT 12\n\n4.\n\nThe same Tribunal in DT 2 and 2A was appointed to hear the complaint against\nPeter in DT 12. In DT 12, the following charges were preferred against Peter, which\nin their amended form reads as follows:\n\n\f3\n\nFIRST CHARGE\nYou, Gabriel Peter, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that on or about 26 March 2014, you:\n\naided the misrepresentation of your daughter, Calista\nMarella Peter, to her then husband, Lim Wei De Victor, that\nthe Deed of Trust would only take effect upon his death, until\nwhich time he was free to deal with his assets,\n\nwhich were acts that took unfair advantage of Lim Wei De Victor or was\nfraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to your position as an advocate\nand solicitor or officer of the Court, and you are thereby guilty of a breach\nof Rule 53A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\nR 1, 2010 Rev Ed), and such breach amounts to conduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nSECOND CHARGE\nYou, Gabriel Peter, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that on or about 26 March 2014, you:\n\nexerted undue influence upon Lim Wei De Victor or aided\nCalista Marella Peter to exert undue influence upon Lim Wei\nDe Victor, thereby inducing the said Lim Wei De Victor into\nsigning the Deed of Trust;\n\n\f4\n\nwhich were acts that took unfair advantage of Lim Wei De Victor or was\nfraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to your position as an advocate\nand solicitor or officer of the Court, and you are thereby guilty of a breach\nof Rule 53A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\nR 1, 2010 Rev Ed), and such breach amounts to conduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nTHIRD CHARGE\nYou, Gabriel Peter, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that on or about 26 March 2014, you:\n\nfailed, refused and/or neglected to advise Lim Wei De Victor\nto seek independent legal advice in circumstances where\n\nmisrepresentation as to the legal effect of the Deed of Trust\nand of the vulnerability and impairment of the said Lim Wei\nat the material time when he was\n\nwhich were acts that took unfair advantage of Lim Wei De Victor or was\nfraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to your position as an advocate\nand solicitor or officer of the Court, and you are thereby guilty of a breach\nof Rule 53A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\nR 1, 2010 Rev Ed), and such breach amounts to conduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n\n\f5\n\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nIII.\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES ON 26 MARCH 2014\n\n5.\n\nAs far as it relates to the complaint against Peter,\n\naccount of the events\n\non 26 March 2014 are that while Victor and Calista were arguing in\n1, Peter came home\n\nbedroom whilst staying in\n\nfrom work and Calista went to Peter in his bedroom to show him the DOT.2 Victor\noverheard Calista complaining to Peter that Victor refused to sign the DOT and\n\nDOT.3 Victor asked Peter if he would do the same if Peter were in his shoes and\nPeter replied yes.4 Victor understood this to mean that the DOT was a standard,\nnormal document which is commonly executed.5\n\n6.\n\nIn the presence of Peter, Calista stated that the DOT\nson S\n\nS\n\n6\n\nCalista stated that Victor would in the meantime be free to deal with all of his assets\nas he deemed fit.7 Peter also stated that he himself did not own anything (which\nVictor understood to mean immovable properties) and that everything Peter had\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\f6\n\nbelonged to his wife and children.8 Victor felt intimidated by Peter (being his fatherin-law and senior lawyer)9 and pressured by Calista to sign the DOT, which he\ndid.10\n\n7.\nin the evening, playing with his grandson with his wife in their bedroom.11 Calista\nentered her parents bedroom to tell them that Victor was leaving the house to stay\nelsewhere.12 Peter recalled that there had been an issue between Victor and\n\nthe couple to resolve the issue.13\nand did not enter Calista\n\n8.\n\nbedroom.14\n\nThe linchpin of the three Charges against Peter was that he had followed Calista\nback to her bedroom and it was there that the events giving rise to the three\nCharges took place.\n\nand no other date. A fortiori, if the Law Society failed to prove that Peter did follow\nCalista back to her bedroom, the three Charges would fail.\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14 DT 12 Transcripts 30 September 2021, page 86 line 18 to page 87 line 29\n\n\f7\n\nIV.\n\n9.\nhear and investigate\nthe matter\n\nSection 89(1) of the Legal Profession Act\n\nemphasis added\n\nLPA ,\n\nclarify doubts arising\n\nfrom the evidence given. For example, in paragraph [40] of\n\nAEIC, he\n\naffirmed the following:\n\nfter I refused to sign the Declaration of Trust Calista became agitated\nand started raising her voice. We argued. During the course of our\nargument, Calista told me that the Declaration of Trust was just a\nit was not meant to take effect until my death, and that\n\nthat effect) until then. Calista said that the Declaration of Trust was just\n\nof Trust, in the event of my death, all my assets would be left to [S] and until\nthen, I was free to deal with my money and assets as I deemed fit. Calista\nwas only interested and insistent in getting me to sign the Declaration of\nTrust.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n10.\n\nCalista said it was not meant to take effect until [his] death\ngave rise to a doubt as to whether Calista did in fact represent to him that in law,\nthe DOT was to take effect only upon his death. When someone describes a\n\n\f8\n\nit was not meant to\nof the document in law was otherwise. Obviously because while the effect of a\ndocument in law may be one thing, the understanding between parties as to how\nand when the document is be used is another. Otherwise, it makes no sense (on\nit was not meant to take effect until [his]\ndeath\n\n11. The Tribunal was therefore compelled to clarify this doubt with Victor during his\ncross-\n\nV.\n\nhear and investigate the matter\n\nUNUSUALLY CONVINCING STANDARD\n\n12. For the three charges against Peter to be made out, it was incumbent on the Law\nSociety to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Peter followed Calista back\ninto her bedroom.\n\n13. This resulted in a face-off between what Victor said had occurred (Peter entered\nthe bedroom) and what Peter said had occurred (he did not enter the bedroom) as\nneither the Law Society or Peter had called Calista as a witness in DT 12.\n\n14. This face-off called into operation the test propounded in Public Prosecutor v GCK\nand another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 PP v GCK in which the Court of Appeal\nunusually convincing\nin convicting an accused, at [87] to [89]:\n\n\f9\n\n87\n\nWe agree with the parties that\n\nstandard is the only standard to be\nuncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for a conviction\n\n88\n\ncase [is] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the\n\nMamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals [2016] 5 SLR 636 at [28],\nthis court considered that (citing Mohammed Liton at [39]):\n\navailable facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth\nwhich leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists\nin\n\ndemeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the\n\n89\nnothing to do with the status of the witness concerned (namely,\nwhether he or she is an alleged victim or an eyewitness), and\n\nProsecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt\nXP ([72] supra) at [31]. In the absence of any other corroborative\nevidence, the testimony of a witness, whether an eyewitness or an\n\n\f10\n\nentire case will rest. Such evidence can sustain a conviction only if it is\n\narising from the lack of corroboration and the fact that such evidence will\ntypically be controverted by that of the accused person.\n\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n15.\n\nunusually convincing\nDisciplinary Tribunals (see, The Law Society of Singapore v Lim Kien Thye [2002]\nSGDSC 6 at [12]), and the Tribunal sees fit to apply it in this circumstance.\n\n16. The Tribunal finds\nentered the bedroom,\n\nunusually convincing\n\nfor a\n\nnumber of reasons.\nInternal and external inconsistencies\n17.\n\nas beset with internal inconsistencies. The most\nglaring of which was his allegation that Calista had misrepresented to him when\nthe DOT took effect in law. Upon questioning by the Tribunal, Victor admitted that\nthere was no such misrepresentation as to when the DOT took effect in law, but\nonly what and when the DOT was meant or intended to be used for:\n\nDT 12 Transcripts 28 September 2021, page 84 line 13 to page 85 line 9\n\nthe High Court what you say here---no, to be fair to\n\n\f11\n\nmisrepresentation about the effect of the DOT was? So that we are fair to you.\nA I disagree.\nQ No, no. What are you saying then?\nPresident: What are you saying? Yes.\n\nPresident: No. No, no. Okay. Let me give you two scenarios so you can\nunderstand, right? One is a misrepresentation that this DOT would only take\neffect on your death, correct?\nAdvocate: As a matter of law.\nPresident: As a matter of law. The other [interpretation] is I made no\n\ndocument until you die\nWitness: Your Honour, CMP represented the second one.\nPresident: The second one. Okay.\nRespondent: Okay.\nPresident:\n\nWitness: Yes.\nPresident:\nyou die. Alright. In law, as my colleague said. You see? So it was really what they call - security. Security. Alright. That you behave yourself.\nAlright. And you come back, you start a family, you know? I think that is\nwhat you agree she meant, yes?\nWitness: Yes, Your Honour.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nDT 12 Transcripts 28 September 2021, page 85 line 25 to page 86 line 18\n\n\f12\n\nQ So Mr Lim, I put it---sorry, I suggest to you that Callista did not make a\nmisrepresentation to you about the legal effect of the DOT, taking---in that it\ntook effect legally upon your death. Do you agree?\nt fact, law.\nA I disagree.\nAdvocate: No, you said you were not willing to sign it, right--Witness: Yes, Your Honour.\nAdvocate: ---\n\nWitness: Yes.\nAdvocate: And it was because she said that look, this is---as you say in\n\nWitness: Yes.\nAdvocate:\n--Witness: Yes.\nAdvocate: ---and---so that seems to be more about intention rather than\n--Or\n\nin\n\nAnd maybe then can---one can\n\nunderstand why is it you go and do whatever you want to do with the property.\nWitness: Your Honour, it was the second one.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nDT 12 Transcripts 28 September 2021, page 87 line 4 to 8\n\n\f13\n\nCallista did not tell\nyou, right, that this document which you signed would take effect in law\nonly upon your death. Did she make that representation?\nWitness:\n\nYour Honour---\n\nPresident: Yes.\nWitness: ---but she--President: So she made what representation? She made the representation\nthat this is only to avoid probate and all that other things, and in case you\ngive your property away to a Chinese [whore]15, I would [leave] this in the\n\n---that really is the\n--Witness: It is the second point\n\n---\n\nPresident: Yes, the second, yes. Alright, alright.\nWitness: ---the kind to think about too much.\n\nRespondent: Yes. Your Honour, it saves a lot of\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n18. In fact, this admission by Victor was not just an internal inconsistency as to his\naccount of the events, but it shows that he was not truthful about\nmisrepresentation altogether. Further, if there was no misrepresentation by\nCalista, why would there be a need for Peter to follow Calista back to her bedroom\nand persuade Victor? This in and of itself raised a reasonable doubt as to whether\n\n15\n\nChinese [whore]\n[S] would end up getting\n\n\f14\n\nPeter did in fact follow Calista back to her bedroom. Without Peter doing so, all\nthree Charges against Peter fail.\n\n19. As for the First and Third Charges in particular, they fail also because they are\nspecifically predicated on Calista having allegedly misrepresented when the DOT\ntook effect in law. The First Charge against Peter is for aiding Calista in her alleged\nmisrepresentation, and the Third Charge is in failing to advise Victor to seek\n\nmisrepresentation. Both predicated on the alleged misrepresentation.\n\n20. Counsel for the Law Society attempted to remedy this clear admission in reexamination by asking Victor what he understood when he signed the DOT:\nDT 12 Transcript 29 September 2021 page 7 lines 10 to 13\nOn the evening of the 26th of March 2014 when you signed the\nDOT, as far as you understood at that time, when would the DOT\ntake effect?\nA\n\nAfter CMP made her statements, I was led to believe that would\n\n21. Read plainly, this answer by Victor in re-examination\nadmission in cross-examination that the DOT was not meant to be used until\ngiven that that was what Calista had told him as part of a family\narrangement.\n\n\f15\n\n22.\n\n-examination were\ncontradicting his answers in cross-\n\ncredibility would be put in\n\nfurther doubt as there would be no way to reconcile his two contradictory accounts.\n\ninconsistency.\n\n23.\n\nalso suffered the internal inconsistency between what he says he\nunderstood the DOT to mean at two different portions of his AEIC.\n\n24. First, at [43] of his AEIC, Victor alleges that when he asked Peter whether he would\n\nalleges that Peter told him that he himself did not own anything and that everything\nhe had belonged to his wife and children. Victor says he understood this to mean\nthat Peter did not own any property. Taking these two statements together, Victor\nmust have understood that signing the DOT would be akin to putting himself in\nof his own. Victor said as much in [9] of\nhis complaint to the Law Society dated 31 May 201916:\nWhen I asked Peter Gabriel, whom I knew and respect to be a senior\nlawyer, whether he would sign the DOT if he was in my shoes, Peter Gabriel\n\nown anything and that everything belonged to his wife and children.\n\n25. Yet later at [55] of his AEIC, Victor says that he honestly believed that under the\nDOT, all of his assets would be to left to S only when he died, and he would\n\n16\n\n\f16\n\ncontinue to own and be free to deal with his assets as he deemed fit without any\nreference to S. This was clearly not the position that Victor understood Peter to be\nin. Obviously because Peter was still alive and yet his wife and children owned the\nproperty.\nhow could Peter have aided any misrepresentation as to when the DOT took effect\nin law?\n\n26. This was picked up by Peter and the Tribunal in the cross-examination of Victor:\nDT 12 Transcripts 28 September 2021, page 74 line 1 to page 72 line 2\nQ Now, I would like you to---just to finish off, just one question on paragraph\n\nParagraph 9.\n\nSo, Mr Lim, what you had done in this paragraph 9 is effectively try to\nsummarise the various points you have raised in your affidavit, and your\n\nthat I was---if I was in your shoes, I would do it and that everything I own\n\nfrom those words, I didn't say it, but all you gathered from those words is\nthat you were being unreasonable for not signing the DOT, correct?\nA I'm not just unreasonable but yah.\n\nQ I said, after reading---\n\n\f17\n\nthose words was that you were being unreasonable for not signing the DOT.\n\nA\nQ And nowhere did you get that impression that you had stated earlier that\nsomehow I had given you the impression that by these words I could\n\nPresident: I have difficulty, Mr Lim, with paragraph 9. Because if you read\nthe first\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n6 lines, right, basically your complaint there is that\n\ntake effect upon death, correct? And if you objectively look at the lines after\nthat:\nwas a\nstandard document. When I asked Peter Gabriel, whom I knew\nand respect to be a senior lawyer, whether he would sign the\n--and this is where he may be said to have corrected Calista--at one point, Peter Gabriel even remarked that he did not own\n\ndid the same.

It belongs to my\nBut by making that\nremark, and you are a intelligent man, you come to the conclusion\nwhatever Calista said was not really true because look at Peter\nGabriel, he owns nothing. And he is saying so. So, I'm sharing with you\nand reading his paragraph 9, it is not as clear-cut as you think it is, yes? So\nMr Peter, you want to carry on this line?\n\n\f18\n\n---his defence\nis an all-orBut even assuming he did, this paragraph 9 has an inherent\ninconsistency.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n27. There was neither a correction by Victor nor a re-examination by the Law Society\nin this regard.\n\n28. T\n\nin his AEIC at [43], he\nstandard\n\ndocument However, Victor resiled from this point during cross-examination and\nadmitted to the Tribunal that the description of the DOT\ncame from himself and not Peter:\nDT 12 Transcripts 27 September 2021, page 59 line 24 to page 60 line 17\nQ\nthis event of which you have produced even quotations purportedly\nabout events that transpired. So try to remember, Mr Lim. Answer the\nquestion. What clarification did you seek from me or my daughter on the\n26th about this trust deed?\nA To you specifically, I asked whether this was a standard document,\nto which you said it is. I asked for illustrations, you told me that this was\nsomething that was acceptable to you and that also you were not\n\n\f19\n\nholding any assets under your name, and that most if not all your assets\nwere held by your wife and your children.\nQ Can you point out in your affidavit you have said that you asked me\nwhether it was a standard document? Can you point out in your affidavit\nwhere you said you asked me whether it was a standard document and\nthat I replied to you?\n\nA Paragraph 43.\n\nQ I can read that. Where is it that you say that you had asked me\nand I replied you?\nA It is not stated explicitly inside that paragraph.\nDT 12 Transcripts 27 September 2021, page 69 line 1 to page 70 line 6\n\nQ Now, coming back to you---what you said this morning. You said that\nyou had asked me whether it was a standard document and that I replied\nto you that it was. So can you tell the Tribunal what is it that you meant\n\n...\nA Your Honour, I was coming from a perspective of a layperson where\nI was not familiar with all these documents. I was asking him as a very\nsenior figure in legal matters whether this is commonly executed,\nwhether this would have any detrimental effects to myself and whether\nthere were any significant ramifications that I was unaware of. So what-\n\n\f20\n\n-was thinking about.\nPresident: So the provenance of this--Advocate: Phrase.\nPresident: ---phras\nwas whose?\nWitness: I asked. I asked PG about it.\nPresident:\nmouth?\nWitness: Yes.\n\nyour mouth, did you communicate to me at any point as to what you\n\na detrimental effect on you and whether---what significant\nramifications were there, did you ask these questions of me? Yes\nor no?\nA I did not.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n29.\n\nstandard\ndocument\n\nhe says in his AEIC. In his\n\nAEIC, it comes across as though Peter was the one who of his own initiative,\nstandard document If that were the case, it\nwould be easy to discern the inducement by Peter. But if the truth was that Victor\nstandard document\n\nwas merely\n\n\f21\n\nresponding to it, where is the inducement? As Victor admitted, he did not further\nask questions about whether it was commonly executed, whether there was a\nyes\nfrom Peter could not encapsulate all of those concerns.\n\n30. The Tribunal also found\n\nwas externally inconsistent with the\n\nobjective evidence. Victor says in his AEIC (at [42]) that while he was in\nbedroom, he could hear Calista and\n\nvery\n\nclearly as the bedroom door was open. The floor plan of the house and the two\nbedrooms was exhibited to the Tribunal, and it was clear that the distance between\nthe two bedrooms was approximately 7.5 metres diagonally across (with walls in\nbetween). This is assuming that Peter and Calista were standing at the doorway\nof one room and Victor was listening in from the other. Even then, it would be\ndifficult to accept that at that distance, Victor could hear the conversation very\nclearly.\nLaw Society.\n\n31. That said, the Tribunal recognises that nothing turns on this in that no allegations\nare being raised in relation to what was said between Calista and Peter while they\nThe Tribunal, however, takes this to be an external\nsatisfying the standard\nunusually convincing.\n\n32.\n\nGiven these internal and external inconsistencies, it could not be said that\nevidence\n\nunusually convincing\n\n\f22\n\nDemeanour of the witness\n33.\n\n-examination in\nDT 12 by Peter, his former father-in-law, was also telling. During the crossexamination, Victor turned away from Peter with his back facing him and faced the\nTribunal with his eyes shut most of the time. The Tribunal can only surmise that\nhe felt some sort of shame or remorse and was uncomfortable facing his former\nfather-in-law.\n\nbe\n\nunusually convincing\n\nring of truth\n\nin PP v GCK.\n\n34. In any event\n\nunusually convincing\n\nevidence does not place a burden on the accused to call corroborative eye-witness\n\ndischarge their burden before there is a shift to the accused (see, PP v GCK at\n[140]). The Tribunal therefore could not agree with Mr Adrian Wee, Counsel for the\nLaw Society, in his submission that Calista ought to have been called by Peter.\n\n35.\n\nunusually convincing\ngiven the internal and external inconsistencies of his evidence, as well as his\ndemeanour. There\n\nCovert recordings\n\nunusually convincing\n\n\f23\n\n36. For completeness, the Tribunal considered the\n\nreliance on the covert\n\nrecording by Victor of his conversation with Calista and her Mother at [64] of BOK\nv BOL:\n\nbedroom on the evening of 26 March 2014 comes from the transcript of\nthe confrontation of 12 February 2015. During the confrontation, the\n\nShe is\n\nknow why you keep saying someone force you. How can any of us\n\nto read the DOT. Indeed, she appeared to accept, by her use of the\n\n.\n\n37.\n\n, however, the covert recordings were unsafe to rely on given\nthat Victor had sole control of what was being recorded and was directing the\nconversation to suit his purposes. Indeed, the transcript of the covert recording\nmakes it clear that Victor was the one who prompted the mention of\n\nalleged\n\ninvolvement:\n[Calista]: Victor, you have already signed it. I d\nto force you?\n[Victor]: You even got your dad to read through it and to force me to sign\nit.\n\n\f24\n\n[Calista]:\none force you. How can any of us force you?\n[Victor]: You just told me to get lost, and you a[Calista]:\n\n38. This was the same concern expressed by the court in Re A (a child) (Hague\nConvention: wrongful retention) [2021] EWHC 1204 (Fam), in which the Court\ngave very little weight to covert recordings made by a father of his conversation\nwith his child. The Court held:\n\nrecordings as evidence at the hearing. I did so because they had been\nmade covertly and the father had sole control over what was recorded\nand could have steered recorded conversations with his child to suit\nhis purposes. Hence, the evidence would be of very little weight.\n\n39. Notwithstanding the above, even if the Tribunal were to place the utmost weight\non what Calista said in this covert recording, it cannot prove that Peter was in the\nroom. Giving the words their natural meaning, all she is saying is that no one in\nher family could have forced Victor to sign the DOT. It cannot prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Peter\n\n40. In view of the above, all three charges against Peter are not made out on the\nevidence. Further, as far as the First and Third Charges are concerned, as stated\nabove at [19], Victor has admitted that there was no misrepresentation by Calista\nas regards when the DOT was to take effect in law. The Third Charge also fails to\n\n\f25\n\nsatisfy the conjunctive requirement that Peter was aware that Victor was suffering\nfrom vulnerability and impairment of his mental state, for the reasons stated in DT\n2 and 2A at [30] to [39].\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n41. In view of the findings in [40] above, the Tribunal determines pursuant to Section\n93(1)(a) of the LPA that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action against\nPeter exists under Section 83 of the LPA.\n\nDated this the\n\n20th\n\nday of February 2022.\n\n_________________________________________\nMr Roderick E Martin SC\nPresident\n\n_________________________________________\nMr Chan Hock Keng\nMember\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-04-08T04:00:27+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-may-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Constance Margreat Paglar (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-constance-margreat-paglar-respondent\">In the Matter of Constance Margreat Paglar (Respondent), <strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Lim Beng Heng Bernard (<strong>Complainant</strong>).

The facts as agreed between the parties are set out below\nfrom [7] to [16].\n\n6.\n\nA hearing was fixed for 23 March 2020 but at the start of the hearing the Tribunal was\ninformed that the Respondent was denied entry to the Supreme Court due to certain\nanswers made in the Heath Declaration Form required by the Supreme Court. The\nhearing was accordingly adjourned and re-fixed for 2 April 2020. At this hearing, the\namended charge was duly read to the Respondent and she pleaded guilty.\n\nTHE ASOF\n\n7.\n\nThe Complainant had engaged CPC to make a claim for personal injuries that he\nsustained in a road traffic accident on 28 September 2017 (“Accident”).\n\n\f-3-\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 March 2018, CPC issued a letter of demand to India International Insurance Pte\nLtd (“III Pte Ltd”), the insurers of the motor vehicle that was involved in the\nAccident. CPC, on the Complainant’s instructions, demanded a sum of S$9,418.05\ninclusive of S$2,996.00 as costs.\n\n9.\n\nThereafter, the following proposals were exchanged between CPC and III Pte Ltd, as full\nand final settlement of the Complainant’s claim:\n\n(1)\n\nby way of an email dated 20 April 2018, at 3.31 pm, III Pte Ltd offered the sum of\nS$3,041.35, inclusive of S$1,605.00 as costs and disbursements;\n\n(2)\n\nby way of an email dated 7 June 2018, at 2.38 pm, CPC counter-proposed the sum\nof S$5,540.65, inclusive of S$2,140.00 as costs; and\n\n(3)\n\nby way of an email dated 7 June 2018, at 4.39 pm, III Pte Ltd offered the sum of\nS$3,281.35, inclusive of S$1,605.00 as costs and disbursements (“7 June\nProposal”).\n\n10.\n\nBy way of a letter dated 11 June 2018 (“11 June Letter”), CPC informed the\nComplainant of the 7 June Proposal and enclosed a copy of the email from III Pte Ltd,\nwhich stated that the settlement sum was S$3,281.35. In the 11 June Letter, the\nRespondent explained that the sum the Complainant would get was S$1,552.00, derived\nas follows:\n\nBreakdown\n\nAmount (S$)\n\nGeneral Damages\n\n1,800\n\nMedical Expenses\n\n120\n\nTransport Expenses\n\n20\n\nAt 80% liability\n\n1,552\n\n\f-4-\n\n11.\n\nThe 11 June Letter further stated that after deduction of the sum of S$535.00, being the\nlegal costs incurred by CPC, from the compensation sum of S$1,552.00, the Complainant\nwould get S$1,017.00. The 11 June Letter also contained the Respondent’s advice to the\nComplainant to accept the 7 June Proposal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 13 June 2018, the Complainant instructed the Respondent to accept the 7 June\nProposal. However, the Respondent did not write to III Pte Ltd to communicate the\nComplainant’s acceptance of the 7 June Proposal.\n\n13.\n\nInstead, the following proposals were subsequently exchanged between CPC and III Pte\nLtd without the Complainant’s knowledge or instructions:\n\n(1)\n\nBy way of an email dated 21 June 2018, at 2.40 pm, CPC made a revised global\nsettlement offer to III Pte Ltd of S$4,000.00 (“21 June Offer”).\n\n(2)\n\nBy way of an email dated 21 June 2018, at 4.29 pm, III Pte Ltd counter-proposed\nthe sum of S$3,800.00 as global settlement of the Complainant’s claim (“21 June\nProposal”).\n\n14.\n\nBy way of an email dated 26 June 2018, at 11.25 am, CPC accepted the 21 June\nProposal. By way of an email dated 27 June 2018, at 11.05 am, III Pte Ltd sent CPC a\nDischarge Voucher for the sum of S$3,800.00.\n\n15.\n\nOn 29 June 2018, the Complainant received a Discharge Voucher issued by III Pte Ltd,\nwhich stated that the settlement sum was S$3,800.00 and not S$3,281.35, as stated in the\n7 June Proposal, which was annexed to the 11 June Letter. The Complainant did not\nreceive an explanation or breakdown of the sum of S$3,800.00.\n\n16.\n\nBy reason of the foregoing, the Respondent has breached Rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR in\nfailing to keep the Complainant reasonably informed of the progress of his matter, by\nfailing to inform the Complainant when she negotiated a higher global settlement sum\nwith III Pte Ltd, and by failing to explain the breakdown of the $3,800 settlement sum.\n\n\f-5-\n\nTHE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that having regard to the matters submitted in the MP, the\nTribunal should impose only a reprimand for the misconduct which may bring the legal\nprofession into disrepute.\n\n18.\n\nEssentially, the Respondent’s main arguments in mitigation were as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nShe was remorseful and had acknowledged that there were shortcomings in her\nconduct, had made representations at an early stage and had agreed to plead guilty\nat the earliest possible opportunity following the reply to her representations,\nthereby saving time and cost for the parties.\n\n(2)\n\nNo prejudice was caused to the Complainant. His interest has not been prejudiced\nor compromised as she had managed to secure the amount of damages which the\nComplainant was prepared to accept in settlement of his claim. Furthermore, no\nissue was raised by the Complainant as to the reasonableness of the amount of\ndamages which she had advised the Complainant to accept in full and final\nsettlement of his claim in the 7 June Proposal.\n\n(3)\n\nHer conduct was not motivated by personal interest or dishonesty and did not seek\nto unfairly benefit herself over the Complainant’s interest. The lapses in\ncommunication with the Complainant was not malicious or motivated by personal\ninterest or dishonesty but stemmed from a genuine belief that the Complainant did\nnot have any interest in the party and party cost component of any offer from III\nPte Ltd because of the structure of the solicitor-and-client cost agreed between the\nComplainant and CPC. She genuinely believed that the 7 June Proposal was\nreasonable and had advised the Complainant to accept it. Furthermore, the party\nand party cost which CPC had sought to negotiate with III Pte Ltd was also in line\nwith the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims in Appendix E of the State\nCourt Practice Directions.\n\n\f-6-\n\nTHE LAW SOCIETY’S ARGUMENTS\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society, however, argued that the Respondent should be ordered to pay a\npenalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct in the sum of $$6,000.\n\n20.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that relevant precedents show that where a legal practitioner\nis charged and found liable for breach of Rule 5(2) of the PCR (or its predecessor\nequivalent, Rule 17), absent aggravating factors, a monetary penalty is appropriate.\n\n21.\n\nIn The Law Society of Singapore v Sham Chee Keat [2018] SGDT 55 (\"Sham\"), the legal\npractitioner there was found guilty of one charge under Rule 5(2)(c) for\nfailing to act with reasonable diligence and competence in his provision of services to\nthe client by including or causing to be included in an affidavit deposed to by the client\nstatements which he ought to have known were inaccurate and false. The legal\npractitioner had attended a Pre-Trial Conference (\"PTC”) on behalf of his client, where\nthe bifurcation of the client's case was discussed. The legal practitioner claimed that he\nmisunderstood the outcome of the PTC and subsequently provided inaccurate\ninformation to his client about the PTC. Thereafter, the client deposed to an affidavit\nprepared by the legal practitioner, which contained statements that were inaccurate or\nfalse, based on the legal practitioner's misunderstanding of the outcome of the PTC. The\nDisciplinary Tribunal found that the legal practitioner had \"acted carelessly with\ninsufficient professional diligence and competence\", and was ordered to pay a penalty of\n$5,000.\n\n22.\n\nAlthough the legal practitioner in Sham was sanctioned for a breach of a different rule\nunder Rule 5 [i.e. 5(2)(c)], the Law Society submitted that the case is nevertheless\ninstructive, given that Rule 5(2)(c) (which relates to the duty to act with reasonable\ncompetence) and the Rule under which the Respondent here was charged, namely Rule\n5(2)(e) (which relates to the duty to keep the client reasonably informed of the progress\nof the client's matter), both fall under the broad category of duties of honesty, competence\nand diligence under Rule 5. The duty of reasonable diligence necessarily entails keeping\nthe client reasonably informed of the progress of his case (Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015 Commentary (Academy Publishing 2016) at para 05-041).\n\n\f-7-\n\n23.\n\nAccordingly, Law Society's position was that, based on the sanction in Sham, a penalty\nof S$5,000, as a starting point, is appropriate in the present case.\n\n24.\n\nThe Law Society went on to submit that the Respondent's seniority is a significant\naggravating factor. As stated by the High Court in Law Society of Singapore v Nathan\nEdmund [1998] 2 SLR(R) 905, it is trite that the more senior an advocate, the more\ndamage he does to the integrity of the legal profession (at [33]). This was acknowledged\nrecently by the High Court in Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju and\nanother matter [2017] 4 SLR 1369, where the legal practitioner having been in practice\nfor 29 years was found to have warranted a more onerous sentence (at [88]). Likewise,\nin the present case, the Respondent being a senior practitioner of about 22 years’ standing\njustified a more serious sanction, warranting an uplift of the penalty from $5,000 to\n$6,000.\n\n25.\n\nThe Law Society also submitted that the mitigating factors relied on by the Respondent\nin the MP should be treated with circumspection and not viewed charitably. As\nacknowledged by the Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Kurubalan\ns/o Manickam Rengaraju [2013] 4 SLR 91, mitigating factors should be viewed in a\nqualitatively different light in disciplinary proceedings as opposed to in a criminal case\n(at [48]- [49]):\n\n“48. A court that exercises disciplinary jurisdiction is likely to view mitigating factors\nin a different light than would a court in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction: see Law\nSociety of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick [1999] 3 SLR(R) 68 at [22]:\n\nBecause orders made by a disciplinary tribunal are not primarily punitive,\nconsiderations which would ordinarily weigh in mitigation of punishment have less\neffect on the exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in\ncriminal cases: Bolton v Law Society [1994] 2 All ER 486 at 492. To state the matter\nanother way, whatever might have been the appropriate sentence in the criminal\nproceedings, the objective there was rather different from that in show cause\nproceedings, which are civil and not punitive in nature.\n\n\f-8-\n\n49. The point simply is that even if a mitigating circumstance might be found that could\nweaken the case for punishment in a criminal case, this circumstance may often not avail\nan Advocate and Solicitor in proceedings because an equally, if not more, important\nconsideration is the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice. This\ninterest can legitimately trump the individual offender's interest in having his punishment\nfinely calibrated according to his precise degree of culpability. Where aggravating factors\nare concerned, there is usually less need to draw this distinction since a factor that\naggravates the offender's particular culpability would generally tend also to aggravate the\nadverse impact on confidence in the administration of justice, although there may be\nexceptions to this.\"\n\n26.\n\nThe Law Society's position is that the mitigating factors relied on by the Respondent\nshould be disregarded in the present proceedings, for the following reasons:\n\n(1)\n\nThe Respondent's assertion that no prejudice was caused to the Complainant, and\nthat her conduct was not motivated by personal interest or dishonesty, is of no help\nto the Respondent. A similar line of argument was pursued in Law Society of\nSingapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick [1999] 3 SLR(R) 68, where the High Court found\nthat the legal practitioner not having benefitted from his misdeeds apart from\nearning the usual conveyancing fees \"was beside the point\", given that \"because\norders made by a disciplinary tribunal are not primarily punitive, considerations\nwhich would ordinarily weigh in mitigation of punishment have less effect on the\nexercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in criminal\ncases\". The mitigating factors highlighted by the Respondent should therefore not\nbe relied on.\n\n(2)\n\nFurther, and in any event, the Respondent's \"remorse and plea of guilt at the earliest\nopportunity\" was a mischaracterization of the events that transpired in the present\nproceedings. The Respondent did not plead guilty at the earliest possible\nopportunity, and her conduct cannot be said to have saved costs and time for all\nparties involved. Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief were exchanged on 25 February\n2020, and the matter was fixed for 2 days of trial, on 10 and 11 March. It was only\n6 days before the hearing on 4 March 2020 that the Respondent agreed to plead\n\n\f-9-\n\nguilty. Therefore, the Respondent's plea of guilt was not timeous, and should not\nbe considered a mitigating circumstance.\n\nMATTERS OF CONCERN TO THE TRIBUNAL\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal struggled to understand the position of the Law Society in amending the\noriginal charges to the amended charge as it appeared not to give adequate weight to the\npossible severity of the actions of the Respondent which was clearly detrimental to her\nclient, the Complainant. The amended charges appeared to trivialise the Complaint and\ndo disservice to the Complainant and any other client who was in a position similar to\nthat of the Complainant.\n\n28.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal felt it had no option but to respect the prosecutorial discretion of\nthe Law Society when it chose to prefer the amended charge instead of the original\ncharges. Furthermore, it was not apparent whether the relevant representatives of the Law\nSociety who made the decision to prefer the amended charge were aware of the\nRespondent’s antecedent misconduct referred to later in this report.\n\n29.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal noted the facts set out below.\n\n30.\n\nIn CPC’s letter dated 11 June 2018 to the Complainant, which attached the 7 June\nProposal which had provided for an offer aggregating $3281.35 comprising, inter alia,\n“Cost and Disbursements including GST-$1605”, CPC had also informed the\nComplainant that:\n\n(1)\n\n“Pursuant to the Warrant to Act, the sum of $535, inclusive of GST, will be\ndeducted from the compensation amount”;\n\n(2)\n\n“Given the injuries diagnosed, we would advise you that the offer made thereon is\nreasonable and can be seriously considered for acceptance”; and\n\n\f- 10 -\n\n(3)\n\n“ you may be required to sign a Discharge Voucher for an amount that is higher\nthan what is stated herein as that amount will include our legal costs and\ndisbursements incurred for this file”.\n\n31.\n\nThe 11 June 2018 letter contemplated that the cost of $535 pursuant to the Warrant to\nAct was in addition to the costs of $1605 payable by III Pte Ltd and this appears to have\nbeen so understood and accepted by the Complainant in the Complaint. The Warrant to\nAct, dated 5 October 2017, provided that the Respondent could deduct from any\nsettlement sum received party and party costs, described as “costs paid by the third party\non [the client’s] behalf” as well as the solicitor and client costs, the minimum of which\nwas stated to be $500 plus GST. It appears that in accepting the 7 June Proposal for a\ntotal of $3,281.35, the Complainant was aware and agreed that the Respondent would\ncharge as her cost a sum of $535 plus $1,605, totalling $2,140, which amounted to 65.2%\nof the proposed settlement sum.\n\n32.\n\nInstead of acting in accordance with the Complainant’s instructions to accept the 7 June\nProposal, the Respondent without authorization or instruction from the Complainant,\nmade an increased offer by way of CPC’s 21 June Offer to III Pte Ltd for a global\nsettlement sum of $4,000. In the 21 June Offer, the Respondent had stated “Purely to\nfacilitate an amicable settlement, we counter proposed global sum of $4,000 all-in and\nno less”. This was a counter offer which in law rejected the 7 June Offer, including the\noffer to pay party and party costs of $1605, and was totally opposite and contrary to the\nComplainant’s instructions to accept the 7 June Proposal which the Respondent had\nadvised the Complainant to accept. Indeed, had III Pte Ltd rejected the 21 June Offer and\nsought to reduce its proposal to an amount less than that in the 7 June Proposal, it would\nhave been legally entitled to do so.\n\n33.\n\nAs it turned out, III Pte Ltd made an increased global settlement offer of $3,800 vide its\n21 June Proposal which was accepted vide CPC’s email response dated 26 June 2018.\n\n34.\n\nClearly, the Respondent knew from experience that it was very unlikely that III Pte Ltd\nwould reject her counter offer and seek to reduce its offer to an amount less than the 7\nJune Proposal and that it was a safe gamble for her to seek a higher global settlement,\nwhich leads to the question: whose benefit was this for? Given that the Respondent had\n\n\f- 11 -\n\nin the 11 June Letter to the Complainant advised the Complainant to accept the 7 June\nProposal and the Complainant agreed to accept the 7 June Proposal, it meant also that the\nRespondent was prepared to and agreed to accept the party and party costs of $1605 from\nIII Pte Ltd and that the Complainant likewise agreed to this. As such, the counter offer\nby the Respondent for a global settlement amount larger than the 7 June Proposal, even\nwhere made without the Complainant’s instructions, which resulted in a global settlement\nfor an amount larger than the 7 June Proposal, would result in the entire\nfinal global settlement amount of $3,800, including the increased differential, being held\nby the Respondent on behalf of and to the benefit of the Complainant, given that the\nRespondent was at all relevant times an agent and solicitor for the Complainant for which\nthere was a duty on the Respondent’s part to account to the Complainant. The Respondent\nhad likely sought a larger “global settlement” from III Pte Ltd, instead of merely seeking\nan increased amount of “party and party costs“, for her own benefit because she wanted\nto give III Pte Ltd the impression that it was the Complainant who wanted a larger amount\nof damages to achieve a settlement, which III Pte Ltd obviously believed. If the\nRespondent truly believed that III Pte Ltd would have agreed to pay a larger amount of\n“party and party costs“, whilst the amount of damages payable to the Complainant\nremained as per the 7 June Proposal, she could have simply stated that a larger amount\nof “party and party costs“ was required to achieve a settlement.\n\n35.\n\nUnder cover of an email dated 27 June 2018, III Pte Ltd forwarded to CPC a discharge\nvoucher for the settlement sum of $3,800 and asked that it be signed by the Complainant\nand returned to them before they issued the cheque for $3,800. As it turned out, the need\nfor the signing of the discharge voucher for the settlement sum of $3,800 became the\ntrigger for the Complaint.\n\n36.\n\nAs admitted by the Respondent, she did not keep the Respondent informed nor obtained\nhis instructions in making the 21 June Offer or in accepting the final $3,800 global\nsettlement amount. In the Complaint, the Complainant stated that he had been asked to\nsign a discharge voucher for $3,800 instead of the $3281.35 under the 7 June Proposal\nand he was concerned that the 7 June Proposal might have been “fabricated“ and that\n“there [was] an unaccounted sum of $581.65 and the issue is whether there [was] an\nattempt to misappropriate it“. In the Complaint, he also stated that he relied on the\nRespondent’s advice in the 11 June Letter (which forwarded the 7 June Proposal) which\n\n\f- 12 -\n\nhe understood to mean that “there was no possibility of getting a higher settlement“ as a\nresult of which he accepted the 7 June Proposal under which he was to receive $1,552\n(being damages of $1,940 X 80%, accepting 20% contributory negligence on his part),\nwhich after deducting the solicitor and client cost of $535 inclusive of GST, meant that\nhe would receive a nett sum of only $1,017. Further, if there had been an uplift in the\nsettlement sum to $3,800, he would have wanted to participate in it.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent has placed emphasis on the argument that the 7 June Proposal which she\nadvised the Complainant to accept was reasonable. As the Tribunal sees it, whether or\nnot the 7 June Proposal was reasonable is not the issue. The issue is whether having\nadvised that the 7 June Proposal was reasonable, and having caused the Complainant to\naccept that offer for his damages, the Respondent could act in a manner which was not\nonly totally contrary to the Complainant’s instructions to accept the 7 June Proposal but\namounted to a rejection of the 7 June Proposal, by going back to III Pte Ltd to give the\nfalse impression that her client was not agreeable to the 7 June Proposal and to counter\noffer a larger global settlement without first informing the client and obtaining his\nauthorisation, with the increased differential amount in the counter offer to be attributed\nto the “party and party costs” at the expense of any potential increase in the amount of\ndamages payable to the Complainant and whether in the absence of any such further\nagreement or instruction from the client, the Respondent was obliged to account to the\nComplainant for any increase in the global settlement sum eventually secured and paid.\nTo the Tribunal, the answer to the first issue is in the negative, whilst the answer to the\nsecond issue is in the positive.\n\n38.\n\nAs it turned out, following the Respondent’s acceptance of the final global settlement\nsum of $3,800, the Respondent expected to receive a total cost of $2,658.65, comprising\nof the solicitor and client cost of $535 plus “party and party costs” of $2,123.65. In short,\nthe Respondent’s cost component increased from 65.2% to 70% of the settlement\namount, whilst the Complainant’s recovery component fell from 34.8% to 30% of the\nsettlement amount.\n\n39.\n\nThe statement in CPC’s 11 June Letter to the Complainant “Please note that you may be\nrequired to sign a Discharge Voucher for an amount that is higher than what is stated\nherein as that amount will include our legal cost and disbursements incurred for this\n\n\f- 13 -\n\nfile“ (“the Higher DV Clause”), which has been relied on by the Respondent to justify\nher self-proclaimed entitlement to negotiate and retain the additional “party and party\ncosts“, is really of no assistance to the Respondent because:\n\n(1)\n\nby advising the Complainant to accept the 7 June Proposal and by the\nComplainant’s acceptance of the proposal, there was effectively a separate\nagreement between the Respondent and the Complainant whereby the Respondent\nagreed to charge and the Complainant agreed for the Respondent/CPC to charge\nthe solicitor and client costs of $535 as well as party and party costs of $1,605,\nnotwithstanding any further work which may need to be done as well as further\ndisbursements to be incurred by CPC to bring about the settlement;\n\n(2)\n\nif the aforesaid separate agreement did not extend to any further cost and\ndisbursements incurred by CPC to facilitate the settlement, then the application of\nthe Higher DV Clause should be limited to any additional cost and disbursements\npayable as the party and party cost after the acceptance of the offer and certainly\nnot to an upward variation of the party and party cost already agreed to be paid by\nIII Pte Ltd. As is common knowledge, there is always a reasonable range or\nestimate of damages for personal injury. It should not be the case that a legal\npractitioner should advice his client to accept a lower reasonable offer when there\nis still room to negotiate a higher reasonable figure and then use that headroom to\nnegotiate a higher party and party cost for himself after the client had accepted the\nlower reasonable offer based on the legal practitioner’s advice. Otherwise, it\nwrongly encourages the acceptance of lower reasonable offers for the benefit of the\nlegal practitioner. If any provision in any letter of engagement or warrant to act is\nintended\n\nto\n\nachieve\n\nsuch\n\na\n\npurpose,\n\nit\n\nneeds\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nspelled\n\nout\n\nclearly and in no uncertain terms. The reality is that one rarely finds any clearly\nagreed provision to this effect as most, if not all, reasonable clients would not agree\nto its insertion as the client would realize that he would be giving the legal\npractitioner a licence to advise him to accept a lower reasonable offer and then go\non to negotiate and secure a higher offer with the upward differential to be kept for\nthe benefit of the legal practitioner’s own cost, which would otherwise have been\nfor the benefit of the client.\n\n\f- 14 -\n\n40.\n\nIn the Respondent’s explanatory letter dated 30 November 2018 to the Inquiry\nCommittee, it was stated that the counter proposal of the global settlement amount of\n$4,000 which CPC made on 21 June 2018 “was to take into account disbursements not\npreviously offered as well as to renegotiate costs”. It was clearly not for any party and\nparty cost or disbursements incurred after the acceptance of the 7 June Proposal.\n\n41.\n\nMore importantly, given that the Respondent’s counter-offer by way of the 21 June Offer\nto III Pte Ltd was for a global settlement of $4,000, and this eventually led to a full and\nfinal global settlement of $3,800:\n\n(1)\n\nIII Pte Ltd never agreed to pay any part of the said $3,800 as party and party costs.\nThe party and party costs of $1,605 under the 7 June Proposal was no longer\noperative as it had been rejected by the counter-offer. As such, there was really no\nbasis for the Respondent to claim that any part of it was being paid as “party and\nparty costs” to which she was entitled; and\n\n(2)\n\nstrictly speaking, this global settlement overrode the terms of the 7 June\nProposal (which had been rejected) so that the entire sum of $3,800 or failing that,\nthe increased differential of $518.65 (being the difference between $3,800 and\n$3281.35), is for the benefit of the Complainant and the Respondent is duty bound\nto account to the Complainant for the same. This means that the Respondent has to\nagree with the Complainant as to her total fees instead of unilaterally seeking to\ngazump $2,123.65 or the increased differential by self-proclaiming it as “party and\nparty costs”.\n\n42.\n\nClearly, the Respondent well knew that had she sought the Complainant’s instructions to\nmake the 21 June Offer, or indeed any larger offer, she would have to explain why she\nhad previously advised the Complainant to accept the 7 June Offer in the first place and\nthe Complainant would very likely have wanted all or a substantial part of any increased\namount for himself.\n\n43.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal arrived at the conclusion that the Respondent’s failure to inform\nthe Complainant and obtain the Complainant’s instructions and authorisation before (a)\nmaking the 21 June Offer and (b) accepting the final global settlement offer of $3,800\n\n\f- 15 -\n\nwas not due to any oversight on the Respondent’s part, or any misguided belief as to her\nentitlement to renegotiate the “party and party costs“ after the Complainant had accepted\nthe 7 June Proposal, but was instead part of a deliberate approach designed by the\nRespondent to benefit herself at the expense of the Complainant.\n\n44.\n\nFurthermore, in response to the Tribunal’s query to the Respondent to clarify whether\nshe was still intending to charge the Complainant for legal fees, and if so, the amount\nthereof, the Respondent stated that she was intending to recover her “party and party\ncosts” of $2,123.65 pursuant to the $3,800 global settlement but she was still undecided\nas to whether she would charge the Complainant for the sum of $535 which was the\nsolicitor and client costs which the Complainant had agreed to pay. The Respondent had\nalso explained that her firm was discharged before the settlement monies were paid to\nher firm, but that she still intended to write to the Complainant’s present solicitors to\nfollow up on the recovery of her fees.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal raised the aforesaid query as it wanted to clarify the Respondent’s statement\nin mitigation to the effect that there was no prejudice to the Complainant and that no\nfinancial benefit was received or intended to be received from the matters complained\noff. Indeed, given the Respondent’s response as set out in the preceding paragraph, the\nTribunal considered her statement to the effect that there was no prejudice to the\nComplainant and that no financial benefit was received or intended to be received, to be\nwholly inaccurate and misleading. The solicitors for the Respondent sought to clarify by\nsaying that the Respondent was receiving no financial benefit beyond what she was\nentitled to. The Tribunal found this explanation to be lacking in substance and that her\nstatement in mitigation, to the effect that there was no prejudice to the Complainant and\nno financial benefit was received or intended to be received from the matters complained\nof, was intended to pull wool over the eyes of the Tribunal. In any event, as stated earlier\nin this report, the entire final global settlement amount of $3,800 or failing that, the\nincreased differential amount of $518.65 was rightfully for the benefit of and belonged\nto the Complainant and the Respondent was under a duty to account to the Complainant\nfor the same, and her actions were analogous to or, arguably, even constituted potential\nbreaches of trust.\n\n\f- 16 -\n\nANTECEDENT\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal had enquired before the hearing on 23 March 2020 whether the Respondent\nhad any antecedents of misconduct and was notified by the Law Society that the\nRespondent had a recent antecedent in The Law Society of Singapore v Constance\nMargreat Paglar [2019] SGDT 11 (DT 8/2019) (“Antecedent”). A copy of the same\nwas provided to the Tribunal before the 23 March hearing.\n\n47.\n\nIn that case, the Respondent’s firm CPC was engaged by various owners of vehicles\ninvolved in traffic accidents to claim for losses and/or damages arising therefrom. These\nvarious owners, who were her clients, had appointed the complainant there, JKS Motor\nWorks (Accident Claims) Pte Ltd (“JKS”) as their agent vis-a-vis the Respondent’s firm\nwhich was to take instructions from JKS and keep JKS informed. Nineteen (19) charges\nwere originally preferred against the Respondent, but following representations made on\nher behalf, the Law Society proceeded only with 4 charges, one in relation to each of 4\nseparate clients, under which the Respondent had failed to provide an update of the case\nto the client from various dates ranging from 24 December 2015 to 22 July 2016, up to\nvarious later dates, and was guilty of having breached Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR as\namounted to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section\n83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA. The Respondent pleaded guilty to the 4 charges and the tribunal\nimposed a penalty of $4,000.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal invited submissions from the parties as to whether the Tribunal was at\nliberty to consider the Antecedent for purposes of arriving at the appropriate sanction in\nview of the guilty plea to the amended charge.\n\n49.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that it was not its practice to rely on antecedents but was of\nthe view that for purposes of determining the appropriate sanction after the issue of\nliability had been determined, as in the present case where the Respondent had pleaded\nguilty, the Tribunal was at liberty to give consideration and weight to the Antecedent,\nshould it choose to do so.\n\n\f- 17 -\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent, however, objected to the Tribunal considering the Antecedent for\npurposes of determining the appropriate sanction. The Respondent’s arguments may be\nsummarised as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nThe legislative framework only permitted the Court of Three Judges (“court”) to\ntake into account the past conduct of a respondent to determine what order should\nbe made under section 83(1) of the LPA as provided for in section 83(5) of the LPA\nwhich reads: “In any proceedings under this Part, the court may in addition to\nthe facts of the case take into account the past conduct of the person concerned\nin order to determine what order should be made.”\n\n(2)\n\nSection 82B(5) of the LPA, which concerns disciplinary proceedings of regulated\nnon-practitioners, and section 83A(3) of the LPA, which concerns disciplinary\nproceedings of regulated foreign lawyers, also provide that only the court can take\ninto account a respondent's past conduct when determining what orders should be\nmade.\n\n(3)\n\nUnder section 91(2) of the LPA, there is no provision for a disciplinary tribunal to\nrequest for and take into consideration for purposes of determining the appropriate\norder a respondent’s past conduct. Instead, a disciplinary tribunal is only\nempowered to administer oaths and \"sue out subpoenas to testify or to produce\ndocuments\".\n\n(4)\n\nUnder section 93(1) of the LPA, a disciplinary tribunal “shall record its findings in\nrelation to the facts of the case and according to those facts” (emphasis ours) make\nthe determination prescribed under that section. This implies that a disciplinary\ntribunal can only look at the facts of the specific misconduct that was before it and\ndecide the appropriate order and not have regard to any antecedent past conduct.\n\n(5)\n\nSection 228 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which is encapsulated under the\nCriminal Procedure Code's Plead Guilty Procedures, permits the Court to consider\nan accused's criminal records and any relevant factors which may affect the\nsentence.\n\n\f- 18 -\n\n51.\n\nThe thrust of the Respondent’s submission was that absent a similar express provision\nenabling a disciplinary tribunal to consider the past conduct of a respondent, the Tribunal\nwas simply not empowered to consider the Antecedent for the purpose of determining\nthe appropriate order where liability has already been established.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that given the potentially serious ramifications faced under\nsection 83(1) of the LPA, Parliament had enacted section 83(5) of the LPA empowering\nonly the court to ensure that sufficient checks and balances were in place to ensure fair\nprocess of the proceedings.\n\n53.\n\nThe consequences of the submission are that no matter how bad a past misconduct was\nor how many acts of past misconduct there were, a disciplinary tribunal simply had to\nignore them and deal only with the facts of the misconduct that were before it.\n\n54.\n\nIt would also mean that where there is antecedent misconduct, it would be better to leave\nit to the court to decide on the appropriate order for the present misconduct so that the\norder to be made is reflective of the object of disciplining the errant advocate. In a\nsituation like that, a disciplinary tribunal may have no choice but to send the matter up\nfor the appropriate order to be made by the court.\n\n55.\n\nBy way of illustration, in the Antecedent the Respondent asked for a fine and was given\na fine for the past conduct. In the present proceedings, the Respondent asks only for a\nreprimand, a lower form of punishment. If the Tribunal had not on its own volition asked\nfor antecedents, it would not have known of the Respondent’s past conduct and could\nhave resulted in it making a wrong order.\n\n56.\n\nGiven the above situation, the Tribunal at the conclusion of the hearing invited the\nRespondent to consider whether the Tribunal could look into the Antecedent in deciding\nthe appropriate sanction for the present misconduct, with the caveat that if she did not\nagree there was the possibility that the Tribunal may feel constrained to refer the matter\nto the Court of Three Judges. The Respondent maintained her position that the Tribunal\nshould not consider the Antecedent.\n\n\f- 19 -\n\nDECISION OF TRIBUNAL\n\n57.\n\nSection 93 of the LPA provides as follows:\n\n“93.— (1) After hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary\nTribunal shall record its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according\nto those facts shall determine that —\n\n(a)\n\nno cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83\nor 83A (as the case may be);\n\n(b)\n\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83 or 83A (as the case may be), the regulated legal practitioner should\nbe —\n(i)\n\nordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed;\n\n(ii)\n\nreprimanded;\n\n(iii) ordered to comply with one or more remedial measures; or\n(iv) subjected to the measure in sub-paragraph (iii) in addition to the\nmeasure in sub-paragraph (i) or (ii); or\n\n(c)\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 or\n83A (as the case may be).”\n\n58.\n\nHaving regard to only the facts of the case, the Tribunal determines that cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83. The Tribunal wishes to\nclarify that in arriving at this decision, it has not given weight to the Antecedent.\n\n\f- 20 -\n\n59.\n\nNevertheless, it would be useful if a Court of Three Judges could clarify for the benefit\nof future disciplinary tribunals whether a tribunal is empowered and be at liberty to\nconsider and give weight to a respondent’s antecedent misconduct in arriving at a\ndecision and/or determining the appropriate sanction for the misconduct that is before\nthe tribunal.\nCOSTS\n\n60.\n\nHaving determined under s 93(1)(c) that there is cause of sufficient gravity for\ndisciplinary action, the Tribunal is permitted under section 93(2) of the LPA to make a\ncosts order. The Law Society submitted that the Respondent should pay costs of $8,000\n(all in) for, inter alia, the following reasons:\n\n(1)\n\nbased on the documents given by the Complainant, the Law Society prepared a\nStatement of Case and framed charges against the Respondent;\n\n(2)\n\nthe Law Society prepared a List of Documents;\n\n(3)\n\nthe Law Society reviewed the Respondent's Defence and subsequent\nRepresentations, and engaged in negotiations with the Respondent;\n\n(4)\n\nthe Law Society had to consider and respond to the Respondent’s Mitigation Plea;\n\n(5)\n\nthe Law Society had to amend the initial charges that were preferred against the\nRespondent;\n\n(6)\n\nthe Law Society prepared a substantive affidavit of evidence in chief for the\nComplainant, and a Bundle of Documents for the Disciplinary Tribunal;\n\n(7)\n\nthe Law Society prepared Submissions on Sanction for the Disciplinary Tribunal.\n\n\f- 21 -\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that costs should be about $2,000. Having heard the parties\nin relation to costs, and taking into account also that the Respondent pleaded guilty to the\namended charge, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent pay costs to the Law Society\nof $4,000 (all in).\n\nDated this\n\n12th\n\nday of May 2020\n\n______________________________________\nPresident: Mr Andre Yeap, SC\n\n_________________________________\nMember: Mr G.

Rajah SC\n(Tan\n\nRajah\n\n&\n\nCheah\n\nLLC)\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\nIntroduction\n1\n\nThese disciplinary proceedings arise from a complaint made by Mdm\n\nLim Lay Choo, Mdm Lim Lay Pheng and Mr Lim Teck Guan (“the\nComplainants”) against Mdm Huang Lui (“the Respondent”). The\nRespondent is a practicing advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore who was admitted to the roll on 14 February 1968. At the material\ntime, she was practicing at M/s Wee Swee Teow LLP.\n2\n\nThe charge against the Respondent is that in breach of Rule 17(3)(a) of\n\nthe Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the “Rules”), she\nfailed to inform or sufficiently inform her clients of the basis on which fees for\nprofessional services will be charged, and she has thereby committed an act\namounting to improper conduct in the discharge of her professional duty as an\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nadvocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court, contrary to Section 83(2)(b) of the\nLegal Profession Act (the “LPA”).1\n3\n\nThe Respondent pleads guilty to the charge preferred against her by the\n\nLaw Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”).\n4\n\nThe Respondent having pleaded guilty, the main issue before this\n\nTribunal is whether there is cause of sufficient gravity for the Respondent to be\nreferred to the Court of Three Judges for disciplinary action under Section 83\nof the LPA, or whether the Respondent should be reprimanded and/or ordered\nto pay a penalty sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct, pursuant to\nSection 93(1)(b) of the LPA.\nThe background facts\n5\n\nThe Complainants are amongst the 9 beneficiaries to the Estate of Mdm\n\nTan Bee Eng, deceased, the mother of the Complainants.\n6\n\nThe aforementioned Mdm Lim Lay Choo and Mr Lim Teck Seng,\n\nanother beneficiary to the Estate, were named in the will dated 11 October 2007,\nand were appointed as Joint Executors of the Estate (“Joint Executors”)\npursuant to the will.2\n7\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the 9 beneficiaries attended a meeting with the\n\nRespondent at the Respondent’s office to seek advice on the will. During this\nmeeting, the Joint Executors agreed to appoint the Respondent and her firm,\n\n1\n\nRespondent’s Opening Statement dated 3 February 2021 at page 4\n\n2\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 4\n\n2\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nM/s Wee Swee Teow LLP as the solicitors in the matter of the probate of Mdm\nTan Bee Eng, deceased, with the Respondent taking up principal conduct of the\nmatter.3\n8\n\nDuring this meeting, the Joint Executors signed a Warrant to Act with 2\n\nenclosures: Information on Costs and Information on Disclosure of Documents.\nNotably, both the Warrant to Act and the Information on Costs did not contain\nany provision on the hourly rate of the Respondent or any other fee earner\napplicable for the handling of this matter.4\n9\n\nA fee deposit of S$2000.00 was duly paid into the Respondent’s firm’s\n\nclient account.5\n10\n\nFrom the outset, there were disputes among the 9 beneficiaries over the\n\nactual value of the Estate and their share entitlements under the will. These\ndisputes were resolved at a mediation and the beneficiaries entered into a\nSettlement Agreement dated 25 April 2018. Neither the Respondent nor her firm\nrepresented any of the parties at the mediation.6\n11\n\nOn 15 May 2018, the Respondent obtained the Grant of Probate.7\n\n12\n\nOn 24 May 2018, the Respondent issued tax invoice no. 783/2018 for\n\nthe sum of S$162,897.32. This sum comprised her professional fees of\n\n3\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 3\n\n4 Statement of Case at paragraphs 3-5\n5 Statement of Case at paragraph 3\n6\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 6\n\n7\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 6\n\n3\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nS$150,000, as well as disbursements and taxes. The tax invoice contained a\ngeneral description of the professional services rendered. However, it did not\ngive a breakdown of the work done, time spent, the fee earners involved, and\nthe rates charged.8\n13\n\nSometime in July 2018, Mr Lim Teck Seng paid a sum of S$1,300,000\n\nto the Respondent’s office to be distributed to the beneficiaries in accordance\nwith the terms of the Settlement Agreement.9\n14\n\nOn 17 July 2018 at 10.13am, the Respondent sent an email to the Joint\n\nExecutors seeking confirmation that the sum of S$974,102.68 was payable to\nthe beneficiaries after deducting her bill, as set out in the issued tax invoice,\nfrom the original amount of S$1,300,000.10\n15\n\nMdm Lim Lay Pheng replied to the Respondent on the same day at\n\n2.15pm, objecting to this deduction and requesting that the Respondent release\nthe full sum of S$1,300,000 to the beneficiaries of the Estate. In this same email,\nMdm Lim Lay Pheng also assured the Respondent that there would be sufficient\nmoney to settle her bill, and that her bill could be settled separately to the\ndistribution of the S$1,300,000.11\n16\n\nHowever, the Respondent continued to assert that she was entitled to\n\ndeduct her bill before paying out the distribution to the beneficiaries.\nSpecifically, in her reply email to Mdm Lim Lay Pheng on the same day at\n\n8 Statement of Case at paragraphs 7-9\n9 Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 16\n10\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 18\n\n11\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 19\n\n4\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\n3.18pm, the Respondent stated that under Clause 3 of the Settlement\nAgreement, her bill had to be paid before the distributions were paid out to the\nbeneficiaries.12\n17\n\nFollowing this, still on 17 July 2018 but at 8.32pm, Mdm Lim Lay Pheng\n\nemailed the Respondent on behalf of the Complainants, informing her that the\ntax invoice issued was unclear as to how the professional fees of S$150,000 had\nbeen derived and requesting for a detailed breakdown of the fees. In particular,\nshe requested for: (a) the amount of time spent on each piece of work done (with\na description of the work done), (b) the date on which the work was done, and\n(c) who had done the work together with his/her hourly rate.13\n18\n\nHaving received no reply from the Respondent to the request made on\n\n17 July 2018 for a detailed breakdown of the Respondent’s professional fees,\nMdm Lim Lay Choo emailed the Respondent twice more, on 20 July 2018 and\n29 July 2018, requesting a response to Mdm Lim Lay Pheng’s 17 July 2018\nemail.14\n19\n\nOn 30 July 2018, the Respondent replied to Mdm Lim Lay Choo, stating\n\nthat she was in the course of preparing the breakdown of the bill. However, by\nJanuary 2019, the Respondent still had not provided the Complainants with such\na breakdown.15\n\n12\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 20\n\n13\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 28\n\n14\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 29\n\n15\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraphs 30-31\n\n5\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\n20\n\nOn 24 January 2019, Mdm Lim Lay Choo forwarded an email (sent to\n\nher by Mdm Lim Lay Pheng) to the Respondent, asking the Respondent to have\nher bill taxed by the court. However, the Respondent did not respond to this\nemail either.16\n21\n\nOn 10 February 2019, Mdm Lim Lay Choo sent the Respondent a further\n\nemail. In this further email, Mdm Lim Lay Choo noted the Respondent’s failure\nto reply to the earlier 24 January email and requested the Respondent to respond\nwithin the next 7 days. Mdm Lim Lay Choo also informed the Respondent that\nif she failed to respond within the next 7 days, steps would be taken as may be\nnecessary to tax the Respondent’s bill.17\n22\n\nOn 15 February 2019, the Respondent responded to inform Mdm Lim\n\nLay Choo that she was still in the course of finishing the detailed bill and that\nshe would require an additional week before she could present the detailed bill.\nThe Respondent also explained that this delay in presenting the detailed bill was\ncaused by the fact that a large portion of the work done towards finishing the\ndetailed bill had been accidentally deleted, and had to be re-done.18\n23\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Complainants wrote to the Law Society to make a\n\ncomplaint (“the Complaint”) against the Respondent. At this time, they had\nstill not received a breakdown of the tax invoice or a response from the\nRespondent in relation to the earlier requests for the bill to be taxed. This was\n\n16\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 32\n\n17\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 33\n\n18\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 34\n\n6\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nmore than 8 months since the Complainants had first requested the Respondent\nto provide a breakdown of her bill.19\n24\n\nIn the Complaint, the Complainants alleged that, inter alia, the\n\nRespondent had grossly over-charged them for the probate matter, had failed to\nprovide full particulars or details of the work done despite repeated requests and\nqueries, had refused to respond to repeated requests to tax her bill, and had\ndelayed providing the breakdown of her bill for 9 months.20\n25\n\nFollowing the lodging of the Complaint, on 11 April 2019, the\n\nRespondent finally provided a breakdown of the tax invoice. In the details, the\nRespondent outlined the dates and items of work done. However, the\nRespondent did not provide the time spent, the fee earners involved and their\nhourly rates.21\nProcedural history and amendment of the charge\n26\n\nSometime on or around 1 October 2020, the Law Society’s Statement of\n\nClaim was served on the Disciplinary Tribunal Secretariat.\n27\n\nThe Statement of Claim set out two charges against the Respondent. The\n\n1st charge was that the Respondent had breached Rule 17(3)(a) of the Rules for\nfailing to inform or sufficiently inform her clients of the basis on which her\nprofessional services had been charged, and had thereby committed an act\namounting to “grossly improper conduct” in the discharge of her professional\n\n19\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 12 and Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on\n30 December 2020 at paragraphs 35-36\n\n20\n\nBundle of Documents of the Law Society of Singapore, Tab 16, at paragraph 2\n\n21\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 13\n\n7\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nduty as an advocate and solicitor contrary to Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA\n(emphasis added). The alternative first charge was that by her breach of Rule\n17(3)(a), the Respondent had committed an act of misconduct unbefitting of an\nadvocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA. 22\n28\n\nThis Disciplinary Tribunal was subsequently appointed by the\n\nHonourable The Chief Justice on 16 October 2020.\n29\n\nOn 11 November 2020, the Respondent’s Statement of Defence was\n\nserved on the Tribunal and the Secretariat.\n30\n\nOn 19 November 2020, the Law Society filed their List of Documents.\n\nThe Respondent filed her List of Documents the next day on 20 November\n2020.\n31\n\nOn 30 December 2020, pursuant to the timelines set by the Tribunal, the\n\nRespondent and the Law Society filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief, and the\nLaw Society filed their bundles of documents and bundles of authorities.\n32\n\nOn 2 February 2021, the Law Society filed its Opening Statement\n\ntogether with supplementary bundles of authorities and documents. The\nRespondent filed her Opening Statement the next day on 3 February 2021.\nNotably, in her Opening Statement, the Respondent invited the Law Society to\namend the 1st charge against her by deleting the word “grossly” from the\nexpression “grossly improper conduct” in the 1st charge.23 The Respondent\n\n22\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 21\n\n23\n\nRespondent’s Opening Statement at paragraph 1\n\n8\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nfurther stated that if the requested amendment to the 1st charge was made, she\nwould re-assess her position in relation to her denial of the charges.24\n33\n\nOn 4 February 2021, during the hearing, the Law Society requested for\n\nleave from the Tribunal to amend the 1st charge against the Respondent to\nremove the word “grossly” from the expression “grossly improper conduct”.\nThe Tribunal granted the Law Society leave to make such an amendment.\nFollowing this amendment, the Respondent changed her position to plead guilty\nto the amended 1st charge, with the result that the alternative 1st charge against\nthe Respondent also fell away.\n34\n\nThe Respondent having pleaded guilty to the amended charge, the only\n\nissue for the Tribunal to decide concerned the sanction to be issued against the\nRespondent, if any. Accordingly, the Tribunal heard submissions from both\nparties regarding what sanctions would be appropriate in the circumstances.\nThe parties’ respective positions\n35\n\nCounsel for the Law Society directed the Tribunal’s attention to two\n\ncases: The Law Society of Singapore v Anand K Thiagarajan [2009] SGDT 2\n(“Anand”) and The Law Society of Singapore v Chung Kok Soon [2002]\nSGDSC 2 (“Chung Kok Soon”).\n36\n\nIn Anand, the respondent admitted to his failure to comply with Rule\n\n35(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R1, 2000\nRev Ed), which stated that “[a]n advocate and solicitor shall inform the client\nof the basis on which fees for professional services will be charged and the\n\n24\n\nRespondent’s Opening Statement at paragraph 7\n\n9\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nmanner in which it is expected that those fees and disbursements, if any, shall\nbe paid by the client”. This provision was a precursor to Rule 17(3)(a) of the\nRules. The Tribunal in that case ruled that a reprimand pursuant to s.93(1)(b) of\nthe LPA would be appropriate bearing in mind that the respondent had still\nprovided the complainant with a bill for the work. The Tribunal also ordered the\nrespondent to pay the costs incurred by the Law Society in those proceedings.25\n37\n\nIn Chung Kok Soon, the respondent was charged, inter alia, with grossly\n\nimproper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within the meaning\nof Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, for failing to comply with the provisions of\nRule 35(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 1998. The\nTribunal found that the respondent had breached Rule 35(a) and, in light of this\nbreach, ordered the respondent to be reprimanded for this conduct and to pay\nthe costs of the Law Society.26\n38\n\nCounsel for the Respondent submitted that the present case was not one\n\nof sufficient gravity to be referred to the Court of Three Judges. Instead, it was\nsubmitted that a reprimand and an order to pay the Law Society’s costs would\nnot be inappropriate sanctions for the Respondent’s misconduct.\nThe Tribunal’s determination\n39\n\nThe two cases which Counsel for the Law Society brought to the\n\nTribunal’s attention concerned Rule 35(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 1998. That Rule is substantively identical to Rule 17(3)(a) of\nthe Rules which provides that “[a] legal practitioner must inform his or her client\n\n25\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Anand K Thiagarajan [2009] SGDT 2 at [28] and [31]\n\n26\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Chung Kok Soon [2002] SGDSC 2\n\n10\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nof the basis on which fees for professional services will be charged, and of the\nmanner in which those fees and disbursements (if any) are to be paid by the\nclient”.\n40\n\nIn both those cases, a breach of the obligation to inform a client of the\n\nbasis on which fees for professional services would be charged, attracted a\nreprimand and an order that the Respondent pay the Law Society’s costs of the\nDisciplinary Tribunal proceedings. Bearing these precedents in mind, and\nconsidering all the facts of this case, the Tribunal finds that pursuant to Section\n93(1)(b)(ii) of the LPA, while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary\naction exists under section 83, the Respondent should be reprimanded.\n41\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent should be reprimanded\n\nand ordered to pay the Law Society’s costs fixed at S$5,000 plus reasonable\ndisbursements.\n\n24th day\nFebruary 2021\nDated ________________\nof ______________\n\nMr Cavinder Bull, S.C.\n\nMr Ian Lim\n\nPresident\n\nAdvocate & Solicitor\n\n11\n\n\f","timestamp":"2021-10-06T06:00:51+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2021/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Koh Tien Hua (Respondent), Advocate and Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Koh Tien Hua (Respondent), Advocate and Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from information referred by the Attorney-General pursuant to section 85(3)(b) of the LPA and as such Council is required to refer the matter to a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) for formal investigation.

a manner the Respondent knew or ought to have known was dishonest, to wit, when knowing that the Judicial Managers of the Companies believed that PLL had agreed prior to their appointment to deposit S$2 million towards the costs of managing the Companies whilst under judicial management, caused the Judicial Managers to continue to believe that PLL had agreed to deposit S$2 million towards the costs of managing the Companies whilst under judicial management by sending emails that confirmed that such deposit had been made in part.\n\nFurther Alternative 2nd Charge (Charge 2BB)\n\nFor

management, did not while acting for PLL clarify PLL’s position that it had not agreed to so fund the judicial management.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT; Council’s Sanctions\n\nThe DT first found that they had jurisdiction to deal with the Six Charges.\n\nThe DT then subsequently found that Rule 10(6)(b) of the PCR was not applicable to the facts of the complaint as it was intended to apply to Court proceedings. As such, Charges 1, 2A and 2B which involved a breach of Rule 10(6)(b) of the PCR could not be maintained against the Respondent and were dismissed.\n\nThe DT also found that although there was a Deposit Agreement made between PLL and the Complainants, Charge 1A was not made out against the Respondent as the totality of the evidence before the DT did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the Respondent had assisted or permitted PLL, in a manner which the Respondent considered dishonest or ought to have considered dishonest, in not paying the $500,000 for the Judicial Managers’ fees.\n\nAs for Charges 2AA and 2BB, these were alternative charges to Charge 1A proffered against the Respondent on the basis that there was no Deposit Agreement and, in light of the DT’s finding that there was a Deposit Agreement, it was unnecessary for the DT to deal with Charges 2AA and 2BB.\n\nThe DT thus found that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under section 83 of the LPA.\n\nCouncil adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT with the Respondent and the Complainants bearing their respective costs.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawsoc-mc-assets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/DT_Report_Lee_Teck_Leng_Robson_(DT_4)_20-25.pdf","pdf-content":"DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL SECRETARIAT\n1 SUPREME COURT LANE, SINGAPORE 178879\n\nTEL: 6332 4040, 6332 4060, FAX: 6332 4061\nDT/SEC/04/2020\n1 February 2021\nBY EMAIL\nDirector, Conduct Department\nThe Law Society of Singapore\n39 South Bridge Road\nSingapore 058673\nMr Tan Chuan Thye, SC\nRajah & Tann Singapore LLP\n9 Straits View\nMarina One West Tower\n#06-07\nSingapore 018937\nDear Sirs\nPROCEEDINGS OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\nIN THE MATTER OF LEE TECK LENG ROBSON\nAN ADVOCATE & SOLICITOR\nPursuant to section 93(4)(a) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed),\nI submit a copy of the Report of the Disciplinary Tribunal in respect of Mr Lee Teck\nLeng Robson\n\nYours faithfully\n\nEDWIN SAN\nSECRETARY\nDISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\nC:DT/04/2020.(18D) - ES/NA/AC\n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f61\n\nwas not guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession\nunder Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA;\n\nas Charges 2AA and 2BB were alternative charges to Charge 1A proffered\nagainst the Respondent on the basis that there was no Deposit Agreement, in\nlight of the DT’s finding that there was a Deposit Agreement, it was\nunnecessary for the DT to deal with Charges 2AA and 2BB;\n\npursuant to Section 93(1)(a) of the LPA, the DT determined that no cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83 of the LPA;\nand\n\nthe DT ordered that the Respondent and the Complainants shall each bear\nhis or their respective costs.\n\nDated this\n\n1st\n\nday of February 2021.\n\nPresident\n\nAdvocate & Solicitor\n\nMs Molly Lim, SC\n\nMr Tan Kheng Ann Alvin\n\n\f\f\f\f\f\f\f","timestamp":"2021-10-06T06:00:51+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2021/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Looi Wan Hui, Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-looi-wan-hui-advocate-solicitor\">In the Matter of Looi Wan Hui, Advocate &amp; Solicitor</h3>\n<p>The Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) had determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (<strong>the Act</strong>) that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of $8,000.</p>\n<p>The proceedings against the Respondent arose out of a complaint lodged against him by a fellow Director of the Respondent’s former law practice.

The said client filed a complaint against the Respondent with the Law Society on 12 October 2015, which led to the present proceedings.\n\n\nThe following charges were preferred against the Respondent at the onset of the proceedings:\n\n1st Charge\n\n“You, Chan Chun Hwee Allan, are charged that you, on or about 8 September 2014, at 133 New Bridge Road, #14-06 Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413, did charge your client a total fee of $32,768.20 (including $268.20 for disbursements) for work done by you as his solicitor for the period 7 August 2013 to 8 September 2014, as evidenced by your Bill No.1582/14 dated 8 September 2014, which fee was far in excess of and disproportionate to what you were reasonably entitled to charge for the services rendered to your client, and such overcharging by you amounts to a breach of Rule 38 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (“PCR”), and you have thereby breached a rule of conduct made by the Council under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act as amounts to grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.”\n\n2nd Charge\n\n“You, Chan Chun Hwee Allan, are charged that you, on or about 24 April 2015, at 133 New Bridge Road, #14-06 Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413, did charge your client a total fee of $72,063.80 (including $563.80 for disbursements) for work done by you as his solicitor for the period 7 August 2013 to 8 September 2014, as evidenced by your Bill of Costs No. FC/BC11/2015 dated 24 April 2015, which fee was far in excess of and disproportionate to what you were reasonably entitled to charge for the services rendered to your client, and such overcharging by you amounts to a breach of Rule 38 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, and you have thereby breached a rule of conduct made by the Council under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act as amounts to grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.”\n\nAdditionally, an alternative 2nd charge was tendered against the Respondent citing section 83(2)(h) of the Act for misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\nAt the onset of the disciplinary proceedings, the Respondent contended that both charges were against the rule of duplicity as they were related to overcharging for the same set of work done. He contended that only the 1st Charge should be considered by the DT. However, the DT determined that both charges were related to separate and distinct acts. While the 1st charge was related to his invoice, the 2nd charge was related to the Bill of Costs presented for taxation instead.\n\nFindings by the DT\n\nWhilst the DT was of the view that there had been breaches of Rule 38 of the PCR as per both charges, the DT did not consider these breaches as amounting to grossly improper conduct on the part of the Respondent. Otherwise, the DT accepted the Respondent’s explanation and found that the nature of the errors relating to the wrongful inclusion of items in the Bill of Costs pointed to an oversight rather than deceit. Moreover, this was the presentation of a Bill of Costs, and not the presentation of an invoice, so it is an act one step removed from requiring payment by the Complainant and hence an act one step removed from bringing pressure to bear on him to pay the bill. Although the breaches did not amount to grossly improper conduct, the DT found the Respondent’s conduct unsatisfactory and that the alternative 2nd charge set out below was made out.\n\nAlternative 2nd Charge\n\n“You, Chan Chun Hwee Allan, are charged that you, on or about 24 April 2015, at 133 New Bridge Road, #14-06 Chinatown Point, Singapore 059413, did charge your client a total fee of $72,063.80 (including $563.80 for disbursements) for work done by you as his solicitor for the period 7 August 2013 to 8 September 2014, as evidenced by your Bill of Costs No. FC/BC11/2015 dated 24 April 2015, which fee was far in excess of and disproportionate to what you were reasonably entitled to charge for the services rendered to your client, and further, in which Bill of Costs, you included items which you are not legally entitled to claim fees for work done and such conduct by you amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act.”\n\nGiven the said circumstances, the DT determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Act that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000. Further, the DT ordered the Respondent to bear the costs of these proceedings, to be taxed if not agreed.\n\nThe Council’s Decision\n\nPursuant to section 94(3)(a) of the Act, the Council agreed with the determination of the DT and ordered the Respondent to pay a penalty of $5,000.\n\n\n","timestamp":"2020-06-06T06:00:04+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jun-2020/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Kang Bee Leng Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<p><strong>In the Matter of Kang Bee Leng</strong><br>\n<strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></p>\n<p>The Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) had determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (<strong>the Act</strong>) that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be reprimanded and ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000.</p>\n<p>The proceedings against the Respondent arose out of a complaint by the Attorney-General that the Respondent had breached Rule 70D of the Act.

The\nRespondent is Mr Lee's daughter-in-law, and she is married to the\n.\nyoungest of Mr Lee's three children, Mr Lee Hsien Yang (“Mr LHY\")\nThe Last Will increased Mr LHY’s share in Mr Lee's estate (the\n“Estate”), as compared with Mr Lee’s immediate preceding will.\nThe Respondent is an advacate and solicitor of 37 years’ standing.\nShe is the founder of Stamford Law Corporation (“Stamford Law”),\nnow Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC (\"MLS\"), and was its Senior\nDirector at the material time. She is currently a director of MLS.\nOn 13 February 2019, the Honourable Chief Justice appointed this\nDisciplinary Tribunal (the “Tribunal’) to hear and investigate the\nmatter.\n\nThe Charges against the Respondent\nThe Law Society preferred two primary charges against the\nRespondent. These are brought on the ground of grossly improper\nconduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n2009 Rev Ed) (the ‘LPA\"), read with the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap. 161, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) (the\n“PCR”). Alternative and further alternative charges were also\n\n\fformulated, for each of the two primary charges (collectively the\n“Charges”). The Charges are:\nFirst Charge\n\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule\n25(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules (Cap. 161, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) in that you failed to\nadvance your client’s interest unaffected by your interest\nand/or the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang,\nby preparing and arranging for the execution of your\nclient's will where a one-third share in 'your client's\nestate was to be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, such act amounting to grossly improper conduct\nin the discharge of your professional duty within the\nmeaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap.\n161, 2008 Rev Ed).\n(“‘Charge 1”)\nOR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE\n\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule\n25(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules {Cap. 161, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) in that you failed to\nadvance your client's interest unaffected by your interest\n\nand/or the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang,\n\nby preparing and arranging for the execution of your\nclients will where a one-third share in your client’s\nestate was to be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, such act amounting to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning\nof s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).\n\n\f(“Charge 1A\")\nOR, IN THE FURTHER ALTERNATIVE\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n\n2013, you failed to advance Mr Lee Kuan Yew's interest\n\nunaffected by your interest and/or the interest of your\nhusband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by preparing and\n\narranging for the execution of Mr Lee Kuan Yew's will\nwhere a one-third share in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's estate\nwas to be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang,\nsuch act amounting to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\nCourt or as a member of an honourable profession\n\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\nAct (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(‘Charge 1B”)\nSecond Charge\n\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 46 of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap. 161, R1,\n2010 Rev Ed) by acting in respect of a significant gift (a\none-third share in your client’s estate) that your client\nintended to give by will to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, and failing to advise your client to be\nindependently advised in respect of this significant gitt,\nsuch acts amounting to grossly improper conduct in the\ndischarge of your professional duty within the meaning\nof s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).\n(“Charge 2\")\nOR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE\n\n\fThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\n\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 46 of the Legal\n\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap. 161, R1,\n2010 Rev Ed) by acting in respect of a significant gift (a\none-third share in your client’s estate) that your client\n\nintended to give by will to your hushand, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, and failing to advise your client to be\nindependently advised in respect of this significant gift,\nsuch act amounting to improper conduct or practice as\nan advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s\n\n83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).\n(“Charge 2A\")\nOR, IN THE FURTHER ALTERNATIVE\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, by acting in respect ofa significant gift (a one-third\nshare in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's estate) that Mr Lee Kuan\nYew intended to give by will to your husband, Mr Lee\nHsien Yang, and failing to advise Mr Lee Kuan Yew to\nbe independently advised in respect of this significant\ngift, such act amounting to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\n\nCourt or as a member of an honourable profession\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\nAct (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(“Charge 2B\")\n\nThe Respondent has defined the first primary Charge as ‘Charge 1\",\nand the alternative first Charge and further alternative first Charge as\n“Charge 1A” and \"Charge 1B\" respectively. Similarly, the second\nprimary Charge has been defined as “Charge 2\", and the alternative\nsecond Charge and further alternative second Charge as “Charge 2A”\n\n\fand “Charge 2B\" respectively. The Tribunal will adopt these\ndefinitions.\nAs would be apparent, each of the alternative and further alternative\n\nCharges are premised on the same conduct, as their corresponding\nprimary Charges. However:\n(a)\n\nThe primary Charges (Charges 1 and 2) are premised on the\nconduct in question being grossly improper conduct, as\ndefined in section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n(b}\n\nThe alternative Charges (Charges 1A and 2A) are brought on\nthe alternative ground in section 83(2)(b) of the LPA\n(“improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor”).\n\n(c)\n\nThe further alternative Charges (Charges 1B and 2B) are\nunlike their respective primary and alternative Charges, in that\n(i) they are not premised on the existence of a retainer\n\nbetween the Respondent and Mr Lee, and (ii) they are brought\nunder section 83(2)(h) of the LPA (“misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor”).\nThe Respondent pleaded not guilty to all the Charges. Proceedings\nbefore the Disciplinary Tribunals are quasi-criminal in nature. This\n\nmeans that the Law Society has to prove its case against the\nRespondent beyond reasonable doubt.\nBackaround\n\nWe will first set out briefly the undisputed background facts. We will,\nwhere necessary, also refer to emails and other documents. The\nrespective parties’ evidence and positions will be considered, as\nappropriate, when we set out our views.\n\n\fA The relevant parties\n10.

Subsequently, he served as Senior Minister,\nand thereafter Minister Mentor.\n11 Other than Mr LHY, Mr Lee’s two other children (in order of age) are\nMr Lee Hsien Loong (“Mr LHL\") and Dr Lee Wei Ling (“Dr LWL\").\n12. Mr Lee’s wife, Mdm Kwa Geok Choo, passed away in October 2010.\nThereafter, and before the Last Will in December 2013, Mr Lee\n\nexecuted six other wills (the “First Will\" to the \"Sixth Wil\" or\n“Penultimate Will\"). Ms Kwa Kim Li (\"Ms KKL\"), a pariner in the law\nfirm Lee & Lee, prepared all these six Wills for Mr Lee.\n13. Mr Lee was 90 years old when he signed the Last Will in December\n\n2013. He passed away in March 2015.\n\n8 Mr Lee’s First to Sixth Wills\n14. Mr Lee’s First to Sixth Wills were executed on the following dates:\n\n(@)\n\nFirst Will - 20 August 2011;\n\n(b)\n\nSecond Will = 21 December 2011;\n\n{c)\n\nThird Will - 6 September 2012;\n\n(d)\n\nFourth Will - 20 September 2012;\n\n(e)\n\nFifth Will — 4 October 2012; and\n\n\f(f)\n\nSixth (or Penultimate) Will — 2 November 2012.\n\n18. Ms KKL retained the originals of all six Wills\".\n\n© Mr Lee’s First Will\n16. Mr Lee executed his First Wili on 20 August 2011. it is not in dispute\nthat this First Will was drafted by Ms KKL. It is also not in dispute that\nthe Respondent made some drafting suggestions to Ms KKL, with Mr\n\nLee's approval, on the First Will. At the time, there had been\ndiscussions between Mr Lee and his three children, Mr LHL, Dr LWL\n\nand Mr LHY, regarding the future of Mr Lee’s residence at 38 Oxley\nRoad (38 Oxley”). These discussions sometimes included Mr Lee's\ndaughters-in-law, namely the Respondent and Ms Ho Ching.\n\n17. On 17 August 2011, the Respondent emailed Mr Lee, with Mr LHY\nand Dr LWL in copy, with a draft of a passage to be included in Mr\nLee's First Will2. Mr Lee then instructed Ms KKL to include the portion\ndrafted by the Respondent in his First Will®,\n18. On 19 August 2011, at 11.06pm, the Reépondent emailed Mr Lee\nand Ms KKL, attaching a document titled “WILL-LKY — Draft of 19\n\nAugust 2011 — v3.DOC”*, The document contained additional edits\nthat the Respondent had made to the draft. The changes made to the\n\ndraft document were marked up. This was the final draft of the First\nWill, which Mr Lee executed the following day, on 20 August 201 18,\n* See paragraph 266 of this Decision.\n\n2 Law Society's Bundle of Documents (‘LSS BOD\"), Vol 1, p 91, email from the Respondent to Mr Les,\nMr LHY and Dr LWL dated 17 August 2011, 11.21pm.\n3158 BOD, Vol 1, p 91, email from Mr Lee to the Respondent, Ms KKL, Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 17\nAugust 2011, 11.23pm.\n4SS BOD, Vol 1, p 101 — 108, email from the Respondent to Ms KKL and Mr Lee dated 19 August\n2011, 11:06pm, with the attachment “WILL-LKY — Draft of 19 August 2011 - v3.DOC\".\n5188 BOD, Vol 1, p 107 — 112, First Will executed by Mr Lee on 20 August 2011,\n\n\f(D) Mr Lee’s subsequent changes to his Wills\n19. Subsequently, Mr Lee executed five further wills before the Last Will.\nSome of the differences between Mr Lee's First to Sixth Wills\nconcerned the following areas:\n(a)\n\nWhat shares in the Estate each child would receive;\n\n(b)\n\nWhether the Will contained a Demolition Clause (setting out\nMr Lee's wishes for his residence at 38 Oxley to be\ndemolished after his passing) and, if so, which of two versions\nof the Demolition Clause; and\n\n(c)\n\nWhether Dr LWL was to be given a right to reside at 38 Oxley\nafter Mr Lee’s passing and, if so:\n(i)\n\nWhether Dr LWL's right to reside at 38 Oxley was (A)\nstated to be free of rent; and/or (B) subject to Mr LHL's\nconsent; and\n\n(i)\n\nWhether Mr LHL was to pay for the upkeep of 38 Oxley,\nfor as long as Dr LWL stayed there.\n\nA table setting out these differences is at Annex AS.\n20. Some of the changes in the Wills were as follows:\n(a)\n\nIn the Second Will, the clause granting Dr LWL a right to reside\nin 38 Oxley was removed;\n\n& The Wills are in LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 264 - 289,\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn the Third Will, Dr LWL was granted a life interest in the\nEstate in place of the one-third share she had been given in\nthe First and Second Wil's;\n\n(c)\n\nIn the Fourth Will, the distribution of the Estate in equal shares\n\nwas restored;\n(d)\n\nInthe Fifth Will, a right to reside at 38 Oxley was granted again\nto Dr LWL. The Demolition Clause (relating to the demolition\nof 38 Oxley) was removed; and\n\n(e)\n\nIn the Sixth (or Penultimate) Will, the shares that Mr Lee's\nchildren would receive upon his death were amended, such\n\nthat there was a total of seven shares. Mr LHL and Mr LHY\neach received two shares, whilst Dr LWL received three\nshares (one share more than each of her brothers).\n\n21. All of Mr Lee's First to Sixth Wills contained a gift-over clause, which\nmade provision for the scenarios where any of Mr Lee's children\npredeceased him. The same gift-over clause was included in all of\nthese wills, save for the Third Will (which granted Dr LWL only a life\n\ninterest in the Estate), wherein the gift-over clause was amended fo\nprovide that if Dr LWL pre-deceased Mr Lee, her share in the Estate\nwould lapse. (See Annex A.)\n\n(E) Mr Lee’s Sixth (or Penultimate) Will\n22. As stated above, Mr Lee’s Sixth (or Penultimate) Will, which was\nsigned slightly over a year before the Last Will, gave Dr LWL an extra\nshare in the Estate.\n23. This appears to be the only difference between the Fifth and Sixth\nWills. Like Mr Lee’s Fifth Will, the Sixth Will did not contain any\n\n\fDemolition Clause, and Dr LWL's right to reside at 38 Oxley was\nmade subject to Mr LHL's consent.\n24, Thus, the position as of the Sixth Will was that (a) Mr Lee did not want\nto include the Demolition Clause for 38 Oxley, and (b) Dr LWL’s right\nto reside at 38 Oxley was made subject to Mr LHL's consent.\n25. On Mr Lee’s instructions, both the Fifth and Sixth Wills also expressly\nstated that Dr LWL's right to reside at 38 Oxley did not give Dr LWL\n\na life interest in the property.\n26. The Last Will made significant changes to the Sixth Will in respect of\nthe shares that each child would receive. A Demolition Clause was\n\nadded. There were also other changes (these will be dealt with later).\n\n(F) Events preceding the Last Will\n27. In 2013, Mr Lee's health deteriorated. Between September and\nOctober 2013, Mr Lee was hospitalised for an extended period, over\nseveral weeks, due to a number of different medical issues. These\nincluded pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and transient ischemic attack\n\n(or mini strokes)\".\n28. The\n\ndocumentary\n\nevidence,\n\nand\n\nin\n\nparticular,\n\nthe\n\nemail\n\ncorrespondence between Ms KKL and Mr Lee, shows that sometime\naround 30 November 2013 (17 days prior to Mr Lee signing his Last\n\nWill), Mr Lee had asked Ms KKL about his Sixth (or Penultimate) Will.\nIt is apparent that Ms KKL envisaged that Mr Lee would make\n7 |t was the Respondent's own case before the Tribunal that Mr Lee had been in and out of the hospital\nin September and October 2013.\nSee Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 23, 24; Respondent’s Closing Submissions (16 August\n2019) at para 11; Gounsel for the Law Society canfirmed that they were not challenging Mr LHY’s\nevidence on the issue. See Transcripts, 4 July 2019, Page 147 line 1 to line 5 (hereinafter the notation\nused will be: “Transcripts (4 July 2018), 147:1-58\").\n\n\famendments or changes to the Sixth Will. Mrs KKL sent an email of\n30 November 20132 and the final line of her email to Mr Lee read:\n“Please et me know your thoughts, and | can make the appropriate\n\nchanges to the Will. The last email exchange between Mr Lee and\nMs KKL, on his will, during this period was on 13 December 20138,\n\n29. The upshot of the discussions between Mr Lee and Ms KKL was that,\nas of 13 December 2013, Mr Lee instructed Ms KKL to make two\n\nchanges, through a codicil, to the Sixth (or Penultimate) Will: (a) first,\nto give his three children equal shares in his Estate; and (b) second,\nto bequeath two carpets (one silk and the other wool) to MrLHY. Thus,\nas of four days before the Last Will was signed on 17 December 2013,\nMr Lee's decision was to keep to the terms of his Penultimate Will,\n\nwith the above two changes to be made, and these changes were to\nbe made through a codicil.\n\n© The Last Will\n30. In the evening of 16 December 2013, at 7.08pm, the Respondent sent\nMr Lee a draft of what eventually became the Last Will. The\ncircumstances in which the Respondent came to send this draft to Mr\nLee are discussed in Section VIII(B) below. The Respondent’s\nposition™ is that Mr Lee independently decided that he would make\nthe Last Will, the terms of which were substantially different from what\nhe had discussed with Ms KKL, three days earlier (see paragraphs\n\n28 - 29 above).\n\nLSS BOD, Vol 1, p 162 — 163, email from Ms KKL to Mr Lee dated 30 November 2013, 11.25am.\n\n9 LSS BOD, Vol 1, 168, emall from Mr Lee to Ms KKL dated 13 December 2013, 10.50pm.\n10 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 76.\n\n11\n\n\f31 It is not disputed that both the Respondent and Mr LHY were aware,\nwhen the Respondent's email was sent, that Ms KKL was likely to be\n\ntravelling, and might not respond'\".\n32, The Respondent’s email of 7.08pm on 16 December 2013 stated as\n\nfollows'2:\n“Dear Pa Pa\n\nThis was the original agreed Will which ensures that all 3 children\nreceive equal shares, taking into account the relative vajuations (as\nat the date of demise) of the properties each receives.\n\nKim Li\nGrateful if you could please engross.\nKind regards\nFern”\n33. Parties are agreed that the Respondent intended, by the phrase\n“original agreed Will', to refer Mr Lee's First Will (signed in August\n2011), and that the phrase would have been understood by Mr Lee\nas such.\n\n34, However, the draft which the Respondent attached was not the First\nWill. The draft which the Respondent sent to Mr Lee differed from the\nFirst Will in the following main respects:\n\n1 Transeript (3 July 2019), 86:7-11; Transcript (4 July 2019), 132:31 —133:21; Transcript (6 July 2019),\n1:20-32.\n12 gS BOD, Vol 1, p 174, email from the Respondent to Mr Lee, Mr LHY and Ms KKL dated 16\n.\nDecember 2013, 7.08pm.\n12\n\n\f(a)\n\nFirst, the First Will contained a gift-over clause. This was\nmissing from the draft.\n\n{b)\n\nSecond, the First Will made provision for Mr LHL to pay for the\nupkeep of 38 Oxley while Dr LWL was in occupation. This was\nalso missing from the draft.\n\n(See Annex B for a detailed comparison.)\n\n35, Itis not in dispute that what the Respondent told Mr Lee (“This was\n\nthe original agreed Will...\") is not accurate®. It is also not in dispute\nthat Mr Lee was entitled to, and would have relied on, what the\n\nRespondent had told him'. The draft which the Respondent sent to\nMr Lee (in addition to being different from the First Will) was also\ndifferent from the Sixth (or Penultimate) Will in the following ways:\n(a)\n\nAs the Respondent's email indicated, the draft gave Mr Lee's\nthree children equal shares in his estate. The Penultimate Will\nhad given Dr LWL an extra share, compared to her two\nbrothers.\n\n(b)\n\nIn addition, the draft reinserted a version of the Demolition\nClause. This was not in the Penultimate Will.\n\n(c)\n\nThe draft also gave Dr LWL an unfettered right to stay at 38\nOxley. In the Penultimate Will, this was conditional upon Mr\nLHL’s consent.\n\n(d)\n\nFinally, the draft removed the gift-over clause which was in the\nPenultimate Will (and which was also in Mr Lee's First to Fifth\nWills (see paragraph 21 above)).\n\n3 Transcript (3 July 2019), 20:8-12; 28:1-4; see also Annex B.\n4 Transcript (3 July 2019), 30:30 — 31:8.\n13\n\n\f(See Annex C for a detailed comparison.)\n\n36. The Last Will, signed on 17 December 2013, was in the same terms\nas the draft that the Respondent sent to Mr Lee on 16 December\n2013. it is not in dispute that other than the change in shares, the\ndifferences between the Penultimate Will and the Last Will were not\nbrought to Mr Lee’s attention (see also paragraphs 534 - 544 below).\nIt is also not in dispute that the Last Will did not incorporate the\nsecond change that Mr Lee had wanted to make to his Penultimate\n\nWill (see paragraph 29 above), which he had discussed with Ms KKL.\n\n37. Thus, the Last Will was substantially different from what Mr Lee had\nwanted, when he had iast discussed and agreed (with Ms KKL) on\namendments to his Penultimate Will, four days earlier on 13\n\nDecember 2013 (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above)®. Mr Lee had\nthen decided, as of 13 December 2013, to keep his Penultimate Will\n\nintact, with only the two changes (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above)\nto be made by way of a codicil.\n38. The Respondent then spoke to Mr Bemard Lui (“Mr BL\"), a partner\nfrom her law firm (Stamford Law), to brief him about the Last Wil, and\n\nrequest his assistance with its engrossment and witnessing.\n\n15 The final email exchange between Mr Lee and Ms KKL was on 13 December 2013 (see paragraphs\n28 and 28 of this Decision). The Respondent sent the draft Last Will to Mr Lee on 16 December 2013\n\n(which was 3 days after 13 December 2013), and Mr Lee signed it (the Last Will) on 17 December 2013\n(which was four days after 13 December 2013). The Tribunal will refer to the events of 16 and 17\n\nDecember 2013 as taking place three to four days after the discussions between Mr Lee and Ms KKL\n(on 13 December 2013), as appropriate.\n\n18 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 41-43; the Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 18.\n\n14\n\n\f39. At 7.31pm, after the Respondent spoke to Mr BL, Mr LHY replied to\nthe email the Respondent had sent. Mr LHY's email was addressed\n\nto Mr Lee, and read'”:\n\n“Pa\n] couldn’t get in touch with Kirn Li. | believe she is away. | don’t think\nit is wise to wait till she is back. I think all you need is a witness to\nsign the will. Fern can get one of her partners to come round with\n\nan engrossed copy of the will to execute and witness. They can\ncoordinate it with Lin Hoe fora convenient time.\nYang”\n\nThe “Lin Hoe” referred to above is Ms Wong Lin Hoe (‘Ms WLH\"),\nwho was then Mr Lee’s personal assistant, in his office.\nMr LHY removed Ms KKL from this email’®. (Apart from Mr Lee and\nMr LHY, only the Respondent and Ms WLH were copied.) Thereafter,\nMs KKL was not copied on subsequent email exchanges leading up\nto the execution of the Last Will.\n\n40. The Respondent emailed Ms WLH, Mr LHY and Mr BL at 8.12pm™®,\nThe Respondent said that she introduced Mr BL to Mr LHY and Ms\n\nWLH through this email?®. She instructed Ms WLH to contact Mr BL,\nregarding the execution of the Last Will. She said to Ms WLH that Mr\n17188 BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to the Respondent, Mr Lee and Ms WLH dated 16\nDecember 2013, 7.31pm.\n\n18 .85 BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to the Respondent, Mr Lee and Ms WLH dated 16\nDecember 2013, 7.31pm.\n191SS BOD, Vol 1, p 179, email from the Respondent to Ms WLH, Mr LHY and Mr Bl dated 16\nDecember 2013, 8.12pm.\n\n20 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 20.\n\n15\n\n\fBL had the Last Will “ready for execution” and told Ms WLH to contact\nMr BL “to make arrangements”.\n41. In response to Mr LHY’s email of 7.31pm (see paragraph 39), Mr Lee\nreplied to Mr LHY and the Respondent, at 9.42pm, saying?\":\n“Ok. Do not walft for Kim Li,\n\nEngross and | will sign it before a solicitor in Fern’s office, or from\nany other office.”\n42, Various emails were then exchanged, regarding Mr Lee’s execution\nof the Last Will. The parties to these emails included the Respondent,\nMr LHY, Ms WLH and/or Mr BL.\n43. At the time of these exchanges, the Respondent and Mr LHY were\nrespectively en route to, or in Paris and Australia.\n\n44, At 4.53am on 17 December 2013, Mr LHY replied to Mr Lee’s email\n(see paragraph 41 above)?2. He informed Mr Lee:\n“We will get someone to come to execute if either in Oxley Road or\nat your office at your convenience. Lin Hoe has the contacts and will\narrange it. One of the partners at Stamford Law who is a notary\npublics.”\n45, At 10:08pm on 16 December 2019, Dr LWL emailed Mr LHY stating\n“To get a notary public not from Lee n Lee to witness his signature n\n\n21 .88 BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr_Lee dated 16 December 2013, 9.42pm,\n\n22188 BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to Mr Lee, Ms WLH and the Respondent dated 17\nDecember 2013, 4.53am.\n\n15\n\n\fthat settles it’?®. At 4.54am, Mr LHY replied to Dr LWL's email with\n\nthe subject *Re: Papa says go back to 2011 wilf'. He wrote®:\n“Will arrange. Lin Hoe has contacts. Will get person to come fo\nOxley Road or Istana whichever is more convenient.”\n\n46. Subsequently, at 5.32am, Mr LHY emailed Mr BL?, forwarding the\nRespondent's email to Ms WLH (see paragraph 40 above). Mr LHY\nrequested that Mr BL engross a copy of the will, as Mr Lee wished to\nhave it executed. He asked that Mr BL be available, when Ms WLH\ngot in touch. Mr BL acknowledged and replied to Mr LHY, with the\n\nRespondent in copy, at 9.02am?.\n47. At 9.22am, the Respondent emailed Mr BL? with the message\n“please be ready and accessible at short notice. Ready to go. Impt\n\nthat we get this done asap please®. From the email chain exhibited\n\nby Mr BL in his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (\"Mr BL’s Affidavit’), it\nappears that the Respondent had replied to Mr BL's email to Mr LHY\nat 9.02am (see paragraph 46 above). However, Mr LHY appears not\nto have been copied in this email from the Respondent. Mr BL\n\nacknowledged and replied to the Respondent at 9.23am?.\n\n23| 85 BOD, Vol 1, p 189, email from Dr LWL dated 16 December 2013, 10.08pm.\n24 55 BOD, Vol 1, p 189, email from Mr LHY to Dr LWL, the Respondent, Ms WLH dated 17 December\n2013, 4.54am.\n25|85 BOD, Vol 1, p 190, email from Mr LHY to Mr BL and the Respondent dated 17 December 2013,\n5.32am.\n26| §S BOD, Vol 1, p 182, email from Mr BL to Mr LHY and the Respondent dated 17 December 2013,\n9.02am.\n\n27 Law Sociely's Supplementary Bundle of Documents (‘LSS SBOD\"), p 10, emall from the Respondent\nto Mr BL dated 17 December 2013, 9.22am.\n\n28 My, BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) af para 16.\n\n28 | 88 SBOD, p 9, email from Mr BL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 9.23am.\n\n17\n\n\f48. At 9.23am as well, Ms WLH emailed the Respondent™® (in reply to the\nRespondent's email of 18 December 2013 at 8.12pm (see paragraph\n\n40 above)) informing the Respondent that she would coordinate with\nMr BL in relation to making an appointment with Mr Lee. Mr LHY and\nMr BL were copied on this email.\n49. At 9.24am, the Respondent emailed Mr BL again, on the email chain,\nstating the following:\n\n“be good to run. Are engrossments ready?”®!\nMr BL responded to the Respondent at 10.13am, stating:\n\n“Preparing. 11am. EK will be with me. | keep the Will?32\"\n50. It appears that by 10.13am, Ms WLH had been told to fix, or was in\nthe process of fixing, an appointment with Mr Lee, at 11am that\nmorning. This is borne out by the fact that Ms WLH emailed Mr Lee\n\nat 10.17am® (with the Respondent, Mr LHY and Dr LWL being\ncopied), to inform Mr Lee that Mr BL and Ms Elizabeth Kong (“Ms EK”)\n(another lawyer from the Respondent's law firm, Stamford Law),\nwould be seeing Mr Lee at his residence at 11am.

He was slurring in his\nspeech so it was very difficult to understand what he was saying.\nBut he is definitely still very lucid — he asked Bemard who drafted\nthe will, twice... and Bernard wasn't entirely sure but mentioned it\nwas primarily you and Ms Kwa from Lee & Lee.\n\nLKY read through every single line and was comfortable to sign.”\n60. At 12.26pm, the Respondent emailed Mr BL, Ms Clara Ng, and one\n\nMs Joyce Han, also from Stamford Law, with Ms EK in copy*. The\nRespondent gave instructions on what was to be done with the two\noriginals of the Last Will. She instructed that a copy be made for her\n(the Respondent) to retain, that one original be given to Ms WLH, and\nthe other original to be kept in the safe at her office (Stamford Law).\nSubsequently, at 12.45pm, the Respondent emailed Ms WLH, to\ninform her that the Respondent’s office would be arranging to send\none original of the Last Will to Ms WLH for safekeeping, and the\nsecond original would be kept in her (the Respondent’s) office safe®.\n43 .88 BOD, Vol 1, p 201, email from Mr LHY to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 12.21pm.\n44 .88 SBOD, p 6, email from Ms EK to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 12.25pm.\n\n— 15, email from the Respondent to Mr BL, Ms Joyce Han, Ms Clara Ng and Ms EK\n45 |SS SBOD, p 14\ndated 17 December 2013, 12.26pm.\n46 |.SS BOD, Vol 1, p 203 — 204, email from the Respondent to Ms WLH, Mr LHY, Mr BL dated 17\n\nDecember 2013, 12.45pm.\n\n21\n\n\f81.

The\nRespondent’s email of 1,16pm went back to the email chain where\nshe had sent an email to Mr Lee, copying Ms KKL, of 16 December\n\n2013, at 7.08pm, and where she had asked Ms KKL to engross the\ndraft of the Last Will (referred to at paragraph 32 above). (The\nsubsequent emails, after that email of 16 December 2013, 7.08pm,\n\nhad left Ms KKL out. Ms KKL had been removed from the address\nlist.)\n\n62. Ms KKL replied at 2.59pm to say*®:\n“ .. | don’t seem to have received your first mail of 16 dec 7.08pm\nasking me to engross.\nWith reference to your emaif of 17 dec, does this mean that he has\nsigned a new will yesterday, in which case the former wifl which is\non my record, is revoked?

Ms\nWLH enquired whether Mr Lee would fike to keep Original A in his\noffice safe, or pass it to Ms KKL for safekeeping. Ms WLH also\nhighlighted to Mr Lee that Ms KKL was keeping all the originals of the\n“title deeds of all the properties, including 38 Oxley Road\".\n66. Mr Lee replied at 6.38pm, saying simply: “Yes, Kwa Kim Li®2 Ms\nWLH replied to Mr Lee at 7.01pm, noting his instructions, and\ninforming Mr Lee that she would arrange for the original of the Last\nWill (Original A), to be passed to Ms KKL®.

She\ninformed Mr BL that “the suggestion is that [Stamford Law] pass other\n\ncopy to Kim Li and [Lee & Lee].

There is also an email on 17 December 2013%7, from Ms EK to Mr BL,\nwith an attendance note (the “EK Attendance Note”), from the\n\nexecution of the Last Will. This was sent to Mr BL at 4.32pm. The EK\nAftendance Note was as follows5®:\n“1. We arrived and met with LKY today (17 Dec) at his residence,\n38 Oxley Road S238629, at approximately 11.10AM.\n2.

As stated previously, the substantive provisions of the Last Will, that\nwas signed by Mr Lee on 17 December 2013, were identical to the\ndraft that the Respondent had sent to Mr Lee the previous evening\n(16 December 2013), by way of her email of 7.08pm (see paragraph\n32 above).\n\n*) Mr Lee’s Codicil\n71. On 2 January 2014, Mr Lee prepared and executed a codicil to the\nLast Wil (the “Codicil’). The Codicil bequeathed two carpets (one\nsilk and the other wool) to Mr LHY. This was in accordance with what\nMr Lee had previously discussed with Ms KKL (see paragraphs 28\nand 29 above).\n72. The next day, Ms WLH emailed the Respondent, attaching a copy of\nthe Codicil®®. Ms WLH's email was sent as a follow-on, to an earlier\nchain of emails on 16 and 17 December 2013, regarding the Last Will.\n81 S5 BOD, Vol 1, p 229, Codicil executed by Mr Lee on 2 January 2014.\n\n1 §S BOD, Vol 1, p 230, emall from Ms WLH to the Respondent, Mr Lee, Mr LHL, 4y LHY, Dy LWL,\nMs Ho Ching and Ms KKL dated 3 January 2014, 10.30am.\n25\n\n\f73.

Mr LHY and Dr LWL\n{collectively, the \"Executors”) were appointed the executors of the\nEstate, in accordance with the terms of his Last Will.\n\nIV.\n\nProcedural History\n\n(A) AGC referral\n76. The disciplinary process was commenced following a complaint filed\nby Deputy Aftorney-General, on 4 December 2018 (the “AGC\nComplaint”). The Deputy Attorney-General stated that the\n\n26\n\n\fRespondent may have “potentially breached Rules 25 and 46\" of the\n\nPCR in force at the material time®'. The Complaint (hereafter referred\nto as the “AGC Complaint”) was made pursuant to section 85(3) of\nthe LPA, and contained a request that the Councit of the Law Society\n(the “Council”) refer the matter to a Disciplinary Tribunal. Section 85(3)\nof the LPA obliged the Council to do so.\n\n77. The Law Society filed its Statement of Case on 1 February 2019. The\nDisciplinary Tribunal Secretariat (the ‘Secretariat’) served the\nRespondent the Notice of Disciplinary Tribunal Proceedings, along\nwith the AGC Complaint and the Statement of Case, on 19 February\n2019. The Defence was filed on 10 Aprit 2018, A Pre-Hearing\n\nConference was first fixed on 8 May 2018.\n78. The Law Society wrote on 16 April 2019, seeking for directions from\nthe Tribunal. By way of its Submissions on 23 April 2019, the Law\nSociety sought: (a) further discovery of documents from the\n\nRespondent; and (b) directions from the Tribunal on the question of\nconfidentiality of the proceedings. The latter aspect of the Law\nSociety's application arose from various Facebook posts that were\n\nmade by Mr LHY and Dr LWL, about the proceedings before this\nTribunal.\n79. Mr LHY and Dr LWL had made Facebook posts, relating to these\n\nproceedings, and referring to documents which were filed in these\nproceedings®? (see also paragraphs 486 — 496 below). They appear\nto have been given documents from these proceedings, and were\n\nmaking public statements about them. These proceedings are (by law)\nconfidential until the matter is disposed of. The Respondent filed\n\nWritten Submissions on these issues, on 26 April 2019%%. After\n&1 LSS BOD, Vol 2, p 803, AGC Complaint.\n821 88 BOD, Vol 2, p 1336 — 1341,\n\n3 Respendent's Skeletal Written Submissions dated 28 April 2019,\n27\n\n\fhearing Counsel for both parties, the Tribunal made no order in\n\nrelation to the Law Society's application for further discovery of\ndocuments. While we considered the documents to be relevant, we\nmade no order because it was not clear to us that a Disciplinary\nTribunal had the powers to order discovery. We told the Law Society\nthat it had other means to seek production of the documents. On the\nquestion of confidentiality, parties were directed to desist from\ndisclosing details andfor documents related to the proceedings,\nexcept to the relevant witnesses, and that there should be no public\n\nstatements. The Tribunal also fixed the timetable for parties to file\ntheir respective Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (\"AEIC\"s), and fixed a\n5-day evidentiary hearing (“Hearing”) from 1 to 5 July 2019.\n80. Parties had been directed to exchange their AEICs on 10 June 2019.\nThe Law Society filed and exchanged the AEIC of Mr K Gopalan (*Mr\nGopalan's Affidavit’). The Respondent filed and exchanged the\nRespondent's AEIC (the “Respondent’s Affidavit’) and Mr LHY’s\n\nAEIC (“Mr LHY’s Affidavit\").\n81. Mr Gopalan’s Affidavit enclosed various documents. The Respondent\ntook objections to the documents being in evidence. The Tribunal\ndirected parties to state their position by letter, and received the\n\nfollowing letters: (a) a letter dated 11 June 2019 from solicitors for the\nRespondent, Providence Law Asia LLC (“Providence Law”), (b) a\nletter dated 12 June 2019 from solicitors for the Law Society\n\n(“WongPartnership®); (c) a letter dated 13 June 2019 from Providence\nLaw; and (d) a letter dated 17 June 2019 from WongPartnership.\n82. Having considered the parties’ positions, the Tribunal directed that it\nwould allow the Law Society to rely on Mr Gopalan’s Affidavit at the\nHearing. The Tribunal also indicated that the parties would be at\nliberty to make any submission(s), in Closing (including on\nadmissibility), on the evidence adduced by the other party.\n\n28\n\n\f83. On 24 June 2019, the Law Society informed the Tribunal and the\nRespondent, that it had issued a subpoena for Mr BL, to give\nevidence before the Tribunal. Mr BL was the Respondent's colleague\n\nat MLS, and (as stated earlier) was her colleague at Stamford Law,\nat the time the Last Will was executed. Mr BL had attended the\nexecution of the Last Will, and had signed as a witness to the same.\n84. After the subpoena was issued, Mr BL's Affidavit, giving his evidence\non the material events, was filed. Documents were produced by Mr\nBL (the “BL Documents”), and annexed to Mr BL's Affidavit. and put\n\nin evidence. This was done on 1 July 2019, about three weeks after\nthe parties had (on 10 June 2019), exchanged AE!Cs.\n\nB Originating Summons 639 of 2019 (“0S 639\"}\n85. On 17 May 2019, an application was brought in the High Court by the\nEstate by way of OS 639. The Executors of the Estate (as stated\nearlier) were Mr LHY and Dr LWL. The documents which were the\nsubject of OS 639 were the First to Sixth Wills, the Last Will and the\n\nCodicil thereto, and all drafts of these wills (see also paragraph 143\nbelow). These were the documents numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7, 8\n\nand 9 in the Law Society’s Notice to Admit Hearsay Evidence, dated\n\n24 June 2019 (“LSS Hearsay Notice”).\n86. The Estate sought, in the main, an injunction against the use of these\ndocuments in the disciplinary proceeding. The basis of the Estate’s\napplication was that the documents in question were confidential, and\n\nprotected by legal professional privilege.®\n\n84| SS Closing Submissions (20 September 2018) at paras 186 — 190 sets out what happened in OS\n639 and how the Executors’ position evolved. The Executors started with a broad objection. But at the\nhearing before Justice Hoo, they offered to disclose the Last Will and narrowed their claims of\nconfidentiality.\n\n29\n\n\f87. The Law Society accepted that the documents were confidential.\nJustice Hoo, who heard QS 639, noted that the documents were\n\nalready in the Law Society's possession. The Estate was not\nasserting privilege to withhold disclosure and the question was\nadmissibility of evidence.\n88. Justice Hoo held that the Revoked Wills and the draft Last Will were\nprotected by legal advice privilege, and were also confidential. The\nLast Will and Codicil, on the other hand, were no longer protected by\nlegal advice privilege, having been proven in probate. However, the\nLast Will and Codicil remained confidential, save for paragraph 7 of\n\nthe Last Will, the Demolition Clause, which expressly provided that\n\nthe clause could be publicly disclosed.\n89. Justice Hoo however declined to grant injunctive relief that the Estate\nsought, on the basis that the interests of justice in disclosure of a third\n\nparty’s iniquity prevail over the privilege of a client. Justice Hoo held\nthat “where a sufficient connection can be drawn between the\nprivileged material and the inquiry before the DT, the [Law Society]\nshould not be unduly constrained in how it conducts its prosecution\nof the DT proceedings’. The argument based on confidentiality also\ndid not succeed. Justice Hoo accordingly dismissed the Estate’s\napplication for an injunction restraining the use of Mr Lee’s wills and\ndrafts thereof. The Law Society was thus not prevented from relying\non the documents.\n\n© The Hearing & submissions\n90. The Tribunal heard the Law Society’s case on 1 and 2 July 2019.\nAfter the Law Society’s Opening Statement, the Law Society called\nfour witnesses, namely, Mr K Gopalan, and three other witnesses\n\nwho had been issued with subpoenas. They were: (a) DSP Lim Seng\nChuan, the Commanding Officer of VIP Protection Unit 3 of the Police\n\n30\n\n\fSecurity Command (pursuant to the subpoena issued to Police\nSecurity Command); (b) Mr BL; and (c) Mr Manoj Pillay. Mr Manoj\nPillay was an agent of MLS, who was subpoenaed by the Law Society,\nfor emails from the firm's email accounts.\n91. At the close of the Law Society's case on 2 July 2019, the\nRespondent made a submission of no case to answer. The Tribunal\nreceived the following written submissions: the Respondent's\n\nSkeletal Submissions for No Case to Answer dated 2 July 2019\n(“Respondent's No Case Submissions”), and the Close of Law\nSociety’s Case dated 3 July 2019 (‘Law Society's Close of Case\nSubmissions”).\n92.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal heard Oral Submissions from Counsel for\n\nboth parties on 3 July 2019. Having read the Parties’ Written\nSubmissions, and having heard oral arguments from the Parties’\nCounsel, the Tribunal found that the Law Society had established a\nprima facie case against the Respondent, and rejected the\nsubmission of no case to answer. The Respondent then called two\nwitnesses in her Defence, namely, herself, and Mr LHY.\n\n93.\n\nAt the end of the 5-day Hearing, on 5 July 2019, the Tribunal\ndirected parties to provide the Tribunal with Written Closing\nSubmissions. The Respondent was directed to file her Closing\nSubmission on 2 August 2018 and the Law Society was directed to\nfile its Closing Submission four weeks later (on 30 August 2019).\nThe Respondent subsequently asked for an extension of time,\nwhich was granted. The Respondent filed her Closing Submissions\non 16 August 2019 (“Respondent’s Ciosing Submissions”). The Law\nSociety also asked for an extension of time to file its Closing\nSubmission by 20 September 2019. That request was also granted.\nThe Law Society filed its Closing Submissions on 20 September\n2019 (“Law Society's Closing Submissions”). At the Respondent's\n\n31\n\n\frequest, the Tribunal also fixed a half-day hearing for Oral Closing\nSubmissions, on 7 October 2019. The Respondent and the Law\nSociety prepared Skeletal Submissions, to assist the Tribunal at this\nHearing, namely the Respondent's Skeletal Submissions dated 27\nSeptember 2019 (“Respondent’s Closing Skeletals”), and the Law\nSociety’s Skeletal Submissions dated 5 October 2019 (“Law\nSociety’s Closing Skeletals”).\nPreliminary Issues\n\n4. Before dealing with the legal and factual issues that arise from the\nCharges, we will first address three Preliminary Issues that were\nraised by the Respondent.\n\n(A) Jurisdiction\n95. The Respondent submitted that the Tribunal does not have the\njurisdiction to hear Charges 1B and 2B. She contended that these\nCharges fall beyond the remit of the AGC Complaint, which is\npremised on the existence of a retainer between the Respondent and\n\nMr Lee. She advanced this position in her Defence, her No Case\nSubmissions, and her Closing Submissions.\n\n96. In support of this argument, the Respondent relies on the cases of\nRe Seah Pong Tshai [1881] 2 SLR(R) 744 (“Seah Pong Tshai\") and\n\nRe Lim Chor Pee [1990] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“Lim Chor Peg\").\n97. Having considered these cases, we are unable to agree that they\nsupport the Respondent's position — either by reason of their facts, or\nas a matter of law.\n\n32\n\n\f98. Seah Pong Tshaiand Lim Chor Pee involved complaints which were\nreferred to an Inquiry Committee, and thereafter culminated in formal\ninvestigations by a Disciplinary Committee (the predecessor of\nDisciplinary Tribunals under the current LPA). In both these cases,\nthe charges were found to be defective because they. (a) went\nbeyond the scope of the complaint, and (b) were not considered by\nthe Inquiry Committee, and therefore fell outside the scope of notice\ngiven by the Inquiry Committee to the lawyer (see Lim Chor Pee at\n[35] and Seah Pong Tshai at [14]).\n99. In our view, neither of these objections applied on the facts before us.\nThe Gravamen of the AGC Complaint\n100.0n the former, the cases establish that the charges must reflect the\n\n“gravamen’ of the complaint (Seah Pong Tshai at [9]); the *subject\nmatter” of the charges must accord with the complaint (Lim? Chor Pee\nat [35]). In other words, if the charge framed is different from the\ncomplaint “both in form and in substance’, it will be found to be\n\ndefective (Seah Pong Tshai at [9]).\n101.We note that this position has been affirmed more recently, by the\nHigh Court, in Law Sociely of Singapore v Yeo Khim Hai Alvin [2020]\nSGHC 3 (“Yeo Khim Hai\"). The Court held (at [68]) that:\n\n“In my judgment, the following propositions emerge from Seah\nPong Tshai and the case law which | discuss in turn below:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the “matter” that has to be heard and investigated\nby the DT is the complaint, and in a typical case, it is\nassumed that the matter would be the complaint as\nproperly framed by the Law Society in the charge. Put\nanother way, it is assumed that the substance of the\ncomplaint will be reflected in the charge, and that\n33\n\n\fconstitutes the matter to be heard and_investigated.\n\nWhere the Law Society has erred in framing the charge,\nthen the DT's determination is liable to be set aside, as\n\nit was in Seah Pong Tshai.\n(b)\n\n)\n\nSecond, the DT has a duty to hear and investigate the\ncomplaint. The DT also has a duty to hear and\ninvestigate the charges. The two duties are not mutually\nexclusive and in fact are complementary to one another,\nin that the expectation must be that the charges reflect\n\nthe gravamen of the complaint and fall within the scope\nof the compilaint.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n102.The corollary to these propositions is that a complaint is not and\n\nshould not itself be regarded as a charging document; the two are\ndistinct, albeit related. it is for the Law Society (and not a\ncomplainant) to determine what charges should be brought against a\nrespondent lawyer, taking into account the essence of the complaint\nthat has been made; this reflects the principle of self-regulation set\nout in the LPA (see also Yeo Khirn Hai at [8Q]). As the cases set out,\n\nwhat is required is not a complete identity between the complaint and\nthe charges, but that the charges encapsulate the substance, or\n\nessence of the complaint.\n103.In Seah Pong Tshai, the complaint was that the respondent lawyer\nrefused to refund his client a sum of $1,000 which he had\n\novercharged. The charge against him was defective, because it\naccused him of something entirely different — that he “falsely denied\nthe receipt of the said sum of $1,000\".\n104.1n Lim Chor Pee, the first charge against the respondent lawyer was\nthat he had wrongfully evaded tax in respect of a sum of $85,000.\n\n34\n\n\fThis went beyond the scope of the complaint, which had not made\nany specific allegation in respect of this sum of $85,000.\n105.In Yeo Khim Hai, two of the charges against the respondent lawyer\nwere found to be “wholly outside the scope of the [clomplaint” (at\n[92]). These charges alleged overcharging, whereas the gravamen of\n\nthe compiaint related to the adequacy of steps that the lawyer had\ntaken to ascertain his client’s mental capacity.\n108.The circumstances before us are quite clearly different. Charges 1B\nand 2B are premised on the same conduct that Charges 1 and 1A,\n\nand 2 and 2A respectively, are premised on. Charges 1B and 2B are\nbased on the same information in the AGC Complaint, as the other\ncharges. The gravamen (or subject matter) is the same for ali the\nCharges — namely, that the Respondent was guilty of misconduct\nbecause of her involvement in the preparation and execution of Mr\nLee's Last Will.\n\n107.The conduct complained of in Charges 1B and 2B is the same\nconduct which is the subject of Charges 1 and 1A, and 2 and 2A,\n\nrespectively. For instance, Charge 1 reads:\n\n“vou failed to advance your client’s interest unaffected by your\ninterest and/or the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by\npreparing and arranging for the execution of your client's will where\n\na one-third share in your client's estate was fo be given to your\nhusband, Ms Lee Hsien Yang, such act amounting to grossly\nimproper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty within\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n\n2009 Rev Ed).”;\n\n35\n\n\fwhile Charge 1B reads:\n\n“you failed to advance Mr Lee Kuan Yew's interest unaffected by\nyour interest andfor the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\n\nYang, by preparing and arranging for the execution of Mr Lee Kuan\nYew’s will where a one-third share in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's estate was\nto be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, such act\namounting to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an\nofficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\n\nAct (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n108.The Respondent accepts that the conduct complained of in Charges\n1B and 2B is the same as the conduct complained of in Charges 1\nand 1A, and 2 and 2A respectively®®. Charges 1B and 2B are\npremised on information in the AGC Complaint, like Charges 1, 1A,\n2 and 2A. The substance of all these Charges is the same, and\nreflects that of the AGC Complaint.\n\n109. For completeness, we should also address a related point which the\nRespondent raised - that because the inquiry stage had been\nbypassed, and the Deputy Attorney-General's complaint was referred\ndirectly to this Tribunal, the scope of the complaint therefore had to\nbe construed even more carefully.\n\n110. She submitted that the power of direct referral under section 85(3)b)\nof the LPA is a power that should be exercised “only in cases where\nthe Respondent would undoubtedly be guilty of grossly improper\nconduct if the evidence supports his specific complaint’. and\ntherefore, where this power was exercised, the Law Society does not\n\no5 Respondent's Skeletal Submissions for No Case fo Answer (2 July 2019) at paras 65 -686.\n\n36\n\n\fhave the power to change the “basis on which the Respondent is tried\n\nbefore the Tribunal®.\n111.The Tribunal is unable to accept this Submission. The exercise of the\npower under section 85(3)(b) of the LPA, to request that a complaint\nbe escalated directly to a Disciplinary Tribunal, does not change the\n\nnature of the Law Society's role and duty, in framing the charges\narising from the complaint. In Yeo Khim Hai, Justice Thean accepted\nthat the Law Society's responsibility in framing charges was the same\nwhether the complainant was a lay complainant or a complainant\n\nunder section 85(3) of the LPA (see Yeo Khirn Hai, at [82]).\nAdeqguate Notice of the Charges\n\n112.The second ground relied upon in the Seah Pong Tshailine of cases,\nnamely that notice of the relevant charges was not given to the\n\nrespondent at the Inquiry Committee stage (see paragraph 98\nabove), is also quite clearly inapplicable here.\n113.To begin with, no Inquiry Committee was convened in this case. The\nadequacy of notice arising from this phase of proceedings therefore\ndoes not arise.\n\n114. More fundamentally, the Tribunal is also guided by the decision of\nthe Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Wong Kai\nKit[1993) 3 SLR(R) 721 (\"Wong Kai Kit\"). In Wong Kai Kit, the Court\nrejected the proposition that, based on Seah Pong Tshai and Lim\nChor Pee, matters outside an original complaint can never form the\nsubject matter of disciplinary proceedings commenced, as a result of\nthat complaint. What was crucial, the Court opined, was that the\n\n6 Respondent’s Closing Submissions (16 August 2018) at paras 49 - 50.\n\n37\n\n\fadvocate and solicitor against whom disciplinary proceedings had\nbeen brought, had notice of the charges against him.\n115.The Court in Wong Kai Kit held (at [18] and [31]) that:\n“It is plain from these [LPA] provisions that the primary concern of\nthe Legislature was that an advocate and solicitor whose conduct is\nbeing investigated by an Inquiry Committee should be given a\nreasanable opportunity to present his case... Nowhere in the\nlegislation is the leap made from this to the suggestion that matters\n\noutside an original complaint can never form the subject matter of\ndisciplinary proceedings commenced as a result of that complaint...\n\n... The fact that a charge was not contained in the information\nreferred by the AG to the Law Society is not by reason of this\n\npassage [in Lim Chor Pee at [36]] sufficient to render such charge\ninvalid or improper if notice of it was in fact given by the Inquiry\nCommittee ag statutorily reguired.”\n[Emphasis added]\n\n116.1n the present case, the charges brought against the Respondent by\nthe Law Society have remained consistent throughout these\nproceedings. The Respondent was not taken by surprise.\n117.We should also highlight that this aspect of the Courts’ findings in\nSeah Pong Tshai and Lim Chor Pee pre-dated amendments to the\nLPA, which broadened the scope of Disciplinary Tribunals’\njurisdiction to consider additional charges.\n\n118.The Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 1993 introduced a new\nprovision (section 89(4) of the LPA), that provided as follows:\n\n38\n\n\f“Where, in the course of its investigation of any matter against an\nadvocate and solicitor referred to it under subsection (1) or (3), a\nDisciplinary Committee receives information touching on or\nevidence of the conduct of the advocate and solicitor which may give\n\nrise to proceedings under this Part, the Disciplinary Committee may,\non the application of the Council, prefer such additional charge\naqainst the advocate and solicitor as it thinks fit with respect to such\n\nmisconduct and, after giving notice to him, hear and investigate such\ncharge and section 93 shall apply to such charge accordingly.”\n\n[See section 19 of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 1993 (Na.\n41/93)]\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n119.As the Explanatory Statement to the Amendment Bill set out, the aim\nof this amendment was to “enable a Disciplinary Committee to prefer\nother charges against an advocate and solicitor in certain\ncircumstances”. In other words, a Disciplinary Committee (and now,\n\na Disciplinary Tribunal) is endowed with the statutory jurisdiction to\nextend its investigation to “fresh matters”, and even to prefer “fresh\ncharges”, once adequate notice of its intention to do so is given to the\nrespondent lawyer (see Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay\nKhiang [2007] SGHC 83 (\" Tan Phuay Khiang\"), at [58]).\n120.As stated above, the Respondent had ample notice of all the Charges\nagainst her. She was given sufficient time to respond, and did in fact\ndo so, substantively, for all the Charges (including Charges 1B and\n2B).\n121.This Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Charges 1B and 2B.\n\n39\n\n\f(B) Admissibility of evidence\n\n122.The Second Preliminary Point raised by the Respondent relates to\nadmissibility of documents into evidence (to prove the truth of the\nunderlying facts). The Respondent says that the documents in Mr\n\nGopalan’s Affidavit are inadmissible.\n123.First, the Respondent argues that the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997\n\nRev Ed) (“Evidence Act’) requires that only direct evidence may be\ngiven of any fact. Mr Gopalan was not the maker of any of the\nstatements in the documents exhibited in his Affidavit. Therefore, the\nRespondent submits, “save for a limited number of documents which\n\nmay be admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule,” all the\ndocuments exhibited in Mr Gopalan's Affidavit are inadmissible.\n124. The Respondent relies on Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor [2008]\n3 SLR(R) 447, for the proposition that only direct evidence may be\ngiven of any fact.\n125.Section 62 of the Evidence Act relates to oral evidence. The other\nprovisions in the Evidence Act, which deal with documentary\nevidence, are more relevant to the exhibits to Mr Gopalan's Affidavit.\n\n126.Section 67A of the Evidence Act provides:\n“Where in any proceedings a statement in a document is admissible\n\nin evidence by virtue of section 32(1), it may be proved by the\nproduction of that document or (whether or not that document is still\nin existence) by the production of a copy of that docuiment, or of the\nmaterial part of i, authenticated in a manner approved by the court.”\n127.Section 32(1) of the Evidence Act, in turn, provides for the\n\nadmissibility of the type of evidence, which, at commeon law, would be\n\n40\n\n\freferred to as hearsay evidence. Both parties have filed notices to\nadmit hearsay evidence, and this issue will be dealt with, later.\n\n128. The effect of section 67A of the Evidence Act, read with section 32(1)\nof the Evidence Act, has been summarised by Justice Woo Bih Li, in\nColumbfa Asfa Heafthcare Sdn Bhd and anotherv Hong Hin Kit\nEdward and another [2016] 5 SLR 735, at [23] to [25]:\n“23\n\nSection 32(1)(b) [of the Evidence Act] deals with the\n\nexceptions to the hearsay rule. Moreover, s 66 must be read\n\nsubject to s 67A of the EA which states that where a statement\nin a document is admissible in evidence by virtue of s 32(1) it\nmay_be proved by the production of that document (ie. the\noriginal) or a copy.\n\nIn summary, in so far as the Hongs submitted that the\n24\nmaker of the document must be called to give evidence,\ns 32(1)(b)(iv) states that this is not necessary under certain\ncircumstances.\n\nIn so far as the Hongs submitted that the original must\nbe produced, s 66 must be read subject to s67A which\n25\n\nprovides that where s 32(1) applies, a copy may be produced.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n129.This question of admissibility of the documents exhibited to Mr\nGopalan's Affidavit (to prove the truth of the statements therein) will\nhave to be determined by whether these documents are admissible,\nby virtue of section 32(1) of the Evidence Act.\n130.We will therefore consider whether the documents relied on by the\n\nLaw Society are admissible, with reference to the LSS Hearsay\n21\n\n\fNotice®”. Both the Law Society and the Respondent have relied on\nsection 32 of the Evidence Act for admissibility of various documents\ninto evidence.\n131.Insofar as hearsay evidence is adduced in relation to statements\n\nmade by Mr Lee, we find these documents admissible pursuant to\nsection 32(1)(j)(i) of the Evidence Act, read with section 67A of the\nEvidence Act, on the ground that the maker of the statemenis, Mr\n\nLee, has passed away.\n132.This will include documents numbered 1, 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8, 9, 12, 13,\n15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 in the LSS Hearsay Notice. In addition, we\nalso find that these documents are admissible pursuant to section\n32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act, being documents forming part of a\n\nrecord kept by Ms KKL, in the course of her profession as Mr Lee’s\nlawyer (see also paragraph 135 below).\n133.The Respondent also objected to various documents in Mr Gopalan’s\nAffidavit, which related to correspondence between Mr LHY and Dr\n\nLWL, and the Ministerial Committee (the \"MC”)®®; as well as\ncorrespondence between various family members and Mr Lee. The\nauthenticity of these documents is not in dispute. They are admissible\nto show what had been said by the various parties. In so far as these\ndocuments originated from Mr LHY and/or the Respondent, both of\nthem gave evidence and were cross-examined. The Tribunal\nreceived direct evidence on some of the documents and is able to\n87 |88 Hearsay Notice dated 24 June 2019.\n& 0On 1 June 2016, a Ministerial Committee (*MC') had been formed by the Singapore Cabinet to\nconsider the options for 38 Oxley Road and the implications of those options [Report of the MC on 38\n\nOxley Road, dated 2 April 2018 (hitps:/fwww.pmo.qov.sg/-/media/PMO/Newsroom/Files/MediaRelease/MC Report 38 Oxley Road.pdf)]. These included looking into various aspects, including the\nhistorical and heritage significance of 38 Oxiey Road, as well as to consider Mr Lee’s thinking and\nwishes in relation to 38 Oxley in the Last Will (see paras 7 — 30 of the Report). The MC stated that it\nhad engaged in correspondence with Mr LHL, Mr LHY and Dr LWL, to obtain as full a picture as possible\non Mr Lee's thinking on 38 Oxley Road (see para 24 of the Report). Some of the questions raised,\nrelated to the Last Will (See paras 4 and 9 of Annex C o the Report: hitps://www.pmo.qov.sg//media/PMO/Newsroom/Files/Media-Release/MC_Report 38 Oxley Road_Annex C.pdf).\n\n42\n\n\fform views on the matters set out in the documents, in the context of\n\nthe evidence given. The same goes for documents that Mr LHY sent\nto the MC.\n\n134.Next we consider the documents relating to statements made by Ms\nKKL, which are documents numbered 10, 11, 14, 17, and 23 in the\nLSS Hearsay Notice. It appears from the LSS Hearsay Notice that\n\nthe Law Society refies on two grounds for the admission of these\ndocuments:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the Law Society states in the LLS Hearsay Notice, that\nthese documents are emails sent by Ms KKL, and therefore,\n\nform part of “a document constituting, or forming part of, the\nrecords (whether past or present) of a frade, business,\nprofession or other occupation that are recorded, owned or\n\nkept by any person, body or organisation carrying out the trade,\nbusiness, profession or other occupation”, pursuant to section\n\n32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act.\n(b)\n\nSecond, the Law Society states that these documents are\nadmissible pursuant to section 32(1)(j}(iv} of the Evidence Act:\nas statements made by a person who “being competent but\nnot compellable to give evidence on behalf of the party\ndesiring to give the statement in evidence, he refuses to do\n”\nSO,\n\n135.First, in relation to section 32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act, this\nTribunal finds that the documents numbered 10, 11, 14, 17, and 23\nin the LSS Hearsay Notice are admissible pursuant to that provision.\n\nThese documents form a record, or part of a record, kept by Ms KKL,\nas a lawyer in the ordinary course of business.\n\n23\n\n\f136.In relation to section 32(1)(j)(iv) of the Evidence Act, it appears that\nMs KKL has said that she will not give evidence.\n\n137.The Tribunal was informed that Ms KKL had refused to participate in\n“any meeting and/or discussion with the Law Society regarding the\ndocuments referred fo in your email and any information or\n\ndocuments pertaining to my engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor™®.\nCounsel for the Law Society informed this Tribunal that the Law\nSociety was “fold in no uncertain terms that she is not allowed and\nthe estate [of Mr Lee] has asserted privilege™. The Executors of Mr\n\nLee’s Estate (namely, Mr LHY and Dr LWL) had taken this position™.\nThe Law Society stated that it did not subpoena Ms KKL, infer alia,\nbecause “a subpoena to her will not waive privilege if she maintains\n\nthat privilege™\" (see also paragraph 153 below).\n138.The documents will be admissible, under section 32(1)(j)(iv) of the\n\nEvidence Act if Ms KKL (as a solicitor to Mr Lee) was not\n“compellable”. There is no direct case law precedent on the\ncompellability of a solicitor, though there is some learning which has\nbeen referred to us by the parties. We do not see the need to decide\n\non the question of whether Ms KKL was compellable, (and thus\nwhether the documents are admissible under section 32(1)(j)(iv) of\n\nthe Evidence Act), since we have stated (above), that the documents\n10, 11, 14, 17 and 23, are admissible under section 32(1)(b)(vi) of the\nEvidence Act.\n\n6 Transcripts (5 July), 60:31 - 61:2.\n7 Transcripts (5 July), 60:27-63:14.\n\n71 Transcripts (5 July), 63:8-10.\n\n\fExclusionary Discretion\n\n139, The Respondent submits that even if the evidence is admissible, this\nTribunal should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence, which\nshe says was obtained by the Law Society in breach of legal privilege.\nSave for documents numbered 1 and 2, which are the Last Will and\nthe Codicil to the same, the Respondent submits that all the other\n\ndocuments ought to be inadmissible on this ground™.\n140.The Court of Appeal in Mykytowych, Pamela Jane v V | P Hotel[2016]\n4 SLR 829 (“Pamela Jane”) has cautioned (at [57]) that the “concepts\nof admissibility, privilege and confidentiality should not be confused”.\n\nThe Court of Appeal, considering the admissibility of a report by one\nDr Tay opined, at {58] — [59]:\n“58 Privilege allows a party to withhold the disclosure of\ninformation which would otherwise be compulsory to\ndisclose. Admissibility, on the other hand, relates to the question of\nwhether a particular piece of evidence may be received by the court,\nand is governed by whether that piece of evidence is relevant to the\n\nmatters in issue (see Kuruma, Son of Kaniu v The Queen [1955]\n2 WLR 223 at 226227 as cited in Wee Shuo Woon at [19]). Where\nthe document in respect of which privilege is being asserted — such\nas Dr Tay's medical report in the present case - is already in the\npossession of the other party, the issue is no longer one of\nwithholding disclosure, and the\nadmissibility rather than privilege.\n\ngquestion\n\nbecomes\n\none\n\nof\n\n58 The question of whether Dr Tay’s medical report is protected\nby litigation privilege is, strictly speaking, irrelevant to the issue of\nwhether it is admissible as evidence. It may, however, have a\nbearing on whether the report should be admitted. This arises from\n\nthe fact that equity may, through the grant of injunctions, intervene\nto prevent the unauthorised use in court proceedings of information\n72 Regpondent's No Case Submissions (2 July 2019) at paras 26 — 27.\n\n45\n\n\fcontained in privileged material, which would, in most instances, be\n\nof a.confidential nature (see Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch\nBuilding\nNationwide\nv\n(“Lord Ashburton\"), Goddard\n469\nSociety [1986] 3 WLR 734 (“Goddard™), Tentat Singapore Pte Lid v\n\nMultiple Granite Pte Ltd[2009] 1 SLR(R) 42 (“Tenfat”) and Wee\nShuo Woon at [22]). The court’s equitable jurisdiction to restrain\nbreaches of confidence is invoked in these instances.”\n\n141.The Respondent's position, in summary, is that the documents in\nquestion (being the Wills and other documents) were privileged\nbetween Mr Lee and Ms KKL. The Estate of Mr Lee now has the\n\nbenefit of that privilege, and thus, she says, the documents cannot\nbe relied upon in these proceedings.\n\n142.The first point to note is that the Respondent has no privilege in\nrespect of the documents. It is for the Estate, which is not a party to\nthese proceedings, to assert any legal privilege. This is a basic point,\n\nwhich the Respondent accepted™. Second, that the documents may\nbe protected by privilege is in itself insufficient to affect their\nadmissibility. The question for the Tribunal is, if these documents are\nindeed protected by privilege, nonetheless (and if such privilege is\nasserted by the Estate), should the Tribunal exercise its discretion to\nexclude this evidence? The Tribunal has the discretion to exclude\n\notherwise admissible evidence™.\n\n143.This question was in substance dealt with by the High Court in OS\n639 (see paragraphs 85 — 89 above). In OS 639, the Estate (acting\nthrough Mr LHY and Dr LWL) made an application to the High Court\nseeking an injunction against the Law Society. The Estate wanted to\nrestrain the Law Society from relying on all of Mr Lee’s wills and the\nCodicil, and all drafts of these Wills, in these Disciplinary\n7 Transcript (3 July 2019), 94:18-21.\n74 See Muhammad bin Kadar v PP [2011] 3 SLR 1205,\n\n46\n\n\fproceedings. This included the Last Will, the Codicil, the First to Sixth\n\nWills, and all drafts of these wills™. In relation to the Last Will, the\nCodicil, the First to Sixth Wills, and the drafts thereof, the Estate\n\nclaimed that these documents were confidential and protected by\nlegal privilege.\n\n144.As stated earlier (see paragraph 89 above), Justice Hoo declined to\ngrant the injunction against the Law Society. The attempt to prevent\n\nthe Law Society from relying on these documents was rejected. This\nTribunal notes that the documents which were the subject of OS 639,\nwere the documents numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 8 and 9 in the LSS\n\nHearsay Notice. In coming to her decision, Justice Hoo applied the\nprinciples set out by the Court of Appeal in Pamela Jane.\n145.1n relation to the documents numbered 1, 2, 3,4, 5,6, 7, 8 and 9 in\n\nthe LSS Hearsay Notice, this Tribunal finds that if the Court did not\ndeem fit to exercise its equitable discretion, to restrain the Law\nSociety from using these documents in these proceedings, then there\nis no reason for this Tribunal to exclude the same. The Estate tried\nbut failed, to prevent the documents from being in evidence in the\n\nproceedings.\n\n146.In relation to the documents in the LSS Hearsay Notice, which are\nemail communications between Ms KKL and Mr Lee, in refation to Mr\nLee’s Wills, (the documents numbered 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n\n20, 21 and 22 (\"LKY-KKL Emails”)), this Tribunal is of the view that\nthese documents would ordinarily be protected by legal privilege.\n\nHowever, this privilege is for the Estate to claim, not the Respondent.\nThis is accepted by the Respondent™. The Tribunal notes that the\nEstate did not seek to restrain the Law Society from using the LKYKKL Emails, in OS 639, Further, the High Court's reasoning in QS\n5 See paragraph 86 and fn 64 of this Decision.\n\n7 Transcripts (3 July), 94:13-21.\n47\n\n\f639 applies equally to the LKY-KKL Emails. This Tribunal will not\nexclude the documents.\n147.Excluding these documents will mean, inter alia, that the Tribunal will\n\nbe precluded from considering the differences between the different\nWills, and understanding the positions taken by Mr Lee.\nRespondent's Hearsay Notice\n\n148.We highlight that the Respondent too had filed a Notice to Admit\n\nDocumentary Hearsay Evidence (“Respondent's Hearsay Notice”),\ndated 24 June 2019. The Respondent relies on the same sections,\nviz, section 32(1)(b) of the Evidence Act and section 32(1)(j)(i) of the\n\nEvidence Act. The Law Society has not objected to the admissibility\nof the evidence listed in the Respondent's Hearsay Notice. The\nevidence listed in the Respondent’s Hearsay Notice is admissible.\n(C) Unfair Conduct\n\n149.We will now consider the Third Preliminary Point. inthe Respondent’s\nClosing Submissions, the Respondent submitted that the Law\n\nSociety acted unfairly to the Respondent. At Annex C of the\nRespondent’s Closing Submissions (the “RAC”), the Respondent has\nset out a list of instances where she alleges she was treated unfairly.\n\nThe Law Society, in its Closing Submissions, has responded to the\ninstances of alleged unfairness, also in table form. The Tribunal will\nbriefly address these submissions, with reference to the serial\n\nnumber assigned to these instances in the RAC.\n150.Items 1 and 2 of the RAC state (a) that the charges did not conform\nto the AGC Complaint, and (b) that the Law Society used documents\nwhich were disclosed in breach of confidentiality and legal\n\n48\n\n\fprofessional privilege. These points have been dealt with earlier (see\nSections V(A} and V(B) above).\n151. jtems 3 and 4 of the RAC relate to procedural matters before the trial\nstage of the hearings before the Tribunal. The Respondent submitted\nthat the Law Society failed to inform the Respondent why an urgent\n\nPre-Hearing Conference (“PHC\") was required, when the Law\nSociety requested for one on 16 April 2019 (Item 3), and that the Law\n\nSociety made an illegitimate demand for immediate disclosure of all\ncopies of documents in the Respondent’s list of documents (ltem 4).\nIn relation to the request for an urgent Pre-Hearing Conference, the\nTribunal had addressed the same in its directions to parties. No\nurgent PHC was fixed, and the Law Society was directed to address\n\nthe issues it wished to bring to the Tribunal's attention (by way of the\nurgent PHC) in written submissions. The Respondent was given an\nopportunity to provide submissions in reply, and both parties were\nheard during the PHC on 8 May 2019. In relation to the request for\ncopies of documents (and the Tribunal fails to see how such a request\ncan be illegitimate), the Tribunal directed that the inspection and\nfurnishing of documents be done in accordance with Rule 9 of the\n\nLegal Profession (Disciplinary Proceedings) Rules. Leaving aside the\nfact that the Respondent did not suffer any prejudice procedurally,\nthe Tribunal does not see any force in the argument that the\nRespondent was treated unfairly. The Law Society sought directions.\nThe Tribunal, having considered the Law Society’s requests for\ndirections, declined to grant the directions sought for the urgent PHC,\nand in respect of inspection and furnishing of documents, directed\nthat this be done in accordance with the Rules.\n\n152.1tems 5 and 6 of the RAC relate to the Law Society’s failure to call Ms\nKKL as a witness, and the “delayed decision” to call Mr BL as a\nwitness. The Law Society had indicated in its list of witnesses,\n\n49\n\n\fprovided on 27 May 201977, that it would be calling Ms KKL as a\nwitness. The Law Society's position is that its list of witnesses,\nprovided on 27 May 2019 was “tentative and subject fo change’™.\n153.The Law Society said that it eventually decided not to call Ms KKL\nbecause Ms KKL had declined to participate in “any meeting and/or\ndiscussion with the Law Society regarding the documents referred to\nin [the Law Society’s] email and any information or documents\n\npertaining to [Ms KKL’s] engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor'™ (see\nalso paragraph 137 above), and that her evidence was not necessary\n\nbecause the Law Society was able to rely on various documents\n\nwhich had become available®®. Ms KKL’s position was based on the\nobjections raised by the Executors of the Estate. We do not find any\nmerit in the points made in the RAC about Ms KKL not being called\nas a witness. It is for each party to decide, at the Hearing, which\nwitnesses are called. The Tribunal is entitled to also draw the\nappropriate inferences when a witness is not called, and regardless\n\nof whether a witness is called or not called, the burden of proof (to\nprove the case beyond reasonable doubt) lay on the Law Society. We\nalso note that the Respondent’s husband, Mr LHY, as Executor, had\nasserted legal privilege, vis-a-vis Ms KKL (see paragraphs 423 — 434\n\nbelow).\n154.In relation to the Law Society's decision to subpoena Mr BL as a\nwitness, the Tribunal does not find any unfairness. The evidence he\n\ngave and the documents he produced were within the Respondent's\nknowledge. The Respondent also had the opportunity to crossexamine Mr BL. We have made some further observations below on\n77 Email from the Law Society to the Respondent and the Tribunal, setting out the list of its witnesses,\ndated 27 May 2019,\n7 |.S8S Closing Submissions (20 September 2019) at p 123, Item 5.\n7 Transcripts (5 July 2019), 60:31-61:2.\n0 Transcripts {1 July 2019), 5:28 - 6:18,\n50\n\n\fthis objection, in relation to Mr BL being called to give evidence (see\nparagraphs 182 — 193 below).\n155.ltems 7 and 8 of the RAC relate fo the subpoena issued against MLS\nfor documents. The Law Society informed the Tribunal on 2 July 2019,\nthe second day of the Hearing, that the Law Society was considering\nissuing a subpoena against MLS. The Respondent submitted that\nissuing the subpoena, after the close of the Law Society’s case,\nresulted in unfairness to her. The Tribunal notes that the witness from\n\nMLS, Mr Manoj Piliay, simply confirmed that MLS had not been able\nto retrieve any document responsive to the subpoena. The Tribunal\nfails to see how this (the fact that the Respondent’s law firm did not\nproduce any documents) caused any unfairness, to the Respondent.\nThe Respondent was put on notice on the second day of the Hearing\nthat the Law Society may issue a subpoena against MLS. The\nsubpoena was in relation to the specific email(s) on the question of\nfrom whom Mr BL had received the draft document, which was\n\nexecuted to become the Last Will. This issue arose as a consequence\nof the evidence given by Mr BL.\n156.The Respondent also alleges that Mr LHY was subject to unfair\nallegations in cross-examination (ltem 9 of the RAC). The Tribunal\ndoes not see any merit in this submission, or how this amounts to\nunfaimess. In the Tribunal's view, cross-examination of Mr LHY by\nCounsel for the Law Society was in accordance with the rules and\nprinciples governing evidence and cross-examination. Counsel for\nthe Respondent did not raise any objection in this regard during Mr\nLHY’s cross-examination.\n157.Lastly, at Item 10 of the RAC, the Respondent submits that the\nreading of an email received by the Law Society's solicitors,\nWongPartnership, from Ms KKL, was unfair as the Estate did not\nhave an opportunity to respond. The Respondent claims that the\n\n51\n\n\fallegation by the Law Society that the Estate had refused to allow Ms\nKKL to testify in these proceedings was based on this email. We do\nnot see any merit in this argument. The Respondent did not raise any\nobjections at the hearing. Second, the Respondent had the\nopportunity to object at the oral hearing on 7 October 2019, but did\nnot do so. We have also dealt with this matter at paragraphs 431 —\n\n434 below.\n158.There was no unfairness to either party in respect of these matters.\nMany of the objections relate to procedures which are normal and\nroutine in hearings: calling / not calling of witnesses, seeking\ndirections from the Tribunal, cross-examination, issue of subpoenas,\n\nproduction of documents, and so on.\n\nV.\n\nSummary of the Parties’ Positions on the Charges\n\n159.We will now set out a short summary of the parties’ positions in\nrelation to the Charges®'.\n\n(A) The Law Society’s Case\n160.The Law Society's case was that there was an Implied Retainer\nbetween the Respondent and Mr Lee. The Law Society said that the\nRespondent acted as Mr Lee's solicitor. She prepared the draft Last\nWill and advised Mr Lee on it. Mr LHY, the Respondent’s husband,\n\nwas a beneficiary under the Last Will. The Law Society argues that\nRespondent’s conduct is in breach of Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR.\n\n161.The Law Society argued that the Respondent had failed to advance\nMr Lee’s interests unaffected by her interests and/or those of her\nhusband, Mr LHY. The Law Society's case is that there were material\n81 We will only set out brief details here. The points made by the parties are dealt with in greater detail,\nhereafter.\n52\n\n\fdifferences between the draft sent by the Respondent, which was\n\nexecuted to become the Last Will, and the First Will (contrary to her\nrepresentation that the draft Last Will was in the same terms as the\n\nFirst Will). Mr Lee was also not advised in detail on the draft Last Will,\non the various clauses in the Last Will (which Mr Lee had earlier\ndecided to drop), and how the Last Will was different from the\nPenultimate Will. The Law Society also points to the fact that Mr Lee’s\nusual lawyer, Ms KKL, was absent from the matters surrounding the\npreparation and execution of the Last Will and that the Respondent\nrushed the execution of the Last Will, contrary to Mr Lee’s interests.\n\n162.As regards the differences between the draft Last Will (which the\nRespondent sent Mr Lee on 16 December 2013, and which was\nexecuted to become the Last Will), and the First Will, the Law Society\npoints to the following in particular:\n\n(@)\n\nThe Last Will omitted (infer alia) the Gift-over Clause, which\nhad been present in the First Will.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Last Wil also included various clauses, including the\nDemolition Clause, which, while present in the First Will, had\n\nbeen removed by Mr Lee in later wills, including the Sixth Will,\nwhich immediately preceded the Last Will.\nThe Law Society argued that the Respondent, by not advising Mr Lee\n\n(amongst other things) on these differences or changes, had failed in\nher duties to Mr Lee as his solicitor.\n\n163.1n addition, the Law Society also argues that Charges 1B and 2B can\nbe maintained even if the Tribunal were to find that there was no\nImplied Retainer between Mr Lee and the Respondent.\n\n53\n\n\f(B) The Respondent's Case\n164.The Respondent said that she was not Mr Lee's lawyer in relation to\nthe Last Will, and that there was no Implied Retainer. The\nRespondent’s position is that she was helping as a family member,\n\nand as Mr Lee's daughter-in-law®; she did not give or take\ninstructions from Mr Lee®, and Mr Lee had access to his own lawyer\nat all times®. (See also paragraph 265 below.)\n\n‘\n\n165.The Respondent also said that there was no conflict of interest as she\nwas unaware of the circumstances giving rise to the conflict. it is the\nRespondent’s case that both she and Mr LHY were unaware of the\nterms of the Sixth Will, and in particular, that it provided for distribution\nwhich gave Mr Lee’s daughter, Dr LWL, a larger share than Mr Lee's\nsons, Mr LHL and Mr LHY. If the Respondent was indeed in a position\nof conflict, the Respondent argued that Mr Lee was fully aware of the\nRespondent’s involvement and consciously chose to proceed®?.\nVil\n\nIssues for determination\n\n166.The main issues that arise for our determination, in respect of the\nCharges, are as follows:\n\n(A) Implied Retainer\nWas the Respondent Mr Lee’s lawyer, for the Last Will, by way of an\nImplied Retainer?\n\n82 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 141.\n8 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 149.\n8 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 1569.\n8 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 192.\n\n54\n\n\f(B) Breach of duties/Misconduct\nIf an Implied Retainer is made out:\n\n(a)\n\nDid the Respondent breach the professional duties, under\nRule 25 and/or 46 of the PCR?\n\n(b}\n\nIf so, did this amount to:\n\n(iy\n\ngrossly improper conduct (pursuant to the primary\nCharges (Charges 1 and 2)); or\n\n(i)\n\nimproper conduct, or practice, as an advocate and\nsolicitor, (pursuant to the alternative Charges (Charges\n\n1A and 2A)),\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA?\n\n(c)\n\nAside from the question of Implied Retainer: Was the\nRespondent nevertheless guilty of misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor, under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA,\n(pursuant to the further alternative Charges (Charges 1B and\n2B))?\n\n\" (C) Cause for disciplinary action\nif there was an Implied Retainer, and if there were breaches of duties,\n\nnevertheless; is there cause of sufficient gravity, for disciplinary action\nunder section 83 of the LPA?\n167.We will consider each of the issues separately.\n\n55\n\n\f168.The Written Submissions from the parties in this matter ran to 237\npages and the Annexes totalled another 42 pages. The transcript of\nthe Hearing ran to 627 pages. The parties covered fairly extensive\nground,\n\nboth on procedures, preliminary issues and\n\non\n\nthe\n\nsubstantive issues.\n169.We have considered the points made. We will deal with the points\nraised, in respect of the three issues set out at paragraph 168 above.\nWe will also deal with several other points raised, even though some\nof them were not strictly necessary for our decision. This has resulted\nin some repetition of the facts and reasoning, as we have tried to deal\n\nwith many of the points and arguments raised.\nVIIl.\n\nRetainer\n\n170.Parties are agreed that there was no Express Retainer between the\n\nRespondent and Mr Lee. The issue is whether there was an Implied\nRetainer between the Respondent and Mr Lee, in respect of the Last\nWill.\n171.We will set out:\n\n(A}\n\nThe applicable legal principles, on the question of Implied\n:\nRetainer.\n\n(B)\n\nThe relevant questions to be considered, on the question of\nImplied Retainer, the evidence that was presented, and our\nviews.\n\n(C)\n\nOur conclusions, on the question of Implied Retainer.\n\n(D)\n\nThe positions that the parties had taken previously, in respect\nof some of the questions that arose before us.\n\n56\n\n\f(A) The applicable principles\n\n172.No legal formalities are required for a retainer to exist (Law Society\n\nof Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani [2006] SGHC 143\n(“Ahmad Khalis\") at [64]).\n173.The assessment turns on whether, on “an objective consideration of\n\nall the circumstances”, a contractual relationship of lawyer and client\n“ought fairly and properly to be imputed to all the parties” (see Ahmad\nKhalis at [66]). [Emphasis added.]\n174.To that end, an objective analysis is applied, from both perspectives\n—that of the lawyer, and of the putative client (Ahmad Khalis at [66]).\nA tribunal must undertake “the objective inquiry” of considering —\n\nwhether the putative client reasonably considered that the\n\n(a)\n\nlawyer was acting for him, and\n\n(b)\n\nwhether the lawyer ought to have reasonably known that he\nwas acting for the putative client\n\n(see BOM v BOK [2019] 1 SLR 34@ (“BOM’) at [109]).\nThe parties' subjective perspectives, are “by no means conclusive”.\nThey must be consistent with the objective facts, and reascnable,\nwhen construed against that context (Ahmad Khalis at [66]).\n\n175, The final assessment rests on a “holistic and careful consideration of\nthe factual matrix” (BOM at [109]). Factors that will be considered\ninclude:\n(8)\n\nWhether the lawyer gave advice to the putative client on the\n\nrelevant document (see Anwar Patrick Adrian and another v\n57\n\n\fNg Chong & Hue LLC and another [2014] SGCA 34 at [52],\nBOM at [109]);\n\n(b)\n\nWhether there was another lawyer acting for the putative client\n(Ahmad Khalis at [67]);\n\n()\n\nWhether the lawyer asked the putative client to seek\nindependent advice (BOM at [109]); and\n\n(d)\n\nWhether the lawyer and the putative client are spouses, in a\nmarital relationship (BOM at [112]).\n\n(B) The relevant questions to be considered on the question of\nImplied Retainer, the evidence that was presented and our views\n\n176.The questions we will consider on the issue of Implied Retainer are\nas follows:\n(a)\n\nDid Mr Lee and the Respondent proceed on the basis that the\nRespondent was his lawysr, for the Last Will;\n\n(b)\n\nThe actual nature and extent of the Respondent’s role, in the\nLast Will; and\n\n()\n\nThe nature and extent of Ms KKL’s involvement (Mr Lee’s\nusual lawyer), in the Last Will.\n\n177.Before we deal with the above three questions, we will refer briefly to\nsome of the important evidence that was put before us, and the\n\nmanner in which some of it came before us.\n\n58\n\n\fProduction of Relevant Evidence\n\n178.The documentary evidence which was put before us provides a fairly\ncomprehensive record of what transpired, in the period leading up to,\nduring, and immediately after Mr Lee signed the Last Will. This is\nprimarily contained in the form of email correspondence.\n179.This evidence was particularly relevant, given its contemporaneity\n\nand being a written record.\n\n180.1n this regard, as more than five years have lapsed between the Last\nWill and these proceedings, the Court of Appeal's observations in\nSandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Strategic Worldwide Assets\nLtd [2014] 3 SLR 562 (“Sandz”) are instructive. In Sandz, the events\nin question took place nearly five years before the trial (see Sandz at\n[77]). The Court of Appeal said (Sandz at [50] and [77]):\n“... As a rule of thumb, the longer the lapse of time between the\nhappening of the event or matter being recollected and the witness's\nappearance on the witness stand, the less the reliance that should\nbe placed on puire oral evidence and the more searching the court\n\n..\nought to be in assessing and testing that evidence.\n...As we observed above...even the recollections of the most\n\ntruthful of witnesses would be tested by the lapse of time. In the\npremises, we think it preferable in these proceedings to place more\nreliance on the objective documentary evidence before us as well\nas the actual conduct of the parties, as opposed to their hazy\nrecollections of past events on the witness stand.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n59\n\n\f181.We found the documentary evidence inherently more reliable than\nthe witness testimony, for the reasons set out by the Court of Appeal,\nand also because of the nature of some of the oral testimony that was\ngiven.\n\n182.The key factual witnesses before us were Mr BL, on behalf of the Law\nSociety, and the Respondent and her husband, Mr LHY, on behalf of\nthe Respondent. Mr BL’s evidence was largely unchallenged by the\nRespondent, save for one point, on what the Respondent told him\nabout the contents of the Last Will (we will refer to this later (see\nparagraph 514(b) below)).\n183.The other witnesses before us, (namely, Mr Gopalan, Mr Lim Seng\n\nChuan, and Mr Manoj Pillay (see paragraph 90 above)), gave\nevidence of a more formal nature, relating to documents.\n\n184.We had referred earlier (at paragraphs 83 - 84) to the BL Documents\nwhich were produced by Mr BL, a few days before the Hearing\n(pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Law Society).\n185.The BL Documents contained, inter alia:\n\n(a)\n\nEmails before the Last Will was signed, which showed the\nRespondent giving Mr BL instructions, on the preparation and\nexecution of the Last Will (see paragraphs 47 — 49 and 51\nabove),\n\n(b)\n\nEmails after the Last Will was signed, which showed the\n\nRespondent giving Mr BL and her other colleagues at\nStamford Law instructions on how to follow-up (see\nparagraphs 53 — 55, 57, 59 — 60, 64 and 67 above), and\n\n60\n\n\f(c)\n\nMs EK’s Attendance Note (see paragraph 69 above), which\nshowed what transpired when Mr Lee signed the Last Will, and\nher email exchange with the Respondent, which recounted Mr\nLee's queries on who drafted the Last Will.\n\nSome significant parts of the facts set out in Section III(G) were\nbased on the BL Documents. (See also paragraph 370 below.)\n186.We will consider these BL Documents, in detail, later.\n\n187.The BL Documents (and Mr BL’s Affidavit) deal with issues and\nmatters that are also dealt with by the Respondent in her Affidavit.\n\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent stated in her Affidavit®® that her involvement\nin the Last Will was limited to forwarding the draft of the Last\nWill and the introducing of Mr BL to Ms WLH. Mr LHY\n\ndescribed these tasks as “administrative tasks’ ®7. The\nRespondent said that she ceased involvement in the Last Will,\nafter introducing Mr BL to Ms WLH and Mr LHY, in the evening\nof 16 December 2013 (see paragraph 40 above).\n\nThe BL Documents and Mr BL's evidence showed that the\nRespondent remained closely involved throughout, and\ncontinued to exchange multiple emails with Mr BL and others,\nregarding the Last Will, until after the Last Will was signed (we\ndeal with this later (see paragraphs 367 — 394)).\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent stated in her Affidavit® that there was no\nreason for Mr Lee to have believed that she was his lawyer.\n\n86 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 27 and 29.\n87 Transeript {4 July 2019), 127:28; see also Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 36 and 56.\n\n88 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 28.\n\n61\n\n\fThe BL Documents and Mr BL's evidence showed that just\nbefore he signed the Last Will, Mr Lee asked Mr BL, more than\n\nonce, who drafted the Last Will. The BL Documents state that\nMr Lee was told that the Respondent was the primary lawyer\nwho drafted the Last Will. The Respondent knew that Mr Lee\n\nwas told this, and had not objected (we deal with this later (see\nparagraphs 200 - 221)).\n\n(¢)\n\nThe Respondent also said, on Affidavit®, that Mr LHY and Dr\nLWL had never sought her inputs on their correspondence\nwith the MC (which, infer alia, dealt with the Last Will). The BL\n\nDocuments showed that the Respondent was kept informed of\nMr LHY and Dr LWL’s correspondence with the MC, and\nhelped them gather information for their responses (we deal\nwith this later (see paragraphs 459 - 471)).\n\n188. The Respondent knew about the BL Documents (many of them were\ncarrespondence sent to or sent by her), and what Mr BL's evidence\nwas. She had possession of several of the BL Documents. Mr LHY\nwas also aware of them:\n(a)\n\nIn December 2016, the Respondent received the EK\nAttendance Note (see paragraph 69) from Ms EK, when she\nwrote to Ms EK, to gather information on Mr LHY and DrLWL’s\n\nbehalf, to prepare responses to the MC®.\n(b)\n\nIn late 2018, after AGC first wrote to the Respondent, the\nRespondent had spoken with Mr BL, who recounted to her his\n\n8 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 35.\n2| §8 SBOD, p 18, email from Ms EK to Mr BL and the Respondent dated 19 December 2016, 10.49am.\n\n62\n\n\frecollection of what happened in December 2013. Mr BL gave\n\nevidence on this and this was not disputed®\".\n(¢)\n\nMore recently, during the discovery phase of the current\nproceedings, the Respondent's lawyers also met with Mr BL\n\nto check what documents were in his possession®.\n189. The Respondent did not give discovery of the BL Documents. She\nsaid that she chose not to disclose or refer to the BL Documents, as\n\nshe “didn’t think that they were relevant at alP®®.\n190.1n our view, the BL. Documents go to important issues before us (as\nwill be seen hereafter), The questions we have to deal with include:\nwhether the Respondent acted as Mr Lee’s lawyer, for the purposes\nof the Last Will. The BL Documents provide relevant evidence, inter\nalia, on the nature and extent of the Respondent’s involvement in the\n\nLast Will, that Mr Lee wanted to know who had drafted the Last Will,\nand that he was told that the Respondent had (primarily) drafted the\nLast Will.\n\n191.We will also deal briefly with how the parties dealt with discovery, in\nrespect of some documents.\n\n192.As part of the discovery process, the Law Society sought specific\ndiscovery, inter alia, of.\n\n(a) all correspondence between the\n\nRespondent, Mr BL and Ms EK, on the Last Will, and (b) the\nAttendance Note for Mr Lee’s signing of the Last Will.\n\n#1 Transcript (3 July 2018), 46:23-28.\n92 Transcript (3 July 2019), 47:10-19.\n93 Transcript (3 July 2019), 47:30 - 48:12, 49:11-14.\n63\n\n\f193.As regards the Law Society’s request for the former category of\ndocuments, the Respondent took the position that the Law Society’s\nrequest was “unnecessary’ because she had already listed “various\ncorrespondences between herself or [Mr LHY] with [Mr BL] and [Ms\nEK] in her list of documents’. The Respondent thus gave the\nimpression that the correspondence disclosed in her List of\nDocuments reflected the entirety of her exchanges with Ms EK and\n\nMr BL%. The Respondent’s List of Documents however, made no\nmention of the BL Documents.\n\n194.As regards the Law Society’s request for the latter category of\ndocuments, the Respondent refused to disclose the EK Attendance\nNote, on the basis that it was “wholly irrelevant to these\nproceedings™®. The EK Attendance Note, inter alia, set out Mr Lee's\nqueries on who prepared the Last Will. In our view, that is relevant to\n\nthe issue of whether the Respondent (or someone else) acted as Mr\nLee's lawyer, in drafting the Last Will.\n195.Both the Respondent and Mr LHY were in possession of the EK\nAttendance Note. Mr LHY said that he may have been given a copy\n\nof the same by the Respondent in December 2016, or he may have\nreceived it earlier®® (see also paragraphs 465 - 466, 493 - 495 below).\n196. We will now deal with the three questions set out at paragraph 176\nabove, to determine whether there was an Implied Retainer, by\nreason of the circumstances, including the Respondent's conduct.\n\n4 Respondent's Skeletal Written Submissions (26 April 2019) at para 28.\n9 Respondent’s Skeletal Written Submissions (26 April 2019) at para 42.\n% Transcript (4 July 2019), 11:11-18, 22:22 ~ 23:11, 43:18 — 44:5, 112:25-30.\n\n\f(1)__ Did Mr Lee and the Respondent proceed on the basis that the\nRespondent was his lawyer for the Last Will?\n197.We will now deal with the first of the three guestions set out in\n\nparagraph 176 above. The Law Society argued that Mr Lee regarded\nthe Respondent as his lawyer for the Last Will. The Respondent and\nMr LHY took the position that Mr Lee regarded Ms KKL, and not the\nRespondent, as his lawyer for the Last Will. They said that there was\nno reason for Mr Lee to have regarded the Respondent as his\n\nlawyer®”. They said that Mr Lee never spoke with the Respondent\nabout the Last Will, and gave his instructions to execute the Last Wil\n\nonly to Mr LHY®,\n. We have considered these points, and the evidence carefully. The\n198\n\nevidence shows that Mr Lee regarded the Respondent as, and\nbelieved her to be, his lawyer for the Last Will. The Respondent also\n\nproceeded on that basis. We will refer to three points:\n(@)\n\nJust before he signed the Last Will, Mr Lee asked, twice, who\nprepared the Last Will. He was told that the Respondent was\nthe primary lawyer for the Last Will. Mr Lee accepted this and\n\nsigned the Last Will on this basis. The Respondent knew what\nMr Lee was told, and did not contradict what Mr Lee was told\n\n(see paragraphs 200 — 222};\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent took instructions directly from Mr Lee, on the\n\nLast Will (see paragraphs 223 — 249); and\n\n97 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) al paras 23, 27 and 28; Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at\nparas 56 and 84(a); Transcript (3 July 2019), 31:15-17; (4 July 2019), 51:4-5, 71:11-12. See also\nDefence at paras 49, 50 and 64(b).\n\n# Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 156; Transeript (3 July 2019), 102:1-4;\nTranscript (4 July 2019), £6:2-4, 66:27, 67:9-11, 97:4-7, 98:13-18.\n\n.\n\n65\n\n\f(c)\n\nAfter the Last Will was signed, Mr Lee kept one of the two\noriginals, and allowed the Respondent to keep the other\noriginal. Ms KKL was sent a copy. Mr Lee also made sure that\n\nthe Respondent was informed, when he signed the Codicil to\nthe Last Will, the following month (see paragraphs 250 — 263).\n189.We will set out the evidence in respect of these three points.\n\n(a)\n\nMr Lee was told that the Respondent prepared the Last Will\n\n200.Mr Lee was told that the Last Will was primarily prepared by the\nRespondent. This took place immediately before he signed the Last\nWill, when Mr BL and Ms EK were at 38 Oxley for its execution.\n201.The Respondent was also informed of Mr Lee's and Mr Bl's\nexchange later that day.\n202.Slightly over an hour after Mr Lee signed the Last Will (on 17\nDecember 2013), Ms EK told the Respondent in an email (see\n\nparagraph 59 above) that®:\n“...he [Mr Lee] is definitely still very lucid - he asked Bernard who\n\ndrafted the will, twice... and Bernard wasn’t entirely sure but\nmentioned it was primarifly you and Ms Kwa from Lee & Lee”.\n[Emphasis added.]\n203. The contemporaneous attendance note prepared by Ms EK later that\nafternoon (namely, the EK Attendance Note (see paragraph 69\n\nabove)), also states that “he [Mr Lee] asked us who drafted the wilf'®.\n# | S8 SBOD, p 8, email from Ms EK fo the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 12.25pm.\n0| S\n\nSBOD, p 20, Attendance nofe contained in the email from Ms EK to Mr BL dated 17 December\n\n2013, 4.32pm.\n\n66\n\n\f204.These accounts were corroborated by Mr BL's evidence. In his\nAffidavit, Mr BL said that:\n\n(a)\n\nBefore Mr Lee signed the Last Will, he asked Mr BL, who\ndrafted the Last Will. Mr BL told Mr Lee that the Respondent\n\nhad drafted the Last Will'®\".\n(b)\n\nMr Lee then asked Mr BL again (i.e. a second time), who\ndrafted the Last Will. On this second occasion, Mr BL told Mr\n\nLee that it was the Respondent, and Ms KKL1%2,\n205.The Respondent did not challenge Mr BL's evidence in crossexamination on this aspect.\n\n206.We consider this exchange between Mr Lee and Mr BL significant,\nfor a number of reasons.\n207.First, Mr Lee's questions to Mr BL show that it was important to Mr\n|Lee to have a lawyer prepare the Last Will. It was the only question\nthat Mr Lee asked (and he asked it twice), before he signed the Last\nWill. We note that Mr Lee had also wanted even the witnesses to the\n\nLast Willto be lawyers. He gave express instructions to get “a solicitor”\n(or a \"notary public’) to witness the signing of the Last Will (see\nparagraphs 41 and Mr LHY’s response, set out at paragraph 44\n\nabove).\n208.Second, in response to Mr Lee's queries, Mr BL said to Mr Lee, both\n\ntimes, that the Respondent was the lawyer for the Last Will. On the\n\n101 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 25.\n162 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 25.\n\n67\n\n\fsecond occasion he also referred to Ms KKL. Mr BL was mistaken in\nthis and Ms KKL had no role in drafting the Last Will (see Section\nVII(BY3) below). Mr Lee was given the impression that the\nRespondent had primarily drafted the Last Will. Mr Lee proceeded to\nsign the Last Will after being told this.\n209.Third, the Respondent's own reaction to what transpired is also\n\nmaterial. The Respondent replied to other aspects of Ms EK's\n\nemail'®. But she did not object to Mr BL saying that she drafted the\nLast Will. She knew that she was held out as the lawyer, who had\n\nprimarily prepared Mr Lee’s Last Will, and was content to leave Mr\nLee with that belief.\n\n210.As will be apparent from the email correspondence, set out earlier\n(see Section [I{G) above, and Section ViIlI(BY3) below), Ms KKL was\n\nnot involved in the drafting of the Last Will. She was left out of the\nrelevant emails. Thus, in fact, the Respondent was the only lawyer\nwho drafted the Last Will. But the inaccurate statement made to Mr\nLee, that Ms KKL was also involved in drafting the Last Will, was also\n\nnot corrected.\n211. The Respondent said to us that Mr Lee ‘never trusted [the\n\nRespondent] as a lawyer’ '™, and therefore could not have regarded\nher as his lawyer for the Last Will. Both Mr Lee and the Respondent’s\nown acceptance of the representation, that she drafted the Last Will,\ncontradicted this assertion. Mr Lee had also (for example) agreed to\nthe Respondent helping Ms KKL draft aspects of the First Will (see,\n\nfor example, paragraphs 16 - 18 above).\n\n198 | 85 SBOD, p 6, email from the Respondent to Ms EK dated 17 December 2013, 12.31pm.\n% Transcript (3 July 2019), 31:12-18.\n\n68\n\n\f212.As mentioned earlier (see paragraphs 83 —84 and 182 — 193 above),\nthe evidence of Mr Lee’s exchange with Mr BL came to light just\nbefore the Hearing.\n213.The Respondent's Affidavit was filed on 10 June 2019, before the BL\n\nDocuments and Mr BL's Affidavit were produced. When she filed her\nAffidavit, the Respondent wouid have had no reason to believe that\nthe BL Documents and Mr BL's Affidavit would be produced before\nthe Tribunal. Her Affidavit gave a very different picture from that\nshown by the BL Documents and Mr BL's Affidavit. Her evidence was\ncontradicted by the BL Documents and Mr BL's evidence.\n\n214.The Respondent sald in her Affidavit that'%:\n“ simply did not consider Papa as a client nor did | contemplate\n\neven for a_moment that Papa would be relying on me for any legal\nadvice. It was clear to me and indeed fo all of us that KKL was his\n\nAs for Papa, he did not consider me as his lawyer or rely on me for\n\nlegal advice.. In fact, as far as | am aware, Papa never intended or\nexpected that | would be involved in making arrangements for the\nexecution of fthe Last Willl.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n215.This is untrue. As set out earlier, the evidence is that Mr Lee was\nexpressly told, twice, that the Respondent had prepared the Last Will.\nMr Lee accepted this. The Respondent also knew that this was what\nMr Lee had been told. Despite knowing that, she said the direct\n\nopposite in her Affidavit.\n105 Respondent’s AEIC {17 June 2019) at paras 27 —28.\n\n69\n\n\f216.The Respondent’s Submissions on No Case to Answer, and Written\nClosing Submissions (made after the BL Documents had been\nproduced), were silent on the BL Documents, and the variance with\nher Affidavit evidence.\n217.1n Oral Closing, Counsel for the Respondent submitted that this was\nan “irrelevant’ point, and a “fruitless” line of enquiry™®. In their Closing\n\nSubmissions, Counsel for the Respondent said that: (a) first, Mr Lee’s\nexchange with Mr BL related to who had drafted the First Will, and\nnot the Last Will. It was therefore not surprising that the Respondent\ndid not object to what Mr BL said, since she had assisted “in the tiny\n\nbit on the demolition clause” for the First Will'”; and (b) second,\nCounsel said there was no reason to ascribe significance to what Mr\nBL had said, because he had, in his evidence, admitted that he was\n\nunsure who had drafted the Last Wil%,\n218.We are unable to accept the above submissions from Counse! for the\n\nRespondent. The unchallenged evidence is that Mr Lee's exchange\nwith Mr BL was directed to the Last Will, which Mr Lee was about fo\nsign, and not the First Will (which Mr Lee wouid have known was\nprepared by Ms KKL). This is confirmed by Mr BL's Affidavit, which\nthe Respondent did not challenge. His Affidavit expressly stated that\n“Mr Lee...asked me who drafted the Last Will.. Mr Lee asked me\n\nagain who drafted the Last Will\"'%. [Emphasis added.}\n219.In our view, it is quite clear that the Respondent was represented to\nMr Lee as the lawyer responsible for the Last (and not the First) Will.\n1% Transcript (7 October 2019}, 24:14-16.\n\n107 Transcript (7 October 2019}, 24:5-16.\n1% Transcript (7 October 2019), 23:28 — 24:4.\n102 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 25.\n\n70\n\n\f220. Further, the Respondent's position is that her role in the First Will\nrelated to only a “tiny bit\". If that is true, then it does not explain why\nshe did not take issue with Mr BL's representation, that she was the\n\nlawyer, even if she understood Mr BL to be referring to the First Will.\n\n221.We also do not regard it as relevant, as the Respondent suggests,\nthat Mr BL may not have known, what the full facts were. What is\n\nMr Lee that she\nmaterial is that the Respondent knew that Mr BL told\ndrafted the Last Will. If that was untrue, she could and should have\ntold Mr Lee what she considered to be the truth. But she accepted\nwhat Mr BL told Mr Lee. She accepted it because as the evidence\nshows, she did prepare the Last Will. In fact, she was the only lawyer\nwho had responsibility for the Last Will. Mr BL's error was in referring\nto Ms KKL, in addition to the Respondent (see paragraph 204(b)\nabove),\n222.The Respondent's answers in cross-examination on several points,\nwere quite unsatisfactory. She often refused to answer questions,\n\nand was evasive. On Mr Lee asking twice about who drafted the Last\n\nWill, this was her evidence''?:\nMr Tan CM:\n\nDoes it not show that in Mr Lee’s mindset, mind, at all\ntimes the fact that either you or Kwa Kim Li was involved\nin the preparation of the will that he was to sign was\nimportant?\n\nRespondent: | think what was important to him was that he had decided\nto go back to the original agreed will and he-—\nMr Tan CM:\n\nSorry.

Her letter of 21\n\nDecember 2018 stated that''®:\n“Matters refating to any involvement | had in assisting my family in\nDecember 2013 were addressed by Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee\nHsien Yang in detailed correspondence to the Committee, in\nparticular in their letters of 28 February 2017 and 14 June 2017.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n227.The Respondent admitted that the plain meaning of what Mr LHY said\n\nwas that Mr Lee had instructed her directly on the Last Will'\"4.\n112 |.8S BOD, Vol 1, p 417 at para 53 and p 419 at para 62.\n113} S5 BOD, Vol 2, p 1329, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 21 December 2018 at para\n10.\n\n114 Transcript (4 July 2019), 53:3-23, 58:7-10.\n74\n\n\f\f228.Both the Respondent and Mr LHY sought fo resile from this account\nof events, in their testimony before us. They said that Mr Lee had\nnever spoken with the Respondent about the Last Will, and that Mr\nLee had given instructions, exclusively, to Mr LHY throughout, and\nnot to the Respondent.\n\n229.This directly contradicted what Mr LHY had said previously, to the\nMC, and what the Respondent had said to AGC.\n230.Neither the Respondent nor Mr LHY provided any coherent\nexplanation, as to why Mr LHY had said to the MC that Mr Lee had\ninstructed the Respondent, if that statement was incorrect. 231.The Respondent said that Mr LHY’s statement (“Mr Lee gave\ninstructions fo Mrs Lee Suet Fern”) was always incorrect and simply\n\nhis “typical...way’ to “shorfcut...his statements’'®. This does not\nmake any sense. To adopt an analogy that the Respondent used, this\nwas not a case where Mr LHY “jumped” steps by going “from A fo D\n\nand misse[d] the B, C D in between\"!'®. This was a case where Mr\nLHY said the exact opposite or something quite different from what\nhe purportedly meant to say. If Mr LHY meant to say that “Mr Lee\n[never] gave instructions to Mrs Lee Suet Fem”; or alternatively, that\n“Mr Lee gave instructiohs to me, [Mr LHY],” then it is surprising that,\n\nto convey the view, Mr LHY would in fact say “Mr. Lee gave\ninstructions to Mrs Lee Suet Fern”. We find it difficult to accept that\n\nthis is a form of “shorthand”'\"?, intended to convey the very opposite/\na meaning quite different, from what the words suggest.\n\n118 Transcript (4 July 2019), 18:32 — 19:2, 25:17-23, 26:12-14, 53:23, 109:29 — 110:1; see also\nTranscript (4 July 2018), 109:31-32, 110:31 — 111:2.\n\n116 Transcript (4 July 2018), 25:17-23; see also Transcript (4 July 2019), 109:31-32.\n17 Transcript (4 July 2019), 18:32 - 19:2.\n\n75\n\n\f232.Second, the Respondent and Mr LHY characterised this as one of the\n“little . exceptions and details’ that had been omitted in the\n\ncorrespondence with the MC''8,\n233.They both drew distinctions between statements to the MC on the\none hand, and court documents on the other and in the case of Mr\nLHY, he went further and made a further distinction with IPO\n\ndocuments \"¢. They said that different standards of care and\nprecision apply between the two, because the former are merely in\n\nthe nature of \"optional explanations™'?. This was said by reference to\nboth public and private statements made by Mr LHY. In plain\nlanguage, the effect of what they said is this: Mr LHY may make\nuntrue statements, in public and in private, whenever there is no legal\npenalty for telling untruths; his public and private statements cannot\n\nbe relied upon to be accurate. This is a surprising statement.\n\n234.We do not find their explanations credible.\n235. These contradictions were not subtle discrepancies, or small details,\n\nthat would only be apparent on close scrutiny. Mr LHY’s assertion to\nthe MC was direct and unequivocal - “Mr Lee gave instructions to\nMrs Lee Suet Fern\". It related to a basic fact — did Mr Lee instruct the\nRespondent, or did he not?\n\n236.This was all the more so, given the significance of this particular\nquestion, in the context of the correspondence with the MC. The\n\npossibility of the Respondent having acted in conflict of interest in\npreparing the Last Will had been raised to the MC, including\n118 Transcript (4 July 2018), 53:5-13.\n19 Transcript (3 July 2019), 17:22-26; see also Transcript (4 July 2019), 111:4-8.\n20 Transcript (4 July 2019), 18:4-11, 18-19, 111:4-7.\n\n76\n\n\fspecifically the question: “What was [the Respondent’s] role in the\npreparation and execution of the Last Will?\"'?. The MC brought this\nissue to the Executors’ (inciuding Mr LHY) attention. It was referred\nto as “serious questions in relation to [the Respondent’s] involvement\n\nas a lawyer” for the Last Will'?2. Mr LHY accepted, under cross\nexamination, that serious allegations had been made in respect of the\n\nRespondent and Mr LHY'2. Mr LHY was responding to the questions\nraised by the MC, by way of the Executors’ letter of 28 February 2017,\nin that context.\n237.As such, we find it difficult to believe that Mr LHY would have\n\nunequivocally asserted that Mr Lee instructed the Respondent, if that\nwas not the case.\n\n238.The first attempt to correct this alleged error was made in Mr LHY’s\n\nAffidavit before the Tribunal'®*. This was more than two years after\nMr LHY’s representation to the MC in February 2017. The Defence\nalso made no mention of it. This is one ofa number of assertions that\nwere made, for the first time, in Mr LHY and the Respondent’s\n\nAffidavits.\n239.We also note that on 25 April 2017, the MC had written to Mr LHY\nand Dr LWL, posing further questions about the preparation of the\n121 | 88 BOD, Vol 1, p 460 at para 38(1), part of Letter from Mr. Lawrence Wong, Minister for Nationat\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n122 | §8 BOD, Vol 1, p 365 at para 10, Annex A attached to the Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\n\nfor National Development, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 16 December 20186.\n\nSee also LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 377 at paras 51 and 56, part of Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\nfor National Development, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 13 January 2017, Para 51 highlighted concerns\nregarding “what appears to be a confiict of interest: LSF was involved in the preparation and/or signing\nof the Last Will, while LHY was a beneficiary...”. Para 56 raised, inter afia, “the following serious\n\nquestions™ in fight of the facts set out — “What was LSF's role in the preparation and execution of the\nLast Wilf?\".\n123 Transcript (4 July 2019), 106:23-26.\n126 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019} at para 84(a).\n\n77\n\n\fLast Will25. In particular, the MC expressly highlighted the Executors’\nearlier representations, that Mr Lee had instructed the Respondent,\nand asked for further details on the nature of the Respondent's\n\ninvolvement'?6.\n240.Despite this, Mr LHY never corrected his purported error.\n241.As stated above (see paragraph 226), the Respondent also adopted\nMr LHY’s representations to the MC, in her own correspondence with\nAGC, in December 2018. During cross-examination, the Respondent\nclaimed that she “did realise” the error, but intended to “clarify it\n\nfurther down”, because her letter was not “the time or place to go\n\nthrough that\"'?\".\n242.1t is not credible to say that the Respondent deliberately left\nuncdrrected, a critical error, which overstated her involvement in the\n\nLast Will. This was the Respondent’s response to AGC, regarding\nserious allegations, that she had misconducted herself, in respect of\n\nthe Last Will. The Respondent knew that her professional conduct\nwas in guestion, and had been raised by AGC.\n\n243, When cross-examined on the Estate’s Letter of 28 February 2017 to\nthe MC, and her letter to AGC, the Respondent was evasive and\nmade numerous attempts to prevaricate. The Respondent said the\nposition in respect of the passages in her letter dated 21 December\n2018 was “nuanced”. The Respendent said that she \"was terrified”\n\nand “wantfed] to go back and check”?®, Then her evidence changed,\n125 | 8S BOD, Vol 1, p 442 — 447, Letter from Mr. Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development,\n{o Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n125 1SS BOD, Vol 1, p 444 at para 6(d), Letter from Mr. Lawrence Wong, Minister for National\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n127 Transcript (4 July 2019), 58:17-19.\n\n128 Transcripts (3 July 2018), 11:8-10.\n\n78\n\n\fand the Respondent’s position was that when she received the first\n\nletter from AGC (on 30 December 2018), she knew that it was\n\n“foreshadowing [her] sitting here before the Tribunal™?®, which was\nan answer she repeated a number of times. Her responses did not\nanswer the question posed.\n\n'\n\n244.Finally, when it was put to the Respondent that her letter, dated 21\nDecember 2018 to AGC, adopted the position the Estate had taken\nin the letter of 28 February 2017, she disagreed. This was\n\nnotwithstanding her admission that in writing to the AGC on 21\nDecember 2018, she had reviewed the two letters from the Estate\n\nshe made reference to'%.\n245, Mr LHY’s and the Respondent’s evidence on this issue was neither\ntrue nor honest. They changed completely their positions from what\nthey had said previously. Their evidence is contradicted by the clear,\ncontrary, contemporaneous evidence, including their own earfier\n\nstatements. Their new position (that it was Mr LHY who had taken\ninstructions from Mr Lee, and not the Respondent) seems to have\nbeen crafted late in the day, just prior to the Hearing, and for the\nspecific purpose of the Hearing.\n‘\n246.0ur conclusion on the evidence is that, when the Estate wrote to the\n\nMC in February 2017, presenting the Respondent as having acted in\na manner consistent with there having been a solicitor-client\n\nrelationship, this was a reflection that the Respondent did indeed see\nher role as such.\n\n23 Transcripts (3 July 2019), 11:25-26.\n\n130 Transcripts (3 July 2019), 7:31.\n\n79\n\n\f247 Now faced with potential disciplinary action, the Respondent has\nchanged her position, and has instead adopted the position that her\n\n™.\ninvolvement was only “peripheral’\n248.Mr LHY’s original account, to the MC — that Mr Lee gave instructions\nto the Respondent — is also consistent with the Respondent's conduct\nin sending the draft Last Will to Mr Lee. As discussed below (see\nparagraphs 274 — 281 below), the Respondent and Mr LHY gave no\n\ncredible explanation as to why it was the Respondent who\nsubsequently sent the draft Last Will to Mr Lee, if Mr Lee's\ninstructions had been given to Mr LHY.\n\n249, The giving and taking of instructions is one of the important hallmarks\nof a solicitor-client relationship.\n250.We will now deal with the third point referred to at paragraph 198,\nrelating to whether Mr Lee and the Respondent proceeded on the\nbasis that the Respondent was his lawyer, for the Last Will.\n(¢)\n\nMrLee’s conduct following the execution of the Last Will\n\n251.The Respondent and Mr LHY said that Mr Lee’s decision to send Ms\nKKL a copy of the Last Will, and (later), the Codicil thereto, showed\n\nthat he regarded Ms KKL as his lawyer for the Last Will'32,\n252.In our view, these events do not support such an interpretation. For\n\nthe reasons set out below, Mr Lee’s conduct, in the way he handled\nthe originals and copies of both the Last Will, and the Codicil, are\n\nconsistent with him regarding the Respondent as his lawyer.\n\n131 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 37.\n132 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 31; Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 54.\n\n80\n\n\f(i}\n\nThe Last Will\n\n253. Mr Lee signed two originals of the Last Will. After the signing, Ms\nWLH informed Mr Lee that the Respondent had sent one of the\noriginals (Original A) fo Mr Lee's office for safe-keeping. She told Mr\nLee that the other original (Original B) would be sealed and locked in\n\nthe Respondent's office safe'® (see paragraph 65 above).\n254. Ms WLH asked Mr Lee if he would like to keep Original A in his office\n\nsafe’®, Alternatively, she suggested that he could pass it to Ms KKL\nfor safekeeping, as Ms KKL was also keeping the originals of Mr\nlLee's title deeds to all the properties.\n\n255.Mr Lee initially responded: “Yes, Kwa Kim L\"\"*. However, when Ms\nWLH replied to confirm that she would arrange for Ms KKL to safe\n\nkeep Original A\", Mr Lee responded: “You keep original in office and\nsend Kim Li a copy™¥. [Emphasis added.] (See paragraph 66 above.)\n256.Thus, despite Ms WLH'’s suggestion to send one of the originals to\nMs KKL, Mr Lee ultimately opted to retain this himself, and send Ms\nKKL a copy instead. This was a departure from the practice for Mr\nlLee’s First to Sixth Wills. Ms KKL, who was Mr Lee’s lawyer for these\n\nprevious Wills, had kept the originals for all of them1®,\n138 | §§ BOD, Vol 1, p 215 — 216, email from Ms WLH to Mr Lee and Ms Lilian Ho dated 17 December\n:\n.\nT\n0\n2013; 4.29pm.\n13 | 8§ BOD, Vol 1, p 215 - 216, email from Ms WELH to Mr Lee and Ms Lilian Ho dated 17 December\n2013, 4.29pm.\n135 | S5 BOD, Vol 1, p 215, email from Mr Lee to Ms WLH dated 17 December 2013, 6.38pm.\n136 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 215, email from Ms WLH to Mr Lee, Mr LHY, the Respondent and Dr LWL daied\n17 December 2013, 7.01pm.\n— 215, email from Mr Lee to Ms WLH dated 17 December 2013, 10.27pm.\n137 { $S BOD, Vol 1, p 214\n\n13 See LSS's Opening Submissions (Transcript (1 July 2019), 24:12); see alsc LSS Submissions for\nNo Case o Answer (3 July 2019) at paras 12(c), 29, LSS Closing Submissicns {20 September 2019)\n\nat paras 69(g) and 83. This was not disputed by the Respondent.\n\n81\n\n\f257.Mr Lee also knew that the Respondent would retain the only other\noriginal of the Last Will, in her office safe. He accepted this.\n258.In our view, it is material that Mr Lee chose to have the Respondent,\n\nand not Ms KKL, retain the original of his Last Will. Mr Lee's practice\n(in respect of the First to Sixth Wills), was to have his lawyer retain\nthe originals of his wills. Mr Lee asking the Respondent to keep the\noriginal of his Last Will is consistent with him proceeding on the basis\nthat the Respondent, and not Ms KKL, was his lawyer for the Last\n\nWill- As we discuss below (see paragraphs 395 - 401), the\nRespondent's own conduct, in deciding to keep an original of the Last\nWill, was equally relevant.\n(i)\n\nThe Codicil\n\n259.The Respondent and Mr LHY relied on the events surrounding the\nCodicil, as evidence that Mr Lee regarded Ms KKL, and not the\n\nRespondent, as his lawyer for the Last Will*®. Their Affidavits\nvariously stated that:\n\n(a)\n\nd\nhis\nOn 3 January 2014, Mr Lee, (through Ms WLH), “informe\nlawyer. KKL, his children, and his 2 daughters-in-law about the\n\nCodicil”.\n(b)\n\nMrLee also “instructed.. that a copy fof the Codicil] be sent to\nhis lawyer, KKL, for her records. He did nof direct any copy to\nbe sent to Stamford”.\n\n(c)\n\n“This makes it apparent that even until January 2014, Papa\ncontinued to view KKL as his lawyer in respect of his wills”.\n\n13 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2018) at paras 30 and 31; Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras\n\n57 and 58.\n\n82\n\n\f[Emphasis added.]\n260.The suggestion that Mr Lee wanted Ms WLH to inform “his lawyer,\n\nKKL...about the Codicil” is not borne out by the evidence. Ms WLH’s\nemail was expressly addressed specifically to the Respondent®. Ms\nKKL was copied as a recipient, just as Mr Lee and the rest of his\nfamily were. Mr Lee decided that Ms WLH should update the\nRespondent on the Codicil. This is consistent with the evidence that\nhe believed that the Respondent was his lawyer, for the Last Will.\n\n261.Mr LHY said that Mr Lee “diid not direct any copy [of the Codicil] to be\nsent to Stamford”#!, [Emphasis added.] However, as stated above,\nMs WLH's email was personally addressed to the Respondent, and\nattached a copy of the Codicil.\n\n262.As regards the Codicil, the Respondent and Mr LHY accepted'#? that\nMr Lee’s Codicil gave effect to his earlier discussions with Ms KKL,\nto bequeath two carpets to Mr LHY (see paragraph 29 above).\n263.We have dealt with the three points, in respect of the question of\n\nwhether Mr Lee and the Respondent proceeded on the basis that the\nRespondent was his lawyer (see paragraph 198 above). That\nquestion, in turn, is the first of three questions, we consider, in\n\ndeciding whether there was an Implied Retainer (see paragraph 176\nabove).\n\n14 | §S BOD, Vol 1, p 230, email from Ms WLH to the Respondent, Mr Lee, Mr LHL, Mr LHY, Dr LWL,\nMs Ho Ching and Ms KKL dated 3 January 2014, 10.30am.\n141 Mr LHYs AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 58,\n\n142 Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 57; Transcript (4 July 2019), 85:22-27, 66:14-16.\n\n83\n\n\f264.

They gave evidence, inter alia, as follows:\n\n(@\n\nMr Lee was a briliant lawyer who knew “exactly what he\n\nwantfed]\"**.

[t went beyond the simple act\n\nof forwarding 1% a draft for Ms KKL to follow up (see\nparagraphs 32 and 268 above, and paragraphs 291 ~ 302\nbelow).\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent’'s email was addressed primarily to Mr Lee;\nMs KKL was copied in the email, with the request to engross\ncoming as an endnote. Prima facie, the email would indicate\nto Mr Lee and Ms KKL, that the Respondent had done all that\nwas necessary, to carry out Mr Lee's instructions, and all that\n\nwas left, was for Ms KKL to engross the Last Will.\n274.Second, Mr LHY was unable to explain why he needed the\nRespondent to send the draft to Mr Lee and Ms KKL, if it was simply\n184 Transcript (3 July 2019), 287, 75:10-28, 73:30-32, 76:30-32, 79:11-12, 86:5-6, 88:10, 108:22-23,\n113:27-32; Transcript (4 July 2019), 2:4-18, 62:16-31, 85.7-23.\n165 On the Respondent and Mr LHY’s evidence that he had forwarded the draft to her (see paragraphs\n303 — 322 of this Decision), the issue of who surfaced the draft is secondary - what is more relevant is\nwhat transpired affer the Respondent obtained the draft (be it herself, or from Mr LHY), when she sent\nit to Mr Lee, and how she explained its contents to him.\n\n89\n\n\fand administrative act of forwarding it on to Mr Lee. Mr LHY also\nremoved Ms KKL, from the emails, shortly thereafter (see paragraph\n39 above).\n\n275.0ne example from Mr LHY's cross-examination is as foliows'®:\n“Mr Tan CM:\n\nSo my question is__if you had -— could forward a draft to\nyour wife, why don’t you directly forward the draft or\nmessage to Kwa Kim Li with instructions for her fo\nengross?\n\nMr LHY:\n\nBecause somelimes my wife helps me with these\nadministrative tasks.\n\nMr Tan CM:\n\nAgain, that doesn't seem to answer my question.

This was especially so if, as he said, he\nwas the one who found the draft. It would have been much faster,\neasier, and the best way for Mr LHY to execute Mr Lee's instructions.\n(As to whether it was Mr LHY who found the draft and sent it to the\nRespondent, see paragraphs 303 - 322 below.)\n167 On the Respondent and Mr LHY's evidence that he had forwarded the draft Last Will to her, see\nparagraphs 303 — 322 of this Decision.\n168 Mr LHY's AEIC {11 June 2019) at paras 40 and 41; The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras\n14 and 18; Transcript (4 July 2018), 135:12-14; Transcript (5 July 2019), 51:28-29, 54;16-17.\n\n91\n\n\f279.Mr LHY admitted, several times, that he could have gone straight to\n\nMs KKL, instead of involving the Respondent'®®.

Mr LHY said that he did all these things. But he specifically required\nthe Respondent’s assistance o send the one email, enclosing the\n\ndraft Last Will, to Mr Lee. This must have been to involve the\nRespondent as a lawyer. This is an the assumption that Mr LHY’s\nevidence that it was he who found the draft and sent it to the\nRespondent is true. However, we do not believe that to be the case\n(see paragraphs 303 - 322 below). We have concluded that Mr LHY’s\nevidence is untrue, and that it was the Respondent who found the\ndraft and sent it to Mr Lee. In any event, it does not matter whether it\nwas the Respondent or Mr LHY who found the draft, for the purposes\nof deciding whether there is an Implied Retainer (see paragraph 304\nbelow).\n\ndelegated tasks to her during the day, but stepped up his involvement in the hours and minutes just\n\nbefore he flew off.\n\n176 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 41.\n\n177 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 42.\n78 | SS BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to Mr Lee, Ms WLH and the Respondent dated 17\n\nDecember 2013, 4.53am.\n\n93\n\n\f281.Mr LHY also suggested that he had not wanted to contact Ms KKL,\n\nbecause he thought very poorly of Ms KKL, and disliked her'™. But\nMr LHY had no issues dealing with Ms KKL on Mr Lee’s previous\n\n. He was also prepared to call Ms KKL on that day (16\nWills\nDecember 2013), to try to speak with her'®'. It is unclear why an email\nwould have been any more unpleasant.\n\n282.In addition, if the Respondent and Mr LHYs intention was to have Ms\nKKL follow-up with the execution, why was the draft Last Will attached?\n\nMs KKL would have the final version of all Mr Lee's Wilis.\n283.Mr LHY’s explanation on this shifted in the course of his evidence.\n\n284. Initially, during cross-examination, Mr LHY accepted that there was\nno need to have attached the draft; he agreed that he could have sent\n\na simple email, and left Ms KKL to follow-up directly with Mr Lee'®.\nMr LHY said, at that point, that he had forwarded the draft not for\nKKL's benefit, but for Mr Lee, so that Mr Lee could see the\n\ndocument\n2,\n285.However, during re-examination, Mr LHY changed his position quite\nsubstantially. He said that he had also wanted Ms KKL to see the\n\ndraft, because he thought very pocrly of her, and was afraid she might\n\nuse the wrong will from 201184,\n\nU\n179 Transcript (4 July 2018), 127:14; Transcript (5 July 2019), §1:22-26, §5:14-21.\n180 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 20189) at paras 19 and 21.\n181 Mr LHY's AEIC {11 June 2019) at para 35.\n\n182 Transcript (4 July 2019), 131:1-8.\n183 Transcript (4 July 2019), 130:27-32; Transcript (5 July 2019), 55:3-13.\n84 Transeript (5 July 2019), 57:21-58:14,\n\n94\n\n\f286.We do not find this explanation by Mr LHY to be credible either. If this\nwas true, there is no reason why he could not have said so, when first\n\nasked. Further, Mr LHY knew that there had been different drafts of\n\nthe First Will “floating back and forth” in 2011'%5, and he had never\nseen the executed version of the First Will'®. That militates against\nbelieving that he would have known better than Ms KKL, which was\nthe correct drait.\n\n287.The Respondent's email of 7.08pm must also be seen together with\nthe other events that took place that evening.\n288.0n Mr LHY and the Respondent’s evidence, they knew before the\nRespondent sent her email, that Ms KKL could not be reached and\n\nwas possibly out of town'®. They sent the email to see if she “might\nbe contactable on email’ '®. They were therefore alive to the\npossibility that Ms KKL might remain uncontactable, or be unable to\nassist with the Last Will. In Mr LHY's own words, “if Kim Li responded\n\nand was able fo, she could. If she can’t, she can’t.”\"®®\n289. They also took other steps, shortly after the Respondent sent Mr Lee\nthe draft Last Will, to arrange for the Last Will to be engrossed and\nwitnessed by another lawyer (Mr BL), without Ms KKL (see paragraph\n\n328 below)™. All this happened without any further attempts to\ncontact Ms KKL'®', and without waiting for Mr Lee’s agreement to\nproceed without her.\n185 Transcript (4 July 2018), 121:11-14,\n188 Mir LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 22.\n87 Transcript (4 July 2019), 129: 8-23, 132:30-134:5; Transcript (5 July 2018), 1:22-32.\n138 Transcript (4 July 2019), 130:25-26, 131:12-13.\n\n189 Transcript (4 July 2019}, 134:8-9.\n190 Transcript (3 July 2018), 33:32-34:24, 40:4-22, 41:22-25; Tran'script (4 July 2019), 1;’{5:21-30.\n\n181 Transcript (4 July 2019), 63:30 — 64:1, 86:3-7, 132:1-4.\n\n5\n\n\f290.In the premises, we do not accept the Respondent and Mr LHY’s\nevidence (see paragraph 272 above), that her email of 7.08pm\n\nserved a purely administrative function. Itis clear that the Respondent\nintended to send the draft Last Will to Mr Lee, as a lawyer, to advise\nhim that it was as he had wanted, and to assure Mr Lee that it was in\n\norder. Even if it was Mr LHY who found the draft, and sent to the\nRespondent'®?, it is her sending it to Mr Lee with her advice, which is\nimportant. It is clear that the Respohdent and Mr LHY contemplated\nthe need for a lawyer, other than Ms KKL, to advise Mr Lee on the\ncontents of the draft Last Wil. The Respondent’s email gave that\nadvice.\n\n(i)\n\nDid the Respondent give Mr Lee “advice”?\n\n291. The Respondent also argued that her conduct could not, as a matter\nof law, amount to “advice’ because she had only described the draft\nto Mr Lee.\n\n292. Her Counsel relied an the High Court decision in CIFG Special Assets\nCapital | Ltd v Polimet Pte Ltd and others[2016] 1 SLR 1382 (“CIFG\"),\nat [138] as authority for the proposition that: (a) explaining the legal\neffect of a document, does not amount to “advice”, for the purposes\nof an implied retainer, and (b) an implied retainer should only be\n\nfound, when a solicitor has gone to the extent of providing advice, for\nthe purposes of safeguarding or advancing the interests of the\nputative client.\n\n293.Having reviewed the judgment in CIFG, we did not find that it\nsupported the Respondent’s position.\n\n182 See paragraphs 305 — 322 of this Decision, where this question is dealt with.\n\n96\n\n\f294.1n CIFG, an implied retainer was alleged to arise between: (a) the\nlawyer acting for the plaintiff, who was party to a proposed agreement,\nand (b) the unrepresented counterparty to the transaction, who was\nthe defendant. The Court found that no implied retainer arose. In\narriving at its decision, the Court took into account the specific duties\nthat arise when a solicitor acts for a client, in a transaction with an\nunrepresented counterparty. In such cases, a solicitor must strike a\nbalance between two competing duties:\n(i)\n\nOn the one hand, the solicitor is under an obligation not to take\n\nunfair advantage of the opposing party: see Rule 53A of the\nPCR (see CIFG at [100]). He therefore owes a duty to the\nunrepresented counterparty to (see C/FG at [101]):\n\n(A)\n\nexplain the terms and conditions of the contract and\nlegal consequences thereof, fully and frankly, to the\n\nunrepresented counterparty; and\n(B)\n\nensure that the unrepresented party understands these\nterms and conditions, and legal consequences, fully\n(see CIFG at [126] - [128]).\n\n(i)\n\nOnthe other hand, the solicitor also owes a concurrent duty to\nhis own client, not to act against the client’s interests, (see\n\nCIFG at [132] — [137]). In particular, the solicitor is not\npermitted to act against his client, by giving “advice” to another\nparty, with opposing interests: Rule 30 of the PCR.\n295.The Court observed that a solicitor in this situation is placed in “an\ninvidious position”; he owes duties, both his client, and the\nunrepresented party who has interests, that are opposed to his\n\nclient's {see CIFG at [100] and [1011).\n\n97\n\n\f(a)\n\nI he overreaches by providing more assistance to the\ncounterparty that he ought to, he could find himself:\n(i)\n\nwith a new putative client, if an implied retainer is found;\nandfor\n\n(i)\n\nin breach of his duty, not to act against his (original)\nclient.\n\n(b)\n\nHowever, if he provides less assistance to the unrepresented\n\ncounterparty than he ought to have, he could be blamed for\nhaving taken unfair advantage of third parties.\n206. In view of the balance that has to be struck, between these competing\nduties, the court agreed that the word “advice” in Rule 30 of the PCR\n(and, by extension, for the purposes of an implied retainer) cannot be\n\ngiven its natural and ordinary meaning (see CI/FG at [134])). In\nparticular, a solicitors conduct, in explaining the meaning of a\ndocument to an unrepresented counterparty (as his duties under Rule\n53A of the PCR require), should not, in itself, constitute “advice”, for\n\nthe purposes of Rule 30 of the PCR, and/or an implied retainer (see\nCIFG at [137] and [138]).\n297.The Court's approach in CIFG is understandable, in the context of\ndealings between a solicitor, and an unrepresented countefparty toa\ntransaction. The ordinary meaning of “advice” is untenable, in such\ncases, because of the solicitor's concurrent duty to the counterparty,\nif the meaning of “advice” is not narrowed. A solicitor will then run the\nrisk of an implied retainer, and/or of being found in breach of Rule 30\nof the PCR whenever he tries to discharge his duty under Rule §3A\nf the PCR,\northe\nFLR, by explaining the document to the counterparty.\n\n98\n\n\f208.There are clear differences between the facts before us, and those in\nCIFG. In CIFG, the lawyer in question took care to tell the\nunrepresented counterparty that: (a) he was not their lawyer and did\nnot act for them, (b) he could not advise them, and (c) they should\nseek independent legal advice. In addition, the lawyer never took\ninstructions directly from the counterparty. He only explained the\nterms of the document to them, as he believed it was his duty to do\n\n50, to avoid any unfair advantage to his client. (See C/IFG at [125],\n[142], and [150].)\n299.The facts before us are quite different. First, the Respondent never\n\ntold Mr Lee that she was not his lawyer. To the contrary, she allowed\nhim to believe that she was the lawyer who had drafted the Last Will\n(see paragraph 209 above).\n300.Second, the Respondent never told Mr Lee to seek independent legal\nadvice. This is undisputed. Instead, the Respondent took active steps\nto allow the execution to proceed, without Mr Lee's usual lawyer, Ms\n\nKKL (see paragraphs 327 - 331 below).\n301.Third, as set out hereafter, the Respondent’s involvement in the Last\n\nWill went beyond sending Mr Lee the draft Last Will, and explaining\nits contents to him. She additionally assumed the responsibility of\nmaking all the preparations for Mr Lee’s Last Will, which Ms KKL\nwould ordinarily have handled.\n302. Between the evening of 16 December 2013, when Mr Lee received\nthe draft from the Respondent, and the morning of 17 December 2013,\nwhen Mr Lee signed the Last Will, no other lawyer advised Mr Lee on\nits contents.\n\n99\n\n\f(iii) Did Mr LHY send the Respondent the draft Last Will for her\nto send to Mr Lee?\n\n303.The Respondent and Mr LHY said that it was Mr LHY who had found,\namongst his emails, what he believed to be the final draft of the First\n\nWill, and that he had then forwarded this on to the Respondent, so\nthat she could follow up with Mr Lee and Ms KKL. Thus, they say, the\nRespondent’s role was merely administrative.\n304.The issue is not, strictly speaking, material to the question of the\nImplied Retainer. For the reasons explained above, the Respondent\n\nadopted and assumed responsibility for the contents of the draft Last\nWill, vis-a-vis Mr Lee. Thus, even if it was Mr LHY who found the draft,\n\nand sent it to the Respondent, that does not detract from the\nRespondent’s legal responsibility.\n305.The claim that Mr LHY sent the Respondent the draft Last Will, is\nhowever, not borne out by the evidence. Neither the Respondent nor\n\nMr LHY produced any emails to support their account.\n306.We found this surprising. Mr LHY had no difficulty locating other\nemails from this period’®®, and even emalils pre-dating this period,\n\nfrom 2011 and 201294, However, he was unable to produce an email,\nshowing that he had forwarded the draft Last Will to the Respondent\n\n(or Mr BL, as he also claimed (see paragraph 333 below))'®.\n307.Mr LHY attributed this to his policy of deleting emails with\nattachments'®; he said that “where documents have been executed\n195 See for example Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) — Exhibit “LHY-9\", “LHY-10\", \"LHY-11\", “LHY-12\".\n19 See for example Mr LHY'’s AEIC (11 June 2019) — Exhibit *LHY~1” (Email exchange from August\n2041), *LHY-3\" (Email exchange from Sep 2012), “LHY-4\" (Email from Qct 2013).\n\n195 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 37 and 42.\n185 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 37; Transcript (4 July 2019), 125:13-31.\n100\n\n\fand there’s a hardcopy, the hardcopy becomes the determining\n\none”%7, However, if what Mr LHY said is accurate, then it is difficult\nto see why, in 2013, Mr LHY would have kept a draft of the First Wiil\nfrom 2011, when that First Will had long been executed and itself\nsuperseded by other Wills.\n308.The Defence that the Respondent filed also made no mention of the\n\nfact that it was Mr LHY who surfaced the draft Last Will to the\nRespondent'. These claims were made, for the first time, in the\nRespondent’s and Mr LHY’s Affidavits.\n300.These Affidavits were filed in June 2019, months after these\n\nproceedings were started, and years after the questions about the\nLast Will first arose.\n310.In particular, Mr LHY’s role in sending the draft Last Will to the\nRespondent was not referred to in Mr LHY’s responses to the MC, in\n\n2016 and 2017, despite these documents having been drafted with\n\nthe assistance of lawyers from Rajah & Tan LLP™®.\n311.Mr LHY’s explanation for not raising this earlier was inconsistent and\n\nevasive?®.\n312.Mr LHY initially said that his new account was reconstructed evidence,\nrather than based on his actual recollection (as his earlier\nrepresentations to the MC had been). He suggested that these facts\nwere omitted from his letters to the MC because at the time, he had\n\n197 Transcript (4 July 2019), 125:28-30.\n198 Transcript (3 July 2019), 46:11-17, 75:29 - 76:8.\n\n198 Transcript (4 July 2019), 107:23-30.\n200 Transcript {4 July 2019}, 118:20-31.\n\n101\n\n\frelied solely on his recollection. In contrast, he said that after the\nTribunal was convened, he and the Respondent's legal team had put\n\nin “an enormous amount of effort’, to do a “very careful review of\nmany documents, emails” and “based on that... to put fogether what\n\nwas a complete picture™.\n313.1n other words, based on Mr LHY's explanation:\n\n(a)\n\nWhat he told the MC was based on his recollection and was\ntherefore not correct; and\n\n(b)\n\nWhat he said to us, two years later, was based on\nreconstruction, not his recollection, and was therefore correct.\n\n314.The High Court had cautioned in Lim Ah Leh v Heng Fock Lin [2018]\n\nSGHC 156 at [80}:\n“Reconstructed evidence is of limited value. |t is self-serving and is\nparticularly susceptible to the influence of hindsight. 1t is therefore a\n\nsignificantly weaker form of evidence than evidence from actual\nrecollection.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n315.Mr LHY spoke about his extensive efforts with the Respondent's\nlawyers to reconstruct what happened in order to prepare the\nRespondent’s case. He was asked why the Defence was still silent\non his role in sending the draft Last Will to the Respondent. He said\n\nhe had no responsibility for the document??. But that does not\nanswer the question as to why he did not paint out to the Respondent,\n\nthat her Defence should set out this fact (if he had thought it relevant):\n201 Transcript (4 July 261 g), 116:8-18, 118:20-31.\n202 Transcript (4 July 2019), 117:15 - 11815,\n102\n\n\f“Tan CM:\n\nWhy did you think it unnecessary to include in this\ndefence [that was filed by Mrs Lee Suet Fern for this\nTribunal] the fact that you were the one who forwarded\na draft to Mrs Lee Suet Fern?\n\nMr LHY:\n\n| wasn't responsible for preparing this defence.\n\nTan CM:\n\nDid you not think that this was an important [fact] when\nyou assist Mrs Lee Suet Fem in the defence?\n\nMr LHY:\n\nShe’s assisted by a team of lawyers.\n\nTan CM:\n\nSo if this is an important fact, why was this not put in her\ndefence if you had some involvement in helping her with\n\nthe defence?\nMr LHY:\n\nI'm not her lawyer.\n\nTan CM:\n\nAlright.\n\nMr. LHY:\n\n| mean, this is not my document.”\n\n[Emphasis added]\n316.1n addition, when asked to provide the evidential basis for his new\n\nassertion (i.e. reconstruction (see paragraphs 312 and 313 above)),\nthat he sent the draft to the Respondent, Mr LHY was unable to\n\nprovide an answer. He could not point to any document which aliowed\n\n103\n\n\fhim to come to this new reconstruction. Eventually he said that his\n\naccount was based on recollection®®:\n“Tan CM:\n\nAlright. You've... combed through everything in 2019 for\nthe purposes of assisting Mrs Lee Suet Fern in this\n\ndefence.

But the two\n\nrecollections were diametrically opposite. His latest recollection is\ncontradicted by the documents, and is not in the Defence that the\nRespondent filed. The (atest recollection, however, fits in with the line\n\nof defence put to us during the hearing. Having observed him on the\nwitness stand, it was clear to us that he was not telling the truth. Mr\n\nLHY came up with this untrue explanation, for the purposes of the\nHearing.\n318.The Respondent also said that she did not recall opening or reading\n\nthe draft before sending it to Mr Lee?%4.\n319.Even if this is true, for reasons that have been stated earlier (see\n\nparagraphs 290, and 299 — 302 above), the fact that the Respondent\n\n204 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 16; Transcript (3 July 2019), 73:11 - 74:8, 75:1014.\n\n103\n\n\fdid nat read the document, before sending it to Mr Lee, does not\ndetract from her legal responsibility for the document.\n\n320.|n addition, we do not find the Respondent's evidence credible. The\n\nRespondent testified that she was “ferrified” of Mr Lea®. In particular,\nshe said that */ wouldn't have dared send [the draft Last Will] if | didn’t\nthink that it was what he wanted’, because “if f've got it wrong... I'd\n\nbe shot'?®. If that was so, it is difficult to believe that she would have\ngiven Mr Lee assurance, on what the document was, and then\nforwarded the document on, without first reading it, to make sure that\n\nits contents were in order?”’,\n321. The objective evidence points against the Respondent and Mr LHY's\nnew account of events. There was no evidence that Mr LHY received\n\nany draft of the First Will in 2011 (which he claimed that he then sent\non to the Respondent, in December 2013). The assertion in his\n\nAffidavit, that he was “privy fo some drafts” of the First Will®®8, was\nunsupported.\n\n322.The documentary evidence available showed the contrary — that it\nwas the Respondent, and not Mr LHY, who had received drafts of the\n\nFirst Will in August 20112%¢, The Respondent’s email, which sent the\ndraft Last Will to Mr Lee, alsc made no reference to Mr LHY having\nsent her the draft.\n\n205 Transcript (3 July 2018), 53:9; See also Transcript (3 July 2019), 34:19-20, 36:32 - 37:2, 57.26-27,\n62:26-28.\n\n208 Transcript (3 July 2019), 89: 6; Transeript {4 July 2019), 85:16-19, 86:10-20.\n207 Transcript (3 July 2019), 75:24-26.\n\n208 pir LHY’s AEIC {11 June 2019) at para 18.\n208 | 88 BOD, Vol 1, p 101, email from the Respondent to Mr Lee and Ms KKL dated 19 August 2011,\n11.08pm.\n\n106\n\n\f323.We now turn to the second point, (b), referred to at paragraph 266\nabove, on the question of the role played by the Respondent in the\nLast Will, by reference to the exclusion of Ms KKL.\n(b)\n\nMs KKL was excluded from being involved in the Last Will\n\n324.The documentary evidence shows that 23 minutes after the\nRespondent sent her email (of 16 December, 7.08pm), Mr LHY sent\na further email to Mr Lee, asking Mr Lee to proceed without Ms KKL\n(see paragraph 39 above). He also removed Ms KKL from the email\nexchange, even though Mr Lee had not decided, at that point, to\n\nproceed without Ms KKL. This was done with the Respondent’s\nknowledge as she was on the emails.\n325.1n his email, Mr LHY told Mr Lee?'*:\n(a)\n\n“I couldn’t get in touch with Kim Li. | believe she is away.\"\n\n(b)\n\n“I don't think it is wise to wait till she is back.”\n\n(c)\n\n“[Lthink allvou need is a witness to sign the will.\"\n\n(d)y\n\n“Fern can get one of her partners to come round with_an\nengrossed copy of the will fo execute and witness.

On the evidence before us, Ms KKL\nwas not aware of any of the arrangements that the Respondent and\n210 | §3 BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to the Respondent, Mr Lee and Ms WLH dated 16\nDecember 2013, 7.31pm.\n\n107\n\n\fMr LHY made, for Mr Lee to sign the Last Will. Ms KKL also did not\nadvise Mr Lee, on the draft that the Respondent sent to him, before\nhe signed it the next morning. She found out that Mr Lee had signed\nthe Last Will after the fact, when the Respondent informed her (see\nparagraph 403 below).\n327.The Respondent was copied on Mr LHY’s email of 7.31pm. She also\nexcluded Ms KKL from all further correspondence relating to the Last\nWill, until after it was signed the next day.\n\n328.In addition, the Respondent took immediate steps to arrange for\nanother lawyer to engross and witness the Last Will, without waiting\nfor Mr Lee to decide whether to proceed without Mrs KKL. This\nshowed considerable haste.\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent approached her colleague, Mr BL, to seek\nhis assistance with the execution of the Last Will, and briefed\nhim. She also selected the other witness for the Last Will, Ms\n\nEK, who was also a lawyer from her law firm?!.\nAccording to Mr LHY’s evidence, the Respondent briefed Mr\nBL, on the Last Will, before Mr LHY emailed Mr Lee at 7.31pm\n\nto propose proceeding without Ms KKL2'2.\nBased on Mr BL's evidence, the Respondent acknowledged\nthat she was doing what Mr Lee’s lawyer, Ms KKL, was\n“supposed fo do’.

This aspect of\nMr BL’s evidence was not challenged.\n332.The Respondent and Mr LHY also said that it was Mr LHY, and not\n\nthe Respondent, who sent Mr BL the draft Last Will to engross.\n333.This assertion is unsupported by any of the contemporaneous\ndocumentary evidence.

The Respondent accepted, during cross-examination, that\nthere was nothing in Mr BL’s evidence about him only being on standby: Transcript (3 July 2018), 74:1518.\n217 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 22.\n\n110\n\n\f336.Mr LHY claimed that he sent Mr BL the draft Last Will by email, on 16\n\nDecember 20132%8, However, Mr BL's evidence?'® was that he only\nreceived one email from Mr LHY (see paragraph 46 above). This was\nsent on 17 December 2013, and had not enclosed the draft Last Will.\n\n337.The Respondent and Mr LHY's account is also contradicted by the\n'\nDefence.\n338. Mr LHY said that he called Mr BL, and sent Mr BL the draft before Mr\n\nLHY sent his email of 7.31pm to Mr Lee?® (see paragraph 39 above).\nHowever, this is contrary 1o the Respondent's pleaded case, that she\nhad “introduced BL to...

There was no other solicitor who gave him\nadvice.\n\n343.Mr LHY then advised Mr Lee to proceed with the execution of the Last\nWill (see paragraph 39 above). Mr Lee agreed with what Mr LHY had\nproposed (see paragraph 41 above) and said:\n\n“Engross and I will sign it before a solicitor in Femn’s office, or from\n\nany other office.” 2%\n. The Last Will was signed the next moming on 17 December 2013, at\n344\n11.10am.\n\n345.We now tumn to the fourth point, (d), at paragraph 266 above.\n\n223 | S BOD, Vol 1, p 182, email from Mr Lee to Mr LHY directing him to proceed without Ms KKL,\ndated 16 Dec 2013 at 9.42 pm.\n\n112\n\n\f(d) The Respondent’s role in expediting the execution of the Last Will\n\n346.The Respondent and Mr LHY testified that the Last Will was signed\nin a rush, because Mr Lee was anxious and impatient. They said that\nthey became involved, because Ms KKL had failed to get back to Mr\nLee as she had promised, and he wanted the Last Will signed\nurgently.\n347.The considerations which the Respondent and Mr LHY cited did not\nshow any anxiety, on Mr Lee's part.\n348.First, the Respondent and Mr LHY claimed that Mr Lee was\nconcerned about his own mortality, because he had been in poor\nhealth.\n349. It is not disputed that Mr Lee was hospitalised for several weeks, from\n\nSeptember to October 2013224,\n350.After his discharge, Mr Lee had discussed the changes to his\n\nPenuitimate Will with Ms KKL over the course of several weeks (see\nparagraphs 28 and 29 above). The last exchange between them was\non 13 December 2013, just three days before the Respondent and\n\nMr LHY entered the picture. There was no reasonable explanation\ngiven as to why Mr Lee would have suddenly decided, on 16\nDecember 2013, that he wanted the Penultimate Will changed in\nmaterial ways, immediately, on an urgent basis. The Respondent and\n\nMr LHY say that Mr Lee had decided that he wanted to revert to his\n\nFirst Will, made in 2011225, No account has been given of any\ndiscussions which led Mr Lee to this decision. The Respondent and\nMr LHY do not say that they asked Mr Lee for his reasons for this\ndecision.\n224 Transcript (4 July 2019), 147:1-5.\n225 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 13; Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 34.\n113\n\n\f351.The way the Last Will was executed is quite different from the way Mr\nLee had handled the First Will and the way he handled discussions\non making changes to the Penuitimate Will. Mr Lee discussed the\n\nFirst Will with his family and worked with a lawyer (Ms KKL) (see\nparagraphs 16 — 18, 28, and 29 above). He also discussed changes\n\nto his Penultimate Will with Ms KKL over a period of time. The Last\nWill (which superseded the Penuitimate Will) was however executed\n\nvery quickly. The evidence shows that it was the Respondent and Mr\n\nLHY who were anxious for the Last Will to be executed quickly and\nrushed it.\n352. These circumstances raise several serious questions.\n353.Why did Mr Lee decide to go back to his First Will of 2011?; Did he\nhave the First Will with him?; Did he remember the terms of the First\n\nWili? (The Respondent admitted that Mr Lee cannot be expected to\nremember the terms of his First Will (see paragraph 558 below); Did\nhe know that the Last Will made several significant changes to the\nPenultimate Will (see paragraph 35 above)?; Did he remember that\nonly three days earlier, on 13 December 2013, the position he had\narrived at with Ms KKL was that he would make only two changes to\nthe Penultimate Will and by way of codicil (one of which was to\nequalise the shareholding of the children) (see paragraphs 28 and 29\nabove)? Why did he suddenly change his position and decide to\ncompletely revoke the Penultimate Will?\n\n354.0n the Respondent's and Mr LHY’s evidence, none of these\nquestions were discussed between Mr Lee and them.\n355, The relevance of some of these points are considered later, in\nSection IX(B), when we consider a solicitor's duties.\n\n114\n\n\f356.Leaving aside these questions, for the time being, we did not find\nanything in the evidence to support the Respondent and Mr LHY's\nstatements that Ms KKL had failed to respond to Mr Lee in a timely\nfashion.\n357.The Respondent and Mr LHY claimed, in this regard, that Ms KKL\n\nhad “promised” Mr Lee to have something ready by 15 December\n2013, but had failed to do so.\n\n358.The email exchange between Ms KKL and Mr Lee shows that Ms\nKKL had offered, in her last email to Mr Lee on 12 December 2013,\nto arrange for him to sign a codicil to the Penultimate Will “this week,\n\nor when you are ready””®. Mr Lee did not respond to indicate that he\nwanted it done urgently. Nor is there any evidence of Mr Lee having\nattempted to make an appointment with Ms KKL (to sign either a\ncodicil to the Penultimate Will, or a new will) between 12 December\n2013 (when Ms KKL's email was sent) and 16 December 2013, when\n\nthe Respondent sent her email to Mr Lee, enclosing the draft Last\nWill. If there were such attempts, or if Mr Lee had shown any urgency,\nsuch evidence should have been available to the Estate. The Estate,\nwith Mr LHY as an Executor, has, where it thought necessary, made\navailable evidence for the Respondent, in this matter.\n\n359.Second, Mr LHY said that the timing for the execution was set by Ms\nWLH, who was also anxious to get the Last Will executed. In support\nof this, he referred to Ms WLH’s use of the word “asap” when she\nreplied\n\nto the\n\nRespondent's\n\n'email,\n\ninstructing\n\nher to\n\nmake\n\narrangements with Mr BL to execute the Last Will (see paragraph 48\nabove)??. Mr LHY's interpretation was that Ms WLH had herself “the\n\n228 | §S BOD, Vol 1, p 167, email from Ms KKL to Mr Lee dated 12 December 2018, 12.48pm.\n\n227 | §$ BOD, Vol 1, p 194, email from Ms WLH to Mr LHY, the Respondent and Mr BL dated 17 Dec\n2013, 9.23am; Transcript (5 July 2019}, 8:20-21,\n\n115\n\n\fsame sense of urgency’, “independent of us [himself and the\n\nRespondent]'?®,\n360. The suggestion that Ms WLH had acquired this sense of urgency from\nMr Lee is speculative, and unsupported by any evidence. There is no\nevidence that Ms WLH spoke or otherwise communicated with Mr\nLee on this matter, before she had sent the email at 8.23am on 17\nDecember 2013.\n361.Ms WLH received multiple emails from the Respondent and Mr LHY\nthrough the night. The Respondent had herself used the same term,\n\n“asap’, in her correspondence with Mr BL, just minutes before Ms\nWLH sent her email.\n\n362.When Ms KKL could not be contacted, it was Mr LHY who told Mr\nLee: “f don't think it is wise to wait...\" (see paragraph 39 above).\n\n363.The Respondent also took steps to arrange for Mr BL to help with the\nexecution, even before Mr LHY approached Mr Lee to suggest\n\nproceeding without Ms KKL2%, and befare Mr Lee agreed fo proceed\nwithout Ms KKL (see paragraphs 38 — 42 above).\n364. In addition, both the Respondent and Mr LHY repeatedly emphasised\nthe need to execute the Last Will as quickly as possible, in their\ncorrespondence with Mi BL, the morning that the Last Will was signed\n(see paragraphs 46 - 49 above).\n\n(a)\n\nIn Mr LHY’s email of 5.32am, he told Mr BL to “gef it engrossed\n\nfoday’.\n\n228 Transcript (6 July 2019), 6:26 - 7:5, §:19-22,\n228 Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 41 — 43; Transcript (5 July 2019), 53:3-11.\n116\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn the Respondent's email of 9.22am, she told Mr BL to “be\n\nready and accessible at short notice...[mpt that we get this\ndone asap please”.\n(c)\n\nShe repeated a minute Iater, at 9.23am, that Mr BL should \"be\ngood fo rur”.\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n365.Based on the evidence, it was the Respondent and Mr LHY who\nproceeded with the execution of the Last Will quickly, while knowing\nthat Mr Lee would not be advised by any lawyer except the\nRespondent. The Respondent worked with Mr LHY to expedite the\nsighing of the Last Will, with extreme haste, without any other lawyer\nadvising Mr Lee. The Last Wifl was signed within 16 hours of the\n\nRespondent’s first email to Mr Lee enclosing the draft Last Will.\n366.We now turn to the fifth point, (€), in paragraph 266 above.\n\n(e) The Respondent’s involvement in the lead-up fo the execution of\nthe Last Will\n\n367.The Respondent said in her Affidavit that she had “no further\ninvolvement” in the Last Will after she sent her email of 8.12pm to Mr\n\nBL, Ms WLH and Mr LHY?* (see paragraph 40 above). Her evidence\nwas shown to be untrue when Mr Bl's evidence and the BL\n\nDocuments were put before us by the Law Society (see paragraphs\n184 - 180 above).\n368.The BL Documents, and Mr BL's Affidavit, showed that the\n\nRespondent's involvement went significantly beyond the two\n2% Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 20 and 27..\n\n117\n\n\f“administrative tasks”, of forwarding the Last Will, and introducing Mr\n\nBL.\n\n369. After the Respondent introduced Mr BL to Ms WLH and Mr LHY at\n8.12pm (see paragraph 40 above), various emails were exchanged\nbetween the Respondent, Mr LHY, Ms WLH and/or Mr BL, untit the\n\nnext morning, before the Last Will was signed. Many of these emails\nwere also sent to, or by, the Respondent. They have been referred to\nat Section II(G) above.\n\n370.Even after the Respondent had boarded her flight to Paris®', she\ncontinued to monitor the progress of arrangements for execution, and\nremained in close contact with Mr BL, who sent her regular updates.\n\n(@\n\nAt 9.22am on 17 December 2013, the Respondent told Mr BL\n\nto be “ready and accessible at short notice”; to be “ready to\ngo”. She told him that it was “impt that we get this done asap”\n232\n\n(b)\n\nA minute later, Mr BL replied to the Respondent, to note her\n\ninstructions?®2,\nAt the same time, Ms WLH also replied to the Respondent’s\nemail of 8.12pm the previous night, thanking the Respondent\n\nfor Mr BL’s contact information, and informing the Respondent\nthat she would arrange for Mr BL to see Mr Lee, as soon as\n\npossible?*,\n\n231 Transeript (1 July 2019), 22:4-12; Transcript (3 July 2019), §9:1-3.\n232 | §8 SBOD, p 10, email from the Respondent to Mr BL dated 17 December 2013, 9.22am.\n23 55 SBOD, p 9, email from Mr BL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 9.23am.\n\n24158 BOD, Vel 1, p 194, email from Ms WLH to the Respondent, Mr LHY and Mr BL dated 17\nDecember 2013, 9.23am.\n\n118\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe very next minute, (at 9.24am), the Respondent sent\nanother email to Mr BL, emphasising again that he must “be\ngood to run”.

She made the arrangements\nthat a lawyer would normally make.\n374.1n addition, the BL Documents show that the Respondent continued\nthis engagement even after the Last Will was signed (see paragraphs\n380 - 384, and 389 - 394 below). She did so with Mr BL, and also with\nMs EK, and her other colleagues in Stamford Law, who helped with\n\nthe Last Will.\n375.1n total, the Respondent exchanged more than 15 emails with Mr BL\nand her other colleagues at Stamford Law.

They gave no coherent explanation as to why\nthey excluded Ms KKL, if they had genuinely regarded her as Mr\nLee's lawyer.\n415.Mr LHY said that these emails were “administrative”, as they dealt\n\nwith “fogistical arrangements” for attestation . That is plainly\nincorrect. These were matters-that Ms KKL would have handled if she\n\nwas Mr Lee's lawyer, just as she had done for all his other Wills. Ms\nKKL was also not asked to give any advice on the changes to the\ndraft Last Will.\n\n263 Sge paragraphs 324 — 328 of this Decision.\n\n264 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 44; Transcript (4 July 2018}, 137:1-11.\n\n129\n\n\f416.The Respondent gave a number of other reasons:\n(a)\n\nShe did not notice that Ms KKL had been removed?®.\n\nThis is not credible. The Respondent was the one who started\nsome of the ensuing email chains in connection with. the\n\nexecution of the Last Will?%.\n(b)\n\nShe did no “active removal’ Ms KKL by withdrawing her initial\n\nemail, or by asking Ms KKL to “stand down™®\".\nHowever, Mr LHY excluded Ms KKL’s involvement and\n\nproceeded quickly with the execution of the Last Will, without\ngiving Ms KKL a reasonable opportunity to respond. The\nRespondent and Mr LHY knew that Ms KKL might be out of\nSingapore, and proceeded on that basis.\n\n417.For completeness, we should also mention that the Law Society\nsuggested that Ms KKL had not received the Respondent’s email of\n7.08pm (see paragraph 32 above)*®. The Law Society relied on Ms\nKKL's email to the Respondent, saying: “/ don't seem fo have\n\nreceived your first mail of 16 dec 7.08pm asking me to engross™e®,\nWe do not need to, and do not make a finding on this, beyond noting\nthat Ms KKL has said that she did not receive the email.\n\n285 Transcript (3 July 2018), 77:3-4, 78:15-17, 79:8-11.\n\n288 See for example LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 179, email from the Respondent to Ms WLH, Mr LHY and Mr\nBL dated 16 December 2013 at 8.12pm, LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 200, email from the Respondent to Mr LHY\ndated 17 December 2013 at 12.13pm, and LSS SBOD p 14, email from the Respondent to Mr BL, Ms\nJoyce Han, Ms Clara Ng and Ms EK dated 17 December 2013 at 12.26pm.\n267 Transeript (3 July 2019), 33: 27-30, 41:10-11, 80:7-8, 86:27, 88:1-3; Transcript (4 July 2019), 63:25 & 25-28.\n268 Transcript (3 July 2018), 87:27 ~ 88:4; Transcript {4 July 2019), 83:14.\n\n269 L8 BOD, Vol 1, p 208, emall from Ms KKL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 2.59pm.\n\n130\n\n\f(b) Mr Lee's discussion with Ms KKL on the Codicil to the\nPenultimate Will\n418.The Respondent also referred to some earlier emails between Mr Lee\nand Ms KKL (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above), as evidence that Ms\nto 16 December 2013, already advised Mr Lee on the\nKKL had, prior\nchanges that he wanted to make to the Penultimate Will.\n\n419.Mr Lee’s prior discussions with Ms KKL, as evidenced by these\nemails, were unrelated to the Last Will, and did not touch on all of the\nchanges that the Last Will effected, either to the Penultimate Will or\n\nthe First Will. The Respondent offered no other evidence on this point.\n420.The documents presented to us prima facie show that Mr Lee and Ms\nKKL discussed an entirely different (and more limited) approach: a\ncodicil to the Penultimate Will, that would make two specific changes\n(see paragraphs 28, 29 and 37 above).\n\n421.The Last Will also omitted changes which Mr Lee had discussed with\nMs KKL (see paragraph 36 above).\n422.To the Respondent and Mr LHY's knowledge, the Respondent was\nthe only lawyer who had advised Mr Lee on the Last Will before it was\nsigned. Mr LHY had also personally persuaded Mr Lee to proceed\n\nwithout Ms KKL.\n\n'\n\nMr LHY’s attempts to prevent Ms KKL from giving evidence\n\n423.Mr LHY agreed that Ms KKL would have been a useful witness to\n\nthese proceedings?®. However, as an Executor of the Estate, he\n\n270 Trangcript (5 July 2019), 63:17-24.\n\n131\n\n\frestricted Ms KKL from discussing her communications with Mr Lee,\n\non the grounds of privilege®™.\n424.In April 2019, the Law Society’s lawyers wrote to Ms KKL, to request\na meeting with her, inter alia, to discuss?’2\n(a)\n\nA public statement which Ms KKL had issued in June 2017,\n\nstating that she did not prepare the Last Will?™;\n(b)\n\nHer email to the Respondent on 17 December 2013, asking if\n\nMr Lee had signed a new will (see paragraph 404 above), and\n()\n\nMsWLH's email on 3 January 2014 (see paragraph 72 above),\nregarding the Codicil.\n\n425.Ms KKL responded to inform the Law Society’s lawyers that the\n\nExecutors had objected to her participation in any discussion with\n\nthem “regarding the documents referred to...and any information or\ndocuments pertaining to my engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor®™.\n426. The effect of these restrictions was to prohibit Ms KKL from giving her\naccount (to the Law Society) of what transpired, vis-a-vis the Last Will.\nShe was barred from even explaining why she had no role in the Last\nWill (see paragraph 424(a) above).\n\n271 Transcript (5 July 2019), 80:1-21, 63:2-3.\n\n272 Transcript (5 July 2019), 60:27-62:22.\n278 Ms KKL issued her statement to the media in response to a Facebook post put up by Mr LHY\n(Transcript (5 July 2019), 62:15-16; LSS Closing Submissions (20 September 2019) at para 152 and fn\n161). Mr LHY's Facebook post stated that “[fhe will was drafed by Kwa Kim Li of Lee & Lee” (sea\n\nfurther paragraphs 486 — 498 of this Decision),\n274 Transcript (5 July 2019), 60:27-61:7.\n\n132\n\n\f427.We found it difficult to see how this could be founded on a valid claim\nof privilege, particularly on Ms KKL's position that she was not\n\ninvolved in the Last Will. The Law Society said that it did not call Ms\nKKL, because of the arguments relating to privilege, and because her\nevidence on the contents of Mr Lee's First to Sixth Wills was no longer\nnecessary after the Estate’s attempts (in OS 639) to preclude the Law\nSociety's production of these Wills had failed®”s.\n428.We note that it was open to the Law Society to have issued a\n\nsubpoena to Ms KKL and tested the argument on privilege. But the\nLaw Society did not do so.\n428.The Respondent and Mr LHY also levelled serious allegations of\n\ndishonesty and misconduct against Ms KKL before us?®. They\nalleged that Ms KKL had lied, by saying that she had no involvement\ninthe Last Will, and concealed her discussions with Mr Lee, regarding\n\nthe Codicil to the Penultimate WilP77. The Respondent also disclosed\ncommunications between Mr Lee and Ms KKL, regarding the Codicil,\n\nwhich were prima facie privileged (the Estate was of course entitled\nto waive that privilege and appears to have so waived). However, the\nEstate objected to Ms KKL giving evidence on these matters based\non assertion of privilege.\n430.During cross-examination, Mr LHY said that the Law Society could\n\nhave subpoenaed Ms KKL?™, if it disagreed with the claim of privilege.\n275 Transcripts (1 July 2019), 5:28 — 6:18.\n\n278 Mr LHY also repeated this allegation against Ms KKL publicly, whilst these proceedings were\npending (see paragraph 493 of this Decision).\n\n277 Trapseript (3 July 2019), 93:6-7, 95:25-27; Transcript (4 July 2019), 94:27 — 95:8; Transcript (5 July\n2018), 30:18-20, 60:7-8.\n27 The Respondent and Mr LHY referred, a number of times, to the Law Society's eventual decision\nrot to subpoena Ms KKL as a witness.

See also Transcript (1 July 2018), 5:28 - 8:18 on why the Law Society decided not to call\n\nMs KKL as a witness.\n\n133\n\n\f431.1n her Closing Submissions, the Respondent advanced a new\nposition. Her Counsel submitted that Ms KKL's response to the Law\nSociety had only conveyed the Estate’s objection “to her participation\nin any meeting or discussion with Law Society’; the Estate did not\n\nobject to her “festifving in these proceedings\" 2. [Emphasis added.]\n432.This contradicted what Mr LHY had told this Tribunal®®:\n“Tan CM:\n\nCan | just ask, did the estate object to Kwa Kim Li\n\ntestifying before this Tribunal?\nMr LHY:\n\n{ think we were_asked whether she could testify and [\nbelieve we were concerned about privilege, | suppose,\n\ngiven how Wei Ling and | see that she's been\neconomical with the truth, she is free to testify on issues\n\nwhich don’t regard privilege but to the extent that there\nare jssues which shows privilege to_the eslate, she\n\nneeds to clear it with the estate but Kim Li has been, |\nsuppose,\n\non\n\nseveral\n\noccasions\n\nacknowledged\n\ninstructions and then didnt do and carry out those\ninstructions. ..and my sister...and | are concerned about\n\nthat.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, it is not in dispute that Ms KKL had no involvement in the events of 16\nand 17 December 2013, and never advised Mr Lee on the specific contents of the Last Will. Nor is it\nthe Respondent's case that Mr Lee had spoken with Ms KKL, beyond what the email set out. {Had that\n\nbeen the case, it would have been for the Respondent to call Ms KKL.) As such, it is for the tribunal to\n\ndraw the appropriate interferences on the issue of retainer based on the unchallenged facts and\n\nobjective evidence,\n\n272 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 99.\n200 Transcript (5 July 2019), 60:4-21. See also Transcript (3 July 2018), 92:21-23, where the\nRespondent said she was aware that the Estate had written to Ms KKL to “object to her [Ms KKL's]\nparticipation in these proceedings”.\n\n134\n\n\fTan CM:\n\nMy question is very simple. Did the estate object to Kwa\nKim Li appearing before this Tribunal?\n\nMr LHY:\n\n| can’t remember the exact answer that R&T gave but |\nthink we will have asserted privilege.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n433.1n this regard, Ms KKL's response to the Law Society was also read\nto Mr LHY, whilst he was on the stand. His response (which the\n\nRespondent cited in her Closing Submissions) was as follows?®':\n(a)\n\nMs KKL “could be subject to subpoena, she could appear here\nand she would be giving evidence”. These was nothing that\n“prevented her from appearing af this Tribunar’.\n\n(b)\n\nIf Ms KKL was subpoenaed, she was “free fo testify on any\n\nissues which are not privileged. And if there are issues which\nare privileged then, you know, they are subject to privilege.”\n\n(c)\n\n“ll)f you ask me whether the estate should assert privilege, |\nthink that's safeguarding the interests of the estate.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n434.The Respondent's statements are at odds with what Mr LHY had said.\nHis position before the Tribunal confirmed his intention to continue to\nassert privilege, in the same terms as Ms KKL had set out to the Law\n\nSociety, if she was called as a witness (see paragraphs 424 — 425\nabove). Mr LHY had even objected to Ms KKL explaining why she\nhad no role in the Last Will (see paragraph 426 above). (In June 2017,\nMs KKL had issued a public statement, denying that she had drafted\n281 Transcript (5 July 2018), 62:23 - 63:7.\n135\n\n\fdid not want\nthe Last Will.) It is clear that Mr LHY and the Respondent\nMs KKL to give any evidence on what role she played in the Last Will.\n435.Having considered the three questions at paragraph 176, we will now\nset out our conclusions on the question of Implied Retainer.\n(C) Conclusion on question of Implied Retainer\n436. The Respondent (inter alia).\n\n(C)\n\nTook instructions from Mr Lee on the Last Wil};\n\n(b)\n\nAdvised Mr Lee on the Last Will;\n\n(c)\n\nSent Mr Lee a draft of the Last Will, and assured him that: (i)\nit equalised the shares to be received by the three children,\nfrom the Estate (and was therefore in accordance with what\n\nMr Lee wanted); and (i) that it was in the same terms as the\n\nFirst Will;\n\n(d)\n\nGave instructions to colleagues in her law firm, on the\nexecution of the Last Wil\nExcluded Mr Lee's usual lawyer, Ms KKL, from the process;\n\nU]\n\nKept the original of the Last Will in her office safe, after it had\nbeen executed;\n\n(@\n\nKnew that Mr Lee had been told that she was primarily\nresponsible for drafting the Last Will; and\n\n136\n\n\f(i)\n\nSubsequently conveyed to AGC that Mr Lee had instructed\nher, on the drafting of the Last Will, a position which had also\n\nearlier been confirmed by Mr LHY, to the MC.\n437.As far as the Respondent knew:\n(a)\n\nNo one, other than she, had advised Mr Lee on the Last Will;\n\n(b)\n\nNo one showed Mr Lee a true copy of the First Will (as\nopposed to the inaccurate version that the Respondent had\nsent him);\n\n(c)\n\nNo one advised Mr Lee of the differences between the First\nWill, and the draft Last Will that the Respondent sent to him;\n\n(dy\n\nNo one advised Mr Lee on the differences between the draft\nLast Will, and the Penultimate Will; and\n\n(&)\n\nNo one advised Mr Lee that the draft Last Will was very\ndifferent from what he had agreed with Ms KKL, on how his\nPenultimate Will should be amended.\n\n438.0n these facts, it is clear, beyond reasonable doubt, that the\n\nRespondent acted as Mr Lee’s fawyer on the Last Will. There was an\nImplied Retainer.\n\n(D) The positions that the parties had taken previously, in respect\nof some of the guestions that arose before us\n\n439.For completeness, we should also deal with one additional maitter.\nThis is in respect of what was said to the MC, to AGC, and to the\n\npublic, in relation to the Respondent’s involvement in the Last Will.\n\n137\n\n\f440.These issues were raised in both parties’ pleadings, and were\ncovered in some detail when the Respondent and Mr LHY took the\nstand. Substantial submissions were also made to us on these points\nby both parties. While they do not affect our conclusions, they relate\n\nto positions taken by the Respondent and Mr LHY, at an earlier point\nin time, on some of the key issues before us. In particular, they relate\n\nto the Respondent's role in the Last Will. We will therefore set out our\nviews on these points.\n\n(1) The MC\n441.The MC raised a number of questions to the Executors concerning\n\nthe preparation of the Last Will*®2, In a letter from the MC to the\nExecutors on 25 April 201728, the MC raised, inter alia, the following\nqueries:\n(a)\n\nWhether a lawyer advised Mr Lee on the Last Will and, if so,\nwho this lawyer was;\n\n(b)\n\nThe nature of the Respondent's involvement in the preparation\nof the Last Will; and\n\n(c)\n\nFor a copy of the contemporaneous attendance notes for the\nexecution of the Last Will, which the Executors had referred to\n\nin their earlier letter of 28 Feb 2017 (see also paragraph 185(c)\nabove).\n\n22 MC repcﬁ on 38 Oxley Road (2 April 2018), Annex C, at para 9 (hiips://www.pmo.qov.sg/fmedia/PMO/Newsroom/Files/Media-Release/MC Report 38 Oxley Road Annex C.pdf).\n283 | S5 BOD, Vol 1, p 443 - 446 at paras 8 — 8, Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n\n138\n\n\fThe MC sent this letter, as a follow up, in response to certain points\nthat had been made by the Executors to the MC%4.\n442.The MC's letter also invited the Respondent to set out her position on\nthe questions raised.\n\n443.The Executors initially responded to indicate that they would be\ntravelling, and that the earliest they would be able to reply (if at all)\nwas end June?®, However, on 14 June 2017, two weeks before the\nend-June deadline, they released a public statement, taking issue\nwith the MC and its work. They also wrote to the MC later that day,\n\ninforming the MC that they had decided to “disengage™®.\n444 As such, the questions raised in the MC'’s letter of 25 April 2017 were\nnever answered. The Respondent also did not respond to the\n\nCommittee directly to set out her position.\n445 1n the present proceedings, the Law Society pleaded in its Statement\nof Case that “the Respondent was invited to set out her\nposition...There was no response from the Respondent to the\n\nCommittee’s invitation?’.\n446.The Respondent denied this assertion in her Defence. She pleaded\nthat “ftJhe Ministerial Committee had never written to the Respondent\n\nfor any clarification’?®®. She also took a similar position in her Affidavit,\nand suggesfed that she had never been involved in the MC work,\n254 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 408, Letter from Mr LHY and Dr LWL to the MC dated 28 February 2017.\n285 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 479 at para 11, Letter from Mr LHY and Dr LWL to Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\nfor National Development, dated 12 May 2017.\n2% | $S BOD, Vol 1, p 506 at para 6, Letter from Mr LHY and Dr LWL to Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\nfor National Development, dated 14 June 2017.\n\n287 Statement of Case at para 34.\n28 Defence at para 56.\n\n139\n\n\feither directly, or through Mr LHY and Dr LWL.

They were also contradicted by her testimony\non the stand.\n(a) Did the MC seek the Respondent’s views?\n\n448.The Respondent’s assertion that the MC “never wrote” to her “fo seek\n[her] views or responses”, conveys the untrue impression that the MC\nhad not sought the Respondent’s views.\n449.The language of the MC’s letter to the Executors on 25 April 2017\nwas as follows:\n\n“In view of the questions which have been raised regarding Mrs [Lee\nSuet Fern’s] involvement in the Last Will, the Committee would like\nto invite her to set out her position. and would also ask if she is\n\nprepared to do so by way of a statutory declaration’®.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n289 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 35.\n\n250 Mr LHY took a similar position during cross-examination: see Transcript (4 July 2018), 105:27-31;\n106:22-26; 113:18 — 114:4.\nfor National Development,\n291 | §8 BOD, Vol 1, p 452 at para 7, Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\nto Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n\n140\n\n\f450.During cross-examination, the Respondent admitted that she was\nindeed told, around the time of the letter, that the MC had sought her\n\nviews??

Her positions shifted repeatedly, and were not credible.\n453, Initially, the Respondent refused to admit that she had even seen the\n\nMC’s letter of 25 April 20172%, After Counsel for the Law Society\npointed her to the Committee’s express invitation “fo set out her\nposition” (see paragraph 449 above), she admitted that she was told\nabout this request.\n\n2% Transcript (4 July 2019), 28:26-31, 30:16-22.\n203 { S BOD, Vol 1, p 788, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 19 November 2018,\n294 | §S BOD, Vol 1, p 795 at para 2, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 3 December 2018.\n\n2% Transcript (4 July 2018), 26:19 — 27:12,\n\n141\n\n\f454.The Respondent also claimed that “a suggested response was also\n\nconveyed'?®. [Emphasis added.] When asked about the particulars\nof this “suggested response”, and how it was “conveyed”, the\n\nRespondent changed her position, and said that the “response” was\n\n“gssentially not to respond’?’ (see excerpt from the transcript at\nAnnex D).\n\n455.1n other words, it was not a case of the MC not having sought the\nRespondent’s views. Rather, it was the Respondent who decided not\nto answer the MC's questions.\n456. The Respondent gave a number of reasons why she did not respond\nto the MC:\n\n(a)\n\nThe MC's request was voluntary?®®.\n\n(b)\n\nThe MC did not write to her personally.

These reasons contradict each other. If the Respondent believed that\nthe MC was a “witch hunt\", as she claimed, why would she consider\nresponding, even if the MC wrote to her personally? In addition, the\nMC had raised serious questions about the propriety of the\nRespondent’s involvement in the Last Wil (see paragraph 441\nabove). Even if a reply was \"voluntary”, as a senior lawyer with more\nthan 30 years’' experience, why would the Respondent leave these\nserious allegations unanswered as a matter of record, if they were\n\nindeed untrue, and without merit?\n458.There are inherent difficulties with the Respondent’s evidence. Our\nconclusion is that she had not wanted to answer the MC's questions,\nabout her role in the Last Will.\n\n{b) Did Mr LHY and Dr LWL seek views from the Respondent on\ntheir representations to the MC?\n459.The\n\ncontemporaneous\n\ncorrespondence\n\nalso\n\nshows\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nRespondent’s assertion, that Mr LHY and Dr LWL \"did not seek any\ninput® from her on their representations to the MC, is also unirue.\n\n460.0n 16 December 2016%%2, the MC wrote to Mr LHY and Dr LWL,\nattaching a summary of Mr LHL's responses to them.

These emails were\namongst the BL Documents, which the Respondent did not produce\n(see paragraphs 182 - 193 above).

This is inconsistent with the chronology of\nevents apparent from the BL Documents, and the Respondent’s own\ntestimony, on cross-examination (see paragraph 465 above).\n471.1t is clear that both their evidence was largely untrue, and an attempt\nto: (a) distance the Respondent from the version of events that Mr\nLHY had put forward to the MC (see paragraphs 224 - 225 above),\n\nand (b) justify her not responding to the MC’s questions (see\nparagraphs 441 - 444 above).

As such,\nAGC asked her to confirm that she would respond substantively to\ntheir questions by 14 December 2018 (the date which the\nRespondent had requested)®®. The Respondent was asked to\nprovide her confirmation by 30 November 2018.\n481. On 3 December 2018, three days after the 30 November deadline,\nthe Respondent wrote to AGC, questioning the basis for AGC's\n\ndecision to review her involvement in preparing the Last Will*'°, She\ncontended that the evidence cited by AGC “does not show any prima\nfacie case at all’.

AGC\nreiterated that they had been prepared to agree to the Respondent’'s\nrequest for an extension of time, had she required the time to respond\n\nto their queries. However, given the Respondent's refusal to provide\nthe confirmation sought, AGC would proceed accordingly®®. AGC\nreferred the matter to the Law Society that same day.\n483.Given the above facts, it is untrue for the Respondent to have said\nthat AGC proceeded, despite her indicating “repeatediy” that she\nwould provide a substantive response.\n484.The Respondent’s statement that she intended to substantively\nrespond (see paragraphs 474 - 476 above), was contradicted by her\ntestimony on the stand. During cross-examination, she admitted that\n\nshe “hadn’t decided at that time”, whether or not to respond to AGC’s\nqueries, and had simply been “asking for more time to think about\nI'f7321.\n\n485.In our view, the Respondent’s claims in her Defence and Affidavit are\nuntrue.\n\n(3)\n\nPublic Statements\n\n486.In her Defence, the Respondent suggested that she need not have\nresponded to these queries about her involvement, because her\n\nhusband, Mr LHY, had already “made public statements as early as\n320 | §§ BOD, Vo! 1, p 797 at para 2 — 4, Letter from the AGC to the Respondent dated 4 Dec 2018.\n321 Transeript (3 July 2019), 11:5-22, 12:20-27, 13:1-14.\n\n149\n\n\fJune 2017 to the effect that the Respondent had not drafted fthe Last\n\nWill] and was not Mr Lee’s lawyer™?2.\n487 .MrLHY's Facebook posts were largely concentrated over two periods.\nFirst, in June and July 2017 (see also paragraph 493 above), and\nsecond, in April 2019, around the time that the Respondent filed her\n\nDefence in these proceedings.\n488.These posts gave the impression that Ms KKL had prepared the Last\n\nWilt for Mr Lee, and that the Respondent had played no role in it.\n489. None of these posts mentioned the Respondent's involvement in the\nLast Will. There was no reference, inter alia, to the Respondent\nhaving sent Mr Lee the draft Last Will, of her role in briefing Mr BL, of\n\nher retaining the original of the executed Last Will, of Ms KKL being\noverseas, or of Ms KKL having been excluded from the preparation\nof the Last Will.\n490.

He said that Ms KKL had drafted the Last Will;\nand that the Respondent had not drafted it; and he said that Ms KKL\n\nwas lying. When he said this, he knew that Ms KKL had not drafted\nthe Last Will, and it was the Respondent who had prepared it (see\nparagraphs 324 — 328 above).\n\n494. The letters which Mr LHY and Dr LWL wrote to the MC®', (which\nwere also in evidence before us), referred to how Mr Lee read the\nLast Will carefully, and was lucid. Again, nothing was said about Mr\nLee having asked who drafted the Last Will, or the answers that he\nwas given. Thus, to the MC and to the public, Mr LHY made selective\nreference to the documents, which were misleading.\n\n495.The MC made a request®® for the EK Attendance Note, after the\nExecutors referred to the EK Attendance Note in their\ncorrespondence with the MC. This request was not acceded to.\nDuring cross-examination, Mr LHY said that the EK Attendance Note\nwas not “refevant’ to the MC's work.%* This was surprising, since he\nhad drawn the MC's attention to the EK Attendance Note to begin\nwith, referring to parts which he wanted to refer to.\n\n496. Mr LHY's explanations for the untruths in his posts were not credible.\nHe gave the same reason that he had cited in the context of his\n\ncorrespondence with the MC (see paragraph 232 - 233 above) —\nnamely, that he had not written these posts “with the level of care\n\nwhich a legal affidavit requires™3.

We will now deal with the question of whether\nthe Respondent was in breach of her professional duties.\nIX.\n\nBreach of Duties / Misconduct\n\n498. We will consider the Charges against the Respondent in the following\norder:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the primary and alternative first Charges (Charges 1 and\n1A), which charge the Respondent with breaches of Ru[_e 25\nof the PCR, amounting to grossly improper, or alternatively\nimproper, conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n(b)\n\nSecond,\n\nthe\n\nprimary and\n\nalternative\n\nsecond\n\nCharges\n\n(Charges 2 and 2A), which charge the Respondent with\n\nbreaches of Rule 46 of the PCR, amounting to grossly\nimproper, or alternatively improper, conduct under section\n83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n(c)\n\nFinally, the further alternative first and second Charges\n(Charges 1B and 2B), which charge the Respondent with\nmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor, under\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\nAs mentioned above (see paragraph 7 above), the further\n\nalternative Charges®® are based on the same conduct, but\npremised on section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, (‘misconduct\n3% Statement of Case at paras 47 (further alternative first Charge) and 50 (further altemative second\nCharge).\n153\n\n\funbefitting an advocate and solicitor”), and do not require\n\nproof of a retainer between the Respondent and Mr Lee.\n499. Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR respectively state as follows:\n“Conflict of Interest\n25\n\nDuring the course of a retainer, an advocate and solicitor shall\n\nadvance the client’s interest unaffected by —\n(a)\n\nany interest of the advocate and soficifor;\n\n(b)\n\nany interest of any other person; or\n\nGift by will or inter vivos from client\n\n46.\n\nWhere a client intends to make a significant gift by will or inter\n\nvivos, or in any other manner, to —\n\n(d)\n\nany member of the family of the advocate and solicitor;\n\nthe advocate and solicitor shall not act for the client and shall\nadvise the client to be independently advised in respect of the\ngitt”\n\n500.For the reasons set out below, we find that the primary first and\nsecond Charges against the Respondent (Charges 1 and 2) have\nbeen made out beyond a reasonable doubt. We also find that the\nalternative, and/or further alternative first and second Charges\n\n154\n\n\f(Charges 1A and 2A and/or 1B and 2B) are also made out beyond\nreasonable doubt.\n(A) Preliminary point\n\n501.Before tumning to consider each of these groups of Charges, we first\ndeal with a preliminary issue that the Respondent raised, in respect\nof all the Charges.\n\n502.The Respondent submitted in her Closing Submissions, that all the\nCharges should fail, because there was no “conflict of interest’. She\ncited two reasons:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, she was unaware of the circumstances giving rise to the\nconflict, because she did not know that the Last Will increased\nMr LHY’s share (from the Penultimate Will)*®; and\n\n(b)\n\nSecond, Mr Lee was fully aware of, and had accepted the\n\nRespondent’s involvement, in the Last Will*,\n503.We will deal with each of these points in turn.\n\n(1) Was the Respondent aware of the conflict of interest?\n504.The Respondent contended that a conflict of interest could only arise\nif: () the Last Will conferred a further advantage on Mr LHY (beyond\nwhat Mr Lee had bequeathed to Mr LHY previously under the\nPenultimate Will), and {b) she, as the putative fiduciary, knew that the\nLast Will had this effect.\n\n3% Respandent’s Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 185.\n337 Respondent’s Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 206.\n\n155\n\n\f505.The Respondent said that the latter requirement was not met.\nSpecifically, she said that at the material time:\n\n(a)\n\nShe was not aware that the Last Will increased Mr LHY's\nshare, in Mr Lee’s estate; and\n\n()}\n\nInstead, she thought that the Last Will reduced Mr LHY's\nshare, in Mr Lee’s estate.\n\n506.As such, she said that no conflict of interest arose on the facts.\n507.We are unable to agree with this. There was a clear conflict of interest,\nregardless of whether the Respondent knew that the Last Will\nincreased, decreased, or maintained, Mr LHY’s share. (As to whether\n\nthe Respondent knew about the Penultimate Will, see paragraphs\n513 - 515 below).\n508.Mr Lee's Last Will gave a significant (one-third) share of the Estate to\nthe Respondent's husband, Mr LHY. The Respondent put herself in\na position of conflict, by assuming the role of Mr Lee’s lawyer, in\nrespect of this substantial gift to her husband. As Mr Lee's lawyer, the\nRespondent owed him a duty of singular loyalty; she was required fo ’\nput Mr Lee’s interests, above those of anyone else. Her concurrent\npersonal interests, as Mr LHY's wife, were in conflict with that duty.\n\n509. The Court of Three Judges has said in Tan Phuay Khiang®®:\n“It is established law that an advocate and solicitor owes a duty of\nunflinching loyalty to his client... This obligation is derived from the\nfiduciary nature of the solicitor-client refationship, which requires a\n\nsolicitor to place his client's interests above those of his own as\nwell as those of third parties. In fact, the obligations of a fiduciary\n33 |aw Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang [2007] 3 SLR (R) 477 at [62].\n\n156\n\n\fgo beyond the avoidance of actual conflicts of interest, and extend\nto proscribe perceived or ostensible conflicts as well. While\n\nonerous in its requirements, the duty of unflinching loyalty is an\nessential cornerstone of the salicitor-client relationship as it\nensures that a client may confidently expect to receive impartial\nand frank advice and in turn repose complete trust in a solicitor to\nsafeguard his interests.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n510.1Instead of avoiding the conflict, the Respondent actively precipitated\nits occurrence. Mr LHY cut out Mr Lee's usual lawyer, Ms KKL, and\n\nthe Respondent then assumed Ms KKL's role, in making all the\narrangements regarding the Last Will (see Section VIII(B)(2) above).\n\n511.This conflict was aggravated by Mr LHY’s close involvement in the\npreparation and execution of the Last Will. He acted together with the\nRespondent, to ensure that the Last Will was executed urgently,\novernight, within a matter of 16 hours, from the time the draft Last Will\n\nwas sent to Mr Lee by the Respondent®®. Together, they rushed the\nexecution of the Last Will through. Mr Lee was not advised on any of\nthe implications of the Last Will (see paragraphs 353 — 354 and 437\nabove).\n\n512.We will also address the underlying question which arose from the\nRespondent's submission: Did the Respondent and Mr LHY know\nabout the Penuitimate Will, when the Last Will was signed?\n\n513.The Respondent and Mr LHY's position was that they only learnt that\nMr Lee had given Dr LWL an extra share, in the Penultimate Will,\n\nafter he passed away.\n\n’\n\n33 See paragraph 607 of this Decision.\n\n157\n\n\f514.The Law Society challenged this position, and argued that the\nRespondent and Mr LHY had actually been aware of the contents of\nMr Lee’'s Penultimate Will, and knew, inter alia, that the Last Will\n\nwould give Mr LHY a farger share®°. Counsel for the Law Society\n\nreferred us to a number of documents, which suggest that by 16\nDecember 2013, the Respondent and Mr LHY knew about the\nPenultimate Wiil:\n\n()\n\nMs KKL's correspondence with Mr Lee’s children suggests\nthat Mr Lee had spoken to them, about his intention to divide\nhis Estate unequally, through the Penultimate Will.\n\nIn an email from Ms KKL to Dr LWL on 3 June 2015*', Ms\nto divide\nKKL told Dr LWL that each time Mr Lee instructed het\nthe estate unequally, Mr Lee said that he would “talk fo the\n\nchildren”. Ms KKL said that she recalled Dr LWL telling her\nthat Mr Lee had spoken to her (Dr LWL).\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nIn a note from Ms KKL to Mr LHL, Dr LWL and Mr LHY on 4\n\nJune 201532 Ms KKL said that Mr Lee had asked her to\nprepare the Third and Penultimate Wills which divided the\nEstate unequally, and told her that ‘he would talk fo the\nchildren to inform them why he wanted fo divide the Estate\n\nunequally'.\n[Emphasis added.]\n340 Transcript (4 July 2019), 67:18-28; LSS Skeletal Submissions (5 October 2019} at para 43.\n341 RBOD, p 51, email from Ms KKL to Dr LWL dated 3 June 2015, 8.39am.\n342 | S5 BOD, Vol 1, p 257, note from Ms KKL to Mr LHL, Dr LWL and Mr LHY dated 4 June 2015.\n\n158\n\n\f(b)\n\nMr BL's Affidavit also said that the Respondent had told him,\non 16 December 2013, that the Last Will was “going back fo\n\n[Mr Lee’s] previous will with the Demolition Clause™*. This\nshows that the Respondent knew that the Penultimate Will\nhad removed the Demolition Clause, and the significance of\n\nthe Last Will in reinstating it. The Respondent’s Counsel\nchallenged this aspect of Mr BL's account in crossexamination.\n(c)\n\nIn an email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching on 28 July 2014, Dr\nLWL shared her view about what transpired on the evening of\n\n16 December 2013.

It is undisputed that Mr Lee never mentioned reinstating the\nDemolition Clause in any of his discussions with the Respondent and/or Mr LHY (see paragraph 538 of\nthis Decision).\n3441 88 BOD, Vol 1, p 238, Emalil from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching dated 28 July 2014 at 11.08am.\n\n159\n\n\f(iv)\n\n“/fitis Pa’s decision, | am ok with it. But| hv a sense that\nYang played me out...] was very upset that Yang did it\nto me.\"\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n(Dr LWL has subsequently changed her position)*®.\n\n515.There are facts which seem to suggest that the Respondent, and Mr\nLHY, knew about the contents of the Penultimate Will, including the\nfact that Mr LHY would get a smaller share under the Penultimate\nWill, as compared with the Last Will. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has\ndecided to refrain from making a finding on this issue, because while\nthe evidence is suggestive (that the Respondent and Mr LHY knew\nthe above about the Penultimate Will), it is nevertheless not\nconclusive.\n\n(2) Did Mr Lee waive the conflict of interest?\n516.The Respondent also said that there was no conflict, because Mr Lee\nwas fully aware that the Respondent was Mr LHY's wife, and had\n\nnevertheless accepted the Respondent's involvement in the Last Will.\n517.In our view, this argument is based on a misapprehension of Rules\n25 and 46 of the PCR. The alleged breaches under Rules 25 and 46\nof the PCR do not stem from the Respondent's failure to disclose her\npotential conflict of interest, as Mr LHY's wife. That is the subject of\na different rule, Rule 26 of the PCR, which provides:\n“Disclosure of Interest\n\n345 RBOD, p 53, Facebook post by Dr LWL dated 15 June 2017, 9.16am.\n160\n\n\f26.\n\nIn any case where the advocate and solicifor or any member\n\nof his family... has an interest in any matter entrusted to him by a\nclient, the advocate and solicifor shall (a)\n\nmake a full and frank disclosure of such interest to the client;\n\nor\n(b)\n\nIif, on the grounds of confidentiality or for any other reason, the\nadvocate and solicitor is unable to make such disclosure,\n\ndecline to represent or withdraw from representing that client.”\n518.Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR stipulate additional duties that a solicitor\nmust comply with, over and above the duty of disclosure mentioned\nin Rule 26 of the PCR. In situations where the Rules 25 and 48 of the\nPCR apply, the solicitor cannot argue that the client was aware of the\nconflict of interest.\n\n'\n\n519.Rule 46 of the PCR is clear: It states that a solicitor: (1) cannot act in\n\nrespect of a gift that his client intends to make to him, or his family\nmembers; and (2) must advise his client to get independent advice in\nrespect of the gift.\n520.This is confirmed in case law, which explains that the foundation of\nRule 46 of the PCR is based on a solicitor's presumed influence over\n\nhis client. See Law Societly of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James\n[2013] 3 SLR 221 (\"James Wan®) at [9]:\n“When a client intends to make a gift to an advocate and solicitor,\n\nthere is an ethical duty on him to remove, as far as he can. any\nvestiges of influence (or the appearance thereof) he might have over\n\nhis client by virtue of their relationship. In the words of Dixon J in the\nHigh Court of Australia in Johnson v Buitress (1936) 56 CLR 113 at\n135:\n\n161\n\n\f“...when [a solicitor] takes [from his client] a substantial gift of\nproperty, it is incumbent upon him to show that it cannot be\n\nascribed to the inequality between them which must arise from\nhis special position...\nThe removal of any vestiges of influence is, in essence, what r 46 of\nthe Rules mandates...When an advocate and solicitor fails to comply\nwith r 46 of the Rules, disciplinary action is taken against him because\nhe is taken to have misused his influence over his client, and thus to\nhave put himself in a position where his personal interests conflict\nwith his duty to act in the interests of his client.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n521. In such cases, a client's purported waiver is irrelevant, precisely\nbecause of the influence that a solicitor is presumed to exercise, over\nhis client. The solicitor can only remove these vestiges of influence,\n\nby complying with both aspects of Rule 46 of the PCR.\n\n522.In our view, the correct position is that set out in the Law Society’s\nGuidance Note (see paragraph 575 below) — the prohibition in Rule\n46 of the PCR against acting in respect of the gift is an absolute\nprohibition.\n\n523.The obligations under Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR clearly applied to\nthe Respondent, and the facts before us.\n\n(8 The Primary and Alternative First Charges — Rule 25, PCR\n524.The key elements of the primary and alternative first Charges34\n(Charges 1 and 1A} are as follows —\n3 Statement of Case at paras 45 (primary first Charge) and 46 (alternative first Charge).\n162\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Respondent prepared and arranged for the execution of\n\nthe Last Will, for her client, Mr Lee®7;\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule 25(b) of the\nPCR because she failed to advance Mr Lee's interests,\n\nunaffected by her own, and/or Mr LHY's interests®?;\n(c)\n\nIn doing the above, the Respondent’s conduct amounted to\ngrossly improper conduct, (or improper conduct/practice),\n\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA%®.\n525.For the reasons set out above (see Section VIII(C) above), we find\n\nthat the first of these elements is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\nOur findings on the second element are set out below. As regards the\nthird element, as both the primary and alternative first and second\nCharges require determination of this issue®®, we will consider them\ntogether, at paragraphs 581 - 592 below.\n\n7 Statemnent of Case at para 45 and 46 — primary and alternative first Charges: \"That you, Mrs Lee\nSust Fern... during the course of your retainer for your client, Mr Lee Kuan Yew...preparfed] and\n\narrangfed] for the execution of your client’s will where a one-third share in your client's estate was {o be\ngiven to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang'.

[Emphasis added.]\n\n163\n\n\f(1)Did the Respondent compromise Mr Lee’s interests?\n\n526.Rule 25 of the PCR encapsulates a lawyer's paramount duty of |oyalty\nto his client. As the Court of Three Judges stated in Law Society of\nSingapore v Uthayasurian Sidambaram [2009] 4 SLR(R) 674 at [53]:\n“Most importantly, a solicitor must remember that his\nparamount duty is to conscientiously, unwaveringly and\nfaithfully advance the interests of his clients and avoid ali actual\nand/or potential conflict of interests.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n527.As Mr Lee's lawyer, the Respondent owed him a duty of singular\nloyalty. As a fiduciary, she was required to place Mr Lee’s interests\nabove anyone else’s — be it her own interests, or those of third parties\n(including Mr LHY).\n528.The specific duties which a solicitor owes his/her client, when\n\npreparing a will are wefl-established. These were set out by the Court\nin Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR(R} 1079 (“Low Ah\nCheow”) , as follows (see [72] - [74]):\n(8\n\nThe preparation of a will involves serious professional\nresponsibilities, which solicitors must uncompromisingly\nobserve and discharge. It is wrong to regard the preparation\n\nof a will as “no more than a routine exercise in form filling’\".\n(b)\n\nA will is one of the most important legal documents which an\nindividual can execute. There ought to be no room for even\nthe slightest doubt (or the slightest possibility of a mistake) on\nthe part of a solicitor in both understanding the testator's\n\n164\n\n\fintention and expressing that intention in the will to be drawn\nup.\n(i)\n\nUnderstanding the testator’s intention and wishes —\nBefore preparing a will, the solicitor ought to have a\nthorough discussion with the testator on all the possible\n\nlegal issues and potential complications that might arise\nin the implementation of the terms of the will. The\nsolicitor ought to painstakingly and accurately document\nhis discussions with and his instructions from the testator.\n\n(i)\n\nEnsuring the will accurately expresses the testator's\nwishes\n—\nThe solicitor should also confirm with the testator, prior\nto the execution of the will, that the contents of the will\n\nas drafted accurately express the testator's intention.\nHalf measures or the cutting of corners in the discharge\n\nof these serious professional responsibilities will not do.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n529. The Court of Appeal also said in Low Ah Cheow™s\":\n“[Tlhe solicitor concerned [in the preparation of a will] should\n\nalso conscientiously seek to avoid being in any situation\nwhere a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist.\n\n31 Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 at [74].\n\n185\n\n\fIn particular, exceptional restraint and care are called for if the\nsolicitor concerned has a pre-existing relationship and/or past\na will, and all the more\ndealings with the sole beneficiary under\n\nso_if the will has been prepared urgently and executed in\nunusual circumstances with that scle beneficiary’s active\ninvolvement. When such a case occurs, the solicitor involved\n\nmust be prepared to have his conduct microscopically\nscrutinised _and.\n\nperhaps, even his motives called into\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n530.Similarly in Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping\n.Chian Alexander) [2010] 4 SLR 373 (“Muriel Chee”), the Court of\nAppeal said at [60] that “[ijn every case, the solicitor should be\ncautious about taking instructions from any person who is to be\nnamed as a beneficiary in the will”.\n531. The evidence shows that the Respondent acted quite contrary to the\nduties set out above. She abused her position to further Mr LHY’s\n\nwishes that the Last Will be executed hurriedly (see paragraphs 30 —\n52 and 346 - 365 above). The Respondent's conduct in taking\ninstructions from Mr LHY on the arrangements relating to and arising\nfrom the execution of the Last Will is, in the Tribunal’s view, an\naggravating factor which increases the egregiousness of her conduct.\nThe Courts have stressed that solicitors should be wary of taking\ninstructions solely from a beneficiary to a will. The Respondent\ntestified that she followed Mr LHY's directions as she was an\n“obedient wife\". But her statement, that she was an “obedient wife”\n\nshows her mindset on 16 and 17 December 2013: that she focused\nprimarily on what her husband wanted done, though her duties were\n\nowed to Mr Lee. She worked together with Mr' LHY, with a singular\npurpose, of getting Mr Lee to execute the Last Will quickly. The\n\n166\n\n\ffollowing\n\nis an excerpt from the cross-examination\n\nof the\n\nRespondent®?:\n“Tan CM:\n\nThe first communication you had with Bernard Lui\nwas at eight---before 8.11. Correct?\n\nRespondent.\n\nIt was probably soon after my 7.08 email.\n\nTan CM:\n\nSoon after your 7.08 email, you communicated with\nBernard?\n\nRespondent:\n\nThe sequence of events, Sirs, is that | sent that\n\nemail out, I think, probably as | was leaving the\noffice on my Blackberry. Yang called me-—| think |\nwas in the car, and he scolded me for taking so fong\n\nto deal with it. Simply put, | was busy and\nprecceupied and | forgot, and he then asked me if\n| could have somebody on standby because Papa\nwas anxious, and we identified Bemard, and he\n\nasked me to (indistinct) Bernard up. He would talk\nto Bernard directly and he would arrange for\nBernard to have the will, and then he also asked\nme to let Lin Hoe know that Bernard was available\nfor the execution. He asked me to do that because\n\nI knew Bernard’s number straightaway at hand.\nWhen I got back home and reached home at 8.12,\n| proceeded to emall Lin Hoe to get it out of the way.\nYang was---must have been in the airport lounge\ncalling and dealing with\nit. | hadn’t yet completed\nmy packing.\n\n352 Transcript (3 July 2019), 40:4-27.\n\n167\n\n\fTan CM:\n\nMrs Lee, you told us that you communicated with\n\nBernard Lui soon after 7.08pm.\nRespondent:\n\nThat's right.

Chee.\na. Understanding Mr Lee's intention and wishes\n\n533.Based on our findings above, the Respondent only spoke once to Mr\nLee about the Last Will (see paragraph 225 above). Mr Lee had told\nher “to revert to his first will from 2011\". Thereatfter, aside from one\nemail from Mr Lee (see paragraph 41 above), all the other instructions\n\nwhich she received, on the Last Will, came from Mr LHY3%.\n\n253 Sge paragraph 531 of this Decision.\n\n168\n\n\f534,0n her evidence, there was no discussion between the Respondent\nand Mr Lee, about his intentions or reasons for wanting to reinstate\nthe First Will, or the wider legal implications of doing so. This fell far\nshort of the professional duties that the law imposed on her. As the\nlawyer preparing Mr Lee's Last Will, the Respondent should have had\n“a thorough discussion” with Mr Lee, “on all the possible legal issues\nand potential complications” that could arise, if he reverted to the First\n\nWill.\n535.Such thorough discussions would have to be handled with utmost\ncare. In this matter, that would entail the Respondent checking about\nprevious Wills. The Respondent should have found out about the\nPenultimate Wil (if, as she says, she did not know about it), and Mr\nLee's intentions, on what changes he had wanted to make to the\n\nPenultimate Will. Mr Lee had discussed that with Ms KKL, just a few\ndays earlier the changes he had wanted. Even if she did not know\nspecifically the terms of the Penultimate Will, she knew that Mr Lee\n\nhad made other Wills, superseding the First Will*%. It was her duty to\nhave them checked, and to see what was Mr Lee's latest valid will.\n\nShe also had a duty to advise him carefully on the differences\nbetween the First Will (which she says he wanted to revert to), and\nwhatever was his last valid Will.\n\n536.For example, Mr Lee had discussed the Demolition Clause, and the\nterms on which Dr LWL was allowed to stay in 38 Oxley, on various\n\noccasions, with Ms KKL, when preparing his earlier Wills*%, He had\nultimately landed in favour of the positions articulated in his Fifth and\nPenultimate Wills. According to Ms KKL, Mr Lee did so because he\nwanted to leave it to Mr LHL to handle the “hit and the heat”, and\n35 Transcript (3 July 2019), 81:32 - 82:1.\n3% Mr Lee never mentioned reinstating the Demolition Clause in any of his discussions with the\nRespondent andfor Mr LHY (see paragraph 538 of this Decision). On the Respondent and Mr LHY's\nevidence, Mr Lee’s instructions had been confined to going back to the First Will.\n\n169\n\n\fremoved the Demolition Clause, altogether, from his Fifth and\n\nPenultimate Wills338,\n537.There were also two versions of the Demolition Clause (see\nparagraph 19(b) above and Annex A). In the first version (from Mr\nLee's First Will), demolition of 38 Oxley was subject to Dr LWL's right\nto stay there. This was the version in the draft that the Respondent\nsent to Mr Lee. However, this version of the Demclition Clause had\n\nbeen superseded by a second version (from Mr Lee’s Second Will).\nThis later version of the Demolition Clause was also used in Mr Lee's\n\nThird and Fourth Will. In the Fifth and Sixth (or Penultimate) Wills, the\nDemolition Clause was removed completely. Thus, the Respondent\nshould have checked with Mr Lee: did he want the Demolition Clause\nreinserted, when he had removed them from his immediately\npreceding two Wills?\n538.The Respondent did not do this. She did not tell Mr Lee that the\nDemolition Clause (which had been removed in the Penultimate Will)\nhad been reinserted in the draft Last Will that she sent to Mr Lee. The\n\nRespondent’s testimony®’ was as follows:\n“Advocate:\n\n...[S]o on 16th December 2013, you never had a chance\nto speak to or advise Mr Lee Kuan Yew, right, about this\n\ndecision to include any demolition clause in the final will\nRespondent:\n\n[ think Papa was his own best lawyer. He knew what he\nwanted.\n\nAdvocate:\n\nOkay. So there was no conversation at alf?\n\n3% | S5 BOD, Vol 1, p 257 — 259, note from Ms KKL te Mr LHL, Dr LWL and Mr LHY dated 4 June 2015.\n\n387 Transcript (4 July 2019), 98:13-18.\n\n170\n\n\fRespondent:\n\nThere was no conversation at all.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n538.Mr Lee had also removed Dr LWL's right to stay at 38 Oxley\naltogether in his Second, Third and Fourth Wills, before deciding to\nconfer her with only a conditional right in his Fifth and Penultimate\n\nWills.\n540.The question of Dr LWL's rights (if any) to stay at 38 Oxley was an\nissue on which Mr Lee seems to have focussed considerable thought\n\nand attention in deciding on his Wills®%®. Apart from Mr Lee’s First Wili,\nnone of his five subsequent wills give Dr LWL an unfettered right to\nstay at 38 Oxley, the Second, Third, and Fourth Wills did not give Dr\nLWL any right to stay at 38 Oxley, whilst the Fifth and Penuitimate\nWills subjected this right to Mr LHL's consent.\n\n541.Mr Lee had also emphasised to Ms KKL the importance of requiring\nMr LHL's consent in this respect. When Mr Lee reinstated Dr LWL's\nright to stay at 38 Oxley in the Fifth Wili, he instructed Ms KKL, more\nthan once, to ensure that this should be made subject to Mr LHL's\n\nconsent®*®,\n542, The Penultimate Will also contained a gift-over clause (as did all Mr\n\nLee’s wills, apart from the Last Will {see paragraph 21 above))®®.\n543.The Last Will departed from the considered positions that Mr Lee had\nsettied on with Ms KKL on the changes to be made to his Penultimate\n358 RBOD, p 51, email from Ms KKL to Dr LWL dated 3 June 2015, 8.39am; LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 257 at\npara 1, note from Ms KKL 1o Mr LML, Dr LWL, Mr LHY dated 4 June 2015.\n359 | 88 BOD, Vol 1, p 145, email from Mr Lee to Ms KKL dated 1 Oct 2012, 4.12pm; LSS BOD, Vol 1,\np 144, email from Mr Lee fo Ms KKL dated 1 Oct 2012, 11.32pm.\n\n360 | 58 BOD, Vol 1, p 289, Penultimate Will executed by Mr Lee dated 2 November 201‘2,\n\n171\n\n\fWill. As Mr Lee’s lawyer, the Respondent owed him a duty to find out\nwhat Mr Lee's true wishes were, take him through the Penultimate\nWill, and remind him of his discussions with Ms KKL a few days\nearlier. It was only with the benefit of such a discussion that Mr Lee\n(and the Respondent) could have been certain that the best (or even\nan accurate) way of giving effect to his wishes was to rescind the\nPenultimate Will, and reinstate the First Will (with all its attendant\nchanges).\n544.The Respondent made no effort to ascertain, discuss, or draw Mr\n\nLee's attention to the changes between the Penultimate Will and the\nFirst Will. She did not try to obtain a copy of the Penultimate Will from\n\nMs KKL, sither for Mr Lee’s or her own reference®!. Any solicitor who\nproceeded thus would have acted contrary to the requirements set\nout by the Court of Appeal in Low Ah Cheow (see paragraph 528\nabove). The Respondent, being in conflict, fell foul of the additional\nobservations made by the Court of Appeal in Low Ah Cheow and\nMuriel Chee (paragraphs 529 — 530 above). As the Court of Appeal\nsaid in Low Ah Cheow, the Respondent’s motives, in sending a draft\nto Mr Lee which completely superseded the Penuttimate Will and in\nrushing the execution of the Last Will, are in serious question.\n\n545.Had Mr Lee’s wish been solely to ensure an equal division of shares,\nthere were various other options he could have used, rather than\nreinstating the First Will — he could have executed a codicil to the\nPenultimate Will (which is what he had agreed with Ms KKL), or\n\nreinstated one of his other previous Wills, which similarly divided his\nEstate into equal shares.\n\npt (3 July 2019), 29:25 - 30:29.\n363 Transcript\n172\n\n\fb. Ensuring Mr Lee’s wishes were fully and accurately\nexpressed in the Last Will\n\n546.We found it established beyond reasonable doubt that the\nRespondent failed in this duty as well.\n’\n547.She did not fully ascertain what Mr Lee's wishes were (see\nparagraphs 533 - 545 above).\n548.Even if Mr Lee’s intention was to go back to the First Will, that was\nalso not done.\n\n549.She told Mr Lee that the draft Last Will that she sent fo him was the\nFirst Will, when it was not (see paragraphs 34 — 35 above). She did\nnot draw his attention to the differences between the draft Last Will\n\nand the First Will.\n550.In particular, two substantive parts of the First Will were missing from\nthe draft that the Respondent gave Mr Lee — (a) the gift-over clause,\nand (b) provision for Mr LHL to pay for the upkeep of 38 Oxley, whilst\nDr LWL occupied the property.\n\n551.0n her evidence, she simply forwarded to Mr Lee, what Mr LHY sent\nto her, assuming it to be the First Will, as Mr LHY told her, and\n\nrepresenting it to Mr Lee as such®®2. The Respondent contended that\nshe did not open the draft, before she sent it on to Mr Lee. For the\n\nreasons set out above (see paragraphs 318 — 321 above), we did not\nfind these statements credibie.\n\n552. However, had this indeed been the case (as the Respondent stated),\nit would have compounded her misconduct even further. Itis a breach\nof the most basic duties for a lawyer to have:\n362 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 16.\n173\n\n\f(a)\n\nUsed a draft will sent to her by a beneficiary, whom she was\nclosely related to; and\n\n(b)\n\nSent on the draft, from the beneficiary, to her dlient,\nrepresenting its contents to be in order, without even having\n\nopened the document to read it.\n553.As Mr Lee's lawyer, it was a serious breach of the Respondent’s\nduties to have misrepresented the Last Will as being identical to the\nFirst Will.\n\n554.The Last Will also omitted changes which Mr Lee wanted to make, It\nfailed to include the provision on the two carpets that Mr Lee had\ninstructed Ms KKL to make, just a few days earlier (see paragraphs\n28 and 29 above).The Respondent’s omission to include this in the\nLast Will underscored her failure to discuss the Last Will with Mr Lee\nand ensure that its contents reflected Mr Lee’s wishes.\n\n555.The Respondent's disregard for Mr Lee’s interests is also apparent\nfrom her conduct after sending him the draft Last Will. She made no\neffort to discuss the draft Last Will with Mr Lee, or at least confirm\n\nthat the draft Last Will accurately and comprehensively reflected his\nwishes (see paragraph 544 above). On her own evidence, she did\nnot know if Mr Lee even read the draft Last Will which she sent,\n\nbecause she did not speak with him after that®3.\n556.Al) of this was a gross breach of the Respondent's duties. As the\nCourt of Three Judges has stated in Law Socfely of Singapore v\nVardan Vasantha Lakshmi[2007] 1 SLR(R) 240 at [47]:\n\n33 Transcript (3 July 2019), 89:7-9.\n\n174\n\n\f‘[LJawyers have a duty generally (and always) to give their\nrespective clients a thorough explanation of all relevant documents\n\nset in their appropriate contexts. This is the minimum standard of\nprofessionalism which we would expect.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n557.In their testimony, the Respondent and\n\nMr LHY repeatedly\n\nemphasised that Mr Lee read through the Last Will before it was\nexecuted. They contended that the Last Will must therefore have\nreflected Mr Lee’s wishes.\n\n558.This reasoning is contradicted, by the Respondent’s own testimony.\nThe Respondent’s evidence is that even though she had worked on\n\nthe First Will in 2011, she herself would not have realised, from a\nplain reading of the draft Last Will in'2013, that it was the wrong\n\nversion®4,\n“Tan CM:\n\nWould it be fair to say that if you did open, you will know\nthat this is nof the correct draft because you were\ninvolved in a wee bit of tidying, resulting in version 3 that\nresulfed in the fast will?\n\nRespondent:\n\nNo. I wouldn't have known.\n\nTan CM:\n\nYou wouldn’t have known?\n\nRespondent:\n\n{ wouldn'f have known,\n\nTan CM:\n\nSo would it be fair to say that when Mr Lee reads\nwhatever draft of will it would be for him, he, too, would\n\n34 Transcript {3 July 2019), 74:9 - 75:8.\n\n175\n\n\fnot have known of the differences with the first will if it\nhad not been placed before him?\nRespondent:\n\n1 don’t know.

And, yes. ! don't have perfect memory\nto_remember a_document | may have go---looked at\nbriefly 2 years ago.\n\nTan CM:\n\nBy the same token, it would not be fair to expect that Mr\n\nLee would remember or would have noticed the\ndifferences between the first and the last will because it\nwas_something that he signed some 2 years and 4\nmonths ago. Would that be a fair statement?\n\nRespondent:\n\n| think that that’s probably the case, although you have\nto recognise, Papa can be a very perspicacious man and\nthat he may well have the wills with him. And | did nof,\n\nTan CM:\n\na fact, am | correct?\nYou don’t know that for\n176\n\n\fRespandent:\n\nNo, [ don't.\n\nTan CM:\n\nYes.\n\nRespondent:\n\nNeither do you.”\n[Emphasis added]\n\n559.The Respondent's comments that she would not have known the\ndifferences between the different variations of the First Will based on\nmemory alone, apply with more force to Mr Lee. By December 2013,\nMr Lee had signed five other Wills since the First Will. Mr Lee was 90\n\nyears old at the time, was very frail and had been in poor health®®. It\nis not possible to assume that Mr Lee would have identified and\nappreciated the specific changes that the Last Will made to either the\nFirst Will, or the Penultimate Will, based on memory alone, and\n\nwithout a lawyer explaining the differences and implications to him.\n560. The problems are compounded by the fact that the Respondent had\nmade false representations to Mr Lee about the contents of the Last\nWill. 1t is grossly remiss for her to have allowed Mr Lee to sign the\nLast Will, based on her false representations to him.\n561.Thus, it is no answer to say that Mr Lee read through the Last Will.\n\nHe was given a document and given false assurances about it. He\n365 See paragraphs 27 and 59 of this Decision above.\n\nSee also email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching dated 16 Dec 2013, 5.21pm, sent the day before the Last\nWill was signed — Dr LWL said that Mr Lee had “been doing very wel’ because he had “no admission\n\nto SGH for more than a month\", but that she thought that \"aging has caught up w his brain alsc”. (LSS\n\nBOD, Vol 1, p 172)\n\nDr LWL also subsequently recounted Mr Lee's health at the time, in the following terms: \"By now, Pa\nwas already v forgetful’ (see email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching dated 28 July 2014, 11.06am (LSS\n\nBOD, Vol 1, p 238)).\n\n177\n\n\ftrusted the Respondent®®, He read it, and signed it. But was he\naware that this Will was very different from what he had discussed\n\nwith Ms KKL just four days earlier’®”? Did he remember, for example,\nthat four days earlier, he had not wanted to include the Demolition\nClause? Did he, for example, remember that the Penultimate Will did\nnot have the Demolition Clause?\n\n562.The Respondent also said that Mr Lee’s interests were not adversely\naffected, because the Last Will simply effected his undisputed wish\n\nto divide the Estate equally amongst his three children®®. She also\nsaid that the only basis on which the first Charge (Charges 1, 1A, and\n1B) could be sustained was if Mr LHY \"got some advantage that he\nwas not entitled fo because of [the Respondent’s] intervention”.\n563. This submission overlooks the several ways in which the Respondent\nfailed to protect Mr Lee’s interests, set out above.\n\n564.Mr LHY's contentions in his Affidavit were also to similar effect®®. He\nreferred to the differences between the First and Last Will as being\n\n“minor discrepancies” and ‘some occasional differences in legal\nwords\". There were in fact substantive differences between the two\n\nWills (see paragraphs 34, 548 - 550 and Annex B).\n565.This was a dismissive approach. It shows, unfortunately, the\ncomplete disregard Mr LHY and the Respondent had for Mr Lee's\n\nwishes, and the Respondent’s disregard for discharging her duties\nhonestly and faithfully. The Respondent:\n\n38 Transcript (3 Jul 2019), 30:30-32.\n387 See paragraph 29 of this Decision.\n\n38 Respondent’s Skeletal Submissions for No Case to Answer (2 July 2019) at paras 54 ~ 5.\n389 Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 87 — 89.\n\n178\n\n\f(a)\n\nDid not have a proper discussion with Mr Lee to ascertain his\n\nwishes;\n(b)\n\nDid not take the required steps to herself ensure that Mr Lee’s\nwishes were properly reflected; and\n\n(c)\n\nPrimarily focussed on ensuring that her husband’s and her\ndesire to get a will executed by Mr Lee quickly — which\ncontained terms which had not been discussed with Mr Lee,\nand on which he was not advised.\n\n566.We find it established beyond reasonable doubt that the Respondent\nbreached Rule 25(a) and (b) of the PCR. The objective facts show\nthat she fell grossly short of her professional duties as Mr Lee’s\nlawyer.\n567.As a fiduciary, who was beholden to protect Mr Lee’s interests above\n\nall else, it was unacceptable for the Respondent to have abused her\nposition as Mr Lee's lawyer and prioritised her husband’s wishes.\n(C) The Primary and Alternative Second Charges: Rule 46 of the\n\nPCR\n568.The key elements of the primary and alternative second Charges\n(Charges 2 and 2A) are as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent breached Rule 46 of the PCR by:\n(i)\n\nActing in respect of a significant gift that her client, Mr\nLee, intended to give to Mr LHY, the Respondent’s\n\nhusband*’®; and/or\n370 Statement of Case at paras 48 and 49 - primary and alternative second Charges: “That you, Mrs\nLee Suet Fem... during the course of your retainer for your client, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule\n179\n\n\f(i)\n\n(b)\n\nFailed to advise Mr Lee to seek independent legal\nadvice®\"; and\n\nIn doing the above, the Respondent’s conduct amounted to\ngrossly improper conduct (or improper conduct/practice)\n\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA%2\n569.Rule 46 of the PCR expressly provides, inter afia, that “where a client\nto “any member of the family\nby\nintends to make a significant gift will’\nof the advocate and solicitor’, the advocate and solicitor “shall not act\n\nfor the client and shall advise the client to be independently advised\nin respect of the gift'. It stipulates “two distinct obligations”, which are\n“cumulative and not alternative” — a lawyer must both refuse to act for\nthe client in respect of the gift, and advise the client fo be\n\nindependently advised (see James Wan®7, at [9] and [22]).\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n570.1n this regard, we note that the charges against the Respondent\nframed both limbs of Rule 46 of the PCR conjunciively (see\nparagraph 568(a) above). For the reasons set out below, we find that\nthe Respondent breached both these limbs, as the charges set out.\nHowever, for completeness, we point out that for the reasons set out\n46...by acting in respect of a significant gift (a one-third share in your client's estate) that your client\nintended to give by will io your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang”. [Emphasis added.]\n371 Statement of Case at paras 48 and 49 - primary and alternative second Charges: “That you, Mrs\nLee Suet Fern... breached Rule 46 of the Legal Professional (Professional Conduct) Rules ...[by] failing\nto advise your client to be independently advised in respect of this significant giff'. [Emphasis added.]\n272 Gtaternent of Case at para 48 — primary second Charge: ... such act amounting fo grossly improper\n\nconduct in_the discharge of your professional duty within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act”. [Emphasis added.]\n\nStatement of Case at para 49 — altemnative second Charge: *... such act amounting to improper conduct\nor practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act\".\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n373 Law Society of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James [2013] 3 SLR 221.\n\n180\n\n\fabove (see paragraph 569 above), a breach of Rule 46 of the PCR\nwould be made out as long as either of these limbs are proved\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n(1)Acting in respect of a significant gift to Mr LHY\n\n571.For the reasons set out above (see Section Vill above), we find that\nthis limb of Rule 46 of the PCR has been established beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\n\n572.The assets which Mr Lee intended to bequeath to Mr LHY through\nthe Last Will were a \"significant gift', within the meaning of Rule 46 of\nthe PCR. This was a gift that was both significant in absolute terms,\nand also significant in proportion (one-third) of Mr Lee’s estate (see\n\nJames Wan, at [101).\n\n573.The Respondent’s decision to act for Mr Lee, despite knowing of the\nsignificant gift that her husband Mr LHY stood to receive, is in breach\nof Rule 46. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in James Wan at [20],\na \"clear instance of so acting is when the advocate and solicitor draws\n\nup an instrument by which a disposal of the client's property is\neffected, such as a will\". [Emphasis added.]\n574.The Court in James Wan has noted that in England and in New South\nWales, the equivalent provisions to Rule 46 of the PCR do not apply\nwhen the client is closely related to the solicitor. However, the Court\npoints out that Rule 46 of the PCR in Singapore does not have any\nexception. The obligations imposed by Rule 46 of the PCR apply\nregardless of any familial relationship between the solicitor and his\nclient. The Court also made reference to the Law Society's Ethics\nCommittee’s Guidance Note of 4 December 2007, where the Ethics\n\nCommittee made clear that the obligations apply even in relation to a\n\n181\n\n\fsolicitor's own parents. The Respondent was in breach of Rule 46 of\nthe PCR.\n\n575.The Guidance Note from the Law Society’s Ethics Committee (which\nwas cited by the Court in James Wan) states that™:\n“A solicitor is absolutely prohibited under rule 46 PCR from acting for\nhis parents in preparing any instrument (including a will) under which\nhe (or his family members or colleagues) would receive a significant\ngift, whether as a beneficiary of his parents’ will or estate or otherwise.\nIn light of potential issues of conflict of interest and sensitivities\ninvolved, the solicitor should avoid acting for his parents even when\nthey have_not intimated any intention to make a gift. Naturally, once\n\nsuch intention was intimated, the solicitor must adlvise his parents to\nseek independent advice concerning the gift and cannot act for them.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n(2)Failing to advise Mr Lee to get independent legal advice\n\n576.The Respondent also breached the second requirement in Rule 46\nof the PCR ~ to advise Mr Lee to seek independent advice.\n\n577.The nature of this duty has been set out by the Court of Three Judges\n\nin James Wan®%\n(a)\n\nAsolicitor's obligation to advise his client to seek independent\nadvice arises even if the intended gift is wholly unrelated to\nthe matter in which the advocate and solicitor is acting for the\n\nclient — a fortiori where he is acting for the client in respect of\nthe gift itself. The dispassionate counsel of an uninvolved\n374 |aw Society Ethics Committee, Guidance Note (4 December 2007).\n\n375 L aw Seaciety of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James [2013] 3 SLR 221 at [12][18].\n182\n\n\fparty is needed, to establish that his client's judgement has\nnot been clouded by influence, arising from their solicitor-client\nrelationship.\n\n(b)\n\nAn advocate and solicitor does nof fulfil his obligation merely\nby telling his client “You should seek independent advice\nwithout more.\n\nHe should explain to his client the reason why independent\nadvice is required, viz, to ensure that the client’s decision to\n\nmake a gift to him, (or parties close to him), is free exercise of\nindependent will, given the presumption that the decision is\ninfluenced by the solicitor-client relationship. He should\nexplain that, even if the client does not perceive any influence,\nsuch_influence may nevértheless exist. e should also\n\nemphasise, repeatedly if necessary. the importance of\nreceiving independent advice.\n\n(d)\n\nThe advocate and solicitor, should ask his client to nominate\nan independent advocate and solicitor, who can advise the\nclient on the matter (the “advising advocate and solicitor”). He\nshould then ensure that the advising advocate and solicitor,\nhas no connections or involvement, which would in any way\ncompromise independence.\n\nHe_should advise his client to obtain written confirmation from\nthe advising advocate and solicitor, to the effect that a full\nexplanation of the nature of the transaction, and its practical\nimplications, has been furnished.\nShould the client decline to seek independent advice for\n\nwhatever reason, he should insist with some force that his\nclient do so. and reiterate the importance of receiving that\n\n183\n\n\findependent advice. In_the absence of such advice, the\nadvocate and solicitor should decline to accept the gift.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n578.ltis not in dispute that the Respondent failed to do any of these things.\nShe did not advise Mr Lee to seek independent counsel. She\n\nbreached the second aspect of her duty under Rule 46 of the PCR.\n579.In fact, the Respondent did the opposite of what Rule 46 of the PCR\nrequired her to do.\n580. The Respondent acquiesced in cutting out Mr Lee from getting advice\nfrom his usual lawyer, Ms KKL.\n(D) Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA: Grossly improper conduct\n\n581, The final question is whether her conduct was “grossly improper”\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n582. The test for what amounts to “grossly improper” conduct, within the\nmeaning of section 83(2) of the LPA was also discussed by Menon\nCJin Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2019] SGHC\n92 (“Peter Ezekiel’):\n“37 The principles relating to s 83(2)(b) of the LPA can be briefly\nstated. Whether a particular conduct is “grossly improper” within\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the LPA depends on whether the\nconduct is dishonourable to the solicitor concerned as a man and\n\ndishonourable in his profession (Re Marshall David; Law Society\nof Singapore v Marshall David Saul[1971-1973] SLR(R) 5§54 at\n[23]; Law Society of Singapore v Rasif David [2008] 2 SLR(R)\n955 at [23]). It is well established that deceit is not necessary for\n\n184\n\n\fa finding of grossly improper conduct. Indeed, s 83(2)(b) of the\nLPA makes it clear that the requirement is for either\nfraudulent or grossly improper conduct to be shown (Re Han\nNgiap Juan[1993] 1SLR(R)135; Re Lim Kiap Khee, Law\nSociety of Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee[2001] 2 SLR(R)\n398 (“Lim Kiap Khee\") at [19]). Whilst simple negligence or want\nof skill would not necessarily constitute grossly improper conduet,\nit has also been noted that there are degrees of negligence, and\nthat the gravity of a negligent act must be viewed in the context\nof the matter, taking into account all the circumstances of the\ncase (Lim Kiap Khee at [19]). Grossly improper conduct will also\nbe found where a solicitor prefers his own interests to that of his\nclient (Law Society of Singapore v Khushvinder Singh\nChopra [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490 (‘Khushvinder Singh Chopra”) at\n[49]; Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R)\n\n466 (“Ng Chee Sing”) at [36]).\"\n583.1t would be “grossly improper”, for an advocate and solicitor to act in\na manner opposed to a client’s interests: Law Sociefy v Heng Guan\nHong Geoffrey [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966 (“Geoffrey Heng’) at [21].\n“Grossly improper conduct”, is also likely to arise, where a solicitor\n\nputs his interest, above his clients' interests®’s: Khushvinder Singh\nChopra at [49]; and Ng Chee Sing at [36].\n\n584.Conduct may be “grossly improper” even without any dishonesty,\nfraud or deceit. Re Han Ngiap Juan at [27] and [34]; and Law Society\nof Singapore v Wong Sin Yee [2018] 5 SLR 1281 (*Wong Sin Yee\")\nat [23].\n\n585.In Peter Ezekiel, the Court of Three Judges characterised the type of\nconflict of interest which has arisen in these proceedings as cases\nwhere ‘it would be impossible, save possibly in exceptional\ncircumstances, to avoid the conclusion that the client had operated\n378 [ aw Society v Khushvinder Singh Chopra [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490; Law Society of Singapore v Ng\nChee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466.\n185\n\n\funder the undue influence of the solicitor in ... making the substantial\ngift\".\n586.Based on these principles, we find the Respondent was guilty of\ngrossly improper conduct, beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n587. This is not a case of sheer incompetence, inadvertent negligence, or\neven reckless indifference. The Respondent, as Mr Lee’s lawyer,\ndeliberately failed to discharge the duties that she was supposed to\nperform. Her breaches are egregious.\n588. Considered in totality, the Respondent’s conduct was quite dishonest.\nMr LHY’s and her conduct, demonstrated a calculated attempt to:\n\n(a)\n\nEnsure that Mr Lee executed the Last Will as quickly as\npossible, without due regard for Mr Lee’s wishes, and\n\n(b)\n\nHide their wrongdoing in having done so.\n\n589.The Respondent and Mr LHY knew that it was important to Mr Lee fo\nhave a lawyer prepare and arrange for the execution of the Last Will.\nDespite this: (a) they cut out Mr Lee’s usual lawyer, Ms KKL, and\nreplaced her with the Respondent, who was in a serious conflict of\ninterest; and (b) instead of advising Mr Lee to seek independent\ncounsel, as she was required to, the Respondent acquiesced in Mr\nLHY’s representation to Mr Lee, that it was best to proceed without\nMs KKL; and actively ensured that the execution could proceed\nwithout Ms KKL.\n\n590.Having removed Ms KKL from the picture, the Respondent\ncompounded her wrongdoing by misleading Mr Lee on the contents\nof the Last Will. She and Mr LHY also rushed the signing of the Last\nWili by Mr Lee. It contained terms which had not been discussed with\n\n186\n\n\fMr Lee (see paragraphs 536 — 538 above). Mr Lee signed the Last\nWill under false assurances.\n591.The Respondent's conduct clearly lacked the integrity, probity and\ntrustworthiness required of an advocate and solicitor. What she did\nwas dishonourable, both to herself, as a person, and to the legal\n\nprofession. It was \"grossly improper conduct’ under section 83(2)(b)\nof the LPA.\n592.Having procured the Last Will through these improper means, she\nand Mr LHY then fabricated a series of lies and inaccuracies, to\nperpetuate the falsehood that Ms KKL had been involved in the Last\nWill, and hide their own role in getting Mr Lee to sign the Last Wil\nand their wrongdoings (see paragraphs 439 - 496 above).\n(E) The Further Alternative First & Second Charges\n593. The further alternative Charges (Charges 1B and 2B) brought under\n\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA, are also established beyond reasonable\ndoubt.\n594.Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA is broader than section 83(2)(b) of the\n\nLPA. It applies when a solicitor's conduct does not fall within any of\nthe other subsections of section 83(2) of the LPA, but is “nonetheless\n\nconsidered unacceptable”™ Wong Sin Yee, [24]; Ng Chee Sing, [40].\nUnlike “grossly improper conduct' under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA,\n“conduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor’ under section 83(2)(h)\n\nof the LPA, is not confined to misconduct in a solicitor's professional\ncapacity; it also includes misconduct in his personal capacity:\nGeoffrey Heng, at [25]; Khushvinder Singh Chopra, at [36].\n595.Menon CJ has summarised, in Peter Ezekiel at [38], the test for\nunbefitting conduct under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA as follows:\n\n187\n\n\fAs for s 83(2)(h) of the LPA, this provision is broader\n“38\nthan s 83(2)(b). The standard of unbefitting conduct will be met\nif a solicitor is shown to have been guilty of such conduct as\nwould render him unfit to remain as a member of an honourable\n\nprofession (Law Saciety of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee [2018] 5\nSLR 1261 (“Wong Sin Yee') at [24]). The relevant test is to\nconsider_whether reasonable people, on_ hearing what the\nsolicitor had done, would have said without hesitation that as a\n\nsolicitor he should not have done it (Ng Chee Sing at [41]; Wong\nSin Yee at [24]).\"\n[Emphasis added]\n\n596.1t is sufficient if the solicitor's conduct brings him into discredit as a\nlawyer, or brings the legal profession as a whole into disrepute: Wong\nSin Yee, at [24].\n\n597.Even if the Respondent had not been Mr Lee’s lawyer, what she did\nto Mr Lee was dishonest and dishonourable. She:\n\n(a)\n\nMisled him, and procured his execution of the Last Will on the\nbasis of misrepresentations,\n\n(b)\n\nDenied him the benefit of proper legal advice, on the contents\nof his Last Will; and\n\n(c)\n\nParticipated in ensuring that the Last Will was signed quickly,\nwithout Mr Lee getting proper legal advice.\n\n598.This conduct unquestionably falis within the rubric of “conduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor’.\n\n188\n\n\fX.\n\nCause of sulfficient gravity under section 83 of the LPA\n\n599.Having found that the first and second Charges against the\nRespondent were established beyond reasonable doubt, the final\nquestion to address is whether there is “cause of sufficient gravity’\nunder section 93 of the LPA.\n600.The existence of misconduct under section 83(2) of the LPA, does\n\nnot ipso facto constitute “cause of sufficient gravity”. The function of\na Disciplinary Tribunal under section 93 of the LPA, is to serve as a\n\n“filter\"; Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel\n[2010] 3 SLR 390 (“Jasmine Gowrimani”) at [28]. It is open to the\nTribunal to find that the conduct, technically, falls within one or more\n\nlimbs of section 83(2) of the LPA, but take the view that the case is\nnevertheless not of “sufficient gravity”, to merit a reference to the\nCourt of Three Judges in Jasmine Gowrimani, at [39].\n601. Cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action arises if, (and only\nif), the Tribunal is of the view that “there is (potential or prima facie)\nmerit in the complaint”, which would result in a finding of \"due cause”,\nby the Court of Three Judges (see Jasmine Gowrimani, at [34] and\n[37]). In other words, the misconduct must be “sufficiently serious to\nwarrant the imposition of sanctions under s 83(1) of the LPA” (see\nLaw Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju [2017] SGHC\n\n141 at [30]).\n602.The sentencing principles set out in Law Society of Singapore v\nNorain bte Abu Bakar [2009] 1 SLR(R) 753 at [92] are instructive —\n(a)\n\n\"Where a solicitor has acted dishonestly, the court will order\nthat he be struck off the roll of solicitors.\n\n189\n\n\f(b}\n\nIf a solicitor is not shown to have acted dishonestly, but is\n\nshown to have fallen below the required standards of integrity,\nprobity and trustworthiness, he will nonetheless be struck off\nthe roll of solicitors, as opposed to merely being suspended, if\n\nhis lapse is such as to indicate that he lacks the qualities of\n_character and trustworthiness which are necessary atiributes\nof a person entrusted with the responsibilities of a legal\n\npractitioner.\n\n©)\n\nA further consideration to be borne in mind when deciding on\nthe appropriate penalty is the public dimension of disciplinary\nsentencing, which is the equivalent of public denunciation by\nthe court in the process of punishing an offender for the\noffence he has committed. This process serves to preserve\n\npublic confidence in the legal profession as an integral part of\nthe legal system.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n603.The misconduct that the Respondent is guilty of represents a serious\n\ndeparture from the most basic and fundamental standards expected\nof an advocate and solicitor — complete honesty and fidelity to his/her\nclient. The Respondent acted with dishonesty, deceit, and in\ndisregard of her legal obligations. To leave such egregious and\ndishonest conduct unsanctioned would bring disrepute upon the\nprofession. We accordingly determine, pursuant o section 93(1)(c)\nofthe LPA, that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists\nunder section 83 of the LPA.\n\nXl\n\nConclusion\n\n604. The main facts in this matter are not in much dispute.\n\n190\n\n\f605.In summary:\n\n(@)\n\nMs KKL was responsible for drafting Mr Lee’s First to Sixth\nWills, from 2011 to 2012377, She was his lawyer.

There\nis also no evidence as o why the First Will was chosen, when\n\nit had been superseded five times, by five other Wills'®. The\nRespondent and Mr LHY say that Mr Lee decided this himself.\nWe only have their word for this — and, in this case, on many\naspects where there was other evidence, it was clear that both\n\nof them were lying, and had acted dishonestly*’®. Mr Lee’s\nconduct in respect of the Last Will is quite different from the\ncare he seems to have exercised just a few days earlier, when\n\nhe was discussing with Ms KKL on amending his Penultimate\n\nWill*'7, The circumstances raise serious questions, including\non the Respondent's and Mr LHY’s motives®'®.\n(m)\n\nThe Respondent managed every aspect of the process, from\nsending the draft Last Will to Mr Lee at 7.08pm, on 16\n\nDecember 2013, and advising him.on i, fo its execution by Mr\n\n411 See paragraphs 554 and 555 of this Decision.\n412 See paragraphs 556 and 565-567 of this Decision,\n\n413 See paragraphs 29 and 37 of this Decision.\n414 See paragraphs 351-354 and 543 of this Decision.\n\n415 See paragraphs 19-20, 533-534 and 545 of this Decision.\n416 See paragraph 612 of this Decision.\n417 See paragraphs 28-29, 350-351, 358 and 543 of this Decision.\n\n418 See paragraphs 544, 565, 587-591 and 597 of this Decision.\n\n195\n\n\fLee at 11.10am, on 17 December 2013%°, She organised\nlawyers from her firm to engross the Last Will (which was in\n\nthe same terms as the draft), told them to get everything done\nquickly, and made the arrangements for execution of the Last\n\nWill by Mr Lee*?°. Mr LHY was also actively involved in the\nprocess 2 .

The Respondent would\nhave known this and other rules, but disregarded them®*.\n(n)\n\nThe Respondent knew that just before he signed the Last Will,\n\nMr Lee had asked (iwice), and was told, that she was the\n\nprimary lawyer who drafted it*?°. She did not object to this*®®.\nYet she told this Tribunal that there was no reason for Mr Lee\nto have considered her to be his lawyer for the Last Will*?\".\nWhen she said this, she did not know that Mr BL's evidence\n\non this matter, contradicting her, was going to be presented??,\n\n419 Sge paragraphs 40-68 and 367-407 of this Decision.\n42 Sge paragraphs 38-52, 363-365, 370, 380-384 and 389-394 of this Decision.\n\n421 See, for example, paragraphs 39, 44-46, 56-58, 279(b) and (c), 324-325, 385-388 and 511 of this\nDecision.\n422 See paragraphs 499-500, 526-532, 566-567, 570-573 and 576-580 of this Decision.\n42 See paragraphs 569 and 574-575 of this Decision.\n424 See paragraph 605(p) of this Decision.\n425 See paragraphs 200-208 of this Decision.\n\n428 See paragraphs 201 and 209 of this Decision.\n421 Sge paragraphs 187(b) and 211-215 of this Decision.\n\n428 See paragraph 213 of this Decision.\n\n196\n\n\f(0)\n\nAfter the Last Will was signed, the Respondent kept an\n\noriginal of the Last Will in her office safe®®®.

However, she did mislead him*®2.\nRule 25(a) and (b) of the PCR requires that she take\nMr Lee carefully through the terms of the draft Last\n\nWill. She did not do that®®. After her initial (wrong)\n\nadvice on what the draft Last Will was, she did not\nspeak with Mr Lee again**.

The Respondent and Mr LHY,\non 16 December 2013, persuaded their aged father-in-law/father, Mr\n\nLee (then a 90-year-old man in poor health, who had recently been\nhospitalised for several weeks, with serious medical conditions), to\nsigh a new Will without his usual lawyer (Ms KKL), to advise him.\nThey cut off that lawyer (Ms KKL) from communications with Mr Lee\non the Last Will, and rushed through the execution of the Last Will, in\nher absence. The Respondent took over as the lawyer to prepare the\nLast Will and advise Mr Lee, and misled Mr Lee on the terms of the\nLast Will that he was going to sign. Mr Lee was persuaded into\n\nsigning the Last Will within 16 hours — the Respondent sent a draft of\nthe Last Will at 7.08pm on 16 December 2013 and it was signed at\n\n11.10am on 17 December 2013. The Will that Mr Lee signed was\nvery different from both the Penultimate Will, and the proposed\nCodicil (that Mr Lee had discussed and agreed with Ms KKL, on 13\nDecember 2013, four days before he signed the Last Will prepared\nby the Respondent). The Respondent gave the briefest of advice to\nMr Lee, and did not alert Mr Lee to all the differences between what\n\nMr Lee had earlier wanted and what the Last Will actually provided\nfor.\n\n435 See paragraphs 324-331, 412-416, 510-511, 531 and 578-580 of this Decision.\n437 See paragraphs 544, 551-556, 560-567, 586-592, 597 and 603 of this Decision.\n\n198\n\n\f608.As stated earlier, the Last Will increased Mr LHY’s share in the\n\nEstate*38. The Respondent, in explaining aspects of her conduct (with\nregards to the haste with which the Last Will was done), said that she\nwas acting as an “obedjent wife\" (see paragraph 531).\n609.Mr Lee, who was very frail and in poor health, was misied by the very\npeople whom he trusted: his son, Mr LHY, and daughter-in-law, the\nRespondent.\n\n610.Mr LHY and the Respondent tried to explain away their conduct, the\ncontemporaneous documentary evidence and other surrounding\nevidence, and even their own previous statements. Their\nexplanations ranged from the improbable, to the patently contrived,\nto the downright dishonest.\n611.They tried to suppress their central role in what happened by:\n(a)\n\nLying about what happened; and\n\n(b)\n\nTrying to suppress evidence on what happened from being\nrevealed.\n\n612.The lies stretched from 2013, both in public and in private forums,\nuntil and through the current disciplinary proceedings. We have\nearlier gone through the facts and set them out. To summarise:\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent and Mr LHY said that the Respondent did\nnot draft the Last Will. This is untrue. She prepared the draft\n\nLast Will and she advised Mr Lee on it**.\n\n4% Mr Lee had discussed with Ms KKL on equalising the shares of all three children. See paragraph 29\nof this Decision.\n4% See paragraphs 267-302 of this Decision.\n\n199\n\n\f(b)\n\nMr LHY lied to the public about how the Last Will was\n\ndrafted*?. He admitted to us that some of his statements were\ninaccurate 4! . He said his public statements could be\ninaccurate because they are not sworn statements, and thus\n\nhe may not look at them carefully**2. The Respondent adopted,\nin her Defence, what Mr LHY had said publicly (which was\n\nuntrue)44, That was dishonest™.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent and Mr LHY said in these proceedings that\nafter infroducing Mr BL to Ms WLH and Mr LHY, the\n\nRespondent had no further role in the Last Will*5. This is\nuntrue. The Respondent was intimately involved, giving\ndirections, in charge of what was happening, until Mr Lee\n\nsigned the Last Will and even thereafter**®. The Respondent's\nand Mr LHY's untruths came to light when Mr BL’s evidence\n\nwas produced*’. They did not know that Mr BL's evidence\nwould be produced before us*®.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Respondent said that Mr Lee had no reason to consider\nthe Respondent as his lawyer, for the Last Will“®, This is\nuntrue. Mr Lee specifically asked, twice, who drafted his Last\nWill. He was told, both times, that the Respondent had drafted\n\n440 See paragraphs 488-493 of this Decision.\n44 Sea paragraph 491 of this Decision.\n442 See paragraphs 233 and 498 of this Decision.\n443 See paragraph 486 of this Decision.\n\n44 See paragraphs 488-421 of this Decision.\n445 See paragraph 265(d) of this Decision.\n445 See paragraphs 367-407 of this Decision.\n447 See paragraphs 187(a) and 367-394 of this Decision.\n\n448 See paragraphs 213 and 266 of this Decision.\n449 See paragraph 214 of this Decision.\n\n200\n\n\fthe Last Will*>. On the second time that Mr Lee asked, he was\ntold that the Respondent and Ms KKL had drafted the Last\n\nWill45!, (Mr BL's reference to Ms KKL was inaccurates?.)\nAgain, Mr BL's evidence exposed the untruths.\nThe Respondent and Mr LHY said that Ms KKL was Mr Lee’s\n\nlawyer and had drafted the Last Will. This was said to us on\n\n0ath*®3, and Mr LHY had said this to the public as well***. This\nis untrue. Ms KKL had no role in drafting the Last Wil**%, She\nwas cut out of communications on the Last Will by Mr LHY“58\n(except for one initial email which Ms KKL had said she did\n\nnot receive)*\".\n\n®\n\nMr LHY compounded his dishonesty by accusing Ms KKL of\nlying, in public\n%% , when Ms KKL said that she had not drafted\nthe Last Will“5®. This was quite cynical conduct.

The untruths are in\nwriting.\n\n613.The Respondent and Mr LHY also sought to suppress relevant\n\nevidence from coming to the Tribunal*’®.\n614.The Respondent suppressed the BL Documents, which would have\n\nexposed her untruths*’®. As a solicitor of 37 years' standing, it was\ninexcusable for her to have not disclosed the BL Documents:\n(a)\n\nShe was under a legal duty to disclose them. She was in\nbreach of that legal duty;\n\n(b)\n\nShe also falsely stated that she had disclosed ali relevant\ndocuments, when she was deliberately holding back the BL\n\nDocuments*”’; and\n(c)\n\nShe knew her husband, Mr LHY, was selectively relying on\nparts of these documents (namely, the EK Attendance Notes)\nin public, whilst suppressing other parts which were damaging\n\nto her*’.\n615.Mr LHY, as one of the Executors of the Estate, caused the Estate to\n\nmake an application OS 639, to prevent the Law Society from relying\n473 See paragraph 451 of this Decision.\n474 See paragraphs 472-485 of this Decision.\n415 See paragraphs 85-89 and 122-147, 184-195 and 423-434 of this Decision.\n476 See paragraph 184-195 of this Decision.\n417 See paragraph 193 of this Decision.\n\n478 See paragraphs 194-195 and 493-495 of this Decision.\n\n203\n\n\fon various documents, including the previous Wills of Mr Lee””®. That\napplication was rejected®.\n616.Thereafter, and despite the High Court’s ruling in OS 639, the\nRespondent tried to prevent this Tribunal from obtaining various\ndocuments, including the previous Wills of Mr Lee®*. These attempts\nwere quite unmeritorious. She then complained that she had been\n\nunfairly treated because these documents were produced®2,\n617.In essence, an elaborate edifice of lies was presented, both on oath\n(through Mr LHY and the Respondent’s Affidavits, and on the witness\nstand), and through their public and other statements, (which were\nreferred to/relied upon during the Disciplinary Proceedings). The\nAffidavits were contrived to present a false picture. Several of the lies\nwere quite blatant.\n618.The Respondent was a deceitful witness, who tailored her evidence\nto portray herself as an innocent victim who had been maligned. This\nwas a fagade. She lied to the AGC and she lied to us. Before us, she\nlied or became evasive whenever she thought that it was to her\nbenefit to lie or evade.\n\n619. Mr LHY's conduct was equally deceitful.

The respondent in that case was not found guilty of misconduct by the Court of Three Judges.\n\nThe DT took the view that a tax evasion offence is a serious offence which implies a defect of character rendering the Respondent unfit for the profession and that it is an act of dishonesty. Referring to [107] in Chng Ghim Huat v PP [2000] SGHC, the DT shared the same view with the presiding Judge in the matter that a conviction for any other reason is equally a fraud on the State and an act of dishonesty. Taking the cue from several authorities from Australia and New Zealand, the DT noted that the respondents in these cases were said to be dishonest and unfit for the profession.\n\nIn examining the Respondent’s mitigation plea, DT took the view that an acrimonious divorce does not quite explain the filing of false tax returns and in fact the Respondent had admitted to filing false returns since 2002 which was well before the start of his divorce proceedings in 2008. Even if he was coerced by his ex-wife to file the false returns as stated in his mitigation plea, such conduct is inexcusable as he either condoned the dishonesty initiated by the wife or worse still, continued with it.\n\nThe DT determined pursuant to section 93(1)(c) of the Act that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the Act and made no order as to costs.\n\nThe Council’s Decision\n\nCouncil adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and accordingly proceeded to apply for leave under section 98 of the Act for the Respondent to show cause as to why he should not suffer the sanctions set out in section 83 of the Act.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges\n\nThe Court of Three Judges ordered that the Respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors on 9 November 2017.\n\n\n","timestamp":"2019-12-07T01:00:02+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/disciplinary-tribunal-reports-dec-2019/"},{"title":"In the matter of Ong Pang Meng, an Advocate and Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-ong-pang-meng-an-advocate-and-solicitor\">In the matter of Ong Pang Meng, an Advocate and Solicitor</h3>\n<p>The disciplinary proceedings arose from a complaint as to how the Respondent had dealt with an interim payment of $20,000 received from insurers on behalf of the complainant, his client, for the client’s injury claim and the Respondent’s breach of his of duty of care and diligence to his client.</p>\n<p>The Law Society preferred five charges for grossly improper conduct pursuant to section 83(2)(b), of the Legal Profession Act (<strong>the Act</strong>) for:</p>\n<p>Requesting the complainant to transfer a sum of $20,000 into a joint account maintained by the Respondent and his wife and upon the receipt of the said sum, being client’s money as defined in the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Account) Rules, failing to transfer without delay the said sum into a client account in a breach of Rule 3(1) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules (<strong>PCR</strong>);</p>\n<p>Failing to maintain a reasonable level of communication with his client, the complainant, despite the client’s multiple attempts to contact him directly and indirectly in breach of Rule 17 of the PCR;</p>\n<p>Failing to provide a statement of account to his client for a sum of $5,000, being client’s money, which he retained since on or about 6 May 2011 despite your client’s requests for a statement of account or return thereof in breach of Rule 19 of the PCR;</p>\n<p>Without authority, instructions and/or consent, accepting a counter-proposal of $6,000 offered by the Plaintiff in respect of a matter in which his client was the Defendant;</p>\n<p>Failing to explain in a clear manner the counter-proposal of $6,000 offered by the Plaintiff in respect a matter in which his client was the Defendant in breach of Rule 21 of the PCR.</p>\n<p>Several alternative charges were also preferred.</p>\n<h4 id=\"findings-of-the-disciplinary-tribunal-dt\"><strong>Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (DT)</strong></h4>\n<p>On the 1<sup>st</sup> Charge, the DT was of the view that it is clear that Rule 3 of the Solicitors’ Account Rules read with Rule 9 of the said Rules requires client’s money to be deposited into a client account without delay unless the exceptions in Rule 9 apply and none of the exceptions were applicable in this case.

Further, the DT ordered that the Respondent bear the Society’s costs of the proceedings which is to be taxed if not agreed.\n\nThe Council’s Decision\n\nThe Council accepted the findings of the DT and accordingly reprimanded the Respondent.\n","timestamp":"2018-02-07T04:00:40+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-feb-2018/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Thirumuthy Ayernaar Pambayan (the “Respondent”), Advocate and Solicitor","html":"<h3>In the Matter of Thirumuthy Ayernaar Pambayan (the “Respondent”), Advocate and Solicitor</h3>\n<p>Pursuant to section 93(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act (the “Act’) the Disciplinary Tribunal (‘DT’) determined that cause for sufficient gravity exists for disciplinary action against the Respondent under section 83 of the Act.</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-77270521\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>The Respondent’s client complained that the Respondent had entered into a prohibited borrowing transaction with him.</p>\n<h4><strong>The Charges</strong></h4>\n<p>The Society tendered the following charges against the Respondent:</p>\n<h5><strong><em>1<sup>st</sup> Charge </em></strong></h5>\n<p>“You, Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan, an advocate and solicitor are charged that on or about 26 January 2012, you did enter into a prohibited borrowing transaction by virtue of which the sum of $3,000 was borrowed by you from your client, one Chandran s/o Eruthi Yanathan, and such conduct by you amounts to a breach of Rule 33(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules and you have thereby breached a rule of conduct made by the Council of the Law Society (the “Council”) under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act, as amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161)”</p>\n<h5><strong><em>2<sup>nd</sup> Charge </em></strong></h5>\n<p>“You, Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan, an advocate and solicitor are charged that on or about 26 June 2012, you did enter into a prohibited borrowing transaction by virtue of which the sum of $8,000 was borrowed by you from your client, one Chandran s/o Eruthi Yanathan, and such conduct by you amounts to a breach of Rule 33(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules and you have thereby breached a rule of conduct made by the Council of the Law Society (“the Council”) under the provisions of the Legal Profession Act, as amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161)”</p>\n<h4><strong>Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”)</strong></h4>\n<p>The DT accepted that only two loans of $3,000 and $8,000 were obtained from the complainant.

In effect, the Respondent was not the proprietor of FLC, but actually employed by one Mohd Sadique bin Ibrahim Marican (“Sadique”) and one Anand Kumar s/o Toofani Beldar (“Anand”) to manage FLC in 2009. The Respondent was paid a sum of $7,500 per month by them. The manager of FLC was Ebrahim Marican Batcha Sahib (‘Ebrahim’), who was not an advocate and solicitor. Both Sadique and Anand subsequently left FLC and the Respondent left the control and management of FLC entirely to Ebrahim.</p>\n<p>In February 2013, the complainant instructed FLC to act in the purchase of a property and signed a Warrant to Act. On the face of it, the Respondent was the signatory to the Warrant to Act. However, the complainant never met the Respondent at all although the Respondent appeared in court for the complainant to successfully obtain specific performance against the vendor. In fact, by this time, the Respondent had ceased to practice at FLC and was acting as “instructed counsel’ in another law practice. The Respondent very much left matters at FLC under Ebrahim’s care.</p>\n<p>On 19 April 2013, the complainant paid the sum of $108,000 to FLC ostensibly to “facilitate completion of the property”. FLC acknowledged receipt of the moneys but failed to complete the purchase. Subsequently investigations revealed that the monies had been withdrawn from FLC through a series of ATM and cheque withdrawals. These withdrawals were traced to Ebrahim.</p>\n<h3><strong>Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”)</strong></h3>\n<p>Before dealing with each specific charge, the DT made a general observation regarding the duty of an Advocate and Solicitor in relation to his duty to supervise his practice.</p>\n<p>Rule 8(1) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (2010 Ed) (the “PCR”) provides:</p>\n<p><em>“8(1) An advocate and solicitor shall exercise proper supervision over his employees and other staff.”</em></p>\n<p>The Tribunal accepted the cases of <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Chwee Wan Allan </em>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 669 and <em>Law Society of Singapore v Zulkifli Bin Mohd Amin &amp; Anor [</em>2011] 2 SLR 620 in which the court stated that the responsibility to supervise is “unyielding” (<em>Allan Tan</em> at page 430) “and in the court stated that a solicitor is<em> “not to abdicate such responsibility … by delegating … without any adequate system or periodic checks”. (Zulkifli </em>at page 38)</p>\n<p>A solicitor can delegate his work to his employee and mere delegation is not, ipso facto, breach of Rule 8(1) of the PCR. However, that does not absolve the solicitor from his overall responsibility to ensure there is proper supervision of what goes on in the practice. A particular act performed by an employee in a law firm must be viewed in the totality of the circumstances for one to decide if the solicitor in allowing that act has been negligent in allowing it. In most instances the test lies not in the act itself (unless the act is obviously illegal, improper or in breach of the rules), but in whether or not there is in place a system to ensure that the solicitor knows about it.</p>\n<h3><strong>DT’s Findings on the Charges</strong></h3>\n<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> charge accused the Respondent of surrendering the management and control of FLC to Sadique and Anand from July 2008 to November 2010. The DT found the 3<sup>rd</sup> Charge proved. The DT found that the two Letters amounted to a confession by the Respondent that he had surrendered the management and control of the practice to Sadique and Anand during this period. It was wrong for the Respondent not to have any control at all over the files brought into the firm, including those brought in by Sadique and Anand. The Respondent owed an obligation to all clients of FLC.</p>\n<p>The 4<sup>th</sup> Charge accused the Respondent of not exercising control and management of FLC by allowing Ebrahim from November 2010 to have full rein of the management of FLC. The DT found this charged proved. Despite knowing that Sadique and Anand were disbarred, he took no steps to acquaint himself with the running of FLC, and to take over the reins of management. In cross-examination the he admitted that he did not supervise Ebrahim and was in breach of the Rules. The Tribunal found that the failure of the Respondent to supervise the Ebrahim was complete. The lack of control enable Ebrahim to embezzle money deposited by the complainant. The lack of management of the practice was egregious and systematic and such complete failure started in July 2008 and continued right up to 2010.</p>\n<p>The 5<sup>th</sup> Charge accused the Respondent of not ensuring that the complainant’s $108,000 would not be deposited into the office account. This payment into the office account is a breach of Rule 3(1) of Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and Rule 5(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011. These are strict liability offences and the DT found the charge proved. The Respondent’s failure to ensure that the $108,000 was not paid into FLC’s office account took place in the context of a complete lack of supervision by the Respondent and resulted in its theft of the money by Ebrahim.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the DT determined under section 93(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act (the “Act’) that cause for sufficient gravity exists for disciplinary action against Krishna Morthy S V under section 83 of the Act.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Council’s Decision </strong></h3>\n<p>Council adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and accordingly proceeded to apply for leave under section 98 of the Act for the Respondent to show cause as to why he should not suffer sanctions set out in section 83 of the Act.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Court of Three
