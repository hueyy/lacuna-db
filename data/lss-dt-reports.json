The Respondent solicitor is Ms Kwa Kim Li. The Respondent is a\npartner in the firm of M/s Lee & Lee, and is an advocate and solicitor of more than 40\nyears’ standing.\n\n2.\n\nThe Complaint covered various matters, which came before this Disciplinary Tribunal\nthrough different procedural routes.\n\nProcedural History\n\n3.\n\nIn the Complaint by LHY and LWL, there were four heads of complaint. These were:(a) First, that the Respondent had failed to follow the instructions of the late Mr Lee\nKuan Yew (the “Testator”) to destroy his superseded wills (the “First Complaint”);\n(b) Second, that the Respondent had breached privilege and her duties of\nconfidentiality by sending emails with records of communications with the Testator\nto Mr Lee Hsien Loong (“LHL”) who was not an executor of the estate of the\nTestator (the “Estate”) (the “Second Complaint”);\n(c) Third, that the Respondent had failed to keep proper contemporaneous notes and\nrecords of all the advice given to and instructions received from the Testator (the\n“Third Complaint”); and\n(d) Fourth, that the Respondent had given false and misleading information to the\nexecutors in her emails of 4 June 2015 and 22 June 2015 (the “Fourth\nComplaint”).\n\n4.\n\nAfter consideration of the Complaint by the Review Committee, the Inquiry Committee\nand the Council of the Law Society (the “Council”), the Council determined, pursuant\nto section 87 of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (the “LPA”), that there should be a\nformal investigation by a Disciplinary Tribunal of only the Second Complaint. Two\ncharges were framed in relation to the Second Complaint, both framed with alternative\ncharges. The Council accordingly applied to the Chief Justice, pursuant to section 89\nof the LPA, to appoint a Disciplinary Tribunal to hear and investigate the matter. The\nStatement of Case prepared by the Law Society of Singapore (the “LSS”), containing\n1\n\n\fthe two charges and the alternatives charges, is attached as Annex A. These charges\nare referred to as the LSS Charges.\n\n5.\n\nLHY and LWL were dissatisfied with the determination of the Council in relation to\nthose parts of the Complaint that were not referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal for formal\ninvestigation. They applied to the High Court, pursuant to section 96 of the LPA, for an\norder directing the LSS to apply to the Chief Justice to the appointment of a\nDisciplinary Tribunal in respect of those matters also. As a result of that application, an\norder was made, pursuant to section 96 of the LPA, that the LSS apply to the Chief\nJustice for the appointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal in relation to the First and the\nFourth Complaint (in addition to the Second Complaint).\n\n6.\n\nUpon appeal by the LSS from the order made by the High Court, the Court of Appeal\nheld inter alia that there was no prima facie case in relation to the First Complaint and\nheld that the First Complaint should not be referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal for formal\ninvestigation.\n\n7.\n\nAs provided under section 97(5) of the LPA, LHY and LWL, as the complainants who\nhad obtained the order in respect of the Fourth Complaint, were to have conduct of the\nproceedings before the Disciplinary Tribunal in relation to the charges brought in\nrelation to the Fourth Complaint. Subsequently the order was varied such that only\nLHY would have such conduct. The Statement of Case prepared by LHY (the\n“Complainant”), containing the additional charge, is attached as Annex B. The charge\ncontained therein is referred to as the Complainant’s Charge.\n\n8.\n\nThe LSS retained conduct of the charges brought under the Second Complaint.\n\n9.\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal 19 of 2022 (the “DT” or “DT 19”) was appointed to hear the\nmatters arising from both the LSS and the Complainant’s Statements of Case\n(comprising the Second and Fourth Complaints respectively). Mr R S Bajwa acted for\nthe LSS and Mr Abraham Vergis SC acted for the Complainant. Mr Cavinder Bull SC\nacted for the Respondent in both matters. In this Report, the following terminology will\nbe used hereafter:\n(a)\n\nStatement of Case filed by the LSS (Annex A) - LSS SOC;\n\n(b)\n\nStatement of Case filed by LHY (Annex B) - Complainant’s SOC;\n\n(c)\n\nDefence of the Respondent to Complainant’s SOC (Annex C)- Defence to\nComplainant’s SOC.\n2\n\n\fBackground to the matters before the DT\n\n10.\n\nLHY and LWL are the two younger children of the Testator and the trustees and\nexecutors of the Estate. The Testator’s eldest child is LHL, the current Prime Minister\nof Singapore. The Testator was the first Prime Minister of Singapore and widely\nacclaimed and acknowledged as the father of Singapore as a nation. The Respondent\nhad acted as the Testator’s solicitor over many years. In particular, the Respondent\nhad acted in relation to the preparation of six wills for the Testator, from 20 August\n2011 to 2 November 2012.\n\n11.\n\nOn 29 November 2013, the Testator contacted the Respondent regarding certain\ntestamentary matters. Communications continued by way of emails, and possibly by\nway of conversations, up to 13 December 2013. The nature of these communications\nand the Respondent’s characterisation of these communications are apposite to the\nComplainant’s Charge. Subsequently, a seventh will was executed on 17 December\n2013, with the involvement of LHY and his wife, Ms Lee Suet Fern, herself an\nexperienced solicitor.\n\n12.\n\nThe Testator passed away on 23 March 2015. The Testator’s will and testamentary\ndirections attracted significant public interest, in particular arising from the Testator’s\nintentions in relation to the demolition of the Testator’s home at Oxley Road. Of less\npublic interest, but probably of equal relevance to the present matters was the manner\nof apportionment of the Testator’s estate amongst his three children.\n\n13.\n\nThe LSS Charges and the Complainant’s Charge arise from two emails that the\nRespondent sent, on 4 June 2015 and 22 June 2015, in response to queries from LHL\nand LWL. These emails were sent to LHL, LWL and LHY. The LSS Charges relate to a\nbreach of confidentiality, in that the Respondent is alleged, by way of the two emails,\nto have disclosed client confidential information to parties not entitled to receive the\ninformation, namely LHL. The Complainant’s Charge relates to the allegation that the\ntwo emails were misleading responses to the queries, by omitting matters that should\nhave been included and/or by containing false and misleading representations. We will\nexamine the ingredients of the charges with greater specificity below.\n\n3\n\n\fThe Proceedings Before the DT\n\nPreliminary Directions\n\n14.\n\nDT 19 was appointed to hear the matters arising from both the LSS SOC and the\nComplainant’s SOC. We directed that both cases would be heard together, with\nwitnesses only giving evidence once, and the evidence, agreed documents and\nagreed facts being admitted in relation to both matters. Counsel for the LSS would\nlead evidence in relation to the LSS SOC and counsel for the Complainant would lead\nevidence in relation to the Complainant’s SOC. It was indicated to us that the LSS and\nthe Respondent were likely to agree on a statement of facts insofar as the LSS SOC\nwas concerned. It was also indicated that the Respondent would be making\nrepresentations to the LSS in relation to LSS charges.\n\n15.\n\nInsofar as the Complainant’s SOC was concerned, Counsel for the Complainant\nindicated that the only witness being called would be LHY. We were told that his\nevidence would be formal, and relate to the documents upon which the Complaint was\nbased. The only witness for the Respondent was to be the Respondent herself.\n\n16.\n\nGiven that the matters before DT 19 related to estate matters, the documents to be\ntendered in the course of the hearing were likely to contain private matters. Parties\nwere directed to agree on redactions to be made to documentary exhibits and agreed\ndocuments, where possible. All such redactions were made by agreement and we\nwere not required to make any determination on redactions.\n\n17.\n\nDirections were given for the filing of the Respondent’s defences, witness statements,\nan agreed bundle, opening statements, and agreed statements of facts. These\ndirections were complied with.\n\nPreliminary Issues\n\n18.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the hearing, the LSS indicated that it had received\nrepresentations from the Respondent. The LSS indicated that it would be tendering an\nagreed statement of facts in relation to an amended charge. The amended charge was\n4\n\n\fthe alternative to the First Charge in the LSS SOC, with further particularization. The\nLSS stated that this new charge, the Amended First Alternative Charge, would be\nmade out on the statement of facts agreed with the Respondent, and that it would not\nbe calling any evidence. The Respondent confirmed this position and stated that she\naccepted that the Amended First Alternative Charge was made out in law and on the\nfacts. A copy of the Amended First Alternative Charge is at Annex D and a copy of the\nAgreed Statement of Facts, agreed between the LSS and the Respondent, is at\nAnnex E.\n\n19.\n\nThere were two preliminary issues raised by the Complainant. The first was an\napplication for the Complainant to give evidence by video link. The second was\nwhether we should continue to consider both the original charges and their\nalternatives, as set out in the LSS SOC even though the LSS chose to proceed on only\none charge upon a “plea bargain” arising from representations made by the\nRespondent to the LSS. Before setting out the specifics of the two issues, and our\nconsiderations and rulings, we touch on the nature of disciplinary tribunal proceedings,\nas this informed the approach that we adopted.\n\n20.\n\nIn the normal course of events, the Council applies to the Chief Justice for the\nappointment of a Disciplinary Tribunal under section 89 of the LPA, where the Council\ndetermines under section 87 of the LPA that there should be a formal investigation, or\nwhere the Court makes an order under section 96 of the LPA. Under section 93 of the\nLPA, the Disciplinary Tribunal must, after hearing and investigating the matter, record\nits findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to those facts, make one\nof three determinations:\n(a)\n\nthat no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under sections 83\nor 83A of the LPA;\n\n(b)\n\nthat while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsections 83 or 83A of the LPA, the practitioner should be ordered to pay a\npenalty, be reprimanded, be ordered to comply with one or more remedial\nmeasures, or be subjected to a remedial measure in addition to a penalty or\nreprimand; or\n\n(c)\n\nthat cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under sections 83 or\n83A of the LPA.\n\n21.\n\nIt is clear from section 93 that the main role of the Disciplinary Tribunal is that of fact\nfinder. This is consonant with its duty to conduct a formal investigation. Upon its\n5\n\n\ffindings of the facts of the case, the Disciplinary Tribunal will form a view on the gravity\nof the case, in terms of the need for any further disciplinary action at all, or for the\nsanctions of penalty or reprimand to be imposed, or for the more serious consequence\nof referring the matter to the Court of Three Judges (“C3J”). The language of the\nvarious sections is not predicated on the Disciplinary Tribunal operating as an\nadjudicator in an adversarial hearing.\n\n22.\n\nHowever, the situation in practice and as contemplated in the Legal Profession\n(Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules (“DT Rules”) is predicated on an adversarial /\nadjudication model. For example, Rule 3(2) / 3(4) and Rule 4(2) / 4(4) of the DT Rules\nrequire the Statement of Case to contain charges. Rule 8 provides for a Defence to be\nfiled. Rule 10 provides for the manner in which evidence is to be adduced. Rule 23\nprovides for the Evidence Act to apply, as it applies in civil and criminal proceedings.\nCost orders can be made against the respondent practitioner or a complainant who\nmakes a frivolous or vexatious complaint. These provisions suggest that the\nDisciplinary Tribunal “tries” the respondent practitioner on the charges in the\nStatement of Case.\n\n23.\n\nWe are of the view that, as the Disciplinary Tribunal is an investigative body, our key\nconcern should be ascertainment of facts.\n\n24.\n\nHowever, the the Disciplinary Tribunal is required to adjudicate the charges in the\nstatement of case, as modified by any decision of the LSS not to proceed on any\nparticular charge or to proceed on amended charges. The question which arises is\nwhether we should exercise our powers to investigate all facts or whether we should\nbe bound by the position taken by the LSS; in short whether the position taken by the\nLSS would circumscribe the findings that the Disciplinary Tribunal may make.\n\n25.\n\nThe C3J decision in Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar [2021]\nSGHC 27 is directly on point and extremely pertinent to the issues in this case. In that\ncase, the LSS had amended the charge originally set out in the Statement of Case,\nwhich contained an element of deceit, to a charge where the element of dishonesty\nhad been removed. Using the parlance of criminal practice, a reduced charge was\npreferred. At [31], the C3J considered the fact that the disciplinary proceedings had\nbeen conducted on the basis of the reduced charge and stated very explicitly that “It\ncannot be gainsaid that the respondent could only be held to account for the specific\nmisconduct that she had been charged for. To hold otherwise would be prejudicial to\n6\n\n\fthe respondent since it is the charge that informs a lawyer facing disciplinary\nproceedings of the case that he or she has to meet and impacts the decision he or she\nmakes as to how to respond to the disciplinary proceedings.” The C3J went on to find\nthat the Disciplinary Tribunal in that case had therefore erred in making findings that\nthe respondent solicitor had acted deceitfully, even if she had indeed done so,\nbecause the amended charge and the agreed statement of facts contained no\nallegation of dishonest conduct whatsoever, even though the original charge did. At\n[37], the C3J considered the decision in Law Society of Singapore v Yeo Khirn Hai\nAlvin [2020] 4 SLR 858, and approved the position that it was only where the “Law\nSociety has framed a defective charge that fails to reflect the substance of the\ncomplaint, that the DT lacks jurisdiction in hearing and investigating the charge and\nmaking a determination thereon, and the DT’s decision is liable to be set aside.”\n(emphasis added). The issue is therefore clearly whether the amended charges\nproceeded with still reflect the substance of the complaint. On the facts of Law\nSociety of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar, the C3J found that while the\namended charge did not capture the full extent of the respondent’s transgressions, it\nwas not so defective as to warrant setting aside the DT’s determination for want of\njurisdiction. We are therefore of the view that the question of whether the substance of\nthe complaint is proceeded with is a fact-sensitive exercise, where the proceeded\ncharge must be considered against the substance of the complaint.\n\nThe First Preliminary Issue\n\n26.\n\nWe now deal with the First Preliminary Issue. Shortly before the commencement of the\nevidentiary hearing, the Complainant applied for his evidence to be given by video link.\nThe application was supported by an affidavit. The Respondent objected to the\napplication. The reason given by the Complainant was that his “passport was currently\nbeing held by immigration authorities in connection with an immigration issue and that\nhe was unlikely to get it back in time for the Hearing.” A video hearing was held to\ndetermine the application. The Complainant submitted that he was unable to travel due\nto matters beyond his control, that there were appropriate administrative arrangements\nand technical facilities available for him to give evidence by video link, and that the\nComplainant would face unfair prejudice if the application was not granted. Despite\nrepeated requests by the DT, Counsel for the Complainant declined to state the\npurpose for which the passport had been handed over, or even when the Complainant\nhad handed over the passport. This latter question was critical as it touched the\nquestion of whether the Complainant’s inability to travel was a matter beyond his\n7\n\n\fcontrol or occasioned by his own actions. This argument was made forcefully by the\nRespondent’s counsel, who also submitted that the Respondent would be prejudiced\nby the inability to cross-examine the Complainant in person. The Complainant’s\nresponse was that the Complainant was a formal witness and that the Complainant’s\ncase was based on documents.\n\n27.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we allowed the application for the Complainant to give\nevidence by video link even though we were disturbed by the Complainant’s refusal to\ngive reasons why and the circumstances under which he did not have possession of\nhis passport. Allowing the Complainant to give evidence by video link would permit us\nto carry out our investigative function with the full benefit of all available evidence. We\nwere of the view that the Respondent would not be prejudiced by having to conduct\nthe cross-examination by video link. In making our determination, we applied the\nstandard and the tests set out in the section 281(5B) of the Criminal Procedure Code\n2010 and section 62A(2) of the Evidence Act 1893.\n\nThe Second Preliminary Issue\n\n28.\n\nAs stated above, the LSS and the Respondent had reached an agreement whereby\nthe LSS would proceed on one amended charge and the Respondent would admit to\nan Agreed Statement of Facts. The Respondent also agreed that the facts admitted to\nwould make out the amended charge. The charge proceeded with was marked as the\nAmended First Alternative Charge, attached hereto as Annex D. This was tendered\nwith an Agreed Statement of Facts, marked as ASOF-LS, and attached as Annex E.\nThe Amended First Alternative Charge related to the email of 4 June 2015 sent by the\nRespondent to LHY, LWL and LHL. The original Second Charge and its alternative\nrelated to the Respondent’s email of 22 June 2015.\n\n29.\n\nThe Complainant took the position, communicated to us by letter dated 2 February\n2023, that the Complainant was concerned about the LSS’s course of action as it\nwould result in a situation where we would not be able to investigate the original\nSecond Charge and its alternative. The Complainant went on to state that he reserved\nhis right to apply for judicial review. The Complainant did not state his position as to\nthe proper course of action we should take.\n\n30.\n\nAll parties were invited to address the point raised by the Complainant, on the first day\nof the hearing, before the evidentiary hearing commenced. The LSS’s position was\n8\n\n\fthat it was not offering evidence in relation to the original First Charge and the original\nSecond Charge and Second Alternative Charge. The LSS went further to state that DT\n19 not only should not, but could not, consider the matters set out in the original First\nCharge, the original Second Charge and the original Second Alternative Charge. The\nComplainant took the position that we could and should consider all the matters in the\nLSS SOC, even in relation to charges where the LSS chose not to offer evidence. We\nindicated that we were inclined to agree with the position taken by the LSS. However,\nthe Respondent took the position that we could consider all the matters in the LSS\nSOC, and therefore the Respondent should be permitted to file a Supplementary\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief addressing the matters in the original Second Charge. In\ndoing so, the counsel for the Respondent adverted to the fact that the Complainant\nmight take this issue further and that it was in the Respondent’s interest that she\naddress the facts relating to the LSS’s Second Charge and its alternative and that a\nfinding on the merits be made thereon.\n\n31.\n\nWe gave leave to the Respondent to file the Supplementary Affidavit of Evidence-inChief and indicated that we would consider the correct approach to be taken in relation\nto charges where no evidence was offered, in the course of our determination.\n\n32.\n\nHaving considered the matter, we are of the view that the LSS has a discretion to\nconsider representations and to weigh the merits of possible defences and consider\nfacts raised by a respondent solicitor; and thereafter to determine whether any charges\nshould be amended and whether no evidence should be offered on any charge. Where\nthere are multiple charges, we are of the view that the same approach can be taken in\nconsidering whether to offer evidence on any of the charges.\n\n33.\n\nWe have considered the strictures of the C3J in Law Society of Singapore v\nConstance Margreat Paglar that amendments [or offering of no evidence in respect\nof some of the charges] should not result in the gravamen of the complaint being so\ndiluted or modified as to result in a want of jurisdiction. In this regard, we cite its\nstatement at [39] where the C3J states, “… save to reiterate that the Law Society’s\nduty to investigate complaints referred to it implies a concomitant duty to frame\nappropriate charges that adequately reflect the gravamen of the complaint (see Alvin\nYeo at [78]). These are weighty obligations that the Law Society has been entrusted\nwith, and the principle of self-regulation in disciplinary matters makes it even more\nimperative that the Law Society thoroughly discharges these duties. Any failure to fulfil\nthese responsibilities would only serve to undermine the overriding purpose of legal\n9\n\n\fdisciplinary proceedings - to protect the public and uphold public confidence in the\nlegal profession (see Law Society of Singapore v Chia Choon Yang [2018] 5 SLR 1068\nat [41]). Having said that, the Law Society does of course retain the discretion to\namend charges in appropriate circumstances after it has considered the relevant facts\nand the law. A complainant’s view of the gravamen of the complaint may not always be\nsustainable.” (emphasis added)\n\n34.\n\nThe position taken by the LSS in not offering evidence on the original Second Charge\nand its alternative was predicated on its view that the email of 22 June 2015 was not a\nbreach of confidentiality as the email did not contain confidential information. This was\na view that could be reasonably held on an assessment of the evidence. We are not\nprivy to the substance of the representations made and form no view on the merits of\nthe representations. We find that the gravamen of the complaint (i.e., a breach of\nconfidentiality) was the subject matter of the original First Charge and its alternative,\nand was addressed by the Amended First Alternative Charge. Further, in choosing to\nproceed with the alternative to the original First Charge rather than the original First\nCharge, the Law Society was pitching its case as a breach of section 83(2)(h) of the\nLPA, as opposed to a breach of section 83(2)(b). This was a position taken after\nconsideration of the law, and was a position that could be reasonably held. The\namended charge still addressed the gravamen of the complaint, which was the breach\nof confidentiality. There was accordingly no want of jurisdiction. For the reasons set\nout in Law Society of Singapore v Constance Margreat Paglar at [31], we are of the\nview that it is not open to us to consider the charges which were not proceeded with\nand in relation to which evidence was not offered.\n\n35.\n\nWe bear in mind the Respondent’s concerns that our view may be wrong, and that the\nComplainant may proceed with judicial review on the question of our failure to exercise\njurisdiction on the original First Charge and the original Second Charge and its\nalternative. Accordingly, we have proceeded to consider the merits of the charges not\nproceeded with, in our discussion of the facts below.\n\nThe LSS SOC\n\n32.\n\nThe Amended First Alternative Charge (Annex C) is set out below.\n\nYou, KWA KIM LI, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that you on or about the 4th day of June 2015 by your\n10\n\n\fletter dated 4th June 2015 sent to Mr Lee Hsien Loong (“LHL”) are guilty of\nknowingly disclosing to LHL, without the consent / authority of the 2 Executors\nand Trustees named in Will No. 7 namely Ms Lee Wei Ling (“LWL”) and Mr Lee\nHsien Yang (“LHY”), the following documents and information which was\nconfidential to your client, Mr Lee Kuan Yew (“Mr Lee”), and which was acquired\nby you in the course of your engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor namely; 5 of the\nprevious Wills of Mr Lee prepared by you upon his instructions and email trails\nbetween Mr Lee and you from 11th December 2011 to 2nd November 2012\n(“Documents Set A”) and explanations as to why your client Mr Lee changed his\nprevious Wills which amounts to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161).\n\n33.\n\nThe Amended First Alternative Charge was supported by an Agreed Statement of\nFacts (Annex E). Of significance is [9] of the Agreed Statement of Facts, where the\nRespondent admits that she did not obtain the consent/authority of the 2 Executors\nand Trustees named in the Testator’s Will dated 17 December 2013 (“Will No. 7”),\nnamely LHY and LWL, prior to sending [by e-mail] the letter dated 4 June 2015 to LHL,\nLWL and LHY. We sought confirmation from the Respondent’s Counsel that the\nRespondent admitted to and accepted the facts set out in the Amended First\nAlternative Charge and Agreed Statement of Facts, and admitted that these facts\namounted to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the\nSupreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession, within the meaning of\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent so confirmed and submitted that the circumstances of this case did\nnot require referral to the C3J, and that we should issue a reprimand or impose a\nmodest penalty. The Law Society took the position that a reprimand was not sufficient\nand that a penalty of $3,000 to $5,000 should be imposed.\n\n35.\n\nBefore we deal with the substance of the Amended First Alternative Charge, we\naddress a point of difference between the LSS and the Respondent. Both parties took\nthe common position that the information and documents set out in the charge were\nconfidential to the Testator, and upon his death, to his Estate. The LSS took the\nposition that the confidentiality could not be breached unless LHY and LWL, as\nExecutors, gave permission. The Respondent took the position that they could not give\n11\n\n\fpermission until Probate was granted. Nothing turned on this as the Respondent did\nnot seek the permission of LHY and LWL in communicating to LHL.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent pitched her breach of confidentiality as a breach of the lowest level,\nsubmitting that that the Testator would have wanted her to share the information with\nLHL, LWL and LHY. Her position was that she released the information out of a deep\nsense of loyalty to the Testator, although she accepts that she did not have specific\ninstructions from the Testator, prior to his death, to release such information. The LSS\ndid not take a position on whether the Testator would have wanted the Respondent to\nrelease the information to LHL, but agreed that the Respondent’s culpability and the\nharm caused by the breach was not substantial. On consideration of all the facts, we\naccept this submission.\n\n37.\n\nWe accept that the Respondent was replying to queries by LHL and LWL under the\nnotion that she ought to respond to queries from beneficiaries, who also happened to\nbe her first cousins, with whom she grew up. We accept that the Testator had\npreviously indicated to her that he would inform his children of his intentions and the\nreasons for his testamentary dispositions. We also accept that the Respondent had a\nclose personal relationship with the Testator. We note that there is no evidence before\nus suggesting that the Respondent was acting from any improper motives.\n\n38.\n\nHowever, it would have been clear to the Respondent that she was dealing with\nsensitive family issues. The Respondent was aware that LWL had previously voiced\nunhappiness on the change from a position where she has a slightly larger share to\nequal shares. In a situation such as the present case, it is imperative that solicitors act\nstrictly within their professional boundaries and exercise care and caution. The\nRespondent’s misconduct was her failure to scrupulously safeguard the Testator’s\nconfidentiality; and this misconduct was unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n39.\n\nIn the premises, we determine pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, that while no\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83, the\nRespondent should be ordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed. Further, we are of the view that a penalty that is sufficient and\nappropriate to the misconduct committed is a penalty of $5,000. Given the DT’s role as\na filter of case, we do not think that a low culpability-low harm situation, involving\nmisconduct under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA is one that should be referred to the C3J,\nparticular in the absence of any dishonesty or deceit, or gross negligence.\n12\n\n\f40.\n\nOn the question of costs, the LSS asked for a very modest $5,000. Pursuant to section\n93(2) read with section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, we order the Respondent to pay the\nLSS’s costs in the sum of $5,000 and to bear all disbursements that have been\nreasonably incurred which are to be taxed if parties are not able to agree.\n\n41.\n\nWe now deal with the original First Charge, the original Second Charge and the\nalternative to the original Second Charge. As stated earlier, we are of the view that\nthese are not matters for our consideration. If we are wrong and should have\nconsidered these matters, there would have made no difference to our earlier\ndetermination – that while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists\nunder section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of\n$5,000 being a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed.\nAs the party framing the Statement of Case, the LSS is entitled to frame alternative\ncharges, to choose which alternative to proceed upon, and to amend the charges.\n\n42.\n\nIn any event, we are the view that the misconduct in the present case does not fall\nwithin the ambit of grossly improper conduct within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of\nthe LPA and the original First Charge would not have been made out.\n\n43.\n\nIn relation to the original Second Charge, we accept the Respondent’s submissions\nthat the contents of the 22 June 2015 letter were different in nature from that of the 4\nJune 2015 letter. The thrust of the letter was to distance the Respondent from any\ninvolvement in the preparation of Will No. 7, not to give information about that will and\nits execution. We also accept the Respondent’s submissions that the information\ncontained in the 22 June 2015 letter was already known to the parties. Specifically, the\ncontents of the 1st Will (the will of 20 August 2011, which has been referred to in other\nproceedings as the 2nd Will), which was mirrored in Will No. 7, had been discussed\nwith LHL, LWL and LHY at the time the 1st Will was executed. It was also clear that\nLHL, LWL and LHY had entered into a deed of Family Arrangement immediately after\nand predicated upon the contents of the 1st Will. In any event, even if the information\ndisclosed in the 22 June 2015 was information confidential to the Testator and his\nEstate, we do not find that the disclosure amounted to misconduct under section 83(2)\nof the LPA.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the Complainant’s position on the original Second\nCharge and its alternative was frivolous and vexatious. We do not agree. There is a\n13\n\n\fsignificant zone between a frivolous and vexatious complaint that ought not to have\nbeen made at all and a finding that misconduct has not been made out beyond\nreasonable doubt. We recognize that the Complainant had viewed the two letters as\npart of a continuum, while the LSS had analysed the two letters as two discrete acts.\nWhile we accept that the LSS’s approach is the correct one, we will not go so far as to\nstate that the Complainant’s approach was frivolous and vexatious.\nThe Complainant’s SOC\n\n45.\n\nThe Complainant’s SOC contained a single charge, as follows:\n\nYou, Mdm Kwa Kim Li, are charged that, by way of your letters dated 4 June and\n22 June 2015, you misled the Executors of the Estate of your former client Mr\nLee Kuan Yew, namely Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by omitting\nand/or otherwise failing to disclose your communications with Mr Lee Kuan Yew\nbetween November 2013 and 13 December 2013 in response to their enquiries\nand/or by making the false and misleading representation that Mr Lee Kuan Yew\nhad never instructed you to change his will dated 2 November 2012, such act\namounting to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n\n46.\n\nThe Complainant and the Respondent tendered an Agreed Statement of Facts as well,\nwhich is at Annex F, together with an Agreed Bundle of Documents. The Complainant\nand the Respondent also filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief, upon which they were\ncross-examined. We observe the following:\n(a)\n\nThe letters of 4 June 2015 and 22 June 2015 are dealt with together in a single\ncharge, without making any distinction between the different contents of the two\nletters and the different queries that were being addressed by the Respondent.\n\n(b)\n\nIn terms of the Respondent misleading LWL and LHY as executors, there are\ntwo separate averments, namely that the Respondent misled LWL and LHY by\nomitting to disclose and/or otherwise failing to disclose her communications with\nthe Testator which had taken place between November 2013 and 13 December\n2013 and/or making the false and misleading representation that the Testator\nhad never instructed her to change his will.\n\n14\n\n\f47.\n\nThe Respondent did not raise any objections as to duplicity in the charges. We are\nmindful that it is our function to formally investigate the matter and make a\ndetermination upon the facts, and the purpose of the charge is to give the Respondent\nnotice of the case to meet. Nonetheless, we are obliged to identify the specific\ningredients made out, and to make our determination only upon the facts that we have\nfound to be made out beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n48.\n\nWe identified to the Complainant and Respondent the steps that we were of the view\nwould be involved in making our determination on the Complainant’s Charge. These\nwere:\n(a)\n\nTo identify the queries that the Respondent was addressing in each of the two\nletters. The queries could be identified by evidence of what LHL and LWL asked\nthe Respondent, what the Respondent and those receiving the letters would\nhave understood the response as relating to, and what the two letters\nthemselves had set out as the queries being responded to.\n\n(b)\n\nFollowing from the findings on point (a) above, whether the responses in each of\nthe two letters were misleading, either by omission or expressly so.\n\n(c)\n\nFollowing from the findings on point (b) above, whether the responses were\nknowingly or deliberately misleading or misleading as a result of a lack of due\ncare and diligence.\n\n(d)\n\nFollowing from the findings in point (c) above, whether the Respondent’s conduct\nwas unbefitting that of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\nCourt, and if so whether a reprimand or penalty should be imposed or whether\nthe matter should be referred to the C3J.\n\n49.\n\nThe key documents in relation to this charge are:\n(a)\n\nThe email exchanges between the Respondent and the Testator dated 30\nNovember 2013, 12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent’s exchange of emails with LWL on 3 June 2013.\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent’s email to LHL, LWL and LHY on 4 June 2015, which has also\nbeen referred to as the 4 June 2015 letter.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Respondent’s email to LHL, LWL and LHY on 22 June 2015, which has also\nbeen referred to as the 22 June 2015 letter.\n\n50.\n\nThe Complainant and the Respondent have characterized the background to and the\ncontents of these documents quite differently. In approaching these differences, we\nhave given weight to the plain and simple meaning of the language used in the\n15\n\n\fdocuments. In considering what the emails addressed and were intended to address,\nwe construed the actual language used. To the extent that we considered evidence of\nwitnesses, we were mindful that the two parties who raised queries, LHL and LWL, did\nnot give evidence. The party who did give evidence was the Respondent who was the\nparty to whom the queries were addressed. In the final analysis, we had to consider\nthe plain meaning of the documents, with the background as context, and consider the\nRespondent’s explanation. In doing this, we were mindful that the burden of proof on\nthe Complainant was proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n51.\n\nThe communications between the Respondent and the Testator in November /\nDecember 2013 clearly show the following:\n(a)\n\nThe Testator contacted the Respondent on 29 November 2013 and discussed\nhis concerns that the Oxley Road property would be “de-gazetted” and wished to\nmake arrangements such that any increase in value upon such “de-gazetting”\nwould be shared by LHL with LWL and LHY, and not be retained by just LHL,\nwho was to be bequeathed the Oxley property.\n\n(c)\n\nIn the week before 12 December 2013, the Respondent and the Testator had a\nfurther discussion and discussed the shares that LHL, LWL and LHY would each\nget. In doing so, the Testator indicated his wish to give all three children equal\nshares, as opposed to his existing will where LWL received an extra share.\n\n(d)\n\nIn her email of 12 December 2013, the Respondent stated that she would\nprepare a codicil to effect the Testator’s wish, for the Testator’s signature that\nweek or when he was ready. The Respondent also stated that she had “some\nthoughts” on the Oxley Road property and would call the Testator later that day.\n\n(e)\n\nOn 13 December 2013, the Testator sent an email to the Respondent asking for\na further amendment to his will, regarding the bequest of two carpets to LHY.\n\n52.\n\nThe Testator passed away on 23 March 2015. The two emails that are the subject\nmatter of the Complainant’s Charge were sent by the Respondent on 4 June 2015 and\n22 June 2015.\n\nThe 4 June 2015 Email\n\n53.\n\nThere is no evidence from LHL or LWL as to what queries were being addressed in the\n4 June 2015 email. LWL’s email of 3 June 2015 gives some indication as she stated “It\nwould be useful to have emails, and not just a summary of evolution of the Oxley\nclause”. No reference at all is made to Will No. 7, executed on 17 December 2013. The\n16\n\n\fheading was “Papa’s Wills”. The Respondent’s email of 4 June 2015 is headed\n“Chronology of 6 Wills - my file records will focus on Oxley”. This does seem to be a\nfollow up on LWL’s 3 June 2015 email. It is noteworthy that no mention is made of any\nissue in relation to any change that equalizes the shares amongst the three children.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent’s 4 June 2015 email focused entirely on the evolution of the\ndistribution amongst the children and matters relating to the Oxley Road property in the\n1st to 6th Wills, which had been prepared by the Respondent. No mention at all is\nmade of the exchange of emails and the communications between the Respondent\nand the Testator in November / December 2013.\n\n55.\n\nWe first observe that there is no extraneous evidence as to the query made by LHL or\nLWL, except for the 3 June 2015 email. We find that there is nothing in the direct\nextraneous evidence that shows that there was any query that required reference to\nthe November / December 2013 communications between the Testator and the\nRespondent as part of the answer.\n\n56.\n\nWe now consider the Complainant’s second argument; which is that the Respondent\nand the recipients knew that the context of the queries related to the execution of Will\nNo. 7 and therefore the Respondent should have included reference to the November /\nDecember 2013 communications between the Testator and the Respondent as part of\nthe answer. We note that the Respondent had started her email with the words “[LHL]\nand [LWL] have requested me for file records of your father’s previous Wills, for\nnotes/emails/information on his instructions regarding Oxley.” The Complainant reads\nthis line with emphasis on the second part, that is, the Respondent should have given\ninformation relating to the Testator’s instructions regarding the Oxley Road property.\nThe Respondent urges us to construe the query with emphasis on the first part, and to\nread the query as being limited to the 1st to 6th Wills. The Respondent also urges us to\nread the word “instructions” as being limited to a direction by a client to carry out a\nparticular task.\n\n57.\n\nIn the absence of evidence from LHL and LWL as to what their queries were, we are\nconstrained to consider the Respondent’s evidence only, and weigh it against the\nbackground evidence and the actual words in the 4 June 2015 email. As candidly\nadmitted by Counsel for the Complainant, LHY did not have any personal knowledge in\nthis regard.\n\n17\n\n\f58.\n\nAn omission, whether wilful or negligent, that amounts to professional misconduct can\nonly arise if there is a clear breach of duty to furnish that information. In the present\ncase, we are unable to find any evidentiary basis for a query that would clearly have\nrequired a response containing reference to the November / December 2013\ncommunications. We agree with the Respondent that the reference to instructions\nrelation to the Oxley Road property are circumscribed by the earlier reference to the 1 st\nto 6th Wills. This is made clear by the fact that the earlier 6 wills are identified and\ncopies were given.\n\n59.\n\nWe wish to point out that the question before us is not whether the Respondent should\nhave given details of the November / December 2013 communications in the 4 June\n2015 letter, but whether there was any query that made her failure to do so misleading.\nWe do not find sufficient evidence, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was\nany query that required a reference to the November / December 2013\ncommunications.\n\n60.\n\nThe Complainant’s alternative argument was that the great degree of detail given by\nthe Respondent would have led the recipients to conclude that all information was\ngiven. Quite apart from the absence of evidence in this regard, we are obliged to\nconsider the issue objectively and not what the recipients subjectively hoped or\nexpected to be informed about.\n\n61.\n\nSince there is no clear query established, we find that the issues relating to whether\nthe answer was misleading, and the subsequent considerations, do not arise in relation\nto the 4 June 2015 email. For completeness, we do not find that the Complainant’s\nCharge in relation to the Respondent’s 4 June 2015 email is made out on the facts.\n\nThe 22 June 2015 Email\n\n62.\n\nWe now consider the 22 June 2015 email. Again, there is a no evidence from LHL and\nLWL on the queries that they raised. However, unlike the 4 June 2015 email, the 22\nJune 2015 email itself contained clear statements as to what queries were being\nraised. The queries being addressed were:\n(a)\n\nA request for the draft will of 19 August 2011; and\n\n(b)\n\nThe background which led to the signing of Will No. 7.\n\n18\n\n\f63.\n\nGiven that Will No. 7 was a return to the will of 20 August 2011 (i.e., the 1st Will) and\nthat both the 1st Will and Will No. 7 were based on the 19 August 2011 draft, it was\nclear that the subject matter being addressed was Will No. 7. This is reinforced by the\nsecond query, requesting the background which led to the signing of Will No. 7.\n\n64.\n\nThe Complainant submitted that this was clearly a request for information relating to\nthe circumstances leading up to the execution of Will No. 7. We agree. Indeed, as the\nqueries were quite obviously a follow-up to the answers received on 4 June 2015, the\nlogical inference was that LHL and LWL were seeking information specifically in\nrelation to Will No. 7, in relation to which the Respondent had given no information in\nher earlier 4 June 2015 email. The query therefore concerns the circumstances leading\nup to the execution of Will No. 7.\n\n65.\n\nWe move on to consider the second issue, which is whether the Respondent’s\nanswers were misleading. We note that there was no reference at all to the November\n/ December 2013 communications with the Testator. In this regard, we note that that\nthe distribution of shares and issues relating to the Oxley Road property were changes\nthat were discussed in the November / December 2013 communications and were\nmatters that were addressed and changed in Will No. 7. We also note that although\nthese matters were discussed between the Respondent and the Testator, the\nRespondent stated in the email that “After your father signed Will no. 6 dated 2nd\nNovember 2012, he did not instruct me to change his Will. I first learnt about Will no. 7\nvia email from Fern and Lin Hoe.”\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent’s explanation was that her statement was true and complete as she\nwas not involved at all in the preparation or execution of Will No. 7, and that it would be\ninappropriate and irresponsible for her to guess or speculate as to the Testator’s\nreasons for the treatment of the Oxley Road property in Will No. 7. The Respondent\nsubmits that she had made it clear that she was not involved in Will No. 7. The\nRespondent submits further that the November / December 2013 communications\nwere not material to the background to the signing of Will No. 7 and did not contain any\ninstructions from the Testator about Will No. 7. The Respondent characterizes the\nNovember / December 2013 communications as relating to the possibility of preparing\na codicil to the 6th Will, but her understanding was that the Testator was still in the\n\n19\n\n\fmidst of considering or compiling possible amendments to include or provide for in the\nproposed codicil.\n\n67.\n\nWe do not agree with the Respondent’s submissions. The issues are quite simple. The\nfirst question is whether the November / December 2013 communications should have\nbeen disclosed in response to a query on the background to the signing of Will No. 7.\nThe second question is whether the omission to disclose made the response\nmisleading. The third question is whether it was true that the Respondent did not\nreceive any instructions to change the Testator’s Will.\n\n68.\n\nIt was clear that the live issue to LHL and LWL was the Testator’s mindset in terms of\nhis wishes in relation to the distribution of the Oxley Road property. The failure to\ndisclose the November / December 2013 communications, coupled with the statement\nthat the Testator did not instruct the Respondent to change his Will gave the clear and\nunequivocal impression that the Respondent had no knowledge as to how Will No. 7\ncame about. On the face of the 30 November 2013 and 12 December 2013 emails, it\nwas clear that the Respondent knew that the Testator wished to equalize the shares of\nhis childrenn and to address matters relating to the Oxley Road property. Unlike the 4\nJune 2015 email, the Respondent did not circumscribe her answers to any particular\nseries of wills or time periods. We find that the nub of the queries by LHL and LWL was\nto find out how Will No. 7 came about, and not the formalities of its execution. It is clear\nthat the Respondent knew that the Testator wanted to change the 6th Will and that the\nchanges related to the shares amongst the children in the Oxley Road property.\n\n69.\n\nWe observe that the query was for the background which led to the signing of Will No.\n7. These words clearly suggest that the answer given would be expansive and address\nthe issues in the mind of the querists.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent argues that her use of the word “instruct”, in stating that the Testator\ndid not instruct her to change the Will, was not false. The basis for this argument was\nthat there were no instructions, but only discussions, as the Respondent was not\nexpressly told to make any changes. The Complainant argues that the word “instruct”\nshould be given its dictionary meaning i.e. “To convey information as a client to an\nattorney” and “the facts and details relating to a case given by a client to his or her\n20\n\n\fsolicitor”. We are of the view that the word “instruct” should be given a meaning that\nthe parties reading the 22 June 2015 email would have understood it to mean. We\naccept the submission made by the Complainant. On that basis we find the statement\nthat the Testator did not instruct the Respondent to change his Will to be untrue. The\ninstructions may not have been finalized, but it is clear that the Respondent received\ninstructions relating to the changes that were shortly made.\n\n71.\n\nThe Complainant had further argued that instructions were in fact actually finalized for\nthe Respondent to change the 6th Will. This is based on the wording of the\nRespondent’s email of 12 December 2013 to the Testator which states “We discussed\nlast week that you would now like to sign a Codicil to change this, and to give Ling\nequal shares with Loong and Yang out of the total estate. I will prepare the codicil for\nyou to sign this week, or when you are ready.”\n\n72.\n\nThe Complainant also points to the change in caption of the emails from “your question\non the properties in your name” in the email of 30 November 2013 to “Codicil to\nequalize Ling”\n\nin the Respondent’s email of\n\n12 December\n\n2013 as an\n\nacknowledgement by the Respondent that she had received instructions to change the\n6th Will.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent disagreed with the suggestion that there were final instructions from\nthe Testator in this regard. Her explanation was that she had actually sent the email of\n12 December 2013 to the Testator to ask whether that was what he really wanted.\n\n74.\n\nHer evidence was that it was normal for her to have many discussions with the\nTestator over an issue with him changing his mind several times before coming to a\nconclusion, hence she assumed this to be part of that process when asked to recall the\ncircumstances surrounding what led her to send the Testator the email of 12\nDecember 2013.\n\n75.\n\nGiven her view that the emails (from 30 November 2013 to 13 December 2013) did not\ncontain any final instructions, her position was therefore that the statement in her 22\n\n21\n\n\fJune 2015 email that she did not receive any instructions to change the 6th Will was not\nfalse or misleading.\n\n76. We find that the Respondent’s omission to disclose the emails of 30 November 2013\nand 12 December 2013 in her email of 22 June 2015 is misleading. We further find that\nher statement in that same email that she did not receive any instructions from the\nTestator to change his Will is false. We now move on to the next stage of the inquiry,\nwhether the responses were knowingly or deliberately misleading or misleading as a\nresult of a lack of due care and diligence.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent’s subjective view that the omission of the November / December\n2013 communications from her 22 June 2015 email did not render it misleading does\nnot accord with the objective analysis of what the November / December 2013\ncommunications amounted to.\n\n78.\n\nThere was no direct evidence that the Respondent knowingly or deliberately misled the\nrecipients of the 22 June 2015 email. There was no evidence or even suggestion that\nshe chose to avoid disclosure for personal or any partisan purposes. The Complainant\nsuggested that the Respondent did not disclose her November / December 2013\ncommunications with the Testator out of embarrassment that she had been tardy in\ncarrying out his instructions. There was no evidence to support this suggestion. We\nbriefly considered the possibility that the Respondent was deliberately choosing to\ndistance herself from Will No. 7, and the issues amongst the Testator’s children in\nrelation to it. There is some evidence that LWL had reached out to the Respondent in\nrelation to her unhappiness in having her share reduced. However, this was not put to\nthe Respondent. Therefore, on the evidence before us, we do not find proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the Respondent knowingly or deliberately misled LHY and LWL\nor that she intentionally made a false statement.\n\n79.\n\nNevertheless, the Respondent was communicating with the Testator’s beneficiaries on\nmatters that were obviously important to them. The Respondent was aware that LWL\nhad expressed some unhappiness in relation to Will No. 7 in terms of the change to her\nshare. Having chosen to respond to the queries, it was incumbent upon the\nRespondent to be complete and accurate in her response. We find that had the\n22\n\n\fRespondent exercised due care and diligence, she ought to have disclosed the\nNovember / December 2013 communications in the 22 June 2015 email and ought not\nhave stated that she had received no instructions to change the Testator’s Will.\n\n80.\n\nWe now consider the appropriate determination. We expressly asked Counsel for the\nComplainant to address us on the issue of harm caused by the Respondent’s breach\nof duty. We were referred to paragraph 30 of the LHY’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief,\nwherein he stated that the Respondent’s failure to disclose the fact that the Testator\nhad communicated his wishes to give his children equal shares and her failure to\ndisclose the context in which the Testator decided to include the demolition clause in\nWill No. 7 “caused unnecessary doubt and confusion about what prompted the\n[Testator] to change his 2 November 2012 Will”. Counsel for the Complainant\nconfirmed that this was the only harm alleged.\n\n81.\n\nGiven the absence of any further background or information, we assessed the harm as\nlow. We were mindful that the 22 June 2015 email was in response to a second query\nfor information and was quite specific. Accordingly, we find that the culpability was low\nto medium.\n\n82.\n\nIn the premises, we determine pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, that while no\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83, the\nRespondent should be ordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed in relation to the Respondent’s 22 June 2015 email. Further, we\nare of the view that a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct\ncommitted is a penalty of $8,000. For completeness, we set out an amended charge,\nthat encapsulates our findings, which is as follows:\nYou, Mdm Kwa Kim Li, are charged that, by way of your letter 22 June 2015, you\nmisled the Executors of the Estate of your former client Mr Lee Kuan Yew,\nnamely Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by omitting to disclose your\ncommunications with Mr Lee Kuan Yew between November 2013 and 13\nDecember 2013 in response to their enquiries and by making the false and\nmisleading representation that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had never instructed you to\nchange his will dated 2 November 2012, such act amounting to misconduct\n\n23\n\n\funbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court within\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n\n83.\n\nWe now address the question of costs. Parties made written submissions on costs on\n3 March 2023. The Complainant’s submissions sought $60,000 in costs at [1] of his\ncost submissions but sought a different figure of $15,000 in [5] of his costs\nsubmissions. Disbursements were sought in the sum of $9.182.29. Pursuant to section\n93(2) read with section 93(1)(b)(i) of the LPA, we order that the Respondent should\npay the Complainant’s costs in the sum of $12,000 and disbursements in the sum of\n$9,182.29.\n\n84.\n\nWe would like to thank Counsel for their assistance in addressing our questions and\nconcerns, in the course of submissions.\nDated this 5th day of May 2023\n\n___________________________\n\n__________________________\n\nNarayanan Sreenivasan SC\n\nTan Kheng Ann Alvin\n\nPresident\n\nMember\n\n24\n\n\f\fCe\nIN THE MATTER OF KWA KIM LI\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n(CHAPTER 161)\n\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n.

Mr Lee’s initial will was prepared\n\nby his wife, Ms Kwa Geok Choo,\n\nand was signed by Mr Lee and dated 7 December 1995.\nLee\n\ninstructed the Respondent\n\nto draft and\n\nengross\n\nThereafter, Mr\n\nhis next six wills\n\nbetween August 2011 and November 2012, each of which was signed by\n\nMr Lee and dated as follows:\na.\n\n20 August 2011 (\"First Will’),\n\n\fb.\n\n21 December 2011 (‘Second Will’);\n\nc\n\n6 September 2012 (\"Third Will’),\n\nd\n\n20 September 2012 (“Fourth Will’);\n\ne.\n\n4 October 2012 (“Fifth Will’); and\n\nf.\n\n2 November 2012 (\"Sixth Will’).\n\n(collectively referred to as Mr Lee's “six wills”)\n\nIn or around end-November 2013, Mr Lee asked the Respondent to draft\nanother will to effect further amendments to his Sixth Will.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 November 2013, the Respondent sent Mr Lee an email to record the\ncontents of her discussion with Mr Lee the previous evening, and to advise\n\nMr Lee on the amendments that Mr Lee was intending to make to his last\nwill (‘30 Nov\n\nEmail”). Specifically, the email recorded that Mr Lee had\n\nasked the Respondent to re-cap the contents of his Sixth Will. Mr Lee had\n\nalso raised the possibility that his family home at 38 Oxley Road (“Oxley”)\nmight be “de-gazetted” after his passing and sought the Respondent's\nadvice on the legal implications if that were to happen.\n\n15,\n\nOn\n\n12 December\n\n2013,\n\nthe Respondent\n\nsent another email to Mr Lee\n\nsetting out further information regarding his Sixth Will and recorded the\ncontents of a discussion with Mr Lee the previous week (\"12 Dec Email’).\n\nIn her email, the Respondent said:\n\n“Under your present will dated 2 Nov 2012, [LWL] has been given\n\n1 share more than [LHL] and [LH], out of your total estate. This is\n\n\fbecause you reasoned that [LWL] does not have double income like\nher brothers.\nWe discussed last week that you would now like to sign a Codicil to\nchange this, and to give {LWL] equal shares with [LHL] and [LHY]\n\nout of the total estate.\n! will prepare the codicil for you to sign this week, or when you are\nready.\n\nRegarding the Oxley property, | have some thoughts and will call\nyou later today.”\n\n16.\n\nOn 13 December 2013, Mr Lee replied to the Respondent to request an\nadditional amendment\n\nto his will to give two carpets to LHY\n\n(“13 Dec\n\nEmail\"). The 13 December 2013 email stated:\n\n“Another amendment is a cadicif to specify that two carpets: a silk\none on the wall over my PV and another a larger woollen one on\n\nthe wall above the bed in my bedroom, fo go to [LHY].”\n17.\n\nThe 30 Nov Email,\n\n12 Dec Email and the 13 Dec Email are collectively\n\nreferred to as the “Emails”.\n\nMr Lee thereafter finally determined to revert to the terms of his First Will,\nand he accordingly executed his last will and testament on 17 December\n2013 (\"Last Will’), on terms which substantially mirrored the contents of\nhis First Wil. In his Last Will, Mr Lee named LHY and LW/ as the executors\nand trustees of his estate.\n\n\fMr Lee passed away on 23 March 2015. The Executors stepped into Mr\n\nLee’s shoes and represented his Estate thereafter.\n\n20.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, LWL wrote to the Respondent to request information\nabout Mr Lee’s wills.\n\n21.\n\nOn 4 June 2015, in response the request from LWL (and a purportedly\nsimilar request from LHL) for the Respondent's file records of copies of Mr\nLee's previous Wills and for any notes, information and emails relating to\nor connected with Mr Lee's instructions regarding his Oxley property, the\nRespondent issued a letter to the Executors and LHL titled “Chronology of\n6 Wills — my file records with focus on Oxley’ {the “4 June Letter’).\n\n22.\n\nIn the 4 June Letter, the Respondent set out a comprehensive account of\nMr\n\nLee’s\n\nsix\n\nwills\n\nand\n\nher\n\ndiscussions\n\nwith\n\nMr\n\nLee\n\nregarding\n\nhis\n\ntestamentary wishes based on her file records.\n\n23.\n\nThe summary included Mr Lee's instructions in respect of the preparation\nof his\n\nsix wills\n\nand\n\nvarious\n\ninstructions and wishes,\n\ndrafts\n\nof the\n\nsame,\n\nthe\n\nchanges\n\nto\n\nhis\n\nand correspondence with him in relation to the\n\nOxiey property. The Respondent also attached copies of all six wills and\nher email correspondence with Mr Lee.\n\n24.\n\nHowever, the Respondent omitted to mention the fact that and/or failed to\ndisclose the Emails which would show that in or around 30 November 2013,\n\n\fMr Lee had given the Respondent instructions to amend the terms of his\nSixth Will by way of another will. In particular, the Respondent did not reveal\nthat Mr Lee had specifically sought the Respondent's advice in November\n2013\n\non what\n\nwas\n\nto be done with Oxley,\n\nnor did she disclose to the\n\nExecutors her Emails with Mr Lee on this issue.\n\n25.\n\nIt would\n\nhave\n\nbeen\n\nevident to the Respondent\n\nthat the Emails and her\n\ncommunications with Mr Lee in November to December 2013 were relevant\nto the inquiries made by LWL and LHL as:\n\na\n\nThe Respondent issued the 4 June Letter in response to the specific\nrequests from LWL and LHL for “notes/emails/information on his\ninstructions to {the Respondent] regarding Oxley’. The Emails are\nself-evidently relevant and material to the requests made to the\nRespondent.\n\nb.\n\nMr Lee had passed away in March 2015, less than 3 months before\nthe 4 June Letter was sent out. There was significant public interest\nand nation-wide discussion over the mainstream media and social\nmedia over whether Oxley should be gazetted and preserved as a\nheritage site or demolished in honour of Mr Lee’s wishes. The said\nEmails recorded the /ast time the Respondent had communicated\n\nwith Mr Lee in respect of Mr Lee’s testamentary intentions for Oxley,\nand\n\nimmediately\n\ncorrespondences\n\npreceded\nwere\n\nthe signing of his Last Will. These\n\ntherefore\n\ncritical\n\nto\n\nunderstanding\n\nthe\n\n\fcontext of Mr Lee's wishes and his underlying concerns regarding\nOxley, and in particular, the fact that Mr Lee had reiterated his\ntestamentary intention to ultimately have his family home at Oxley\ndemolished. Given Mr Lee’s standing as the former Prime Minister\n\nand\n\nfounding\n\nfather\n\nof modern\n\nSingapore\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nhistorical\n\nsignificance of Oxley, the Respondent's records of her discussions\nwith Mr Lee were both of personal importance to him and potentially\nof national importance.\n\nThe Respondent clearly understood the scope and significance of\nthe requests made by LWL and LHL. In her 4 June Letter, she set\nout\n\na\n\ncomprehensive\n\nrecord\n\nof\n\nher\n\ndiscussions\n\nand\n\ncorrespondence with Mr Lee. The Respondent's account included\nher previous discussions with Mr Lee regarding Oxley, whether or\nnot it directly related to any of Mr Lee's wills or resulted in any\nchanges to any of Mr Lee’s witls.\ncancelled\n\nversions\n\nShe had even put together\n\nof his previous wills to reconstruct\n\nall the\n\nrelevant events.\n\n26.\n\nOn\n\n22\n\nJune\n\nExecutors\n\nand\n\n2015,\nLHL\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nin response\n\nthen\n\nsent\n\na further\n\nto further queries\n\nfrom\n\nletter to the\nLWL\n\nand\n\nLHL\n\nregarding the signing of the Last Will (the “22 June Letter’). In her email,\nthe Respondent explained\n\n“Further to my note to you dated 4 June 2015, [LHL] has asked me:\n1}\n\nFor a copy of draft Will dated 19” August 2011;\n\n\f2)\n\nAbout\n\nthe background\n\nwhich\n\nfed to the signing\n\nfather’s last Will dated 17 December 2013\n\n27.\n\nIt would\n\nof your\n\n(\"Will no. 7°)\"\n\nsimilarly have been evident to the Respondent that Mr Lee's\n\ninstructions to her te amend the contents of his Sixth Will and Mr Lee’s\nrequest for her advice regarding Oxley (all of which were captured in the\nEmails between the Respondent and Mr Lee which were exchanged up to\n\n4 days before he signed his Last Will), would have been relevant to these\nspecific\n\nrequests\n\nfor\n\ninformation,\n\nand\n\nin light of the\n\nfacts\n\nset out\n\nin\n\nparagraph 25 above. However, the Respondent omitted to disclose to the\n\nExecutors the fact of her communications with Mr Lee regarding his will\nand Oxley in November to December 2013, or the existence of the Emails\n\nbetween her and Mr Lee.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent was also able te disclose another chain of emails dated\n46 December 2013 to 3 January 2014 relating to the execution of Mr Lee’s\nLast Will, ie. shortly after the Emails were\ndisclose copies\n\nof the Emails or make\n\nsent.\n\nmention\n\nHowever,\n\nshe\n\ndid not\n\nof the communications\n\nbetween her and Mr Lee that were referenced in the Emails.\n\n29.\n\nInstead,\n\nin her 22 June\n\nLetter,\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nmisrepresented\n\nto the\n\nExecutors in specific and unambiguous language that \"fajfter [Mr Lee Kuan\nYew] signed Will no. 6 dated 2°\" November 2012, he did not instruct [the\nRespondent] to change his Wilf’.\n\n\f11\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent's statement was false and/or misleading, as the Emails\ndemonstrate that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had in fact instructed the Respondent\nto change\n\nhis Sixth Will in his discussions with her in November\n\nto\n\nDecember 2013. His instructions and those discussions were recorded or\nreferenced in the Emails.\n\n31\n\nAfter the 4 June\n\nLetter and the 22 June\n\nLetter, the Respondent\n\ndid not\n\nattempt to correct her misrepresentation that Mr Lee had not instructed her\nto change his will after his Sixth Will was executed or notify the Executors\nabout the existence or contents of the Emails.\n\n32.\n\nThereafter, the Executors, through their then solicitors, Rajah & Tann LLP,\nmade repeated requests to the Respondent for copies of all her documents\n\nand records on file in respect to Mr Lee’s wills. In or around March 2019, in\nresponse to the Executors’ requests, the Respondent\n\nher records\n\nand documents to the Executors,\n\nprovided copies of\n\nincluding copies of the\n\nEmails. It was only then that the Executors discovered the existence of the\nEmails and learned that the Respondent had made false and/or misleading\n\nstatements in her 4 June Letter and 22 June Letter. The Respondent did\nnot disclose the existence of or copies of the Emails or make any attempt\nto correct the false and/or misleading statements in her 4 June Letter and\n22 June Letter at any time prior to March 2019.\n\n33,\n\nThe Respondent's accounts in the 4 June Letter and the 22 June Letter\nwould have given the Executors the impression that Mr Lee had never\n\n\fexpressed to her his intention to change the terms of his Sixth Will or to\ndivide his estate equally between his children. This caused unnecessary\ndoubt and confusion about whether Mr Lee had intended to change his\nSixth Will, and what his concerns were in respect of Oxley prior to executing\n\nhis Last Will.\n\nThe Respondent omissions and misrepresentation to the Executors were\nmade knowingly and deliberately, or in the alternative, as a result of lack of\ncare and diligence on her part. The Respondent's actions, in knowingly and\ndeliberately making false and misleading statements and/or omitting to\nmention\n\nor failing to disclose\n\ninformation\n\nreceived from one of the Executors, would\n\nin response\n\nto the\n\ninquiries\n\nbe in breach of her general\n\nduties of honesty, competence, due care and diligence under Rule 2{2) of\nthe PCR and would accordingly amount to a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of\nthe LPA.\n\n35.\n\nEven\n\nif the\n\nRespondent\n\nmade\n\nfalse and\n\nmisleading\n\nstatements\n\nto the\n\nExecutors and/or had omitted disclosing information and documents\n\nin\n\nresponse to the Executors' specific inquiries unintentionally, be it as a result\nof carelessness,\n\nnegligence\n\nand\n\nlack of due\n\ncare and\n\ndiligence,\n\nher\n\nconduct feli short of the standards of integrity, probity and trustworthiness\n\nexpected\n\nof a solicitor who\n\nfound\n\nherself in the critical context\n\nand\n\ncircumstance that the Respondent was in, and would accordingly amount\n\nto a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n\fCHARGES\n36.\n\nAccordingly, the Complainant formulates the following charge against the\nRespondent.\n\nCHARGE\n\n37.\n\nYou, Mdm Kwa Kim Li, are charged that, by way of your letters dated 4\nJune and 22 June 2015, you misled the Executors of the Estate of your\nformer client Mr Lee Kuan Yew, namely Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, by omitting and/or otherwise failing to disclose your communications\nwith Mr Lee Kuan Yew between November 2013 to 13 December 2013 in\nresponse to their enquiries and/or by making the false and misleading\nrepresentation that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had never instructed you to change\nhis will dated\n\n2 November\n\n2012,\n\nsuch\n\nact amounting\n\nto misconduct\n\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n2009 Rev Ed).\n\nDated this 25\" day of July 2022\n\n«2| idence\na\n\n~\n\nCounsel for the Complainant\nProvidence Law Asia LLC\n\n\f\fDT/19/2022\n\nIN THE MATTER OF KWA KIM LI\nAN ADVOCATE AND SOLICITOR\nAND\n\nIN THE MATTER OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION ACT\n(CAP 161, 2009 REV ED)\n\nSTATEMENT OF DEFENCE\n(TO STATEMENT OF CASE OF THE COMPLAINANT)\n\nSolicitors for the Respondent\n\nMr Cavinder Bull SC\n\nMs Gerui Lim\nMs Elisabeth Liang\nDrew & Napier LLC\n10 Collyer Quay\n#10-01 Ocean Financia!

Where the Respondent had received further\nqueries from LHL and LWL about the “background which led to the signing\nof [LKY’s] last Will dated 17 December 2013\", the Respondent's letter dated\n22 June 2015 had accurately and truthfully conveyed the fact that any\ninstructions given by LKY for the preparation of the Seventh Will, and his\nexecution of the Seventh Will, had occurred without the Respondent's\ninvolvement.\n\nThis was evident from two email chains enclosed to the\n\nRespondent's 22 June 2015 letter, namely:\n\n(a)\n\nthe emails from LSF pleaded at paragraphs 12 to 16 of the SOD;\n\n(b)\n\nan email dated 3 January 2014 from Mdm\n\nWong\n\ntrailing emails) which inter alia: {i) recorded\n\nthat the Respondent\n\nhad\n\nSeventh\n\nmerely\n\nbeen\n\nprovided\n\ncopies\n\nof the\n\nLin Hoe (with\n\nWill and\n\na\n\nsubsequent codicil after they were executed “for her record\", while\nthe originals were kept in LKY's office.

The Respondent's letter dated 22\nJune 2015 enclosed the email chains referred to at paragraph 28 of the\n\n\f11\n\nSOC because they were relevant to communicating the matters pleaded at\n\nparagraph 29 of the SOD above.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent's\n\nletter dated 22 June 2015 did not enclose the emails\n\ndated 30 November 2013,\n\n12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013.\n\nThese were not relevant or material to the Respondent's responses in her\n\nletter dated 22 June 2015, which only addressed the two queries pleaded\nat paragraph 26 of the SOC.\n\nWhen the Respondent prepared her letter\n\ndated 22 June 2015, she also did not recall her emails with LKY dated 30\nNovember 2013,\n\n12 December 2013 and 13 December 2013, which had\n\nnot registered with her as having any particular significance and/or material\nimport because they had never led to any decision or instructions by LKY\nfor the Respondent to change his Sixth Will, nor any draft instrument being\nprepared by the Respondent.

She was admitted to the roll of advocates\nand solicitors on 16 January 1980.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is and was at the material times the Managing Partner of\nLee & Lee (“the Firm”).\n\n3.\n\nThe original Complainants, Ms Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang\n(“LWL” and “LHY” respectively), are the sole Executors and Trustees of the\nEstate of Mr Lee Kuan Yew (the “Executors”). LHY, LWL and Mr Lee Hsien\nLoong (“LHL”), are siblings and the children of Mr Lee Kuan Yew (“Mr\nLee”).\n\n4.\n\nPrior to his death, Mr Lee executed a total of eight wills. The Respondent\nwas Mr Lee’s solicitor who drafted and engrossed six of his wills between\nAugust 2011 and November 2012, each of which was signed by Mr Lee\nand dated as follows:\na.\n\n20 August 2011;\n\nb.\n\n21 December 2011;\n\nc.\n\n6 September 2012;\n\nd.\n\n20 September 2012;\n\ne.\n\n4 October 2012; and\n\nf.\n\n2 November 2012 (“2 November 2012 Will”).\n\n(collectively referred to as Mr Lee’s “Six Wills”)\n\n2\n\n\f5.\n\nIn or around end-November 2013 there were discussions between Mr Lee\nand the Respondent on whether he wished to draft a new will and if so,\nwhat might be included in such a further will.\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 November 2013, the Respondent sent Mr Lee an email to record the\ncontents of an oral discussion which had taken place between her and Mr\nLee the previous night (“30 November Email”). Amongst other things, the\nemail recorded that Mr Lee had asked the Respondent to re-cap the\ncontents of his 2 November 2012 Will, and that Mr Lee had raised the\npossibility that his family home at 38 Oxley Road (“Oxley Property”) might\nbe “de-gazetted” after his passing and sought the Respondent’s advice on\nthe legal implications if that were to happen. The Respondent concluded\nthe email by asking Mr Lee to “Please let [her] know [his] thoughts, and\n[she] can make the appropriate changes to the Will”.\n\n7.\n\nOn 12 December 2013, the Respondent sent an email to Mr Lee (“12\nDecember Email”) stating:\n\n“Under your present will dated 2 Nov 2012, [LWL] has been given\n1 share more than [LHL] and [LHY], out of your total estate. This is\nbecause you reasoned that [LWL] does not have double income like\nher brothers.\nWe discussed last week that you would now like to sign a Codicil to\nchange this, and to give [LWL] equal shares with [LHL] and [LHY]\nout of the total estate.\n\n3\n\n\fI will prepare the codicil for you to sign this week, or when you are\nready.\nRegarding the Oxley property, I have some thoughts and will call\nyou later today.”\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 December 2013, Mr Lee sent an email to the Respondent (“13\nDecember Email”) stating:\n\n“Another amendment is a codicil to specify that two carpets: a silk\none on the wall over my PV and another a larger woollen one on\nthe wall above the bed in my bedroom, to go to [LHY].”\n9.\n\nThe 30 November Email, 12 December Email and the 13 December Email\nare collectively referred to as the “Emails”.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent subsequently departed from Singapore to London on\nabout 15 December 2013. The Respondent did not prepare any codicil for\nMr Lee.\n\n11.\n\nWhile the Respondent was overseas, Mr Lee executed his last will and\ntestament dated 17 December 2013 (“Last Will”). In his Last Will, Mr Lee\nnamed LHY and LWL as the only executors and trustees of his estate. LHL\nwas not named as an executor and trustee of Mr Lee’s estate.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent was informed by Mrs Lee Suet Fern (“LSF”) that Mr Lee\nhad executed the Last Will. LSF sent the Respondent an email dated 17\nDecember 2013 at around 1.16pm. The email stated, inter alia, “just a quick\n\n4\n\n\fnote to say this has been dealt with already”. Embedded in LSF’s email\ndated 17 December 2013 was an earlier email dated 16 December 2013\nsent from LSF to Mr Lee at around 7.08pm. LSF’s 16 December 2013 email\nstated:\n“Dear Pa Pa\nThis was the original agreed Will which ensures that all 3 children\nreceive equal shares, taking into account the relative valuations (as\nat the date of demise) of the properties each receives.\nKim Li\nGrateful if you could please engross.\nKind regards\nFern”\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent emailed LSF on 17 December 2013 at around 2.59pm.\nHer email stated that she did not seem to have received LSF’s email dated\n16 December 2013. The Respondent also asked whether LSF’s email\ndated 17 December 2013 meant that “[Mr Lee] has signed a new will\nyesterday, in which case the former will which is on my record, is revoked?\nIf so, I will update my file record.”\n\n14.\n\nLSF replied to the Respondent by an email dated 17 December 2013 sent\nat around 3.10pm. LSF stated, “Yes, he has signed already. In fact this is\ngoing back to his 2011 will so it supercedes all. He read it extremely\ncarefully before signing.”\n\n5\n\n\f15.\n\nMr Lee passed away on 23 March 2015.\n\n16.\n\nOn 3 June 2015, LWL wrote to the Respondent to request information\nabout Mr Lee’s wills.\n\n17.\n\nOn 4 June 2015, in response to LWL’s request and a separate request from\nLHL for information focusing on LKY’s intentions with regard to the Oxley\nProperty, the Respondent issued a letter to the Executors and LHL titled\n“Chronology of 6 Wills – my file records with focus on Oxley” (the “4 June\nLetter”) with enclosures.\n\n18.\n\nThe 4 June Letter stated, amongst other things:\n“To:\nHsien Loong, Wei Ling, and Hsien Yang\n4 June 2015.\nLoong and Ling have requested me for file records of your father's\nprevious Wills, for notes/emails/information on his instructions to me\nregarding Oxley.\nI thought best to write this note addressed to the 3 of you as the only\nbeneficiaries of his Estate.\nYour father signed 6 Wills with me over the period of August 2011 to\nNovember 2012. (2 in 2011, and 4 in 2012).\nHe instructed me several times, by phone, by email and personally at\nhis office typically in the evenings before his Chinese class.\nI attach file copies of the 6 cancelled Wills, numbered 1 to 6 for ease.\nBackground why your father signed 6 Wills over 15 months.\nRegarding the 6 Wills which your father signed over August 2011 to\nNovember 2012, I would estimate that I prepared at least 15 drafts for\nhis review over that period, to take into account the many changes he\nwanted to make. There were also one or two occasions that I went to\nhis office for signing after he approved the draft Will, but he had second\nthoughts, did not sign the Will and asked for further changes. I am\ntelling you these details for you to know that your father spent much\ntime and thought on his 6 Wills.\n\n6\n\n\fMuch of the discussions and changes revolved around:\n1) Where Ling is to stay - at Oxley or in his other properties, or at Ho\nChing's Belle Vue apartment, whether or not to give Ling a life interest\nin Oxley.\n2) The division of the Estate - although he was aware that it was\nintended/agreed that he would divide his entire Estate into 3 equal\nshares for the 3 children, he asked me to prepare Wills no. 3 and 6\nwhere the Estate was to be divided unequally. He said he would talk to\nthe children to inform them why he wanted to divide the Estate\nunequally.\n3) Oxley - how to give the children least problem after he is gone.\nYou have asked me to focus on Oxley. I set out a brief 3 point\nsummary regarding the Oxley Clauses in the 6 Wills:\n…\nI now summarise your father’s Wills based on my file records\nchronologically, focusing again on Oxley…”\n19.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the Respondent sent a further letter to LWL, LHY and\nLHL in response to further queries from LWL and LHL regarding the signing\nof the Last Will (the “22 June Letter”). The letter stated:\n“Dear Hsien Loong, Wei Ling and Hsien Yang,\nFurther to my note to you dated 4 June 2015, [LHL] has asked me:\n1) For a copy of draft Will dated 19th August 2011;\n2) About the background which led to the signing of your father’s last\nWill dated 17 December 2013 (“Will no. 7”)\nWei Ling also asked me the same question 2 in May 2014.\nI thought it best to write to all of you, so that everyone has the same\nreply from me.\nAfter your father signed Will no. 6 dated 2nd November 2012, he did\nnot instruct me to change his Will.\nI first learnt about Will no. 7 via email from Fern and Lin Hoe.”\n\n7\n\n\f20.\n\nThe 22 June Letter enclosed copies of emails dated 16 December 2013 to\n3 January 2014 relating to the execution of Mr Lee’s Last Will.\n\n21.\n\nOn 6 October 2015, the Executors obtained a grant of probate in respect\nof Mr Lee’s estate.\n\n22.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, the Executors, through their then solicitors, Rajah &\nTann LLP, asked the Respondent for copies of all her documents and\nrecords on file in respect to Mr Lee’s wills. In or around 8 March 2019, in\nresponse to the Executors’ requests, the Respondent provided copies of\nher records and documents to the Executors, including copies of the\nEmails. The Emails had not been enclosed to the 4 June or 22 June Letters.\n\n23.\n\nOn 5 September 2019, the Executors filed a complaint against the\nRespondent (“Complaint”). The Complaint comprised four distinct heads\nof complaint. The fourth head of complaint, namely that the Respondent\nhad given the Executors false and misleading information in her 4 June and\n22 June Letters, is the subject of the present charge.\n\nDated this 31st day of January 2023\n\n8\n\n\f","timestamp":"2024-02-12T04:00:28+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-feb-2024/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Teo Eng Thye (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-teo-eng-thye-respondent-advocate-solicitor\">In the Matter of Teo Eng Thye (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Ms Goh Yng Yng Karen (<strong>the Complainant</strong>), who was the daughter of the late Mdm Liew Khoon Fong (<strong>Mdm Liew</strong>) and executrix of Mdm Liew’s will.</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-809343780\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>The complaint arose from two Powers of Attorney (<strong>POA</strong>) dated 20 November 2017. POA 6414 was related to the sale of 107 Namly Avenue (<strong>Namly Property</strong>), while POA 6417 was related to the purchase of a condominium unit (<strong>Condominium Unit</strong>). At the material time, Mdm Liew was 87 years old.</p>\n<p>On or around 17 November 2017, Mdm Liew’s son (<strong>Kelvin</strong>), as well as Kelvin’s wife (<strong>Jacqueline</strong>), visited the Respondent to seek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew who was not present at this meeting.</p>\n<p>On Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on or around 20 November 2017. The Respondent had prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any other authority, from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her behalf.</p>\n<p>The Respondent met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time on 20 November 2017 at the Namly Property. Kelvin, Jacqueline, their sons, one Goh Eng Sheng Daniel (<strong>Daniel</strong>) and one Goh Eng Chun David (<strong>David</strong>) were present. Mdm Liew signed the POAs at this meeting.</p>\n<p>POA 6414 authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s behalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then 19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium Unit.</p>\n<p>POA 6417 authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in Mdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as a joint owner. It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from banks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if the sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also authorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and purchase agreement on behalf of Mdm Liew.</p>\n<p>On 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an Option to Purchase (<strong>OTP</strong>) to buyers for the purchase of the Namly Property. The OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017, and the Respondent was appointed by Kelvin to act as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer with respect to the sale of the Namly Property.</p>\n<p>On 1 December 2017, the OTP for the Condominium Unit was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline with the OTP being exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. The Respondent also acted for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew in this transaction.</p>\n<p>On 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been lodged against the Namly Property.</p>\n<p>On 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (<strong>Suit 45</strong>) in her capacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney to stop the sale of the Namly Property. On 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the mental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and declared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but had given evidence at the trial.</p>\n<p>Mdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020.</p>\n<p>The Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Mr Davinder Singh SC, and Mr K Anparasan as DT member to investigate the complaint.</p>\n<p>Seven charges were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h4><strong>First Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966

POA 6414 was related to the sale of 107 Namly Avenue (Namly Property), while POA 6417 was related to the purchase of a condominium unit (Condominium Unit). At the material time, Mdm Liew was 87 years old.\n\nOn or around 17 November 2017, Mdm Liew’s son (Kelvin), as well as Kelvin’s wife (Jacqueline), visited the Respondent to seek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew who was not present at this meeting.\n\nOn Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on or around 20 November 2017. The Respondent had prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any other authority, from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her behalf.\n\nThe Respondent met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time on 20 November 2017 at the Namly Property. Kelvin, Jacqueline, their sons, one Goh Eng Sheng Daniel (Daniel) and one Goh Eng Chun David (David) were present. Mdm Liew signed the POAs at this meeting.\n\nPOA 6414 authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s behalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then 19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium Unit.\n\nPOA 6417 authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in Mdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as a joint owner. It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from banks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if the sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also authorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and purchase agreement on behalf of Mdm Liew.\n\nOn 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an Option to Purchase (OTP) to buyers for the purchase of the Namly Property. The OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017, and the Respondent was appointed by Kelvin to act as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer with respect to the sale of the Namly Property.\n\nOn 1 December 2017, the OTP for the Condominium Unit was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline with the OTP being exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. The Respondent also acted for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew in this transaction.\n\nOn 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been lodged against the Namly Property.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (Suit 45) in her capacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney to stop the sale of the Namly Property. On 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the mental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and declared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but had given evidence at the trial.\n\nMdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020.\n\nThe Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) presided by Mr Davinder Singh SC, and Mr K Anparasan as DT member to investigate the complaint.\n\nSeven charges were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nFirst Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (LPA), in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, without ensuring that Kelvin had the authority to give those instructions on behalf of Mdm Liew, and when the Respondent had no evidence of such authority, failed to obtain confirmation of the said instructions from Mdm Liew regarding the preparation and drafting of the said POAs, in breach of Rule 5(5)(a) and 5(5)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (PCR).\n\nSecond Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, in the preparation of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017 with the client as the donor and Kelvin as attorney, and permitted Mdm Liew to execute the said POAs without first taking sufficient steps to satisfy himself that Mdm Liew understood the nature and effect of the terms that were set out in the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.\n\nThird Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to Mdm Liew, by failing to take sufficient steps to safeguard Mdm Liew’s interests by ensuring that he received his instructions, and explained the nature and effect of the two POAs dated 20 November 2017, to Mdm Liew without the presence of the attorney or other family members of the attorney so as to avoid any undue influence being exerted over the client, in breach of Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR.\n\nFourth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had acted for Mdm Liew, Kelvin and Jacqueline in the purchase of the Condominium Unit, where there was a diversity of interests that existed between the parties, and failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s and/or Jacqueline’s interests, by removing Mdm Liew’s name from the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rules 20(5) and 20(6) of the PCR.\n\nFifth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect her interests in respect of the purchase of the Condominium Unit, in particular the removal of her name, the non-inclusion of Daniel’s name, and the inclusion of Jacqueline’s name, in the OTP dated 1 December 2017, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.\n\nSixth Charge\n\nFor improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA, in that the Respondent had failed to inform Mdm Liew of all information known to him that may reasonably affect Mdm Liew’s interests in respect of the POAs, in particular the medical report prepared by Dr Ang Yong Guan and correspondence from Templars Law LLC relating to Mdm Liew’s alleged lack of mental capacity as at the time of the execution of the POAs, in breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the PCR.\n\nSeventh Charge\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor in the discharge of his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section 83(2)(h) of the Act, in that the Respondent, who had acted for Mdm Liew in respect of the matters that were the subject-matter of Suit 45, failed to advance Mdm Liew’s interests unaffected by Kelvin’s interests, by failing to take Mdm Liew’s instructions or her donee’s instructions when he was served with a subpoena by solicitors acting in Suit 45, and instead taking Kelvin’s instructions.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions\n\nThe DT found that the First Charge and Second Charge were made out, while the remaining Charges were dismissed.\n\nWith reference to the First Charge, the DT noted that the disparity between the Respondent’s evidence about the meeting on 20 November 2017 and what was said in the Respondent’s Attendance Note was simply too huge to be credibly accounted for.

He is an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore and was admitted on 19 April 2000. He is, and was at\nall material times, a director of City Law LLC.\n\nThe Complainant’s complaints arise from\n\ntwo Powers\n\nof Attorney dated 20\n\nNovember 2017. Both were lodged with the Supreme Court of Singapore as HC/PA\n6414/2017 (“POA\n\n6414”) and HC/PA\n\nrelated to the sale of 107\n\nNamly\n\n6417/2017 (“POA\n\nAvenue,\n\nSingapore\n\n6417”). POA\n267676\n\n6414\n\n(the “Namly\n\nProperty”) and POA 6417 related to the purchase of a condominium unit (the\n“Condominium Unit”).\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced HC/S 45/2018 (“Suit 45”) in her\n\ncapacity as Mdm Liew’s sole donee under a Lasting Power of Attorney registered\non 16 September 2014 (the “2014 LPA”), inter alia, against Kelvin in relation to\nthe sale of Namly Property.\n\nOn 17 September 2020, the High Court determined that Mdm Liew had lacked the\nmental capacity to understand and execute the POAs on 20 November 2017 and\ndeclared the POAs void. The Respondent was not a party to Suit 45 but gave\nevidence at the trial of that Suit.\n\nTHE HEARING AND THE WITNESSES\n\nThe Disciplinary Tribunal (the “DT”) was constituted on 8 October 2021. The\nhearing took place on 4 and 5 May 2022.\n\nThe Applicant called the Complainant as its only witness.\n\nThe Respondent gave evidence on his own behalf. He did not call any other witness.\n\n\fTHE UNDISPUTED FACTS\n\n10.\n\nThe following matters are not in dispute’.\n\n11.\n\nMdm Liew passed away on 10 June 2020. The Complainant was also the executrix\nof Mdm\n\n12.\n\nLiew’s will.\n\nOn or around 17 November 2017, Kelvin and Jacqueline visited the Respondent to\nseek his assistance to prepare two POAs for Mdm Liew, who was not present at this\nmeeting. The Respondent recorded a summary of Kelvin’s instructions in a note\ndated 17 November 2017.\n\n13.\n\nOn Kelvin’s instructions, the Respondent prepared the two POAs for Mdm Liew on\n\nor around 20 November 2017. The Respondent accepts that Mdm Liew was his\nclient.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent prepared the draft POAs without receiving any written, or any\nother authority from Mdm Liew authorising Kelvin to give him instructions on her\nbehalf.\n\n15.\n\nAt 12.28pm on 20 November 2017, the Respondent’s secretary emailed the two\ndraft POAs to Kelvin’s email address kjgoh@hotmail.com on the Respondent’s\nbehalf. In that email, he requested that Kelvin “go thru [sic] the drafis and let us\nhave your comments if any.”\n\n16.\n\nAt around Spm on 20 November 2017, the Respondent visited the Namly Property.\nThere, he met and spoke to Mdm Liew for the first time in connection with the\nPOAs and their execution (the “Meeting”). Kelvin, Jacqueline and their sons,\n\nDaniel and Goh Eng Chun David, were present throughout.\n17.\n\nMdm Liew listened and nodded while the Respondent took her through the POAs.\n\n1 The DT has in this section and others adopted in many places the language that the parties\nhave used in the pleadings, affidavits of evidence and submissions\n\n\f18.\n\nVery generally speaking, the first POA authorised Kelvin to act on Mdm Liew’s\nbehalf to sell the Namly Property and have the sale proceeds paid to Daniel, then\n19 years old, to hold on trust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the Condominium\nUnit (the “1** POA”).\n\n19,\n\nBroadly, the second POA authorised Kelvin to purchase the Condominium Unit in\nMdm Liew and Daniel’s names, with Kelvin having the authority to add himself as\na joint owner (the “2™! POA”). It also authorised Kelvin to borrow monies from\nbanks and other financial institutions on the security of the Condominium Unit if\nthe sale proceeds from the Namly Property sale were insufficient. Kelvin was also\nauthorised to execute documents, such as an option to purchase and sale and\npurchase agreement, on behalf of Mdm Liew.\n\n20.\n\nMdm Liew signed the POAs at the Meeting. She was 87 years old at the time.\n\n21,\n\nThe Respondent prepared an attendance note of the Meeting (the “Attendance\nNote”).\n\n22.\n\nOn 22 November 2017, Kelvin granted an option to “Leow Tang Liea and/or\nnominees” to purchase the Namly Property (the “Namly OTP”). Leow Tang Lie\nwas, at the material time, a director of Pinnacle Development (Greenmead) Pte Ltd\n(“Pinnacle”). The Namly OTP was exercised on 7 December 2017. Pursuant to the\n1 POA, Kelvin appointed the Respondent as Mdm Liew’s conveyancing lawyer\n\nwith respect to the sale of the Namly Property.\n23,\n\nOn\n\n1 December\n\n2017, the Option\n\nto Purchase\n\nthe Condominium\n\nUnit (the\n\n“Condominium OTP”) was granted to Kelvin and Jacqueline.\n\n24.\n\nThe Condominium OTP was exercised on 8 December 2017 in the names of\nKelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. On the same day, the Respondent furnished the\nsigned acceptance copy of the Condominium OTP to the seller’s solicitors, Sterling\n\n\fLaw Corporation (“SterlingLaw”). In that letter, the Respondent said he was\nacting for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew. Daniel was not named as a purchaser\nin the Condominium OTP.\n25.\n\nAccording to the e-Notice of Transfer, the Condominium Unit was sold to Kelvin\nand Jacqueline on 8 December 2017.\n\n26.\n\nOn or about 13 December 2017, the Complainant discovered that a caveat had been\nlodged against the Namly Property in favour of Pinnacle. Following this discovery,\nthe Complainant instructed her lawyers, Templars Law, to write to Pinnacle’s\nsolicitors, WongPartnership, to persuade Pinnacle to defer the completion of the\nsale of the Namly Property.\n\n27.\n\nOn 15 December 2017, Templars Law wrote to WongPartnership to draw attention\nto the unusual circumstances surrounding the sale of the Namly Property and asked\nthat Pinnacle agree to defer the completion of the sale until Mdm Liew’s mental\ncapacity could be determined by a medical expert. That letter also added that the\nComplainant was the sole donee under the 2014 LPA, that the Complainant\nreasonably\n\nbelieved\n\nthat\n\nMdm\n\nLiew’s\n\nmental\n\ncapacity\n\nhad\n\nsignificantly\n\ndeteriorated since September 2017, and that Kelvin had moved Mdm Liew to an\n\nunknown location’.\n28.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, Templars Law sent the 2014 LPA to WongPartnership*.\n\n29.\n\nOn 30 December 2017, Dr Ang Yong Guan issued a medical report in respect of\n\nMdm Liew’s mental capacity‘.\n30.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, Templars Law wrote to WongPartnership and enclosed Dr\nAng’s report. The report stated that the 1 POA was invalid and unenforceable, and\n\n2 page 1044 of the Complainant's AEIC\n» page 1048 of the Complainant's AEIC\n“page 1064 of the Complainant's AEIC\n\n\fthat Mdm Liew lacked the mental capacity to make the decision to sell the Namly\n\nProperty. Templars Law asked that the sale be stopped®.\nBy\n\n31.\n\nan email\n\nand a letter dated\n\n10 January 2018, Templars\n\nLaw\n\nwrote to\n\nWongPartnership to ask if they had instructions to accept service of process on\n\nbehalf of their client®.\nOn 10 January 2018, WongPartnership wrote to the Respondent to ask how “[his]\n\n32.\n\nclient” intended to resolve the matter. They stated that, if the sale and purchase\ncould not be proceeded with, that “[his] client” would compensate Pinnacle for all\nlosses. WongPartnership enclosed Templars Law’s letters dated 15 December 2017,\n22 December 2017, 5 January 2018 (with Dr Ang’s medical report attached) and 10\n\nJanuary 20187.\n33.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Complainant commenced Suit 45 in her capacity as Mdm\nLiew’s donee, pursuant to the 2014 LPA, against Pinnacle and Kelvin to stop the\nsale of the Namly Property.\n\n34.\n\nOnor around 24 January 2018, the Respondent wrote to SterlingLaw. In that letter,\nthe Respondent stated his clients’ intention to withdraw Mdm Liew’s name from\nthe purchase of the Condominium Unit.\n\n35.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, Templars Law wrote to the Respondent to inform him that:\n\na.\n\nthe Complainant was the sole donee under the 2014 LPA;\n\nb.\n\nDr Ang opined that Mdm Liew had been suffering from dementia since the\nmiddle of 2017 and lacked mental capacity to make financial decisions; and\n\nS page 1062 of the Complainant's AEIC\n* page 1072 of the Complainant's AEIC\n7 page 1074 of the Complainant's AEIC\n\n\fc.\n\nthe Complainant had commenced Suit 45 against Kelvin for the sale of the\nNamly Property and to request a statutory declaration setting out the full\ncircumstances under which Mdm Liew came to sign the POAs*.\n\n36.\n\nOn27 February 2018, the Complainant’s application for an interlocutory injunction\nto restrain the sale of the Namly Property from being completed was refused. The\n\nsale was allowed to proceed on the basis that the sale proceeds would be paid into\nCourt. Eventually, the sale was completed and the sale proceeds of S$5.1m were\n\npaid into Court.\n37,\n\nOn or around 27 February 2018, the Respondent wrote to SterlingLaw. In that\nletter, the Respondent referred to a fresh Option to Purchase for the Condominium\nUnit, to be signed by the seller pursuant to the withdrawal of Mdm Liew’s name as\na joint purchaser of that unit. Kelvin and Jacqueline exercised this Option to\nPurchase, with the exercise date backdated to 8 December 2017 (the “Amended\nCondominium OTP”).\n\n38.\n\nOn 3\n\nFebruary 2020, Templars Law issued a subpoena in Suit 45 against the\n\nRespondent requiring him to attend the trial and to produce documents that they\nhad asked for in their letter of 21 January 2020. It was served on the Respondent\n\non 4 February 2020°.\n39.\n\nThe Respondent then consulted Drew & Napier, who were Kelvin’s solicitors, in\nrelation to the subpoena. According to the Respondent”, he believed that he was\nentitled to seek instructions from Kelvin and/or his solicitors because Kelvin was\na party to Suit 45.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent informed Templars Law over the phone that he would not be\ntesponding\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nComplainant’s\n\nconfidentiality’.\n\n® page 1078 of the Complainant's AEIC\n\n° page! 103 of the Complainant's AEIC\n%° paragraphs 70 of the Respondent's AEIC\n31 paragraph 62 of the Respondent's AEIC\n\nrequest\n\nbecause\n\nof\n\nsolicitor-client\n\n\f41.\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the Accountant-General was directed to pay out the sale\n\nproceeds of the Namly Property to Mdm Liew.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent filed an affidavit of evidence-in-chief and appeared as a witness in\nSuit 45.\n\nTHE RESPONDENT’S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION\n\n43.\n\nIn paragraph 3 of the Respondent’s Defence (Amendment No. 1) (the “Defence”),\nthe Respondent pleaded that, insofar and to the extent that any of the matters in the\n\nStatement of Case (Amendment No.1) (the “SOC”) and the charges in paragraph\n37 of the SOC go beyond or are different from the complaint, they are not within\nthe jurisdiction or remit of the DT.\n\nHowever, the Respondent does not pursue that point in his Closing Submissions.\n\n45.\n\nNotwithstanding this, we are unable to agree with this point. As the Applicant has\nargued, and as made clear from the Complainant’s complaint dated 26 October\n2020, the charges against the Respondent “encapsulate the gravamen\n\nof the\n\ncomplaint”: LSS v Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin and another matter [2020] 4 SLR 858 at\n\n[64]-[65}.\nTHE APPLICANT’S RELIANCE ON THE JUDGMENT\n\nIN SUIT 45 AND\n\nPROOF OF MDM LIEW’S MENTAL CAPACITY\n\n46.\n\nIn the SOC, the Applicant pleaded Mdm Liew’s mental capacity (see paragraph\n3(b)) and referred to one Dr Ang’s medical report dated 30 December 2017, which\nthe Applicant said, “opined that Mdm Liew started suffering from dementia around\nthe middle of 2017 and was progressively getting worse” (see paragraphs 26-30).\n\nThe Applicant also pleaded what it said were the High Court’s findings in Suit 45,\nincluding those in relation to Mdm Liew’s mental capacity to understand and\nexecute the POAs and the Respondent’s conduct (see paragraphs 35-36).\n\n\f47.\n\nIn the Defence, the Respondent denied paragraph 3 of the SOC (see paragraph\n43A), disputed the findings in Dr Ang’s report of 30 December 2017\n\n(see paragraph\n\n67), pleaded that that report was insutticient evidence that Mdm Liew did not have\nmental capacity when she signed the POAs and agreed to the sale of the Namly\nProperty (see paragraphs 68 and 69), and that it had not been enough for Dr Ang\nto have relied solely on the information that the Complainant had provided to\nconclude that Mdm Liew lacked the mental capacity to agree to the sale of the\nNamly Property (see paragraph 69).\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent also pleaded that while the SOC reproduced the High Court’s\nfindings in Suit 45 (see paragraphs 76- 88), the findings of the High Court in Suit\n\n45 are opinion evidence (see paragraph 89).\n49.\n\nThe Applicant\n\nwould have therefore been aware from the Defence that the\n\nRespondent had pleaded that the findings in Suit 45 relied on by the Applicant are\nin the nature of opinion. The Applicant would also have been aware of the\n\nDefence’s assertion that there was insufficient evidence that Mdm Liew lacked\nmental capacity when she signed the POAs and agreed to the sale of the Namly\nProperty.\n\n50.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Applicant only called the Complainant as a witness. It did\n\nnot call Dr Ang or any expert on the issue of Mdm Liew’s mental capacity.\n51.\n\nIn her Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“AEIC”), the Complainant referred to and\ntelied on parts of the Judgment in Suit 45 (see e.g., paragraphs 16, 17, 38, 46, 53,\n\n62, 63, 65, 71, 73, 86, 89, 90, 91, 93, 94). She also referred to and relied on Dr\nAng’s reports (see e.g., paragraphs 122-124) and on Dr Ang’s opinion that “Mdm\n\nLiew was suffering from dementia which started around the middle of 2017 and\nwas progressively getting worse”.\n\n52.\n\nHowever, while the Complainant is a medical doctor, she was called as a witness\n\nof fact and not as an expert witness on Mdm Liew’s mental capacity. As she\n\n\ftestified, she was not qualified to comment on Mdm Liew’s mental capacity (TS,\n4 May 2022, page 25 lines 3-7).\n\n53.\n\nIn his closing submissions, the Respondent contended that in view of section 45 of\nthe Evidence Act, Arul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor JP [2000] SGHC 111 at\n[141], Zrans-World (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China (Singapore) [2003] 2\n\nSLR(R) 501 at [19], the findings of fact in Suit 45 (that were referred to and relied\non by the Complainant in her AEIC and at the hearing) are not evidence and not\n\nadmissible for their truth.\n34,\n\nThe Respondent also submitted that the hearing before the DT was a de novo\nhearing. The Applicant did not respond to this point.\n\n55.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the DT gave the parties liberty to ask for leave to submit\nreply submissions to the other side’s closing submissions. The Applicant did not\nask for leave to respond to these submissions.\n\n56.\n\nAs per Rule 23 of the Legal Profession (Disciplinary Tribunal) Rules, the Evidence\nAct applies to proceedings before the DT in the same manner as it applies to civil\nand criminal proceedings.\n\n57.\n\nThe position under section 45 of the Evidence Act as set out in Arul Chandran and\nTrans-World was later reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in Zainal bin Kuning v\nChan Sin Mian Michael [1996] 2 SLR (R) 858 at [69], where it held that a\n“judgment determining a fact in one trial cannot be used or relied upon in another\n\ntrial”.\n58.\n\nThis was also\n\naddressed by the Singapore Intemational Court (“SICC”)\n\nin\n\nBeyonics Asia Pacific and others v Goh Chan Peng and another [2020] 4 SLR 215\nwhich, applying Arul Chandran, held at [33] that “evidence of statements made in\n\nan earlier case may be adduced in order to seek to discredit evidence given by a\nwitness in a later case, but there is an important distinction between reliance upon\n\nstatements made in a previous action and conclusions reached by the court in that\nprevious action on the basis of those statements”.\n\n\f59.\n\nThe SICC also applied Zainal bin Kuning and held at [35] that “a finding of fact in\na previous judgment cannot be relied upon to prove primary facts which have to\nbe proved in a subsequent action,\n\n60.\n\nHere, although the Respondent was a witness, he was not a party to Suit 45. Neither\nwas the Applicant. The Applicant has not submitted that any exception to section\n\n45 of the Evidence Act applies.\n61.\n\nWhile there had been an agreement in relation to the documents in the bundles of\ndocuments, it was qualified. On the first day of the hearing, Mr Peter Low for the\nRespondent informed the DT that the Respondent agreed to the documents in the\nbundles of documents, “subject to cross-examination”. In cross-examination, Mr\nLow challenged the assertion that Mdm Liew lacked mental capacity at the material\ntime and took issue with Dr Ang’s reports and views.\n\n62.\n\nOn the question of whether the hearing before the DT was a de novo hearing,\nalthough the Respondent did not cite any authority, his submission is supported by\nRe Parti Liyani [2020] SGHC 227 at [48] where the Honourable Chief Justice held\nthat “the Disciplinary\n\nTribunal\n\nis obliged\n\nto hear\n\nthe matter de novo”.\n\nThe\n\nDisciplinary Tribunal in that case accordingly treated the hearing before it as a de\nnovo hearing: see The Law Society of Singapore v Tan Yanying and another [2022]\n\nSGDT 6 at [20].\n63.\n\nIn the circumstances, we agree with the Respondent that the Applicant cannot rely\non the findings in the Judgment in Suit 45 to prove the existence or truth of matters\nthat the Respondent has not admitted or agreed to in this case. We also find that\n\nthere was no evidence before us of Mdm Liew’s mental capacity.\nTHE STANDARD OF PROOF\n\n64.\n\nIt is trite that the charges have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: Law Society\nof Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani [2006] 4 SLR 308 at [6].\n\n\fG.\n\nTHE CHARGES\n\nTHE FIRST CHARGE\n65.\n\nThe First Charge is as follows:\n\nThat\n\nyou,\n\nTeo\n\nEng\n\nas an advocate\nin\n\nsection\n\nwhilst\n\nyou\n\nThye,\n\nare charged\n\n83(2)(b)(i)\nacted\n\nof\n\nwith\n\nSupreme\n\nKelvin\n\nwith\n\nCourt\nthe\n\nas the attomey,\n\nProfession\n\nthe\n\nfor Madam\n\nof the 2 Powers\n\nrespectively\n\nimproper\n\nand solicitor of the Supreme\n\npreparation\nthe\n\nwith\n\nLegal\n\nLiew\n\nof Attommey\nas\n\nclient\n\n1966\n\nthat,\n\nFong)\n\nin the\n\ndated 20 November\n\n2017\n\nlodged\n\nand\n\nHC/PA\n\nas\n\ndonor\n\none\n\nGoh\n\nConduct)\n\nin\n\n(alias Liew\n\n6414/2017\n\nin breach of Rule\n\n(Professional\n\nFong\n\nAct\n\nHC/PA\nthe\n\nor practice\n\nCourt of Singapore as set out\n\nProfession\n\nKhoon\n\nconduct\n\nand\n5(5)(a)\n\nRules\n\n2015\n\n6417/2017\n\nYong\n\nChiang\n\nand 5(5)(b) of the Legal\nyou\n\ntook\n\ninstructions\n\nfrom Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin without ensuring that he had the authority\nto give those\nevidence\n\ninstructions\n\nof such\n\ninstructions\n\nfrom\n\non behalf of your\n\nauthority,\nyour\n\nyou\n\nclient\n\nclient and\n\nfailed\n\nto obtain\n\nregarding\n\nthe\n\nwhen\n\nconfirmation\n\npreparation\n\nand\n\nyou had no\nof the\n\nsaid\n\ndrafting\n\nof\n\nthe said Powers of Attorney.\nTHE PARTIES’ CONTENTIONS\n\n66.\n\nThe Applicant recounts the following: First, the Respondent met Mdm Liew for\nthe first time only at the Meeting. Second, the Meeting was his first and only\ncontact with her. Third, he did not, at the 17 November 2017 meeting with Kelvin,\n\nobtain confirmation of Kelvin’s authorisation to act for Mdm Liew in relation to\nthe POAs.\n\n67.\n\nIt is argued that although it became plain to the Respondent during the Meeting\nthat Mdm Liew was not able to communicate verbally, the Respondent should not\nhave been satisfied with Mdm Liew’s nods and smile as he went through the POAs\n\nwith her, not least because the Respondent accepted that there was a greater need\nfor him to confirm Kelvin’s instructions with Mdm Liew because Kelvin stood to\nbenefit from the POAs.\n\n\f68.\n\nThe\n\nApplicant\n\ncontended\n\nthe following:\n\nFirst, Mdm\n\nLiew’s\n\nresponses\n\nwere\n\ninsufficient to confirm her instructions. Second, the Respondent did not speak to\nher alone to confirm\n\nif Kelvin’s\n\ninstructions\n\nwere\n\nindeed\n\nhers.\n\nThird,\n\nthe\n\nRespondent did not ask her to repeat the instructions that she had allegedly given\nto Kelvin. It argued that the Respondent could have asked Mdm Liew to confirm\nher instructions by writing them down.\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent relied on the dicta in Law Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar\nNaidu [2012] 4 SLR 1232 (“K Jayakumar Naidu”) to contend that solicitors should\nnot be held to the same “strict protocols appropriate in a business setting” and that\n\n“by and large, family members do not take advantage of each other”.\n70.\n\nHe\n\nalso argued\n\nthat there was nothing remarkable\n\nor suspicious about the\n\ncircumstances of this case.\nTl.\n\nThe Respondent contended that since Kelvin was Mdm Liew’s son, the Respondent\nwas entitled to assume that Kelvin had the authority to give him instructions on her\nbehalf. He contended that at the 17 November 2017 meeting he informed Kelvin\nthat he needed to personally take Mdm\n\nLiew’s instructions and to witness her\n\nexecution of the POAs.\n72.\n\nThe Respondent said that at the Meeting, he took instructions from Mdm Liew\npersonally, verified Kelvin’s instructions, and also confirmed Mdm Liew’s own\ninstructions. According to him, after explaining the terms of the POAs, he not only\nasked Mdm Liew if she understood what he had said but also asked her why she\nwanted to move out and if she wanted to buy a single-storey condominium unit to\n\nlive in. He contended that he was satisfied that she possessed mental capacity at\nthe time.\n73.\n\nThe Respondent further argued that he witnessed her execution of the POAs,\n\nadding that he even observed her taking off her glasses and reading them before\nsigning.\n\n\f74.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that he was entitled to rely on Mdm Liew’s nodding\nas confirmation of her instructions, and for that purpose relied on section 5(1)(d)\nof the Mental Capacity Act (“MCA”). He said that he had used simple language\nwhen explaining the terms of the POAs, that Mdm\n\nLiew was able despite her\n\nphysical limitations to sit upright on her own, and that she even took off her glasses\n\nto read the POAs before signing them. He added that if he had stated anything\nincorrect, Mdm Liew would have corrected him, just as she was able to correctly\nidentify the members of her family and even referred to Kelvin by his nickname.\n\n75.\n\nInsofar as section 5(1)(d) of the MCA is concemed, the Applicant’s position was\nthat nodding is insufficient where, as here, Mdm Liew did not ask any questions or\nmake any amendments to the POAs.\n\n76.\n\nBoth parties relied on a number of authorities, which we have considered. Some of\nthem were cited for more than one of the charges.\n\nIl.\n\n77.\n\nOUR FINDINGS\nSection 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 (the “Act”) concerns, inter\n\nalia, a breach of any rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council.\n\n78.\n\nRule 5(5) is the subject of the First Charge. That Rule provides that where a legal\npractitioner is given instructions purportedly on behalf of his or her client, the legal\npractitioner must,\n\nunder\n\nRule\n\n5(5)(a),\n\nensure that the person\n\ngiving\n\nthose\n\ninstructions has the authority to give those instructions on behalf of the client or,\nunder Rule 5(5)(b), if there is no evidence of such authority, obtain the client’s\n\nconfirmation of those instructions within a reasonable time after receiving those\ninstructions.\n\n79.\n\nIt is alleged that the Respondent breached both Rule 5(5)(a) and Rule 5(5)(b).\n\n80.\n\nInsofar as Rule 5(5)(a) is concerned, it is not in dispute that the Respondent met\nMdm Liew for the first (and only) time on 20 November 2017. That means that the\nRespondent was unable to ensure at that meeting that Kelvin had Mdm\n\nLiew’s\n\n\fauthority to give instructions to him in relation to the POAs when he met Kelvin\nand Jacqueline on 17 November 2017 and when his assistant secretary emailed, on\nhis\n\nbehalf,\n\nthe\n\ndrafis\n\n<kjgoh@hotmail.com>\n\nof the\n\nPOAs\n\nto Kelvin\n\nat Kelvin’s\n\nemail\n\naddress\n\nat around 12.28pm on 20 November 2017 requesting that\n\nKelvin “go thru the drafts and let us have your comments if any”.\n81.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that Rule 5(5)(a) was breached. Rule 5(5)(b) shows\nthat in cases where it is not possible to obtain evidence of such authority, the\nsolicitor must obtain the client’s confirmation of those instructions within a\nreasonable time after receiving those instructions.\n\n82.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent acted reasonably and in compliance with Rule 5(5)(a).\nIt was the Respondent’s uncontested evidence that at the 17 November 2017\nmeeting, he told Kelvin to bring Mdm Liew to his office to enable him to take her\ninstructions and witness her execution of the POAs, and that when Kelvin asked if\nthere was another way for the Respondent to do that since Mdm Liew was unable\nto walk and had trouble speaking, he informed Kelvin that he could visit Mdm\nLiew at the Namly Property.\n\n83.\n\nThe Meeting was arranged for Monday 20 November 2017, the first working day\nafter 17 November 2017, which was a Friday. In his contemporaneous note of the\n\n17 November 2017 meeting’, the Respondent recorded “To visit client 20/11/17\nevening 5-6pm to the house”.\n84.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Meeting was arranged for him to meet Mdm\nLiew for the Respondent to take her instructions and witness her execution of the\n\nPOAS,\n85.\n\nIn the circumstances, we do not agree that there was a breach of Rule 5(5)(a).\n\n2see paragraph 10 of the Respondent's AEIC and TAB-I of TET-I\n» see paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Respondent's AEIC\n\n\f86.\n\nThe next question we will address is whether at the Meeting, the Respondent had\n\nobtained Mdm Liew’s confirmation of Kelvin’s instructions.\n87.\n\nThe Court of Appeal’s observations in Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline\n(Chee Ping Chian Alexander and another, interveners) [2010] 4 SLR 373 at [60]\non the duty of solicitors who undertake the task of preparing and/or witnessing the\nexecution of wills are instructive:\n\n“In our view, this case demonstrates that solicitors who undertake the task of\npreparing wills and/or witnessing the execution of wills must take the necessary\nprecautions or steps in order to fulfil their duties to their clients. The precautions\nare not complicated nor are they time consuming. In any case, as solicitors, they\nmust do what is required, however complicated or difficult the task may be. The\n\ncentral task is to ensure that the terms of the will reflect the wishes of the testator.\nHow this is done depends on the circumstances of each case. In every case, the\nsolicitor should be cautious about taking instructions from any person who is to be\nnamed as a beneficiary in the will.”\n\n88.\n\nAt [61], the Court of Appeal in the same case reiterated the following points that\nwere made in Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR (R) 1079:\n\n“73.\n\nThe preparation of a will involves serious professional responsibilities,\n\nwhich\n\nsolicitors must uncompromisingly\n\nobserve and discharge.\n\nRegrettably,\n\nit seems to us that, all too often nowadays, solicitors appear to consider the\npreparation of a will to be no more than a routine exercise in form filling.\nThis is wrong. Before preparing a will, the solicitor concerned ought to have a\nthorough\n\ndiscussion\n\nwith\n\npotential complications\n\nthe testator on all the possible\n\nlegal issues\n\nthat might arise in the implementation\n\nand\n\nof the terms\n\nof the will. The solicitor ought to painstakingly and accurately document his\ndiscussions\n\nwith\n\nand his instructions from\n\nthe\n\ntestator.\n\nHe\n\nshould\n\nalso\n\nconfirm with the testator, prior to the execution of the will, that the contents\n\nof the will as drafted accurately express the latter’s intention.”\n\n\f89.\n\nIn Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang [2007] 3 SLR(R) 477 at [95], the\n\nCourt of Three Judges held, in relation to a solicitor’s duty when asked to prepare\na Power of Attorney to be executed by the client, that:\n\n“The respondent was obliged to take reasonable care to advise and ensure that the\ncomplainants understood the implications of executing a power of attorney in the\nprevailing circumstances”.\n\n90.\n\nIn Zan Phuay Khiang at [97], the Court also observed that where “there was a real\npossibility that the execution of a power of attorney had not been initiated by the\n[clients] themselves, but at a third party's behest instead....it was imperative for\n\nthe [solicitor] to have privately met with the [clients] and ensured that the [clients]\nwere not acting\n\nunder any misrepresentation or improper influence and could\n\ncommunicate with him freely”.\n91.\n\nIn K Jayakumar Naidu, the Law Society decided not to pursue the charge relating\n\nto the respondent’s failure to advise his client on the nature, purport and\nconsequence of the Power of Attorney. In that context, the Court of Three Judges\n\nsaid at [44] and [45]:\n“44, The gravamen of the first charge relates to the respondent's alleged failure to\nadvise HCS on the nature, purport and consequence of the power of attorney.\n\n45, As the Law Society eventually did not pursue this charge we need not dwell on\nthis save to make the following observation. To require solicitors to hold their\n\nclients’ family members to the same strict protocols appropriate in a business\nsetting would place them in an untenable attitude of opposition with their clients’\nfamilies and would not be in the interest of the client. Nor would it accord with the\ncommon experience that, by and large, family members do not take advantage of\neach other. The Law Society was therefore correct in eventually submitting that\nthere was nothing remarkable or suspicious about the circumstances in which HBS\napproached the respondent to prepare the power of attorney. At that stage, he need\nnot have done anything more than confirm that HCS wanted to sell the flat and that\n\nhe wanted HBS to act on his behalf.”\n\n\f92.\n\nHowever, the Court also said this at [1]:\n\n“A solicitor should also ensure that the client understands sufficiently any risks\nthat may arise. This duty is elevated when a solicitor has reason to suspect that\n\nthere are special risks or unusual pitfalls involved in the subject transaction.\nNaturally, the extent of this duty depends on the precise identity, sophistication and\ncircumstances of the client: a vulnerable client, such as one who is mentally and/or\nphysically disadvantaged, uneducated or impecunious, may require comprehensive\nand comprehensible advice for even the simplest of matters; in contrast, a client\nwho is a seasoned businessman\nmanagement\n\nteam may\n\nor a corporate entity with an in-house risk\n\nbe reasonably presumed to have greater situational\n\nawareness. In a similar vein, the extent of the duty will also vary with the client’s\napparent\n\nfamiliarity\n\nowe\n\nclients\n\ntheir\n\nadvance\n\nwith\n\na\n\nproposed\n\na fundamental\n\ntheir client’s interests\n\nduty\n\nand\n\ntransaction.\n\nAll\n\nof undivided\n\nloyalty\n\nnot place\n\nthemselves\n\nsolicitors\nto\n\nalso\n\nethically\n\nin a position\n\nof\n\nconflict.”\nGoh Yng Yng Karen v Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin [2021] 3 SLR 896\" held at [119]\nthat:\n\n“It is well established that what amounts to a transaction that calls for an\nexplanation is a “fact-sensitive inquiry” where\n\n“much would depend on the\n\nstrength of inferences to be drawn from the circumstances”: Moh Tai Siang v Moh\nTai Tong and another /20/8] SGHC 280 at [80]. I note also the observation in\nRoyal Bank of Scotland ple v Etridge (No 2) [2002] 2 AC 773 at [22] citing with\napproval the view of Lindley LJ in Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145 at 185\nthat a transaction calls for an explanation where\naccounted\n\nSor\n\non\n\nthe\n\nground\n\nit cannot\n\n“be reasonably\n\nof\n\nSriendship,\n\nrelationship, charity or other ordinary motives on which ordinary men act.”\n\n% which is being relied on for the law as set out by the Court\n\n\f93.\n\nAfter considering Muriel Chee and Low Ah Cheow, the High Court opined that in\ncases involving a solicitor’s duty in connection with a client’s disposal of property\nto his or her successors,\n\nthere is no material\n\ndistinction between\n\na situation\n\ninvolving wills and one which involved the making of an inter vivos gift.\n\n94,\n\nIn view of these authorities, the question whether there was a breach of Rule 5(5)(b)\nis a “fact-sensitive inquiry” where\n\n“much\n\nwould depend on the strength of\n\ninferences to be drawn from the circumstances”.\n\nIt is important therefore to\n\nconsider all the circumstances. In doing that, it must be borne in mind that this case\ninvolved family members (see Jayakumar Naidu). This requires a consideration of\nthe circumstances leading to and what happened at the Meeting.\n\n95.\n\nThe starting point is what the Respondent said happened.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Respondent\", during the meeting on 17 November 2017, Kelvin\ninformed him that Jacqueline and their family were residing with his mother, Mdm\nLiew, at the Namly Property. Furthermore, Mdm Liew had instructed him that she\n\nwanted to move out of the Namly Property as soon as possible for two principal\nreasons: First, that as she was wheelchair-bound, it was inconvenient for her to\nmove up and down the stairs in the Namly Property, as well as to and from her\n\nbedroom to the toilet. Second, that as she spent most of her time at the Namly\nProperty,\n\nMdm\n\nLiew\n\nwas\n\naffected\n\nby\n\nongoing\n\nconstruction\n\nwork\n\nin the\n\nneighbouring properties which generated noise, dust, and pollution, causing her\ndiscomfort and affected her sleep during the day. As such, she suggested that she,\nKelvin, and his family move to a single-storey condominium unit where she would\nbe able to move freely and more independently in her wheelchair. Further, Kelvin,\nhis family, and their domestic helper would be on the same floor and thus be able\n\nto respond to her needs more easily.\n97.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, at the 17 November 2017 meeting, Kelvin had told\nhim that Mdm Liew had instructed him to engage a lawyer to prepare two Powers\nof Attomey for Kelvin to act on her behalf in the sale of the Namly Property and\n\n8 paragraph 9 of the Respondent's AEIC\n\n\fthe purchase of a single-storey condominium unit. She had also instructed that the\nPowers of Attorney should allow for the following:\n\na.\n\nKelvin to sell and absolutely dispose of the Namly Property;\n\nb.\n\nKevin to request for all sale proceeds to be issued to Daniel to be held on\ntrust for Mdm Liew for the purchase of the single-storey condominium unit.\n(Mdm Liew wanted to give the Namly Property to Daniel, her favourite\ngrandson), and;\n\nc.\n\nKevin to purchase the single-storey condominium unit in her and Daniel’s\nnames with the option to include Kelvin as a joint owner.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent also said that at the 17 November 2017 meeting, Kelvin requested\nthat\n\nhe\n\nprepare\n\nthe\n\nPowers\n\nof\n\nAttorney\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nsale\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nNamly\n\nProperty and for the purchase of a single-storey condominium unit.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent said’ that he also asked Kelvin whether Mdm Liew had a history\nof mental illness or had ever been admitted to the Institute of Mental Health\n(“IMB”) or any other mental health facilities and Kelvin informed him that Mdm\nLiew was in perfect mental health and that he could verify the same after meeting\nher. The Respondent also said that he did not sense anything was amiss, given that\nhe had adult children approaching him on their parents’ behalf before and that\nKelvin had identified himself to the Respondent as a medical doctor. He said he\nhad trusted Kelvin when he said that Mdm Liew was in perfect mental health and\nhad never been admitted to IMH or any other mental health facilities. He added\nthat he was satisfied that he would be able to verify Mdm Liew’s mental capacity\n\nhimself and to take her instructions when he met her on 20 November 2017.\n100. According to the Respondent, at the Meeting, the Respondent met Mdm\nKelvin, Jacqueline and their two sons were present throughout.\n\n16 paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Respondent's AEIC\n\nLiew.\n\n\f101.\n\nThe Respondent said\"? that Kelvin had begun the Meeting by introducing him to\nMdm Liew as the lawyer who he had approached to act for her. The Respondent\n\nexplained tv Mdin Liew that he was there because Kelvin had told him that Mdm\nLiew had asked Kelvin to engage a lawyer to prepare legal documents to give\nKelvin\n\nthe power\n\nto sell the Namly\n\nProperty\n\nand purchase\n\na single-storey\n\ncondominium unit, and for the lawyer to act in the sale of the Namly Property and\nthe purchase of the single-storey condominium unit. Mdm Liew nodded her head\nin affirmation of the Respondent’s explanation.\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent also said that upon meeting Mdm Liew, he had introduced himself\nand asked for her name. As Mdm\n\nLiew had difficulty speaking audibly, the\n\nRespondent was unable to decipher her response. He then read out Mdm Liew’s\nname from her NRIC card, which Daniel handed him. Mdm Liew confirmed her\nidentity by nodding and smiling.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent then asked Mdm Liew if she recognised the people around her.\nShe said yes, and introduced him, one by one, to her family members who were\npresent, in the following order: Kelvin, Jacqueline, Daniel and David, and lastly\nher domestic helper. She was able to softly refer to Kelvin as “Vin”, which the\nRespondent understood was her affectionate nickname for him. She also correctly\nidentified each individual present in the room.\n\n104.\n\nFollowing the confirmation of Mdm\n\nLiew’s identity, he then asked Mdm Liew\n\nthree times if she was comfortable having the Meeting in the presence of Kelvin,\nhis family members, and the domestic helper. Mdm\n\nLiew nodded her head in\n\nresponse each time she was asked, indicating that she was comfortable.\n105.\n\nThe Respondent then proceeded to ascertain if Mdm\n\nLiew possessed mental\n\ncapacity by first asking her if she had a history of mental illness or if she had ever\nbeen admitted to IMH or any other mental treatment facilities. In response, Mdm\nLiew shook her head, indicating that she did not have a history of mental illness\n\n» paragraphs 21-37 of the Respondent's AEIC\n\n\fand that she had not ever been admitted to IMH or any other mental treatment\nfacilities.\n\n106. The Respondent tumed to Kelvin and asked the same questions in Mdm Liew’s\n\npresence. Kelvin confirmed that Mdm Liew had no history of mental illness, nor\nhad she ever been admitted to IMH or any other mental treatment facilities. The\n\nRespondent proceeded to ask Mdm Liew if she understood the purpose of the\nMeeting. Mdm Liew nodded her head, indicating that she understood the purpose\nof the Meeting.\n\n107. Throughout their interaction, the Respondent observed that Mdm Liew was fully\nalert, and was able to understand and respond to his questions although she was\n\nunable to walk and had difficulty speaking audibly. As such, the Respondent was\nsatisfied that Mdm Liew possessed mental capacity.\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent asked her if the Namly Property was suitable for her to continue\n\nresiding in. In response, Mdm Liew shook her head, indicating that the Namly\nProperty was not suitable for her to continue residing in. He also asked if the noise\n\nfrom the construction from the neighbouring properties was one of the reasons why\nthe Namly Property was no longer suitable for her to live in. Again, Mdm Liew\nnodded her head.\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent asked if Mdm Liew had difficulty manoeuvring up and down the\nstairs in the Namly Property, and in response, she nodded her head.\n\n110.\n\nHe asked Mdm Liew if she wished to move to a single-storey condominium unit to\navoid having to manoeuvre up and down stairs and to avoid the noise from the\nneighbouring properties, and Mdm Liew nodded her head again.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondent asked Mdm Liew to confirm that she wished to appoint Kelvin as\nher attomey\n\nto\n\nsell\n\nthe\n\nNamly\n\nProperty\n\nand\n\nto purchase\n\na single-storey\n\ncondominium unit. She nodded. He then proceeded to explain the following, inter\nalia, in respect of the POAs to Mdm Liew:\n\n\fa\n\nHe explained to Mdm\n\nLiew that the sale proceeds of the Namly Property\n\nwere to be used to purchase a single-storey condominium unit in the joint\nnames\n\nof herself\n\nand\n\nDaniel.\n\nHe\n\nalso\n\nexplained\n\nthe\n\nmeaning\n\nand\n\nconsequences of Daniel holding the sale proceeds on trust for Mdm Liew. He\nfurther explained that as Daniel was not 21 years of age, his share in the\nproperty would be held on trust by Kelvin and that usually for trust matters,\na separate trust deed would be drafted. However, as at the time of the\nexecution of the two POAs, the address of the single-storey condominium\nunit was not yet known, the trust deed could not yet be drafted;\n\nQ)\n\nThe Respondent explained the meaning of joint tenants and tenants-incommon and the implications. To explain the concept of a joint tenancy and\nthe right of survivorship to Mdm Liew, he employed a hypothetical situation\n\nin which persons A, B and C were joint tenants of a property. He explained\nthat if A passed away, B and C would be the owners of the entire property.\nLikewise, if B passed away, A and C would be owners of the entire property,\n\nand if C passed away, A and B would be owners of the entire property. He\nthen explained that in a tenancy-in common, each tenant possesses their own\nshare which can be distributed according to their will or by intestacy;\n\nG3)\n\nHe explained that if the sale proceeds of the Namly Property were insufficient\nto purchase the single-story condominium unit, Kevin’s name would be\nincluded as a joint tenant for the purposes of obtaining a bank loan to finance\nthe remaining balance of the purchase price. He then asked Mdm Liew if she\nwanted Kelvin’s name to be included as a joint tenant in the event a bank\nloan is required to finance the balance purchase price. Mdm Liew nodded,\nindicating her assent and that she understood the above. The Respondent then\nexplained to Mdm Liew that the two POAs had the effect of giving the Namly\nProperty to Daniel, and asked Mdm Liew if she intended to give the Namly\nProperty to Daniel. Mdm Liew nodded. He asked Mdm Liew if she intended\nto give the Namly Property to David. Mdm Liew shook her head, indicating\nthat she did not wish to give the Namly Property to David; and\n\n\f(4)\n\nHe said that Kelvin’s consent would be required to revoke the two POAs. He\ninformed Mdm Liew that the two POAs were irrevocable without written\napproval from Kelvin or the Family Justice Courts. He explained that this\nmeant that Mdm Liew could not withdraw, cancel, or amend the two POAs\nafter their execution,\n\nand\n\nasked\n\nif she understood.\n\nMdm\n\nLiew\n\nnodded,\n\nindicating that she understood.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent said he repeated these explanations twice. Mdm Liew nodded her\nhead in response to each explanation, indicating that she understood the terms and\nthe consequences of the two POAs. When the Respondent finished his explanation,\n\nhe asked Mdm Liew if she understood what he had said. She nodded her head.\n113.\n\nHe asked Mdm Liew once more if she wanted to move out of the Namly Property\nbecause it had become inconvenient for her to stay there, and that she wanted to\nbuy a single storey condominium unit to live in instead. Mdm Liew nodded her\nhead again.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondent was satisfied that she had mental capacity to sign the two POAs.\nHe then placed the two POAs in front of Mdm Liew, who removed her glasses and\n\ntook some time to read them before signing them in his presence. The Respondent\nthen affixed his stamp to the two POAs and countersigned against them.\n\n115.\n\nHe observed that during the Meeting, Mdm\n\nLiew appeared relaxed, alert and\n\nshowed no signs of discomfort or that she was not acting on her own.\n\n116.\n\nWe are unable to accept the Respondent’s evidence of what happened during the\n\nMeeting for the following reasons:117.\n\nFirst, this evidence does not accord with the Respondent’s Attendance Note of the\nMeeting which he prepared at around 6.15pm when he retumed to his office after\n\nthe Meeting'®. According to the attendance note:\n\n+8 see paragraph 39 of the Respondent's AEIC and TAB 5 of TET-1\n\n\fa.\n\nMdm\n\nb.\n\nThe Meeting took place between Spm to 5.45pm;\n\nc.\n\nThe Meeting concemed “2x Powers of Attorney at 107 NamlyAve”;\n\nd.\n\nThe Respondent “saw Mdm Liew around Spm and read the POA to her”;\n\ne.\n\nLiew is recorded as the client;\n\n| “She was aware that her son had told me to come and she had given\ninstruction to her son”. Her response, if any, was not recorded;\n\nf.\n\nThe Respondent “ask{ed] her whether she understand what I was saying\nand whether she recognise the people around her”. Mdm Liew’s response,\nif any, was not recorded;\n\ng.\n\n| The Respondent “askfed] her whether she was admitted to woodbridge or\nmental clinic before, she said No”;\n\n118.\n\nh.\n\n“She said that staying here is inconvenient and want to move out”;\n\ni.\n\n“She was relaxed ... and no sign of oppression or discomfort”; and\n\nj.\n\n“end 5.45pm”.\n\nThe Respondent sought to explain the difference between his evidence and the\nAttendance Note by saying that the latter did not fully reflect his communications\nwith Mdm Liew.\n\n119.\n\nWhile we accept the Attendance Note was not, and could not have been, meant to\nbe a verbatim note of what was said at the Meeting, the fact is that the Respondent\n‘was conscious of the need to have a contemporaneous record of what he considered\nto be the main and important aspects of the Meeting. Further, the fact that he\nprepared it immediately after the Meeting meant that his memory of the Meeting\n\nwas fresh at that time.\n\n\f120.\n\nThe disparity between his evidence about the Meeting and what is said in the\nAttendance Note is simply too huge to be credibly accounted for.\n\n121,\n\nAccording to the Attendance Note, the Respondent “read the POA to her”. There\nis nothing about him explaining the POAs (let alone more than once) in the manner\nthat he claimed in his evidence. There is also nothing in the Attendance Note about\n\nhim explaining the nature and effect of the POAs to Mdm Liew. The Applicant\nsubmitted that the Respondent accepted that he did not say any of this in his\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief in Suit 45 (his “45 AEIC”).\n\n122.\n\nIn his Defence, the Respondent also claimed that he explained the nature and\nconsequences of joint ownership of the Condominium Unit by Mdm Liew, Kelvin\nand Daniel. This was not in the Attendance Note. The Applicant submitted that the\n\nRespondent did not say this in his 45 AEIC.\n123. The\n\nRespondent\n\nalso\n\ntook\n\nthe\n\nposition\n\nthat\n\nhe\n\nexplained\n\nthe\n\nmeaning\n\nand consequences of Daniel holding the sale proceeds of the Namly Property\non trust for Mdm\n\nLiew and that as Daniel was below 21 years of age, his\n\nshare in the property would be held on trust by Kelvin.\n\nThis was not in the\n\nAttendance Note. The Applicant submitted that this was different from what the\nRespondent said in his 45 AEIC where the Respondent said that he explained that\nthe sale proceeds would be held by Daniel on trust for her to purchase the\n\nCondominium Unit.\n124,\n\nAs the Applicant pointed out, the Respondent’s own understanding of the legal\neffect of the 2 POA was inaccurate and that Kelvin could, at his own discretion,\n\nadd himself as a joint tenant to the purchase of the Condominium Unit. It was also\nnot correct that Kelvin would be added as a joint tenant to the purchase of the\nCondominium Unit only if there were insufficient funds to finance the purchase the\nCondominium Unit from the sale proceeds of the Namly Property.\n\n125.\n\nAccording to the Attendance Note, Mdm Liew “was aware that her son had told\nme to come and she had given instruction to her son”. However, her response, if\nthere was any, was not recorded. This also begged the question whether she\n\n\funderstood what the Respondent was talking about when he said that “she had\n\ngiven instructions to her son”.\n126,\n\nThe Attendance Note also said that the Respondent “ask/ed/ her whether she\nunderstand what I was saying and whether she recognise the people around her”.\nThis presents a particular difficulty because the POAs had unusual clauses and\n\nfeatures that gave rise to various issues that needed very careful explanation,\nparticularly to an 87 year old lay person who could not readily interact because of\nher speaking difficulties.\n\n127.\n\nIn fact, it was not just the nature, terms, and implications of the two POAs which\nrequired careful explanation but also the issues arising from the interaction between\nthe two POAs. They raised, inter alia, the following issues or concerns:\n\na.\n\nThe concept of joint tenancy;\n\nb.\n\nThat Mdm\n\nLiew would be making an inter-vivos gift to Daniel to the\n\nexclusion of others;\n\nc.\n\nHow that intention could still be fulfilled if Kelvin included his name in the\npurchase of the Condominium Unit;\n\nd.\n\nThe fact that she could not on her own change her mind;\n\ne.\n\nThat Daniel was a minor (the Respondent knew that Daniel was about 19\n\nyears old at the time!® and cannot be a trustee);\n£.\n\nWhat the terms of the trust would be and how would they affect Mdm Liew\nand her rights;\n\n39 NE dated 25 February 2020, page 79, line 16, Tab 19 of Exhibit KG-I at page 720\n\n\fg. | What would happen if after the Namly Property was sold, complications\narose in relation to the purchase of the Condominium Unit e.g., because\nDaniel refused to allow the sale proceeds to be used, and;\n\nh.\n\nThe fact that Kelvin could choose to be one of the purchasers of the\nCondominium Unit at a consideration of his own choosing, which might\n\ncreate a conflict of interest.\n128. Mdm\n\nLiew was\n\n87 years old at the time. She had difficulty speaking. The\n\nRespondent should not only have carefully explained these matters but should also\nhave asked if they were in line with her wishes and instructions and how she\nthought they were in her interests, including asking why she felt that it was in her\ninterest for the POAs to be irrevocable by her. In this connection, the Applicant\npointed out that it was the Respondent’s evidence in his 45 AEIC that Mdm Liew\ndid not provide reasons for the POAs to be irrevocable and he did not see any\nnecessity to ask her about that.\n\n129,\n\nIf Mdm Liew was unable to communicate her understanding verbally or in writing,\nthen the Respondent should have called for a pause and asked for her condition to\n\nbe reviewed by an independent medical expert or declined to act:-\n\na.\n\nThe fact that Mdm Liew nodded when the Respondent read the POAs to her,\nin light of these particular POAs that he was asked to draft by Kelvin and the\nfact that one of them dealt with the disposal of her home, should not have\nbeen accepted by the Respondent as evidence that she understood their terms,\nnature and consequences; and\n\nb.\n\nThe fact that she did not ask any questions in light of the issues and concerns\nreferred to above should have raised a red flag.\n\n130. The Respondent said that because his 45 AEIC was drafted for a different purpose\nfrom present proceedings, it did not contain as many details as his AEIC in these\nproceedings. We are unable to accept that. Although he was not a party to Suit 45,\nthe question whether the Respondent properly explained the POAs to Mdm Liew\n\n\fat the Meeting and whether she executed the two POAs with a full understanding\nof their terms and effect was an important issue of fact in that case. Therefore, it\nwould have been important for the Respondent to be as comprehensive as possible\nin his evidence at the High Court Trial about what happened at the Meeting.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent also did not take steps to meet Mdm Liew privately and without\nthe presence of Kelvin and Daniel, who stood to benefit from the POAs, and their\nfamily members\n\nto determine whether Mdm\n\nLiew was not acting under any\n\nmisrepresentation, misapprehension, or improper influence. The Respondent also\n\ndid not ask Mdm Liew whether the POAs accorded with her wishes under any will.\nIn this connection, we were shown photos of the Meeting that were taken by\nJacqueline which showed that Kelvin stood or sat in front of Mdm Liew, to her\nright, and that David and Daniel stood directly in front of Mdm\n\nLiew”, The\n\nproximity was vexing and should have alerted the Respondent to insist on a private\nmeeting with Mdm Liew.\n\n132.\n\nIf the Respondent’s account of what he did at the Meeting is correct, then the\nMeeting could not have taken around 45 minutes (around Spm to 5.45pm).\n\n133.\n\nWe note that the Respondent’s evidence in these proceedings about what he\nclaimed to have explained to Mdm Liew was given after he would have read the\nHigh Court’s decision in Goh Yng Yng Karen, where he gave evidence and findings\nwere made about him and his conduct, and which highlighted what he omitted to\ndo at the Meeting.\n\n134. In coming to these findings, we were conscious of the obiter dicta in K Jayakumar\nNaidu which has been referred to above about family settings. However, even\nthere,\n\nthe\n\nCourt\n\nrecognised\n\nthat\n\nthere\n\nmay\n\nbe\n\nremarkable\n\nor\n\nsuspicious\n\ncircumstances or situations where family members may seek to take advantage of\neach other. We are satisfied that for the reasons set out above, including the unusual\nclauses and features of the POAs, Kelvin and Daniel’s benefits as well as the fact\n\n% photos at Tab 21 KG-I at pages 804-806 of the Complainant's AEIC\n\n\fthat Mdm Liew could not by herself revoke the POAs, this situation called for\n\nspecial vigilance and care.\n135.\n\nWe are unable to agree with the Respondent’s position on the MCA”!,\n\n136.\n\nSection 4 of the MCA states that a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if\nat the material time the person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself\nbecause of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or\nbrain. Section 5(1)(d) of the MCA provides that for the purposes of section 4, a\n\nperson is unable to make a decision for himself or herself if the person is unable to\ncommunicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any\nother means).\n\n137.\n\nAll that section 5(1)(d) does is to list visual illustrations of when it can be said that\na person is unable to make a decision for herself. It does not say, and does not\namount to legislative endorsement, that if a person can communicate by sign\nlanguage or other means, she is able to make a decision for herself. The latter does\n\nnot flow from the former.\n138.\n\nWe are also unable to accept the Respondent’s reliance on evidence of other events\ninvolving Mdm Liew which, according to him, show that Mdm Liew had mental\n\ncapacity. As he accepted”, he did not know about these other events at the Meeting.\n139,\n\nIn coming to our decision, we have not had any regard to the question of whether\n\nMdm Liew had mental capacity at the material time. Unlike Suit 45, where expert\nevidence was led, there was no expert evidence on that issue before us.\n\n140.\n\nIn the circumstances, we find that the Respondent breached Rule 5(5)(b) as alleged\nin the First Charge.\n\n2 paragraph 121 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n2 paragraph 107 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n\n\fTHE SECOND CHARGE\n\n141,\n\nThe Second Charge is as follows:\n\nThat you, Teo\n\nEng Thye, are charged with improper conduct or practice\n\nas an advocate\n\nand solicitor of the Supreme\n\nin\n\nsection\n\n83(2)(b)(i)\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nwhilst you acted for Madam\n\nLegal\n\nCourt of Singapore\n\nProfession\n\nLiew Khoon\n\nAct\n\nas set out\n\n1966\n\nin\n\nthat,\n\nFong (alias Liew Fong) in the\n\npreparation of the 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged\nwith\n\nthe\n\nSupreme\n\nrespectively\nKelvin\n\nwith\n\nCourt\nthe\n\nHC/PA\n\n6414/2017\n\nand\n\nHC/PA\n\nas\n\ndonor\n\nand\n\none\n\nGoh\n\nin breach of Rule\n\n5(2)(c)\n\nof the Legal\n\nProfession\n\nRules\n\nfailed\n\nto\n\nwith\n\nreasonable\n\nto your\n\nclient,\n\nclient\n\nas the attorney,\n\n(Professional\n\nConduct)\n\ndiligence\n\ncompetence\n\nand\n\nthat you permitted\n\nas\n\nyour\n\nthe\n\n2015\n\nin the\n\nyou\n\nprovision\n\nclient to execute\n\nact\n\nof services\n\nthe said\n\n6417/2017\n\nYong\n\nPowers\n\nChiang\n\nin\n\nof Attorney\n\nwithout first taking sufficient steps to satisfy yourself that your client understood\nthe nature and effect of the terms that were set out in the said Powers of Attorney.\n\n142. Under Rule 5(2)(c), a legal practitioner must act with reasonable diligence and\ncompetence in the provision of services to the client.\nTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, solicitors breach their duty to advance their clients’\ninterests with diligence and competence if they fail to advise on the issues peculiar\nto the matter at hand and to ensure that the client understands any risks that may\narise: K Jayakumar Naidu at [1].\n\n144,\n\nThe Applicant argued that there was a breach of Rule 5(2)(c) on two grounds: first,\nthat the Respondent failed to ascertain that Mdm\n\nLiew had sufficient mental\n\ncapacity to make a decision with respect to the POAs;\n\nand second, that the\n\n\fRespondent failed to render proper advice for Mdm Liew to understand her position\nand the risks with respect to the nature and effect of the POAs.\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent’s position on the first ground was that there was no evidence of\n\nmental incapacity and that in any event he relied both on his own independent and\nin-person assessment that Mdm Liew was mentally competent as well as Kelvin’s\nconfirmation that Mdm\n\nLiew was mentally competent. The Respondent’s own\n\nassessment of Mdm Liew’s mental capacity was based on the fact that Mdm Liew\nwas able to communicate by nodding her head.\n146.\n\nWith regard to his position on the second ground, the Respondent maintained that\nhe acted consistently with his duties.\n\nIl.\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n147.\n\nFor the reasons set out under our discussion in relation to the First Charge, we find\nthat the Respondent breached Rule 5(2)(c) as alleged in the Second Charge.\n\n148.\n\nHowever, we should add that because the offending conduct in First Charge and\nthe Second Charge is the same, our finding under the Second Charge does not, in\nour view, add anything to the Respondent's culpability.\n\nTHIRD CHARGE\n149. That\n\nyou,\n\nTeo\n\nEng\n\nThye,\n\nare\n\ncharged\n\nwith\n\nimproper\n\nconduct\n\nor practice\n\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out\nin section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap.\nin breach\nRules\n\nof Rule\n\n2015,\n\nyou\n\n5(2)(c)\n\nof the Legal\n\nfailed\n\nact with\n\nto\n\nProfession\n\nreasonable\n\n161)\n\n1966 in that,\n\n(Professional\n\ndiligence\n\nand\n\nConduct)\n\ncompetence\n\nin the provision of services to your client Madam Liew Khoon Fong (alias Liew\nFong) by failing to take sufficient steps to safeguard the interests of your client by\nensuring that you received your instructions and explained the nature and effect of\nthe 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged with the Supreme Court\nas HC/PA 6414/2017 and HC/PA 6417/2017 respectively with the client as the\n\n\fdonor and one Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin as the attorney, to the client without the\npresence of the attomey\n\nor other family members\n\nof the attorney so as to\n\navoid any undue influence being exerted over the client.\n\nTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n150. The Applicant contended that the Respondent should have met Mdm\nexplained the POAs,\n\nLiew,\n\nand taken her instructions in Kelvin’s and his family’s\n\nabsence. Kelvin and Daniel were beneficiaries and the Respondent should have\n\nbeen concerned that Mdm Liew could not have been able to communicate her\nwishes in front of them. It relied on Jayakumar [68] and Tan Puay Khiang [97].\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent argued that he had asked Mdm Liew thrice if the Meeting could\nproceed in the presence of Kelvin and his family. He said that Kelvin was, after all,\n\nMdm Liew’s son and his family were her family members. He contended that he\nobserved that Mdm Liew appeared relaxed, alert and showed no signs that she was\nnot acting on her own free will.\n\nIL\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n152.\n\nRule 5(2)(c) has been set out above.\n\n153.\n\nIn our discussion above under the First Charge, we said that all the circumstances\nhad to be considered. The allegation that the Respondent should have received his\ninstructions and explained the POAs without the presence of the attorney or other\nfamily members of the attorney cannot be viewed in isolation and was just one of\nthe matters\n\nthat has to be taken\n\ninto account\n\nin determining\n\nwhether\n\nthe\n\nRespondent breached his duties. We are not satisfied that a charge based only on\nthis one aspect of his conduct is sufficient to amount to a breach of Rule 5(2)(c).\n\n154,\n\nIn the circumstances, we dismiss this charge.\n\nTH C)\n\nGI\n\n\f155.\n\nThat\n\nyou,\n\nTeo\n\nEng\n\nThye,\n\nare charged\n\nwith\n\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\n\nimproper\n\nyou\n\nacted\n\nYong\n\nChiang\n\nKelvin\n\nArdmore\n\nPark\n\nfor\n\nMadam\nand Goh\n\n#36-02,\n\nLiew\nSok\n\nSingapore\n\nKhoon\n\nNgoh\n\n1966 (Cap.\nFong\n\nJacqueline\n\n259962,\n\nor practice\n\nCourt of Singapore as set out\n\nin section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act\nwhilst\n\nconduct\n\nwhere\n\n(alias\n\n161) in that,\nLiew\n\nFong),\n\nin the purchase\n\nthere\n\nwas\n\nof 1\n\na diversity\n\nof\n\ninterests that existed between the parties, you failed to advance Mdm Liew Khoon\nFong’s (alias Liew Fong) interests unaffected by the interest of Goh Yong Chiang\nKelvin and/or Goh Sok Ngoh Jacqueline, by removing Mdm Liew’s name from\nthe\n\nOption\n\nproperty,\n\nto\n\nwhich\n\nPurchase\n\ndated\n\nis a breach\n\n1\n\nDecember\n\nof Rule\n\n20(5)\n\n2017\nand\n\nin respect\nRule\n\n20(6)\n\nof the\n\nsaid\n\nof the\n\nLegal\n\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015.\n\nTHE PARTIES’ POSTIONS\n156.\n\nThe Applicant argued that the Respondent’s position that he was acting only for\nKelvin in the purchase of the Condominium Unit is mistaken because he admitted\nthat he was acting for Kelvin, Jacqueline and Mdm Liew when the Condominium\nOTP\n\nwas\n\nexercised.\n\nThis was\n\nalso seen in his letter of 8 December\n\n2017 to\n\nSterlingLaw when the Condominium OTP was exercised”. He therefore was under\nan obligation to inform Mdm Liew, his client, when her name was removed as a\npurchaser of the Condominium Unit.\n\n157.\n\nIt contended\n\nthat a diversity\n\nof interests arose when\n\nKelvin\n\ninstructed the\n\nRespondent to remove Mdm Liew’s name as a purchaser and that that removal was\nto Mdm\n\nLiew’s disadvantage and conversely to the advantage of Kelvin and\n\nJacqueline. Further, as the Respondent would have been aware that Kelvin’s\n\ninstructions conflicted with the 2™ POA, he should have directly informed Mdm\nLiew of Kelvin’s instructions, which would result in Mdm Liew losing her most\n\nsignificant asset, the Namly Property”*.\n\n® paragraphs 76, 77 and 78 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n» paragraphs 81 and 82 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n\n\f158.\n\nThe Complainant testified that the Respondent should have informed Mdm Liew,\nhis client, that her name was to be removed under the Amended Condominium\nOl? and that as a result, she would no longer own a property under her name. The\nRespondent should also have ceased to act in the conveyancing transaction or\nceased to act for Mdm Liew and obtain her informed consent, in writing, for him\n\nto continue to act in the conveyancing transaction».\n159,\n\nInstead, the Respondent sent the 24 January 2018 letter to seek the vendor’s\nconsent for Mdm Liew’s name to be removed although he was aware that Mdm\n\nLiew might be prejudiced”®.\n160.\n\nThe Respondent made the same arguments for the Fourth Charge and the Fifth\nCharge.\n\n161. He denied there was a conflict of interests in representing Mdm Liew, Kelvin and\nJacqueline because Mdm Liew received fair consideration for the sale of the Namly\nProperty. Thus, there was common\n\ninterest among\n\nthe three to purchase the\n\nCondominium Unit for the family’s residential purposes and Kelvin and Jacqueline\nbecame the Respondent's clients as purchasers of the Condominium Unit only after\nthe original plan to purchase that unit under the terms of the 2\" POA, read with the\n\n1° POA, was aborted”’,\n162. He argued that the Option to Purchase that was exercised on 8 December 2017 was\nnot exercised pursuant to the 2\" POA. By that time, he had been told that the\n“money most likely will not come in”, In any event, the 2\" POA was contingent on\nthe sale proceeds of the sale of the Namly Property being used to purchase the\nCondominium Unit’. He was also of the view that, as Mdm Liew would no longer\nbe a party to the purchase of the Condominium Unit, there would be no prejudice\n\n%5 paragraph 109 of the Complainant's AEIC\n28 paragraph 89 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n» paragraphs 146 and 154 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n% paragraph 156 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n\n\fto her and as such there was no need for him to cease acting for Mdm Liew or the\n\nothers as there was no conflict of interests”.\n163. The Respondent also contended that, since he believed that the POAs were valid\nand enforceable, he was entitled to take instructions from Kelvin as Mdm Liew’s\n\nattomney in the purchase of the Condominium Unit.>° He also pointed out that the\nproceeds of sale were to be used for the purchase of a single-storey condominium\n\nunit and the 2™ POA did not specify any particular address of that unit.\"\n164. The Respondent said that when he wrote the letter dated 24 January 2018 to\nSterlingLaw, he acted in his capacity as Kelvin’s solicitor in the purchase of the\nCondominium Unit. This, according to him, was because the Complainant had\ncommenced Suit 45 against Kelvin who had informed him that Mdm Liew would\nno longer be a party to the purchase of the Condominium Unit which would be\npurchased in the names of Kelvin and Jacqueline, that that purchase would be\n\nfinanced by his and Jacqueline’s own savings and that he wanted the Respondent to\n\nact for Kelvin and Jacqueline in the purchase of the Condominium Unit®?.\n165.\n\nThe Respondent also said that as the 2014 LPA had not been activated at the time,\n\nthere was no need to inform Mdm Liew of the removal of her name, the non-\n\ninclusion of Daniel’s name, and the inclusion of Jacqueline’s name*>.\nIl.\n\nOURFINDINGS\n\n166. Rules 20(5) and 20(6) provide that where a legal practitioner acts for 2 or more\ndifferent parties in a matter or transaction, and a diversity of interests arises between\nthose parties during the course of the retainer for the matter or transaction, he or she\nmust throughout the remainder of the course of the retainer for the matter or\ntransaction continue to be vigilant of any conflict or potential conflict between the\n\n?° paragraph 146 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n® paragraph 140 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n\n3 paragraphs 140 and 142 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n® paragraphs 58 and 59 of the Respondent's AEIC\n® paragraphs 141 and 142 of the Respondent's Closing Submissions\n\n\finterests of any of the relevant parties and inform each relevant party in the matter\nor transaction if, in the course of the retainer, the legal practitioner has difficulty in\n\nadvising on and dealing with the relevant parties’ divergent interests competently,\nevenly and consistently.\n\n167. The following discussion is on the assumption that there was in law a solicitor-client\n\nrelationship between the Respondent and Mdm Liew. We will come back to that\nbelow.\n\n168. Before 24 January 2018, when the Respondent wrote to SterlingLaw to say that his\nclients intended to withdraw Mdm\n\nLiew’s name\n\nfrom the purchase of the\n\nCondominium Unit, he had been aware of the letters from Templars Law to\nWongPartnership dated 15 December 2017, 22 December 2017, 5 January 2018 and\n10 January 2018.\n\n169. The Respondent was also aware of the following: First, the Complainant claimed to\n\nbe the sole donee under the 2014 LPA, and that she claimed that Kelvin had moved\nMdm Liew to an unknown location. Second, Dr Ang had issued a medical report\nwhich said that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia which started around the\n\nmiddle of 2017**. Third, the Complainant’s position was that the 1‘ POA was\ninvalid and unenforceable, that Mdm Liew lacked the mental capacity to decide to\nsell the Namly Property, and that her lawyers had asked that the sale be stopped and\nhad asked WongPartnership if they had instructions to accept service of process on\n\nbehalf of their client.\n170. He therefore found himself in a position where, in acting for Mdm Liew, Kelvin\nand Jacqueline, he had secured for her an interest in the Condominium Unit and\nKelvin was now asking him to divest one of his clients of her interest. Those\ninstructions could not have been given under the POAs meant to facilitate the sale\nof the Namly Property and the purchase, with Mdm Liew being one of the buyers,\nof a single-storey condominium unit. The Respondent would also have known that\n\n* page 1070 of the Complainant's AEIC\n\n\fthe fact that Daniel’s name was not added to the Condominium OTP was not\nconsistent with Mdm Liew’s alleged intention to make a gift to him.\n171. Further, he had been put on notice of the matters in Templars Law’s letters. He\nwould have known that, should the 1 POA be said to be invalid because of Mdm\nLiew’s alleged mental condition, that would also call into question the validity of\n\nthe 2\" POA which was signed at the same time.\n172. He therefore found himself in a position where if the POAs were valid, and he\nwithdrew Mdm Liew’s name, he would affect her interests. If the POAs were not\nvalid, he could not act on Kelvin’s instructions, which were purportedly given under\nthe POAs, to remove her name.\n\n173. In these circumstances, he was under a duty to check the position with Mdm Liew\nto ensure that there was no divergence of interests between her on the one hand and\nKelvin and his family, on the other. He was under a duty to satisfy himself that she\ncontinued, after the POAs, to have the mental capacity to instruct him in the sale of\nthe Namly Property and the purchase of the Condominium Unit, as well as ask Mdm\nLiew if the purchase in Kelvin, Jacqueline and her names was consistent with her\n\nintention to make a gift to Daniel, and whether she agreed with giving up her interest\nin the Condominium Unit. If the Respondent had not been given access to her or\nwas unable to properly obtain instructions, he should have ceased acting for all his\n\nclients.\n174, However, this does not mean that the Fourth Charge has been made out.\n175. These Rules, and the Fourth Charge, are premised on there being a retainer and a\n\nsolicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and Mdm Liew at the material\ntime. In fact, the Applicant’s Closing Submissions emphasise the Respondent’s\n\nduty to his “client”.\n\n% see eg paragraph 88\n\n\f176. It is not the Applicant’s case that the Rules apply even where there is no retainer\n\nbut that a solicitor believed that there was one.\n177. If, as is the Complainant’s case, the POAs were null and void, and the High Court\nin Suit 45 has found them to be null and void, then the question which arises is\n\nwhether there was in law a solicitor-client relationship between the Respondent and\nMdm Liew after she signed the POAs which have been found by the High Court to\nbe null and void.\n178. The fact that he informed SterlingLaw that he acted for Mdm Liew and that he\n\npurported to act for Mdm Liew when the Condominium OTP was accepted and\nthereafter does not mean that there was that relationship in law or that in law, he\nhad been retained by her.\n179. As this issue was not addressed by either the Applicant or the Respondent, at a posthearing conference on 19 July 2022, we raised this for the parties to consider their\n\npositions on it since it affected the 4\" to 7\" Charges. We asked the Applicant’s\ncounsel whether it wished to proceed with these charges. The Applicant’s counsel\nsaid that he will consider the matter and take instructions and get back to us. The\nRespondent’s counsel said that he did not address this point because of an oversight.\n180. By a letter dated 26 July 2022, the Applicant’s counsel said that the Applicant would\nlike to proceed on these charges. In that letter, the Applicant’s counsel referred to\nMahidon Nichiar bte Mohd Ali and others v Dawood Sultan Kamaldin [2015] 5\nSLR\n\n62 and the disciplinary proceedings which followed\n\nfrom that decision,\n\nreported as The Law Society of Singapore v Harjeet Singh [2016] SGDT 9. He\nargued that in light of these cases, the Applicant was of the view that there “could\nstill be a breach” of the relevant Rules referred to in these charges.\n181. With respect, we are unable to see how either case is of assistance. In Mahidon,\nthere was a solicitor-client relationship between the appellants and the solicitor\nbefore the deed in issue, i.e., the RBI Deed, came to be executed: see [17]. It was in\nthat context that the Court of Appeal considered the scope of the solicitor’s duties\n\nand whether he had breached them. Those findings had no impact on the solicitor-\n\n\fclient relationship. Unlike the present case, it was not a situation where the\nsolicitor’s authority was based on the very document which the solicitor was found\nnot to have properly advised.\n182. As we set out above, the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. We are not\nsatisfied that the Applicant has discharged that burden to show that even though the\nPOAs have been found to be null and void, there continued thereafter to be a\nsolicitor-client relationship in law between the Respondent and Mdm Liew.\n183.\n\nFor these reasons, we dismiss the Fourth Charge.\n\nEIFTH CHARGE\n184. That you,\n\nTeo\n\nEng\n\nThye,\n\nare charged\n\nwith\n\nimproper\n\nconduct\n\nor practice\n\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section\n83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 in that, whilst you acted for Madam\nLiew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in the purchase of 1 Ardmore Park #36-02,\nSingapore 259962, you failed to inform the client of all information known to you\nthat may reasonably affect the interests of the client in respect of the purchase of 1\nArdmore Park #36-02, Singapore 259962 in particular of the removal of her name,\nthe non-inclusion of the name of Daniel Goh Eng Sheng and the inclusion of the\nname of Goh Sok Ngoh Jacqueline from the Option to Purchase dated 1 December\n2017 in respect of the said property, which is a breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n\n185. The Applicant argued that the Respondent had failed to inform Mdm Liew that her\ninstructions under the 2 POA were not being followed by Kelvin, the attorney,\nbecause the Condominium Unit was purchased with Jacqueline and not Daniel. It\nalso argued that the Respondent had assumed a\n\nresponsibility to Mdm\n\npurchase the Condominium Unit,\n\n% paragraphs 89 and 94 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n\nLiew to\n\n\f186. The Respondent made the same arguments as he did in relation to the Fourth\nCharge.\n\nI.\n\nQUR FINDINGS\n\n187. Rule 5(2)(b) has been set out above.\n\n188. This charge is premised on there being a solicitor-client relationship between the\nRespondent and Mdm Liew at the time of the alleged failure.\n\n189. For the reasons set out under the Fourth Charge in relation to whether the Applicant\nhas\n\ndischarged\n\nits burden\n\nto show\n\nthat there was\n\nin law\n\na solicitor-client\n\nrelationship, we dismiss this charge.\nSIXTH CHARGE\n\n190, That\n\nyou,\n\nTeo\n\nEng\n\nThye,\n\nare\n\ncharged\n\nwith\n\nimproper\n\nconduct\n\nor practice\n\nas an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore as set out in section\n\n83(2)(b)(i) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 in that, whilst you acted for Madam\nLiew Khoon Fong (alias Liew Fong) in the preparation, execution and registration\nof 2 Powers of Attorney dated 20 November 2017 lodged with the Supreme Court\nas HC/PA 6414/2017 and HC/PA\n\n6417/2017 respectively with the client as the\n\ndonor and one Goh Yong Chiang Kelvin as the attorney, you failed to inform the\nclient of all information known to you that may reasonably affect the interests of\nthe client in respect of the said Powers of Attorney in particular of the medical report\nprepared by Dr Ang Yong Guan dated 30 December 2017 and correspondence from\nTemplars Law LLC dated 12 February 2018 relating to the alleged lack of mental\ncapacity of the client as at the time of execution of the said Powers of Attorney,\nwhich is a breach of Rule 5(2)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\n\nRules 2015.\n\n\fTHE PARTIES’ POSITIONS\n191. The Applicant contended that the Respondent knew from correspondence which\n\nwas forwarded to him that the Complainant had challenged Mdm Liew’s mental\n\ncapacity*’, It argued that the Respondent was privy to the Dr Ang’s medical report\ndated 30 December\n\n2017 which\n\nsaid that Mdm\n\nsignificantly deteriorated since the middle of 2017\n\nLiew’s mental\n\ncapacity had\n\nand of the Complainant’s\n\ncomplaint that Kelvin had concealed Mdm Liew from her’®.\n192. The Applicant contends that, in spite of the above, the Respondent failed to inform\n\nMdm Liew of this challenge and instead informed Kelvin*®.\n193. The Applicant further said that the Respondent should have been put on notice of\nthe possibility that Mdm Liew was suffering from dementia which started around\n\nthe middle of 2017 and did not inform her of that to obtain her instructions. It was\nwrong for the Respondent to assume that the Complainant’s concerns were entirely\n\nwithout substance and did not even consider that there was a risk that Mdm Liew\nhad not authorised Kelvin to find a lawyer to prepare the POAs and yet proceeded\n\nto forward the correspondence to Kelvin®,\n194, The Respondent argued that when he received the letter dated 10 January 2018 from\n\nWongPartnership, he forwarded it to Kelvin, who was Mdm Liew’s attorney, to ask\nif there had been a change in Mdm Liew’s mental capacity since the Meeting.\n\nKelvin denied that there was any change*\".\n195. Insofar as Templars Law’s letter dated 12 February 2018 was concemed, the\nRespondent maintained that as the information sought was protected by solicitor-\n\nclient privilege and as the Respondent was of the opinion that the 2014 LPA had\n\n» paragraph 100 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n%* paragraphs 98 and 104 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n%° paragraph 100 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n\n“ paragraph 108 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n* paragraph 158 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\fnot been properly activated, there was no need for him to respond and therefore no\n\nneed for him to take Mdm Liew’s instructions on that letter.\ni.\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n196. Rule 5(2)(b) has been set out above.\n\n197. This charge is premised on there being a solicitor-client relationship between the\nRespondent and Mdm Liew at the time of the alleged failure.\n198. For the reasons set out under the Fourth Charge in relation to whether the Applicant\n\nhas discharged\n\nits burden to show that there was in law a solicitor-client\n\nrelationship, we dismiss this charge.\nSEVENTH CHARGE\n\n199.

The Applicant argued that whether the Respondent complied with the subpoena is\n\nirrelevant to this charge“. It said that the Respondent should not have sought\ninstructions in relation to the subpoena from Kelvin because he had no authority to\nmake decisions and act for Mdm Liew with respect to the subpoena. Further, since\nKelvin was a defendant in Suit 45, it was improper for the Respondent to take advice\n\nfrom Kelvin’s solicitors*.\n201.\n\nThe Complainant said“ that the Respondent had conceded during the hearing before\nthe Inquiry Committee (Transcript dated 25 March 20121 page 56) that he should\n\nhave taken instructions from Mdm Liew and not from Kelvin, who was represented\nby Drew & Napier. She also said that the Respondent did not advance Mdm Liew’s\n\ninterests as he disclosed the subpoena to Kelvin and obtained advice from Kelvin’s\nlawyers as to the manner in which he should comply with the subpoena, even though\n\nKelvin was a defendant in Suit 45. She said that since the Respondent had received\nthe 2014 LPA by then, he should have known that Kelvin had no authority to make\ndecisions and act for Mdm Liew with respect to the subpoena.\n\n202. The Respondent argued that he believed that he was entitled to take instructions\nfrom\n\nKelvin\n\nand/or his solicitors because\n\nKelvin was\n\na party to Suit 45, the\n\ndocuments that were requested were protected by solicitor-client privilege and that\nthe POAs were valid and enforceable. Further, because Suit 45 was to determine\nwhether Mdm Liew had mental capacity, he continued to take instructions from\n\nKelvin**.\nIL.\n\nOUR FINDINGS\n\n203.\n\nSection 83 (2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act 1966 states that due cause may be\nshown by proof that an advocate and solicitor has been guilty of such misconduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a\n\nmember of an honourable profession.\n\n2 paragraph 113 of the Applicant's Closing Submissions\n\n* paragraph 115 of the Applicant’s Closing Submissions\n“ paragraphs 145 and 146 of the Complainant's AEIC\n\n*5 paragraphs 167 and 170 of the Respondent’s Closing Submissions\n\n\f204. We do not agree that this Charge has been made out.\n205. When the Respondent was served with a subpoena, his interests were potentially\ndivergent from those of the Complainant, who was representing Mdm Liew. Suit\n45 was an action to nullify the POAs. The Respondent’s conduct was going to be\n\nsquarely in issue, and he would likely be criticised. In our view, he was fully entitled\nto speak to whoever he wished, including Kelvin and any law firm which felt able\n\nto advise him on his own position and exposure.\n206. We disagree with the assertion that the Respondent should have taken instructions\nfrom\n\nMdm\n\nLiew,\n\nwho\n\nwas\n\neffectively the plaintiff in Suit 45, through the\n\nComplainant who initially acted pursuant to the 2014 LPA and later as executrix of\nMdm Liew’s estate, and therefore on the other side of the Suit.\n\n207. There is another reason we do not agree that this charge has been made out. This\ncharge is premised\n\non there being a\n\nsolicitor-client relationship between the\n\nRespondent and Mdm Liew at the time of the alleged failure.\n208. For the reasons set out under the Fourth Charge in relation to whether the Applicant\nhas\n\ndischarged\n\nits burden\n\nto show\n\nthat there was\n\nin law a\n\nsolicitor-client\n\nrelationship, we dismiss this charge.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n209. In conclusion, we find that the First and Second Charges have been made out. We\n\ndismiss the remaining Charges.\n210. In considering whether cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists, we\nhave had regard to the fact that it was not the Applicant’s case and was not put to\n\nthe Respondent that he acted with any deliberation, dishonesty, or for improper\nmotives. It appears from the Respondent’s evidence that he appears to have been\ninfluenced about the scope of his obligations by the small fee that he would eam\nfrom preparing and attending to the execution of the POAs.

The attendance in chambers concluded shortly after noon on 13 September 2018, and at 1.22pm, TALLP filed SUM 4260 of 2018 in OS 1100 (the Recusal Application) for the learned JC to recuse himself from further hearing the proceedings.\n\nThe Respondent filed an affidavit in support the next day (the Recusal Affidavit) which contained allegations against other legal practitioners without letting them have the opportunity to respond to the said allegations. The Respondent had also made further statements against the learned JC in the Recusal Affidavit which was disrespectful to the Court.\n\nThe recusal application was heard on 25 September 2018 before the learned JC and was dismissed. An affidavit opposing the application was filed by the late David Kong who was the solicitor for three of the siblings. The Respondent took umbrage at statements made in David Kong’s affidavit and filed a police report accusing him of perjury.\n\nThe solicitors for the siblings of SPG jointly made a complaint to the Law Society.\n\nThe Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) presided by Mr Tan Chuan Thye SC and Mr Chong Yee Leong as DT member to investigate the complaint.\n\nThe following charges were preferred against the Respondent:\n\nUnder DT 6 of 2019\n\nFirst Charge\n\nFor breaching Rule 29 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (PCR) in permitting an affidavit to be filed on behalf of TALLP in HC/OS 1100/2017 which contained allegations against other legal practitioners without allowing them an opportunity to respond to the said allegations.\n\nSecond Charge (Alternative Second Charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA)\n\nFor breaching Rule 13(2) of the PCR in being disrespectful of the Court in the making of certain statements in respect of the learned JC in an affidavit filed in HC/OS 1100/2017.\n\nUnder DT 6A of 2019\n\nFirst Charge (Alternative First Charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA)\n\nFor breaching Rule 13(2) of the PCR in filing or causing to be filed documents against the Court’s directions and orders, which are discourteous of a Court.\n\nSecond Charge (Alternative Second Charge under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA)\n\nFor breaching Rule 29 of the PCR in having permitted documents to be filed on behalf of TALLP in HC/OS 1100/2017 containing allegations against other legal practitioners without allowing them an opportunity to respond to the said allegations.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions\n\nThe DT’s findings are summarised below:\n\n\n\nThe DT cited dicta by Andrew Phang JA in China Insurance Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd [2005] 2 SLR(R) 509 and Law Society of Singapore v Tan Buck Chye Dave [2007] 1 SLR(R) 581 to remind counsels that “… one can disagree and yet not be disagreeable…” and that there should be “… more civility within the legal profession itself …” and “… more camaraderie within the profession …”.\n\nCouncil accepted the findings and recommendations of the DT, and imposed a financial penalty of S$10,000 on the Respondent.\n\nDissatisfied, the Respondent sought to review and set aside the decision of the Council to impose a financial penalty of S$10,000 in HC/OS 432/2021 (OS 432). The Judge in OS 432 found that the penalty imposed was appropriate and justifiable.\n\nThe Respondent appealed against the decision of the Judge in OS 432 (the Appeal). The Appeal was dismissed on 12 September 2022 with costs of $30,000 (all-in) payable to the Law Society.*\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n\n*The decision of the Court of Appeal can be found in Tan Beng Hui Carolyn v Law Society of Singapore [2023] SGCA 7.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawsoc-mc-assets.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dtr-2023-05.pdf","pdf-content":"\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f\f12th\n\nNovember\n\n\fAnnex 1\n\n\f38\n\n\f39\n\n\f40\n\n\fAnnex 2\n\n\f29\n\n\f30\n\n\f31\n\n\fAnnex 3\n\n\f52\n\n\f53\n\n\f54\n\n\f55\n\n\f56\n\n\f58\n\n\f","timestamp":"2023-05-01T04:00:01+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-may-2023/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Ong Lian-Yi Gregory (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-ong-lian-yi-gregory-respondent\">In the Matter of Ong Lian-Yi Gregory (Respondent), <strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Ms Scarlett Merida Xi Wei Yuan (<strong>the</strong> <strong>Complainant</strong>).</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-1434542897\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>On or around 27 October 2015, the Complainant was served with a statutory demand for a sum of S$970,547.26 (<strong>Statutory Demand</strong>) allegedly due to one Ang Boon Kim t/a ABK Leasing (<strong>ABKL</strong>) under a loan agreement.</p>\n<p>The Complainant wished to dispute the alleged debt, and met the Respondent on 28 October 2015 and 29 October 2015 respectively to hand him relevant documents and pay a deposit of S$7,000.00 with instructions to file an application to set aside the Statutory Demand (<strong>Setting Aside Application</strong>).</p>\n<p>From 1 November 2015 to 4 December 2015, the Complainant and the Respondent exchanged various e-mails and WhatsApp messages wherein the Respondent had provided assurances to the Complainant that there should be no issues with her Setting Aside Application.</p>\n<p>The Complainant was made a bankrupt on 24 December 2015 and the Complainant terminated the Respondent’s engagement on 18 January 2016.

He had added that he verily believed that\nhis conduct that is the subject matter of these proceedings does not amount to\nmisconduct that warrants sanction pursuant to the Act, and on this basis, he\nrespectfully requested that this Tribunal acquit him of the charges made against him.\n\n\f11\n14.\n\nThe following bundles were tendered at the Hearing:\n\n(i)\n\nAgreed Bundle of Documents dated 7 March 2022, which included the ASOF\nat pages 407-412 (the ABOD\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\n2022;\n\n(iv)\n\nand\n\n(v)\n\n2022.\n\nB.\n\n15.\n\n2022;\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nAt the Hearing, Counsel for the Law Society, Ms Fong, had summarised the salient\nbackground facts with some details which were not found in the ASOF. However,\n\nmind. Mr Sreenivasan S.C. for the Respondent confirmed that he does not dispute\nthese facts even though they were not in the ASOF.2 In any case, the facts were\ndocumented in the ABOD.\n\n16.\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena [2013] SGHC 5 ( Selena\nChiong ) wa\nbe sufficiently grave and could be considered to be a breach of an essential duty of an\nadvocate and solicitor such that it is inexcusable and would constitute professional\nmisconduct.3 Ms Fong also cited a textbook authority authored by Jeffrey Pinsler SC.4\n\n2\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 32 at line 17 and page 33 at line 2, where Counsel for the Respondent was\ndealing with the limited issue of the emails of 4 November 2015.\n3\n[14].\n4\n[17].\n\n\f12\n\n17.\n\nThe decision of Zhou Tong v Public Prosecutor\n\nZhou Tong\n\nwas next referred to. Members of the profession have to be competent and diligent in\nadvising their clients when representing their interests. This fundamental professional\nresponsibility requires every solicitor to thoroughly familiarise himself with the facts\n, analyse the issues carefully, research the applicable law and then\n. Professional incompetence and\n\nconsider how best to\n\nindolence are no less a cause for concern as compared with cases of dishonesty.\n\n18.\n\nIt was submitted that the Commentary on the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules 2015 at [05.047] summarised what professionalism encompasses in the context\nof competence and diligence pursuant to rule 5 of the Legal Profession (Professional\nLPPCR\n\n5\n\nMs Fong noted that in the same commentary\n\nat [05.041], it was said that the duty of reasonable diligence also involved completing\nwork for the client as soon as reasonably possible. It was said that this is also\nprescribed in rule 17(2)(b) of the LPPCR.6\n\n19.\nWritten Submissions, it was urged that we should make a finding that the\n\ndo, namely, to set aside the Statutory Demand. He was aware of the deadline as\nevidenced by the correspondence. Yet, after the Complainant had provided the further\ninformation on 4 November 2015 to address the\n\n5\n6\n\n[19].\n[20].\n\ncomments and\n\n\f13\nquestions about the background facts relating to her case, there was simply no\nresponse from or follow-up by him. It was the Complainant who followed up and\nsought updates.7\n\n20.\nqueries and requests in a manner that disclosed a lack of care and truthfulness. The\nfollowing are some instances:8\n\n(i)\n\nIn his response on 9 November 2015, he said that he was studying [her]\ncase\".\n\n(ii)\n\nOn 10 November 2015, he acknowledged that the deadline to set aside had\narrived but merely sought to assure the Complainant that an extension of\ntime could be sought so long as it is filed within a reasonable time\n\n(iii)\n\nWhile the Respondent told the Complainant in his email response on 2\nDecember 2015 that he was applying for an extension of time to file the setting\naside application, no such step was in fact taken. The Respondent s written\nexplanation dated 26 February 2021 to the Inquiry Panel, had confirmed this\nfact.\n\n(iv)\n\nEven up to 18 January 2016, when the Complainant realised that she had been\nmade a bankrupt, it was pointed out that the Respondent had continued to\nstring the Complainant along. There was no attempt on the Respondent\nto explain the delay. Instead, he sought to pin the blame on the Complainant.\n\n7\n8\n\n[22].\n\n\f14\n21.\n\nIt was contended that the Respondent was very much aware that the failure to set aside\nthe Statutory Demand could result ina bankruptcy application being taken out against\nthe Complainant. Notwithstanding this, he took no steps to advance the Complainant s\ncase nor to protect her interests beyond the initial enquiry for the chronology and\nto study the\ncase\nto have, at the very least, written to the creditor s solicitors to inform them that the\nComplainant was disputing the debt and would be applying to set aside the Statutory\nDemand or steps would be taken to apply for an extension of time.9 He was aware of\nthe need to set aside but had simply not made any attempt to prepare the application.10\nCourt searches were not even done to ascertain if the creditor had commenced\nbankruptcy proceedings.11 It was argued that the draconian consequences resulting\nfrom failure to set aside the Statutory Demand would have left the Complainant\nirremediably prejudiced. In fact, she was adjudged bankrupt on 24 December 2015\nand had to spend the next two and a half years or so instituting proceedings to set aside\nthe Statutory Demand and annul the bankruptcy order made against her.\n\n22.\n\nThe Law Society also contended that given the scope of the retainer (which was to set\naside the Statutory Demand) it was incumbent on the Respondent to make the\napplication, and if necessary, to seek an extension of time to do so. The\ninitial inquiries to understand the case and subsequent silence (apart from furnishing\nfalse assurances when pressed for updates) were not sufficient to discharge his\nprofessional responsibility.12\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n[24].\n\n\f15\n23.\n\nIn respect of the Alternative 1st Charge, Counsel for the Law Society stated that the\nthe retainer (i.e. to set aside the\nStatutory Demand within the prescribed time) and the gross delay in his management\nof the case would clearly fall afoul of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, given that an\n\nLPA.13\n\n24.\n\nIn respect of the Alternative 2nd Charge, the Law\n\ncase is that the Respondent\n\nfailed to keep the Complainant reasonably informed of the application to set aside the\n\nfailure to apply for extension of time was patently unbefitting of an advocate and\nsolicitor under Section 83(2)(h). He was well aware of the avenue of applying for an\nextension if he needed more time to understand the matter.14\n\n25.\n\nCounsel for the Law Society further noted that the present case bears striking\nsimilarity to the cases of Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R)\n466 Ng Chee Sing and Selena Chiong. In Ng Chee Sing, the Court of Three Judges\nhad found that the solicitor had failed to carry out what he had been instructed to do\nunder his retainer. In Selena Chiong, the respondent had made false representations as\nto the status of the matter.15 In both cases, the solicitor was found guilty of grossly\nimproper conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Act and/or misconduct unbefitting of\nan advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(h) of the Act. 16 In our case, it was\nsubmitted that the Alternative 2nd Charge was similarly made out.\n\n13\n14\n\n[38].\n[39].\n\n15\n16\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 105 at lines 15-18.\n\n\f16\n\n26.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Tribunal informed counsel for the Law Society that we were\nminded to hear arguments for sentencing at the same sitting. Counsel for the Law\nSociety stated that her instructions were to await the outcome before arguing on\nsentencing. Nonetheless, should the Tribunal find that sanctions were necessary, she\nsubmitted that there should at least be a fine, subject to instructions from the Law\nSociety.17\n\nC.\n\n27.\n\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nAt the outset, Counsel for the Respondent stressed that the standard of proof\nbeyond reasonable doubt 18 It was argued that\nif the Law Society was arguing that there was untruthfulness that elevated the various\ncommunications into misconduct, the burden rested on it to prove its case. There\nshould be no adverse inference to be drawn against the Respondent.19\n\n28.\n\nIt was noted that the necessity of adhering to the criminal standard was because\nmoral censure and professional disapprobation cast upon the solicitor [upon a finding\nas\nwas stated in Law Society of Singapore v Dhanwant Singh [2020] 4 SLR 736.20\n\n17\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 105 at lines 15-18.\n\n18\n19\n20\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 105 at lines 19-22.\n\n\f17\n29.\n\nThe case of Law Society of Singapore v Harjeet Singh\n\nHarjeet\n\nthat:21\n\nSingh\n\negregious than\ns 83(2)(h) which was\ndescribed in Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466\n\nnot fall within any of the other enumerated grounds but is nevertheless\nconsidered\n\n30.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent also highlighted that mere negligence does not amount to\nmisconduct and does not warrant sanction under the Act. There are different degrees\nof negligence. Whether or not a particular degree of negligence amounts to\nmisconduct must be determined by viewing the gravity of the negligent act in the\ncontext of the matter whilst taking into account all the circumstances of the case. It\nwas observed in Law Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar [2012] 4 SLR 1232 that an\n\ncompensation but not censure. The professional lapse must be grave if it is to attract\ndisciplinary sanction (see [1] above). Plainly, several serious lapses in the course of\na professional engagement would invite serious consequences, including disciplinary\nsanction(s). 22\n\n21\n22\n\n-[34].\n\n\f18\n31.\ndoes not amount to misconduct that warrants sanction pursuant to the Act. The\nfailure to file the Setting Aside Application and/or the EOT Application\nwas his one lapse and would, at worst, amount to a one-off act of innocent bungling\nwant of skill 23\n\n32.\n\nIn this regard, the present case can be distinguished from Selena Chiong.24 It was also\nnoted that the respondent in Selena Chiong committed several lapses in her\nengagement with the complainant. The lapses included providing the complainant\nwith inappropriate advice, failing to advice the client as well as misleading the\ncomplainant. The Court of Three Judges had noted that there was a pattern of chronic\n\nas a solicitor\n\n33.\n\n25\n\nIt was submitted that in contrast, the Respondent here had only committed one lapse,\ni.e. his failure to file the setting aside application or the application to seek extension of\ntime to do so. Unlike in Selena Chiong, his conduct does not involve the failure to\nproperly advise the Complainant, or misleading her. He was not guilty of any pattern\nof chronic irresponsibility or problem of attitude. The Respondent had also not\nattempted to provide excuses for his conduct or justify his actions. He has admitted to\nthe factual averments of these charges. He initiated the filing of the ASOF to assist\nwith streamlining these proceedings so that the Complainant would not be subjected\nto prolonged proceedings.26\n\n23\n24\n25\n26\n\ns Closing Submissions at [55].\n-[57].\n[57].\n[57].\n\n\f19\n\n34.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent also submitted that while it is true the Respondent did not\ndo as he had promised, it did not make him dishonest. Counsel for the Respondent\nspecifically referred to an email communication dated 2 December 2015 where he told\nthe Complainant that\n\nare applying for extension of time to file the setting aside\n\napplication. Should not be a problem. Yes, we will send a receipt at the same time\nwhen we have prepared all the court papers which you have to sign at our offices on\na date to be fixed\n\n27\n\nIt was submitted that this email clearly showed that there were\n\nstill things to be done.28\n\n35.\n\nAs for the Alternative 2nd\nthe Alternative 1st Charge would apply.29\n\n36.\n\nIn the circumstances, it was submitted that the Respondent should be acquitted of the\nProceeded Charges.\n\n37.\n\nIn the alternative, should the Tribunal find that one or both of the Proceeded Charges\nhave been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, Counsel for the Respondent submitted\nthat the appropriate punishment for each misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and\nsolicitor would have to depend on the circumstances of the case as a whole. In this\nregard, Counsel for the Respondent cited several cases that stand for the proposition\ncases involving grossly improper conduct without dishonesty or deceit will\n\n27\n\nAgreed Bundle of Documents at page 462.\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 95 at line 8.\n29\n[66].\n28\n\n\f20\ngenerally attract a monetary penalty\n\n30\n\nHe also reserved his right to file a mitigation\n\nplea at the appropriate juncture, if necessary.31\n\n38.\n\nMr Sreenivasan SC urged the Tribunal to apply Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine\nGowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR 390.32 He argued that no cause of sufficient\ngravity exists, as the present case does not fall within the category of the\nof complaints that should be referred to the Court of Three Judges.33\n\n39.\n\nInstead, it was submitted that a reprimand or a fine should be imposed. Notably, the\nfine, if imposed, should be on the lower-end.34 The reasons for his submissions are as\nfollows:\n\n(i)\n\nThe charges are closely connected and arise out of the same transaction;\n\n(ii)\n\nThe Complainant terminated her engagement with the Respondent shortly\nafter she found out that a Bankruptcy Order had been made against the\nRespondent. The Respondent therefore did not have the opportunity to remedy\nthe situation;\n\n(iii)\n\nThe Respondent received no financial advantage. He returned to the\nComplainant the Deposit paid and did not charge the Complainant for any\nwork done;\n\n30\n31\n32\n\nRespondent's Bundle of Authorities, Tab 11.\n\n33\n34\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 99 at line 24.\n\n\f21\n(iv)\n\nThe Bankruptcy Order was eventually annulled and the Statutory Demand set\naside;\n\n(v)\n\nThe motive of the Complainant is called into question. The Complaint was\nfiled more than two years after the Bankruptcy Order had been annulled and\nthe Statutory Demand set aside, and almost five years after the Bankruptcy\nApplication had been filed. The Complainant had not offered an explanation\nas to why there was an inordinate delay in the filing of the Complaint. Any\ncomplaint she wished to make ought to have been filed earlier;\n\n(vi)\n\nNo allegations of dishonesty have been raised against the Respondent;\n\n(vii)\n\nThe Respondent has no antecedents; and\n\n(viii)\n\nIn admitting to the factual averments of the Proceeded Charges, the\nRespondent has not unnecessarily prolonged these proceedings but has instead\nshown remorse.\n\nThe main question before the Tribunal is whether the facts as adduced from the\ndocuments in the ABOD and the ASOF are sufficient to establish that the Respondent\nis guilty of misconduct unbefitting on advocate and solicitor as alleged in the\nProceeded Charges.\n\nBurden of Proof\n\n40.\n\nAt the outset, Counsel for the Respondent submitted that even if the evidence before\nus would have established negligence on the part of the Respondent, they are\n\n\f22\ninsufficient to find him guilty of misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor\nAct\n\n41.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the Law Society to establish that the documents would prove\nnot merely negligent but\nsuch that it would amount to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n42.\n\nThe Law Society on the other hand contended that the evidence is clear that the\nRespondent was guilty of misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor. He had\nfailed to apply to set aside the Statutory Demand made against his client and to apply\nfor an extension of time after the deadline to set aside the Statutory Demand had\npassed. This resulted in a Bankruptcy Order being made against the Complainant.\n\n43.\n\nIt is trite law that the standard of proof is to show that the Respondent was guilty of\nthe charges beyond reasonable doubt. 35 We would refer to the case of Public\nProsecutor v GCK and another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 where it was held as\nfollows:36\n\nconceptualised\nin two ways. First, a reasonable doubt may arise from within the case mounted\nby the Prosecution. As part of its own case, the Prosecution must adduce\nsufficient evidence to establish the accused\n\nguilt beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt on at least a prima facie basis. Failure to do so may lead to a finding\n\n35\n36\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James [2013] 3 SLR 221 at [50].\nPublic Prosecutor v GCK and another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 at [149].\n\n\f23\nthat the Prosecution has failed to mount a case to answer, or to an acquittal.\nIn those situations, the court must nevertheless particularise the specific\n\nthe threshold of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n(f)\n\ncase,\n\nnot been able to discharge its overall legal burden.\n\n(g)\n\nThe second way in which a reasonable doubt may arise is on an\n\nassessment of the totality of the evidence. The inquiry here is intimately\n\npreferred over the evidence put forth by the accused person where it is a case\n\n(h)\n\nThe assessment of the\n\nevidence under the\n\nstandard must be made with regard to the totality of the evidence,\nwhich logically includes the case mounted by the Defence. The evaluative task\nis not just internal to the\n\ncase, but also comparative in nature.\n\nWhere the evidential burden lies on the Defence and this has not been\ndischarged, the court may find that the Prosecution has discharged its burden\n\n\f24\nof proving its case against the accused person beyond a reasonable doubt. At\n\n(i)\n\nWhat the Defence needs to do to bring the\n\ncase below the requisite\n\nthreshold is to point to such evidence as would generate a reasonable doubt. That\nevidence need not necessarily be raised by the Defence; what matters is that a\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n44.\n\nThus, the burden on the Law Society is to adduce sufficient evidence which must\nestablish the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on at least a prima facie basis and that\nthe Respondent has to show at the end of the trial that a reasonable doubt exists on the\nevidence adduced.\n\nDid the acts and/or omissions of the Respondent amount to misconduct unbefitting an advocate\nand solicitor of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession?\n\n45.\n\nWith that in mind, we proceed to examine and assess the facts and evidence before us\nin order to arrive at our decision.\n\n46.\n\nThe Proceeded Charges were both made under s 83(2)(h) of the Act. In this regard,\nthe Tribunal is mindful that in the case of The Law Society of Singapore v Harjeet\nSingh [2016] SGDT 9, it was stated that s 83(2)(h) is a catch all provision which can\n\n\f25\nbe invoked when the conduct does not fall within any of the other enumerated grounds\nbut is nevertheless considered unacceptable\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the\n\n37\n\ncontention that there are degrees of negligence\n\nand whether a particular degree of negligence amounts to misconduct must be\ndetermined by viewing the gravity of the negligent act in the context of the matter\nwhilst taking into account all the circumstances of the case. 38 Not all cases of\nnegligence support a finding of due cause.39 Innocent bungling which prejudices the\ngrave\nnature. Several serious lapses would invite disciplinary sanction.\n\n48.\n\nWe would therefore examine the undisputed material, correspondences and other\ndocuments contained in the ABOD read with the ASOF to evaluate if the conduct was\njust mere negligence or whether it was sufficiently grave to amount to misconduct on\nthe part of the Respondent in the discharge of his professional duty.\n\n49.\n\nOn 31 October 2015, the Respondent had requested for documents, information and a\nstudy, then to do legal\nresearch and then draft affidavit. Fighting a case is not like making instant noidle. It\nhas to be carefully thought over and researched. 40\n\n37\n38\n\nRe Lim Kiap Khee; Law Society of Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee [2001] 2 SLR(R) 398 at [19].\nLaw Society of Singapore v K Jayakumar Naidu [2012] 4 SLR 1232 at [79].\n40\nABOD at page 424.\n39\n\n\f26\n50.\n\nOn 1 November 2015, the Complainant responded to the Respondent in an email,\nproviding whatever responses she could to the Respondent.41\n\n51.\n\nOn 2 November 2015, the Respondent emailed the Complainant, raising further\nquestions on the chronology provided in the Compla\n201542 and commented on the insufficiency of the chronology:43\n\nSimply put, the chronology of facts you have given to me has too many\nunexplained holes and lacks sufficient details. Accordingly, at the moment,\nsuch a chronology is not very helpful in the preparation of your application to\nset aside the statutory notice of demand in bankruptcy against you. You need\nto work harder on the chronology, recall and remember important facts,\nnames, terms of discussion and dates otherwise the court will not believe what\nyou say as there is no credibility in what you say unless the said holes are\nplugged and the details provided\n\n52.\n\nHe further emphasised in the same email:44\n\nACCORDING TO YOU, YOU WERE SERVED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY\nSTATUTORY DEMAND ON 27 OCTOBER 2015, ACCORDING TO THE\nLAW YOU HAVE 14 DAYS TO APPLY TO SET ASIDE THE STATUTORY\nDEMAND IE.

In these emails, she notably stated that she\nwould provide the Respondent the slips and loan agreement between her and one\nSheraz in later emails.\n\n55.\n\nOn 4 November 2015 at 11.53pm, the Complainant forwarded to the Respondent an\nemail she had previously received on 14 May 2015 from the law firm representing\nSheraz, which had forwarded a Supplementary Agreement for her comments.47 In the\n\nfor applying the credit line with bank of China\n\nbe\n\nof help. It is unclear however whether a copy of the said company contract was in fact\nforwarded to the Respondent at all as there was no record of such a document in the\nABOD.\n\n56.\n\nOn 5 November 2015 at 11.15am, the Respondent asked the Complainant if the loan\nagreement was connected to the loan given to the Complainant by ABKL.48\n\n57.\n\nOn 9 November 2015, the Complainant sent a WhatsApp message to the Respondent\nin relation to another matter unrelated to the case. At the same time, however, she\n\n45\n\nABOD at page 435.\nSee ABOD at page 436-442.\n47\nABOD at page 444.\n48\nABOD at page 452.\n46\n\n\f28\nenquired about her case. To this query, the Respondent specifically responded that he\nstudying your case\n\n58.\n\n49\n\nUp to this point, we find that all the Complainant was told was that the Respondent\nthat neither the Setting\nAside Application nor the EOT Application was ever made.50 Further, no drafts of\neither the Setting Aside Application or EOT Application were ever shown to have\nbeen prepared during the period he was acting for her.\n\n59.\n\nIt ought to be borne in mind that the Respondent was at all times fully aware that the\ndeadline was 10 November 2015. Yet, a day before the deadline, when the\nAnd how about my case?\n\nStudying\n\nyour case\n\n60.\n\nThus far, the evidence had not shown any sign of concern or urgency on the\n\nStudying your case\nresponsible lawyer faced with a situation where time will run out the next day. We\nfind that this conduct is not what is expected of an advocate and solicitor tasked with\n\nconsequence after time runs out. In the circumstances, we do not accept that the\nthe\n\n49\n50\n\nABOD at page 71\nAgreed Statement of Facts at [15].\n\n\f29\nRespondent as submitted by Mr Sreenivasan, SC. We are satisfied that the conduct\nwas grave enough to amount to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n61.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent had, in his submissions, also attempted to characterise the\nRespondent as having [dropped] the ball only on 2 December 2015.51 We disagree.\n\nviewed as a whole. We do not accept that he\n\nthe\n\nonly from 2 December\n\n2015 onwards. In any case, we find that his conduct and attitude towards the\nComp\nthe queries of the Complainant on the status of the matter to the time the Complainant\nterminated his services.\n\n62.\n\nOn 10 November 2015 (i.e. the date of the deadline to set aside the Statutory Demand),\ntoday is the last day for us\nto file in and put aside right?\n\n[correct] but not to\n\nworry we can apply for extension of time so long as it is filed within a reasonable\nperiod 52\n\n63.\n\nFrom this reply, we note that:\n\n(i)\n\nThere was simply no urgency shown by the Respondent right up to 10\nNovember 2015.\n\n51\n52\n\nTranscript of the Hearing, page 92 at lines 13-26.\nABOD at page 454.\n\n\f30\n(ii)\n\nHis conduct throughout his engagement was to say the least, lackadaisical. In\nparticular, he told the Complainant not to worry as he could apply for an\nextension of time giving the impression that such an extension would be\ngranted as a matter of course. This amounted to an assurance to the\nComplainant that so long as an application to extend time is made within a\nreasonable period of time, there is no cause to worry. We are unable to accept\nthis as mere negligence. As an experienced lawyer, the Respondent ought to\nknow that an extension of time is granted at the discretion of the Court and\nthat it would depend on the reasons given to convince the Court to exercise the\ndiscretion in favour of the applicant.\n\n(iii)\nserious consequences that would follow if the extension of time was not\ngranted and the Statutory Demand not set aside. Furthermore, there was no\nevidence adduced to show that the Respondent had even initiated a search to\ndetermine if ABKL had taken steps after the expiry of the Statutory Demand\ndeadline to enforce it. There was not even a suggestion or an attempt made to\nwrite to the solicitors acting for ABKL on the matter to state the\ncase or to ask for time to respond.\n\n64.\n\nThe same pattern of conduct continued well after 10 November 2015. On 28\nNovember 2015 (i.e. 18 days after the deadline to set aside the Statutory Demand had\nexpired), the Complainant sent a WhatsApp message to the Respondent as she had not\n\n\f31\nheard from him, to request for updates on her case. There was no response to this\nmessage.53\n\n65.\n\nMorning Gregory, do you\nresponse.54\n\nhave time to talk\n\n66.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Complainant once again messaged the Respondent,\nrequesting an update regarding the Statutory Demand. This time, the Respondent\nFor your setting aside, not yet\".55 The Complainant thereafter\nenquired if there wa\n\nthe setting aside\n\nthis\n\nmessage.56\n\n67.\n\nOn 2 December 2015 at 5.12pm, the Complainant sent an email to the Respondent,\nrequesting a receipt for her fee payment of $7,000.00 and again asked whether there\nwas a deadline for setting aside the Statutory Demand. 57 He responded to this email\non the same day at 5.51pm, stating that he was applying for an extension of time which\nnot be a problem\n\nreceipt\n\nall the court papers which [she would] have to sign at [his] offices\non a date to be fixed\n\n68.\n\nall the court papers 58\n\nWe find that this response gave the impression that the Respondent was ready to\nproceed with the matter and that the relevant court papers would soon be ready for the\n\n53\n\nABOD at page 455.\nABOD at page 455.\n55\nABOD at page 455.\n56\nABOD at page 456.\n57\nABOD at page 461.\n58\nABOD at page 462.\n54\n\n\f32\nComplainant to sign. However, as stated previously, the evidence before the Tribunal\nhas showed that in fact no court papers were prepared nor were they sent to the\nComplainant even though the Respondent had stated he would have them at his office\nfor her to sign on a date to be fixed.\n\n69.\n\nAfter 2 December 2015, there appears to be no further communication between the\nComplainant and the Respondent until 15 January 2016 when the Complainant\nemailed the Respondent requesting him to set aside the Statutory Demand\nimmediately.59\n\n70.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, by an email timestamped 12.50pm, the Complainant terminated\n\nhad her phone line cut off and her bank account suspended because of his negligence.\nShe also noted in the same email that:60\n\nYou have not even had the courtesy to respond to my email of 15 January and\nmy registered letter dated 16th January. I am most disappointed by your\nderelict attitude.\n\n71.\nstated that it was defamatory of the Complainant to accuse him of negligence. He\naccepted the termination of his services and agreed to return the $7,000.00 deposit\npaid to him.61\n\n59\n\nABOD at page 463.\nABOD at page 464.\n61\nABOD at page 466.\n60\n\n\f33\n\n72.\nand unwavering. The Respondent was engaged to set aside the Statutory Demand.\nThis is shown from the\n\ninstructions from the time the Respondent was\n\nfirst appointed to act for her62 and throughout the entire retainer period.63 Both the\nEOT Application and Setting Aside Application are inextricably linked and the\n\nwhole.\n\n73.\n\nWe find that while the Respondent was correct to seek further information from the\nentirely coherent\nthereby contributing to his inability to prepare the Court papers, it would still be the\nRe\nproceed in good time. We find instead that it was in fact the Complainant who was\nmaking regular inquiries on the state of the application with no meaningful response\nreceived from the Respondent. This was conceded by the Respondent. 64 He had\nrepeatedly assured the Complainant that he was in the midst of preparing the necessary\ncourt papers, giving no impression that anything more was needed from the\nComplainant.65 Therefore, on the assumption that the information provided by the\n\nApplication and the EOT Application forthwith on an urgent basis in view of the tight\ntimeline. On the evidence before us, it was clearly shown that he had taken absolutely\nno action right up to the date his engagement was terminated.\n62\n\nASOF at [4].\nASOF [11]64\nABOD at page 379-380.\n65\nABOD at pages 453, 462 and 466.\n63\n\n\f34\n\n74.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Respondent was unaware of the bankruptcy proceedings filed\nagainst the Complainant,66 it is clear that he had not even made an effort to establish\nif a bankruptcy application had been filed after the deadline had passed. This was\nadmitted by Counsel for the Respondent.67 We are of the view that the Respondent\nought to have known that bankruptcy proceedings would be the next step to be taken\nby ABKL (on 15 January 2016 at the latest) if they receive no response from the\nComplainant. An urgent search would reveal the status of the matter at the material\ntime.68\n\n75.\n\nIf negligence is involved, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that there is always\na need to discern and differentiate the various degrees of negligence, taking into\naccount all the facts of the case69 and that the degree of negligence must still be found\nto be sufficiently grave for the purposes of a finding of misconduct under s 83(2)(h)\nof the Act. Otherwise, every negligent act or omission would be tantamount to\nmisconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n76.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Selena Chiong provided helpful guidance of the standard\nrequired for a charge under s 83(2)(h) of the Act:\n\nwe do have some difficulties in relation to the misconduct complained of in\nthe first and second charges, which misconduct smacks more of incompetence,\ndisorganisation or lack of care on the part of Chiong rather than any deliberate\n66\n67\n\nTranscript of the Hearing, page 58 at lines 12-13.\n\nen Submissions at [25].\nABOD at page 466.\n69\nRe Lim Kiap Khee; Law Society of Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee [2001] 2 SLR(R) 398 at [19].\n68\n\n\f35\n\nwould be more appropriate to regard the misconduct set out in the first and\nsecond charges as\n\nunbefitting of an advocate and\n\nwithin\n\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n77.\n\nIn a similar vein, the High Court in Zhou Tong stated that professional incompetence\nand indolence is a cause for concern. It is indeed a fundamental responsibility of the\n\nconscientiously and conscionably.70 We are of the view that the Respondent had failed\nthe test in the present case.\n\n78.\n\nWe also agree with Counsel for the Respondent that unlike the respondent in Selena\nChiong, the Proceeded Charges in our case do not involve any failure to advise the\nComplainant, the failure to appropriately advise the Complainant or misleading the\nComplainant.71 The irresponsibility displayed by the respondent in Selena Chiong\ncase\n\n79.\n\nHowever, this does not\namount to misconduct under the Proceeded Charges. As established in Selena Chiong,\na lack of care and incompetence, despite not being deliberate, can still amount to\nmisconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(h)\n\n70\n71\n\nZhou Tong v Public Prosecutor [2010] 4 SLR 534 at [1].\n\n\f36\nof the Act. In this regard, we find that his failure in acting competently for the\n\nnegligence can be said to be relatively short as he was on retainer from 28 October\n2015 to 18 January 2016, the point to emphasise is that he did fail to file the Setting\n\ninstructions knowing all along the consequences that would follow should he fail to\ndo so on time. For that, we find that the Respondent displayed a total lack of care\n\nof time should not present a problem.72 The Respondent was irresponsible to give the\nimpression to the Complainant that an extension of time would be granted if it was\napplied for within a reasonable time without advising her that it has to be on grounds\nacceptable to the Court.\n\n80.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent had failed to keep the Complainant reasonably informed\nabout her case at least from on or around 6 November 2015 onwards. Notably, the\nRespondent did not provide any updates to the Complainant after he replied to her\nchaser on 10 November 2015 (i.e. the period from 11 November 2015 to 30 November\n2015).73 This was in spite of the fact that there was a real possibility of bankruptcy\nproceedings being commenced as the deadline for the Setting Aside Application was\ndue to expire on 10 November 2015. In our view, this period of silence from the\nRespondent was inexcusably lengthy and puts the Complainant at risk of being made\na bankrupt.\n\n72\n73\n\nABOD at page 462.\nASOF at [11]-[12].\n\n\f37\n\n81.\n\nFor completeness, we note that Counsel for the Law Society appeared to be hinting at\nan element of dishonesty specifically at the Hearing, and untruthfulness in relation to\n\nApplication.74 In response, Counsel for the Respondent pointed out that any\nuntruthfulness\nall the court\npapers\n\n75\n\nSimilarly, he had sent a Whatsapp message\n\nto the Complainant on 4 Dece\n\nwill complete drafting all\n\ncourt papers and call [her] when [he was] ready 76\n\n82.\n\nWe find that an allegation of untruthfulness is a grave accusation against a solicitor.\nHowever, we are unable to make a finding of fact in respect of the\n\nstate\n\nof mind relating to untruthfulness solely by reference to the documents and without\ncross-examination of the Respondent. In any event, we find that it is unnecessary to\nfind untruthfulness against the Respondent for the purposes of the Alternative 2nd\nCharge. The fact is that no such Court papers were produced and we are satisfied that\nthe Respondent had by his own admission no further excuse to allege that he needed\nfurther information in order to draft the court papers.\n\n83.\n\nIn the light of our findings, we are satisfied that the Proceeded Charges (i.e. the\nAlternative 1st Charge and the Alternative 2nd Charge) have been proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt and that the Respondent is guilty as charged.\n\n74\n\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 77-79 and 103.\nTranscript for the Hearing, page 93-94.\n76\nABOD at page 150.\n75\n\n\f38\n\nAPPROPRIATE SENTENCE\n\n84.\ndetermination under either s 93(1)(b) or (c) of the Act.\n\n85.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent helpfully drew our attention to the decision of the Court\nof Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel [2010]\n3 SLR 390 in which the function of a Disciplinary Tribunal was set out:\n\nsorts, thereby ensuring that only the most serious complaints are referred to\nthe court of three Judges... the Disciplinary Tribunal may find that the conduct\nof the advocate and solicitor concerned does fall within one or more of the\nlimbs of s 83(2).. but feels that the conduct itself, whilst technically within the\nambit of one or more of these limbs\n\nsanction pursuant to s 93(1)(b) of the Act\n\n86.\n\n77\n\nHere, we are of the view that even though we find that the Respondent is guilty as\ncharged, we would agree with Counsel for the Respondent that the present case does\nnot fall within the category of the most serious of complaints.78 Indeed, we accept that\n\nLaw Society.\n\n77\n78\n\nLaw Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel [2010] 3 SLR 390 at [28] and [39].\n\n\f39\n\n87.\n\nWe have considered the mitigating factors raised by Counsel for the Respondent. The\nRespondent did not gain financially from this incident. He had no prior antecedents.\nWe are mindful that any form of dishonesty and/or untruthfulness has not been\nestablished beyond reasonable doubt. Plainly, in the short period of his retainer, the\nRespondent was negligent and had displayed a lack of professionalism in the way he\n\nexpected of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n88.\n\nWe also note that the\n\nactions had caused the Complainant suffering and\n\ninconvenience as she was adjudged a bankrupt. Bankruptcy is undoubtedly a traumatic\nexperience and the Complainant must have suffered during her period of bankruptcy.\nHowever, to attribute the\n\nlengthy period of suffering (approximately\n\n2.5 years of bankruptcy) solely to the Respondent is unjustifiable. No evidence was\nadduced to explain why it had taken approximately 2.5 years for the bankruptcy order\nto be annulled.79\n\n89.\n\nIn light of all our findings, and pursuant to s 93(1)(b)(i) of the Act, we determine that\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 83 of the Act,\nthe Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000.00, which in our view is\nsufficient and appropriate to the misconduct committed\n\n90.\n\nPursuant to s 93(2) of the Act, we award costs of $2,500.00 to be paid by the\nRespondent to the Law Society.\n\n79\n\nTranscript

We\nthen deal with the First Charge and remaining three charges in numerical order.\n\nThe Second Charge and Alternative Second Charge\n\n5.\n\nThe Second Charge alleges: 5\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of contravening Rule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Admission) Rules 2011, by being the supervising solicitor during the practice\ntraining periods of [Mr Lim] and [Ms Sunil], who were practice trainees serving their\nrespective practice training periods under separate practice training contracts with\nFoxwood LLC, while having in force a practicing certificate of a period of less than 5\nout of the 7 years immediately preceding the date of the commencement of your\nsupervision of Mr Lim and [Ms Sunil] which warrants disciplinary action within the\nmeaning of Section 83(2)(j) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n4\n5\n\nThe Law Society’s Statement of Case (Amendment No. 2) (the “SOC”) page 8.\nSOC page 13.\n\n2\n\n\f6.\n\nThe Law Society also alleged in the alternative that the conduct described in the Second\nCharge amounted to “misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession” within the meaning of\nSection 83(2)(h) of the Act (the “Alternative Second Charge”).6\n\n7.\n\nTo succeed in these charges, the Law Society must establish that (a) Mr Lim and Ms\nSunil were practice trainees serving their respective practice training periods under\nseparate training contracts with Foxwood LLC, (b) the Respondent purported to act as\ntheir supervising solicitor during their respective practice training periods, and (c) the\nRespondent was not qualified to do so by reason of not having a valid practicing\ncertificate for at least five out of the seven years immediately preceding the respective\ncommencement dates of Mr Lim’s and Ms Sunil’s training contracts.\n\n8.\n\nEach of these facts are admitted. The Respondent admits that he acted as Mr Lim’s\nsupervising solicitor “with effect from 16 December 2019” and as Ms Sunil’s supervising\nsolicitor “with effect from 2 January 2020”.7 He also admits that he held a practicing\ncertificate for a total of only two years and 10 months as at 1 October 2019.8\n\n9.\n\nRule 18(1) of the Admission Rules prohibits a solicitor from acting as a supervising\nsolicitor of a practice trainee unless (i) he is in active practice in a Singapore law practice,\nand (ii) has had in force a practicing certificate for a total of “not less than 5 out of the 7\nyears immediately preceding the date of commencement of his supervision of the\npractice trainee”.\n\n6\n7\n8\n\nSOC page 14.\nDefence [10] read with SOC [15].\nDefence [9] read with SOC [14].\n\n3\n\n\f10.\n\nThere is therefore no question that the Respondent has breached Rule 18(1) of the\nAdmission Rules.\n\nThe only question therefore is whether his conduct warrants\n\ndisciplinary action within the meaning of Section 83(2)(j) of the Act for the purposes of\nthe Second Charge and/or amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor\nas an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession for the\npurposes of the Alternative Second Charge.\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent submits that both questions ought to be answered in the negative.9\nWe shall deal with each of his arguments in turn.\n\nAlleged mitigating circumstances\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent points to what he describes as mitigating circumstances. First, he says\nthat he admitted to having acted as supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil “even\nthough an alternative would have been to argue that they had in fact no Supervising\nSolicitor”, and that his admission therefore “resolved this issue in [the Law Society’s]\nfavour, even though the position was ‘grey’, stepping up to shoulder the blame”.10\n\n13.\n\nDuring oral closing arguments, the Respondent’s counsel clarified that the Respondent’s\nargument was simply that he could have argued that there was no supervising solicitor\nin law – i.e. as defined under the Act.11 However, this argument also does not take him\nvery far. The fact there was no supervising solicitor for the purposes of the Act is\nundeniable given that the Respondent did not satisfy the requirements under the Act.\nThe critical fact is that he admits to having acted as Mr Lim’s and Ms Sunil’s supervising\n\nRCS [59].\nRCS [46].\n11 Transcript 7 Dec 2021, 42(9) to 44(6).\n9\n\n10\n\n4\n\n\fsolicitor despite not having satisfied the requirements under the Act. This is the very\nsubstance of the breach before us.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent appeared to us to be seeking credit for admitting that he had acted as\nsupervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil – i.e. for telling the truth. Telling the truth\nis not mitigatory – it is the absolute minimum expected of any advocate and solicitor. To\nclaim that he ought to be given credit for not arguing that Mr Lim and Ms Sunil had no\nsupervising solicitor (an argument that he must know to be false given his pleaded\nadmission) is an appalling submission, and one which we completely reject.\n\n15.\n\nSecond, he argues that the responsibility for ensuring that the practice trainees taken in\nby Foxwood LLC are properly supervised is shared between the Respondent and\nFoxwood LLC’s sole director at that time Mr Goh Keng How (“Mr Goh”).12 He argues\nthat it would therefore be unfair to pin the effect of this “lapse” solely on him.\n\n16.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent appears to suggest that Mr Goh should bear most of the blame\nfor alleged systemic regulatory and compliance failures at Foxwood LLC.13 He argues\nthat Mr Goh was “responsible for regulatory and compliance matters”14 but (i) “did not\nraise any concerns regarding regulatory compliance”15 despite the Respondent having\nkept him in the loop on the hiring of practice trainees, and (ii) “failed to provide any form\nof guidance or policy relating to the employment of trainees”16 by Foxwood LLC.\n\n17.\n\nMr Goh testified on behalf of the Law Society. He admitted that he had not familiarized\nhimself with the Admission Rules and was not aware that the Respondent was not\n\nRCS [47].\nRCS [48].\n14 Ibid.\n15 Ibid.\n16 Ibid.\n12\n13\n\n5\n\n\fqualified to act as supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil. It was also patently\nclear to us from Mr Goh’s testimony that he was not someone who placed a great deal\nof importance on the need to comply strictly with the applicable rules and regulations\ngoverning practice.\n\n18.\n\nHowever, Mr Goh’s conduct is not the subject of these proceedings. Even if Mr Goh’s\nconduct had fallen below the standard expected of advocates and solicitors (on which\nissue we make no finding), it does not mitigate the Respondent’s culpability.\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society correctly highlighted that all solicitors ought to be familiar with the rules\nmade under the Act and will at any rate be deemed to be aware of their existence and\napplicability: Law Society of Singapore v Chiong Chin May Selena (“Selena Chiong”).17\nIt follows therefore that each advocate and solicitor bears personal responsibility to\nensure that the applicable rules of practice are strictly adhered to in all areas of his\npractice.\n\n20.\n\nIt was incumbent on the Respondent to familiarize himself with the relevant rules\ngoverning his practice as an Advocate and Solicitor. In particular, he ought to have\nfamiliarized himself with the rules governing the supervision of practice trainees before\nhiring Mr Lim and Ms Sunil as practice trainees. He ought, at the very least, to have\nsatisfied himself that he met the statutory requirements for being a supervising solicitor.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent patently failed to do so – he admits he failed to familiarize himself with\nthe relevant rules relating to being a supervising solicitor.18 Indeed, the evidence before\nus suggests that he simply did not care whether there were any rules and, if so, what\n\n17\n\n[2005] 4 SLR(R) 320, referred to at LSCS [48].\n\n18\n\nTranscript 17 Dec 2021, 26(29) to 27(2).\n\n6\n\n\fthey were. He claimed that he assumed that someone in the firm (presumably Mr Goh)\nwould have told him if what he proposed to do contravened any applicable rules. That\nargument does not assist him. The onus was on him to ensure he complied with all\nrelevant rules and regulations governing his practice. His failure to do so is not mitigated\nby any failing on the part of Mr Goh or anyone else in the firm.\n\n22.\n\nThird, he claims that he always believed that “he had a shield” on regulatory issues –\nnamely, that Mr Goh “would take care of regulatory and compliance issues”.19 This is\nessentially the same argument as above and is rejected for the same reasons.\n\n23.\n\nFourth, the Respondent claims that he did “all he could to rectify the mistake and\nalleviate the situation for [Mr Lim]”20 by trying “to find solutions to [Mr Lim’s]\npredicament”21. Mr Lim did not agree that the Respondent had been of much help in\nresolving the predicament he found himself in. However, while we are prepared to\naccept that the Respondent did take some steps to try and help, we do not think these\nsteps have much mitigatory value. Mr Lim eventually secured a training contract with\nanother firm through his own endeavors and not because of anything that the\nRespondent did.\n\n24.\n\nWe therefore find that none of the alleged mitigatory circumstances raised by the\nRespondent are of any assistance to him in diminishing his culpability.\n\n19\n20\n21\n\nRCS [49].\nThe Respondent’s AEIC, at [51].\nThe Respondent’s AEIC, at [54].\n\n7\n\n\fThe Respondent’s state of knowledge\n\n25.\n\nThe Law Society argues that the Respondent was aware from “at least November\n2019”22 that he did not meet the requirements to act as a supervising solicitor for\ntrainees. This is a serious allegation. If true, it would mean the Respondent knew he\ndid not satisfy the requirements under the Act before either Mr Lim or Ms Sunil\ncommenced their training period.\n\nIt would also mean that the Respondent had\n\ndeliberately ignored the provisions of the Admission Rules and then dishonestly alleged\nin these disciplinary proceedings that the breach had been inadvertent.\n\n26.\n\nThe Law Society relies on the evidence of Mr Tan Yong Xian, Selwyn (“Mr Tan”) and Mr\nGiam Zhen Kai (“Mr Giam”). Both Mr Tan and Mr Giam are Advocates and Solicitors.\nMr Tan practiced at Foxwood LLC between September 2019 and April 2020. Mr Giam\npracticed at Nair & Co. LLC with the Respondent from February 2019 before moving\nwith the Respondent to Foxwood LLC in July 2019 and practicing there until November\n2019.\n\n27.\n\nMr Tan’s evidence was that when he learnt that two practice trainees would be joining\nFoxwood LLC’s dispute resolution team in December 2019, he “had some concern that\n[the Respondent] would be the supervising solicitor for these [two] trainees” since he\nwas the only partner who handled litigation and dispute resolution at the firm.23\n\n28.\n\nMr Tan said that these concerns prompted him to check the applicable rules and the\nRespondent’s LinkedIn profile, and that he then concluded that “it was unlikely that [the\nRespondent] would be able to meet the criteria” under the Rules. He said that during a\nbreak in trial proceedings sometime in November 2019, he had highlighted the\n\n22\n23\n\nLSCS [42].\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Tan Yingxian, Selwyn (“Mr Tan’s AEIC”), at [8] and [9].\n\n8\n\n\fapplicable rules to the Respondent and had “asked [the Respondent] directly if he had\nsufficient years of practice with a practicing certificate in force to supervise trainees”. Mr\nTan said that Respondent had replied that “there would be ‘no issue’” and that Mr Goh\nwould be the trainees’ supervising solicitor. 24\n\n29.\n\nMr Giam testified that soon after he joined Nair & Co. LLC in February 2019, he was told\nthat the reason Mr Suresh Nair was his supervising solicitor (and not the Respondent)\neven though he spent “the vast majority of [his] practice training period assisting [the\nRespondent]” was because the Respondent was not qualified to act as supervising\nsolicitor.25\n\n30.\n\nMr Giam said that during the period when the Respondent was considering joining\nvarious other firms, the Respondent had assured him that his practice training “would\nnot be affected as [the Respondent] would be able to assign qualified persons to be [his]\nsupervising solicitor in those firms”.26\n\n31.\n\nMr Giam also said that he had accompanied the Respondent to interview Mr Lim\nsometime in early October 2019, and that he had asked the Respondent shortly after\nthe interview whether the Respondent would be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor. Mr Giam\nsaid the Respondent replied that “he would not be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor and that\none of the other partners of Foxwood LLC would be named as Mr Lim’s supervising\nsolicitor”.27\n\n24\n25\n26\n27\n\nMr Tan’s AEIC at [12] to [14].\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Mr Giam Zhen Kai (“Mr Giam’s AEIC”) at [5] and [6].\nMr Giam’s AEIC at [7] and [8].\nMr Giam’s AEIC at [10] to [12].\n\n9\n\n\f32.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the admission of these portions of the evidence of Mr Tan\nand Mr Giam and applied to strike them out on several grounds, namely (i) that these\nconversations had taken him by surprise as they were material facts that ought to have\nbeen, but were not, pleaded; (ii) that the evidence was not relevant, (iii) that he did not\nknow the specific charge(s) to which this evidence relates, and (iv) that the evidence\nwas being raised late in the day.\n\n33.\n\nHaving heard parties, we dismissed these objections and allowed the evidence in. The\nobjection that the conversations were not pleaded was misconceived. The material\nallegation was that the Respondent knew or ought to have known that he was not\nsufficiently qualified. This was pleaded. The conversations referred to by Mr Tan and\nMr Giam formed part of the evidence tendered by the Law Society in support of that\nmaterial allegation. It is trite that evidence need not be pleaded.\n\n34.\n\nThe objection as to the relevance of the evidence is equally unfounded. The issue of\nwhether the Respondent knew he was not qualified is pleaded and in issue. While the\nRespondent admits that he was not qualified, the main plank of his mitigation is that his\nbreach of the relevant regulation had been purely inadvertent – i.e. he had not known\nthat he was not qualified. The conversations, if proved, would go towards undermining\nthat assertion of inadvertence and are therefore plainly relevant.\n\n35.\n\nAs to the objection that the Respondent did not know which charge(s) the evidence\nrelated to, there is no requirement for each piece of evidence to be tagged to a particular\ncharge. In any event, the nature of the conversations make it quite apparent which\ncharge(s) they relate to.\n\n36.\n\nFinally, the evidence was not adduced late in the day.\n\nThe evidence of the\n\nconversations is contained in the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of Mr Tan and Mr Giam,\n10\n\n\fboth of which were exchanged together with the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of all the\nother witnesses.\n\nThe Respondent’s main complaint appears to be that the\n\nconversations should have been raised at the pleading stage. For the reasons stated\nabove, we disagree.\n\n37.\n\nHaving dismissed the Respondent’s objections, we nonetheless granted him leave to\naddress these alleged conversations either by way of a supplementary affidavit of\nevidence-in-chief or via oral testimony. The Respondent chose to do so by way of oral\nevidence. He claimed that his relationship with Mr Tan and Mr Giam had soured towards\nthe end of their time with Foxwood LLC and suggested that this soured relationship\ntainted their evidence against him.\n\n38.\n\nBoth Mr Tan and Mr Giam candidly admitted that their relationship with the Respondent\nhad soured. However, they steadfastly maintained that their evidence, particularly in\nrespect of the respective conversations with the Respondent, was true. We would also\nbe slow to find that two Advocates and Solicitors would lie under oath, especially when\nthey had absolutely nothing to gain from doing so and could face severe repercussions\nif they did so and were found out.\n\n39.\n\nCritically, the Respondent did not deny the conversations with Mr Tan and Mr Giam but\nsaid that he could not recall if they had taken place.28 At the hearing, the Respondent\ndid not directly challenge the evidence of Mr Tan and Mr Giam in respect of these\nrespective conversations. Instead, he sought to undermine their evidence on this issue\nby challenging their evidence on the events that led to these alleged conversations.\nSpecifically, he challenged Mr Tan’s evidence on when and why he had searched the\n\n28\n\nRCS [82].\n\n11\n\n\fRespondent’s LinkedIn profile29 and Mr Giam’s evidence on how he had come to learn\nthat the Respondent was not qualified to act as supervising solicitor.30\n\n40.\n\nWhile we accept that they were some inconsistencies in the evidence of both Mr Tan\nand Mr Giam, we find that these inconsistencies do not detract from their unchallenged\nevidence on their respective conversations with the Respondent. Both Mr Tan and Mr\nGiam were unwavering in their evidence that they had each, on separate occasions, had\nconversations with the Respondent about whether he was qualified to act as a\nsupervising solicitor. Having reviewed all the evidence on this issue, we conclude that\nthe conversations alleged by Mr Tan and Mr Giam did take place.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that the conversations had not registered in his mind even\nif they had taken place.31 He points to certain concessions made by Mr Tan and Mr\nGiam during cross-examination in support of this assertion. Mr Tan agreed that his\nconversation with the Respondent had occurred during an intensive trial and the\nRespondent could have been preoccupied with the trial.32 Mr Giam agreed that his\nconversation with the Respondent was not an extended one and he could not provide\ndetails of the conversation save that it had occurred shortly after the interview with Mr\nLim sometime in October 2019.33\n\n42.\n\nWe are unable to conclude with the necessary degree of certainty that these\nconversations had registered in the Respondent’s mind or that he was otherwise aware,\nprior to 6 January 2020, that he was not qualified to act as a supervising solicitor for\npractice trainees. We highlight several factors in this regard. First, the fact that the\n\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n\nRCS [82(g)] to [82(l)].\nRCS [82(b)] to [82(f)].\nRCS [83].\nTranscript 28 Oct 2021 46(21) to 46(22).\nTranscript 28 Oct 2021 7(5) to 8(18).\n\n12\n\n\fconversations were one-off, coupled with the concessions by Mr Tan and Giam, suggest\nit is possible that the conversations had not in fact registered in the Respondent’s mind.\n\n43.\n\nSecond, there is no other contemporaneous evidence (apart from the conversations)\nthat the Respondent was aware that he was not sufficiently qualified. As stated above,\nthe Respondent’s evidence is that he was not aware of the relevant regulations and had\nnot bothered to check. There is no evidence to suggest that this is untrue.\n\n44.\n\nThird, the Respondent informed Mr Lim that he was not qualified to be his supervising\nsolicitor on or around 14 January 2020, shortly after he says he discovered his lack of\nqualifications on 6 January 2020. If the Respondent had in fact been aware all along\nthat he was not qualified, there is no reason why he should suddenly choose to admit\nthis fact to Mr Lim in January 2020. The fact that he did so is more consistent with him\nonly having discovered this fact shortly before, as he claimed.\n\nIs Section 83(2)(j) of the Act satisfied?\n\n45.\n\nThe Second Charge asserts a breach of Section 83(2)(j) of the Act, which relates to\ncontraventions of the provisions of the Act that warrant disciplinary action.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent contends that his conduct did not cross the threshold to warrant disciplinary\naction.34\n\n46.\n\nWe make two observations. First, while the section refers to provisions of the Act, it\nmust necessarily extend to and encompass contraventions of subsidiary legislation and\nregulations promulgated under the Act.\n\nSecond, a plain reading of the provision\n\nsuggests that some contraventions of provisions of the Act may not warrant disciplinary\n\n34\n\nRCS [59].\n\n13\n\n\faction. It follows that the mere fact that the Respondent may have contravened a\nprovision of the Act does not necessarily mean that his conduct warrants disciplinary\naction.\n\nThis is not controversial and is consistent with the general tenor of the\n\ndisciplinary framework established under the Act.\n\n47.\n\nFor the reasons set out below in our discussion in relation to the Alternative Second\nCharge,35 we find the Respondent’s conduct in breaching Rule (1)(b) of the Admission\nRules to be of sufficient severity to warrant disciplinary action and that the Law Society\nhas therefore made out the Second Charge.\n\nIs Section 83(2)(h) of the Act satisfied?\n\n48.\n\nThe Alternative Second Charge asserts a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of the Act, which\nrelates to conduct that amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession. The\nRespondent contends that his actions do not amount to such misconduct.36\n\n49.\n\nThe standard of unbefitting conduct is met if a solicitor’s conduct is such as would render\nhim unfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession, and the relevant test is\nwhether reasonable people, on hearing what the solicitor had done, would have said\nwithout hesitation that as a solicitor he should not have done it: The Law Society of\nSingapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer (“Ezekiel Peter”).37\n\n35\n36\n37\n\nParagraphs 48 to 52 below.\nRCS [59].\n[2019] 4 SLR 92, [38].\n\n14\n\n\f50.\n\nThe Respondent describes his conduct as “a case of simple negligence”.38 He says he\nmade an honest mistake. During oral closing arguments, the Respondent’s counsel\nexplained that the mistake was “in failing to familiarize himself with the relevant rules\nrelating to … being a supervising solicitor”.39\n\n51.\n\nWe disagree. This was not a case of a mistake or oversight. A mistake would have\nbeen if (for example) the Respondent had incorrectly calculated the number of years he\nhad been in practice and thereby wrongly conclude that he was sufficiently qualified.\nThat was not what happened. The evidence clearly showed that the Respondent did\nnot know what the qualifying requirements were to be a supervising solicitor and did not\nbother to check. In fact, he admitted as much.\n\n52.\n\nWhile the Respondent repeatedly claimed he had acted under a mistaken belief that he\nwas qualified to act as a supervising solicitor, he could not provide an answer when\nasked what the basis of that belief was. Indeed, it would appear from his evidence that\nthe first time he familiarized himself with the relevant rules was sometime on 6 January\n2020 while waiting for a flight back from Perth.40\n\n53.\n\nApplying the test set out in Ezekiel Peter, when asked whether an Advocate and Solicitor\nshould have taken on the role of supervising solicitor for practice trainees without first\nfamiliarizing himself with the applicable rules and ensuring that he was qualified to take\non the role (which is what the Respondent admits happened in this case), we have no\ndoubt that a reasonable person would have said that he should not.\n\n38\n39\n40\n\nRCS [61].\nTranscript 17 Dec 2021 26(30) to 27(2).\nRespondent’s AEIC [36].\n\n15\n\n\f54.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent’s conduct as particularized in the Alternative\nSecond Charge amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an\nofficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession and that the\nLaw Society has made out the Alternative Second Charge.\n\nThe appropriate sanction\n\n55.\n\nThe function of a Disciplinary Tribunal is to act as a filter to determine if there is ‘cause\nof sufficient gravity’ that could, on a finding by the Court of Three Judges, be ascertained\nto constitute ‘due cause’ that merited the imposition of one of the range of sanctions\nprescribed in Section 83(1) of the Act: Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani\nd/o Daniel (“Jasmine Daniel”).41\n\n56.\n\nIt is not for us to determine whether ‘due cause’ has been established in this case – that\ndetermination lies solely within the purview of the Court of Three Judges. Our role is to\ndecide whether ‘cause of sufficient gravity’ has been established, and for that we need\nonly be satisfied that there was a prima facie case on the relevant evidence that ‘due\ncause’ might be present: Jasmine Daniel.42 There are three options open to us pursuant\nto Section 93(1) of the Act:\n\n(a)\n\nDetermine that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists;\n\n(b)\n\nDetermine there while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists,\nthe legal practitioner should be reprimanded or ordered to pay a penalty sufficient\nand appropriate to the misconduct committed; or\n\n41\n\n[2010] 3 SLR 390, at [37].\n\n42\n\nIbid., at [31].\n\n16\n\n\f(c)\n\nDetermine that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists, in which\ncase the Law Society is obliged pursuant to Section 94 of the Act to make an\napplication under Section 98 of the Act to the Court of Three Judges.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent submits that his conduct evinces no cause of sufficient gravity. He\nargues that his conduct was merely a mistake or an oversight. We have explained above\nwhy we disagree.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to and relies on two cases (The Law Society of Singapore\nv Anand K Thiagarajan43 and The Law Society of Singapore v Anand Kumar s/o Toofani\nBeldar)44 which he submits are factually akin to the present case and where the\nrespective Disciplinary Tribunals found there to be no cause of sufficient gravity.\n\n59.\n\nWe do not think these cases take the Respondent very far. Neither of these cases deal\nwith breaches of the Admission Rules. In any event, it is trite that whether cause of\nsufficient gravity is made out in any given case must necessarily turn on the specific\nfacts and circumstances of that case.\n\n60.\n\nTurning to the appropriate sanction, we are acutely conscious of the importance of\nensuring that members of the public have access to quality legal advice. The framework\nfor the training of advocates and solicitors seeks to ensure the quality of persons being\ncalled to Bar by way of the following three-pronged framework:\n\n43\n\n[2009] SGDT 2.\n\n44\n\n[2011] SGDT 12.\n\n17\n\n\f(a)\n\nStringent criteria for those wishing to become a ‘qualified person’ as defined in\nSection 2(1) of the Act, including limiting the number of universities whose law\ndegrees are recognized in Singapore;\n\n(b)\n\nRequiring them to successfully complete the Preparatory Course leading to Part\nB of the Singapore Bar Examinations, as well as Part A of the Singapore Bar\nExaminations for those who obtained their law degree from a recognized foreign\nuniversity; and\n\n(c)\n\nRequiring them to undertake and complete six months of relevant legal training,\nrelevant legal practice or work. The Admission Rules specify that such relevant\nlegal training must be carried out under the supervision of suitably qualified\nperson. This includes a solicitor in active legal practice for “a total of not less than\n5 out of the 7 years immediately preceding the date of commencement of his\nsupervision”.45\n\n61.\n\nThe aim of these requirements is plainly to ensure that anyone granted the privilege of\nadmission to the Bar is equipped with the relevant skills to provide clients with legal\nadvice of the requisite standard. Rule 18(1) of the Admission Rule is therefore an\nimportant pillar in the framework for ensuring the quality of advocates and solicitors\ncalled to the Bar. This in turn helps ensure that the broader public interest of ensuring\nthe quality of legal advice available to clients is met.\n\n62.\n\nViewed in this context, the Respondent’s breach of Rule 18(1) of the Admission Rule is\nnot simply one of “oversight in failing to familiarize himself with the applicable rules”.46\n\n45\n\nRule 18(1) of the Admission Rules.\n\n46\n\nRCS [61].\n\n18\n\n\fThe undisputed facts evince a complete disregard for and disinterest in the rules\ngoverning his suitability to act as supervising solicitor. Not only did he not know the\napplicable rules, he also did not (and could not be bothered to) check. Such conduct\nimperiled the careful framework put in place to ensure the quality of advocates and\nsolicitors admitted to the Bar.\n\n63.\n\nWe therefore find that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists in respect\nof both the Second Charge and the Alternative Second Charge.\n\nThe First Charge and Alternative First Charge\n\n64.\n\nThe First Charge alleges: 47\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching rule 36(2)(a)(ii)\n\nof the Legal Profession\n\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 …, as part of the management of a Singapore\nlaw practice known as Foxwood LLC, by failing to ensure that [Mr Lim] and [Ms\nSunil], who were practice trainees serving their respective practice training periods\nunder separate practice training contracts with Foxwood LLC, were supervised\nduring each of their practice training periods with Foxwood LLC by a supervising\nsolicitor who had in force a practicing certificate for a total of not less than 5 out of 7\nyears immediately preceding the date of the supervision of each of the said practice\ntrainees, which amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor\nwithin the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).”\n\n65.\n\nThe Law Society also alleged in the alternative that the conduct described in the First\nCharge amounted to “misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\n\n47\n\nSOC page 8.\n\n19\n\n\fthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession” within the meaning of\nSection 83(2)(h) of the Act (the “Alternative First Charge”).48\n\n66.\n\nThe Responded raised a preliminary objection to the First Charge and Alternative First\nCharge, arguing that they were unnecessarily duplicative given the Second Charge.49\nHe relied on Section 308(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the “CPC”), which states:\n“Limit of punishment for offence made up of several offences\n308 – (1) Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which\nparts is itself an offence, the person who committed the offence shall not be punished\nwith the punishment of more than one of such offences unless it is expressly\nprovided.\n(2)\n\nWhere –\n(a)\n\nanything is an offence falling within 2 or more separate definitions of\nany law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or\npunished; or\n\n(b)\n\nseveral acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or\nthemselves constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different\noffence,\n\nThe person who committed the offence shall not be punished with a more severe\npunishment than the court which tries him could award for any one of such offences.”\n\n67.\n\nThe objection is misconceived. A plain reading of Section 308(1) of the CPC clearly\nshows that it does not prevent a person facing multiple charges arising from the same\nset of facts. Rather, it is meant to regulate the punishment that can be meted out to\nsuch an individual. There is therefore nothing improper with the First Charge and\nAlternative First Charge arising from the same facts as the Second Charge.\n\n68.\n\nThe First and Alternative First Charges assert a breach of Rule 36(2)(a)(ii) of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the “PCR”), which states:\n\n48\n49\n\nSOC page 12.\nRCS [7] to [10].\n\n20\n\n\f“Responsibilities to practice trainees in law practice\n36 – (2) The management of a law practice must ensure that all of the following\napply to each practice trainee who serves the practice training period under a\npractice training contract with the law practice:\n(a)\n\n69.\n\nThe practice trainee is supervised by a supervising solicitor who –\n(i)\n\nis in active practice in the law practice; and\n\n(ii)\n\nhas in force a practicing certificate for a total of not less than 5\nout of the 7 years immediately preceding the date the supervision\nof the practice trainee starts.”\n\nRule 36(2)(a) of the PCR imposes an obligation on the management of a law practice in\nrespect of the supervision of practice trainees. It is common ground that this obligation\nwas breached in relation to Mr Lim and Ms Sunil. The only issue therefore is whether\nthe Respondent was part of the management of Foxwood LLC at the material time.\n\n70.\n\nThe Law Society argues that the Respondent was a “de-facto director of Foxwood [LLC]\nor was in any event part of [its] management”.50\n\nIt argues that the fact that the\n\nRespondent had not been formally appointed as a director of Foxwood LLC and had not\nbeen notified as such to the Law Society was irrelevant, and that the substance of the\nRespondent’s role must trump its form.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent argues that he was neither a de facto director of Foxwood LLC nor\notherwise part of its management, but was at all times only a “high-level employee”.51\nWhile he accepts that he effectively ran Foxwood LLC’s dispute resolution department,\nhe claims that Mr Goh retained overall control of the department and the rest of the firm\nand that he did not have “visibility or access to Foxwood [LLC’s] bank accounts,\naccounting information and clients outside of the [dispute resolution department]”.52\n\n50\n51\n52\n\nLSCS [60].\nRCS [19].\nRCS [20].\n\n21\n\n\f72.\n\nMr Goh’s evidence53 was that the Respondent ran the entire dispute resolution practice\nof Foxwood LLC – hiring his own staff, taking on his own clients and running the practice\nas he saw fit. Mr Goh explained that Foxwood LLC would supply back-end support (e.g.\nsoftware, payroll and human resource services) but would be compensated for these\nservices. The Respondent would be “entirely responsibly for the profit, losses and\nsustainability of the dispute resolution practice”.54\n\n73.\n\nMr Goh’s evidence is supported by a Partnership Agreement between Foxwood LLC\nand the Respondent (the “Agreement”).55 While the copy of the Agreement in evidence\nwas undated and unsigned, the Respondent does not dispute that he entered into the\nAgreement with Foxwood LLC. Indeed, the Respondent refers to and relies on some of\nthe terms of the Agreement in support of his argument that he was not part of the\nmanagement of Foxwood LLC56 - an argument we deal with below.57\n\n74.\n\nThe Agreement expressly states that Foxwood LLC and the Respondent had entered\ninto the Agreement “in order to govern their relationship as stakeholders in [Foxwood\nLLC] and the management and the affairs of [Foxwood LLC], in particular, the Dispute\nResolution Division”.58 Clause 2 of the Agreement states as follows:\n\n“2.\n\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION DIVISION\n\n2.1\n\n[The Respondent] shall be responsible for starting, heading and maintaining\nthe Dispute Resolution Division.\n\n53\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Goh Keng Haw (“Goh’s AEIC”), at [14].\n\nIbid..\nExhibit GKH-2 of Goh’s AEIC.\n56 See, for example, [15] and [16] of the Respondent’s AEIC.\n57 See paragraphs __ to __.\n58 Recital C, at page 16 of Goh’s AEIC.\n54\n55\n\n22\n\n\f2.2\n\n[The Respondent] shall have authority to, and be responsible for:\n(a)\n\nAccepting and opening files from new clients and commencing work on\nbehalf of such clients, subject always to satisfactory client due diligence\nand conflicts check;\n\n(b)\n\nSigning off on all correspondences (only with respect to the Dispute\nResolution Division) for and on behalf of [Foxwood LLC]; and\n\n(c)\n\nHiring, employing and terminating [employees of the Dispute Resolution\nDivision].\n\n2.3\n\nIn consideration of the above, [Foxwood LLC] shall pay [the Respondent] a\npartnership fee, to be paid out from the office account … only, as and when\ninstructed by [the Respondent].\n\nThe amount of partnership fee shall be\n\ndetermined solely by [the Respondent].”\n\n75.\n\nClause 3.1 of the Agreement states that the Respondent would pay Foxwood LLC a\nmonthly Administrative Fee of S$1,500 for each fee-earner in the Dispute Resolution\nDivision. Clause 3.2 of the Agreement obliged the Respondent to pay Foxwood LLC a\nrefundable Deposit calculated by multiplying the gross monthly salary of each employee\nof the Dispute Resolution Division by that employee’s notice period in months. In\nconsideration for the payment of the Administrative Fee and the Deposit, Foxwood LLC\nwas required pursuant to Clause 3.4 of the Agreement to provide the Respondent and\nthe Dispute Resolution Division with the following services:\n\n“(a)\n\nCosts and use of the following software:\n(i)\n\nMicrosoft 365;\n\n(ii)\n\nLawnet (two users);\n\n(iii)\n\nE-litigation;\n\n(iv)\n\nWaveapp;\n\n(v)\n\nClio; and\n\n(vi)\n\nNuance Power PDF.\n\n23\n\n\f76.\n\n(b)\n\npay-roll and Human Resource services;\n\n(c)\n\nStationaries, such as name cards, pens and papers;\n\n(d)\n\nClient onboarding and invoicing;\n\n(e)\n\nMarketing efforts through digital and traditional means;\n\n(f)\n\nGeneral administrative work in relation to application for practicing\ncertification, professional indemnity insurance, employee benefit.”\n\nThe picture that emerges is that the Respondent was clearly responsible for the\nmanagement of Foxwood LLC’s dispute resolution department even if he had not been\nformally appointed as a director of the firm. As part of this role, he made the hiring\ndecisions concerning lawyers and trainees for the dispute resolution department.\n\n77.\n\nThis is apparent from the process by which both Mr Lim and Ms Sunil joined Foxwood\nLLC as trainees in the dispute resolution department. Mr Lim’s evidence was that he\nsent his application for a training contract directly to the Respondent and was eventually\ninterviewed by the Respondent and the offer to join the firm as a trainee was made by\nway of a letter on the firm’s letterhead signed by the Respondent as “Head of Dispute\nResolution”.59 Ms Sunil went through the same process as well.60 Both Mr Lim and Ms\nSunil dealt with the Respondent. There is no evidence that Mr Goh or anyone else at\nFoxwood other than the Respondent made the final decision on whether to offer them\ntraining contracts.\n\n78.\n\nWe agree with the Law Society that we must look at the substance and not the form of\nthe Respondent’s role at Foxwood LLC in determining whether he was part of its\nmanagement. Similarly, whether a solicitor is part of a firm’s management for the\n\n59\n60\n\nMr Lim’s AEIC, [9] to [14].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC, [10] to [21].\n\n24\n\n\fpurposes of Rule 36 of the PCR cannot be determined by simply asking whether he held\nthe title of director or partner. One must look at the actual role he performed in the\nrunning of the firm.\n\n79.\n\nIn this case, it is clear to us that the Respondent was part of the firm’s management\ninsofar as he called the shots in the dispute resolution department. As we described\nabove, it was the Respondent who made the decision to offer Mr Lim and Ms Sunil\ntraining contracts with the firm and it was he who put himself forward as their supervising\nsolicitor. It is not the Respondent’s case that Mr Goh or anyone else at Foxwood LLC\nhad made those decisions, and there is certainly no evidence that that was the case.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Agreement does not “give the Respondent control to\nGoh’s exclusion”61 and that the Agreement did not state that Goh had no control over\nthe dispute resolution department. He contends that Mr Goh, as the sole director of\nFoxwood LLC, always had the power to veto any decisions the Respondent made in\nrelation to the dispute resolution department.\n\n81.\n\nThis may have been the case in theory, but the Respondent did not adduce any evidence\nof specific occasions when Mr Goh had done so. All the evidence before us points to\nthe Respondent having been given a free hand to manage the dispute resolution\ndepartment in accordance with the arrangement set out in the Agreement. It bears\nnoting that the Respondent accepts that ensuring that practice trainees are properly\nsupervised is a shared responsibility by the management of the firm, and he admits that\nhe must take responsibility for his part.62\n\n61\n62\n\nRCS [19].\nRCS [47].\n\n25\n\n\f82.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent was part of the management of Foxwood LLC at\nthe material time and that Rule 36(2)(a)(ii) of the PCR was breached as pleaded in the\nFirst Charge and the First Alternative Charge.\n\n83.\n\nWe note that Rule 36 places the responsibility for providing supervised training on the\nmanagement of the law firm. While we have found that the Respondent was part of the\nmanagement of Foxwood LLC, he was certainly not the only person in management. Mr\nGoh, as the sole director of the firm, was certainly part of management as well.\nHowever, neither Mr Goh nor any other individuals are before us and we therefore make\nno comment on their respective roles or potential culpability.\n\nHas Section 83(2)(b) of the Act been satisfied?\n\n84.\n\nSection 83(2)(b) of the Act provides (among other things) that due cause may be shown\nby proof that an advocate and solicitor has been guilty of such a breach of “any usage\nor rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under section 71 or by the\nCouncil under the provisions of [the] Act”63 as amounts to improper conduct or practice\nas an advocate and solicitor.\n\n85.\n\nGiven the seriousness of the breach (as we explained in dealing with the Second and\nAlternative Second Charges above), we find that the Respondent’s conduct did amount\nto improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor and that the First Charge\nhas therefore been made out.\n\n63\n\nSection 83(2)(b)(i) of the Act.\n\n26\n\n\fHas Section 83(2)h) of the Act been satisfied?\n\n86.\n\nThe Alternative First Charge asserts a breach of Section 83(2)(h) of the Act, which\nrelates to conduct that amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as\nan officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\n87.\n\nApplying the test in Ezekiel Peter, we find that the Respondent’s conduct as set out in\nthe Alternative Second Charge amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\nWe repeat our remarks at paragraphs 48 to 52 above in relation to the Second and\nAlternative Second Charges in this regard.\n\nThe Alternative Second Charge has\n\ntherefore been made out.\n\n88.\n\nThe failure to ensure that Mr Lim and Ms Sunil were supervised during their respective\ntraining contracts by a solicitor who was sufficiently qualified is a serious breach. We\nfind that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists in respect of both the\nFirst and Alternative First Charges.\n\nThe Third Charge\n\n89.\n\nAt the hearing for oral closing submissions on 17 December 2021, Counsel for the Law\nSociety highlighted that the Law Society was considering making amendments to the\nThird Charge. Subsequently, on 31 December 2021, we allowed an amendment to the\nThird Charge pursuant to an agreement between the parties. The amended Third\nCharge alleges: 64\n\n64\n\nLaw Society’s Further Submissions (“LCFS”) [7].\n\n27\n\n\f“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore have behaved in a manner inconsistent with the public interest by being\nthe supervising solicitor during the practice training periods of [Mr Lim] and [Ms\nSunil], who were practice trainees under separate practice training contracts\ncontracts with Foxwood LLC, when you did not have in force a practicing certificate\nof a period of not less than 5 out of the 7 years immediately preceding the date of\nthe commencement of your supervision of Mr Lim and [Ms Sunil] as required under\nRule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 …, which amounts to\nmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court\nor as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the\nLegal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n90.\n\nThe crux of the charge is that advocates and solicitors have “a duty to behave in a\nmanner consistent with the public interest” 65 and the Respondent had breached this\nduty by purporting to act as the supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms Sunil when he\nwas not qualified to do so.\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent does not appear to dispute the existence of such a duty. His argument\ninstead is that “the public interest is not engaged every time a lawyer makes a mistake”\n66\n\nand that the conduct complained of in the Third Charge did not amount to a breach of\n\nthat duty.\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent’s arguments in response to this Charge focus on his claim that he had\nnot held himself out to be a supervising solicitor in an advertisement published on the\nLaw Society’s practice training website on 18 November 2019 (the “Advertisement”).67\nWe are prepared to accept the Respondent’s argument on this issue. However, this\nfinding does not assist him.\n\n65\n\nRespondent’s Further Written Submissions (“RFWS”) [3].\n\n66\n\nSOC page 15.\n\n67\n\nRFWS [5] to [15].\n\n28\n\n\f93.\n\nThe Respondent’s focus on addressing the Advertisement appears to arise from the\npleaded particulars to the charge, the majority of which assert that the breach arose\nbecause the Respondent held himself out to be a supervising solicitor in the\nAdvertisement. However, the Respondent has not addressed the body of the charge,\nwhich asserts that he had purported to act as supervising solicitor for Mr Lim and Ms\nSunil while not qualified to do so – something the Respondent admits.\n\n94.\n\nAs we explained above in dealing with the Second Charge and Alternative Second\nCharge, the Respondent’s conduct imperiled the framework put in place to ensure the\nquality of advocates and solicitors admitted to the Bar. Such conduct clearly offends the\npublic interest.\n\n95.\n\nWe therefore find that the Third Charge has also been made out and that cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists in respect of this charge.\n\nThe Fourth Charge and Alternative Fourth Charge\n\n96.\n\nThe Fourth Charge and Alternative Fourth Charge both relate to the Respondent having\nallegedly demanded that Ms Sunil pay a sum of $2,000 pursuant to her practice training\ncontract with Foxwood LLC.\n\n97.\n\nThe Fourth Charge alleges: 68\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(a) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 …, by taking unfair advantage of [Ms Sunil] by\ndemanding that she pay Foxwood LLC the sum of $2,000 when this sum was not\nrecoverable by due process of law, which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an\n\n68\n\nSOC page 17.\n\n29\n\n\fadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n98.\n\nThe Fourth Charge asserts a breach of Rule 8(3)(a) of the PCR, which requires a legal\npractitioner to “not take unfair advantage of any person”. The Law Society alleges that\nthe Respondent took unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by demanding that she pay Foxwood\nLLC a sum of $2,000 that was “not recoverable by due process of law”.\n\n99.\n\nThe Alternative Fourth Charge reads:\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodaong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 by acting in a manner contrary to your position\nas a member of an honourable profession by demanding that [Ms Ann] pay Foxwood\nLLC the sum of $2,000 under the terms of a practice training contract under which\nyou agreed to be [Ms Sunil’s] supervising solicitor during her practice training period\nwhen you knew or ought to have known that you did not meet the requirements to\nbe [Ms Sunil’s] supervising solicitor under rule 18(1)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Admission) Rules … as of the commencement of your supervision of [Ms Sunil]\nduring her practice training period under the terms of that practice training contract,\nwhich amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning\nof s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n100. The Alternative Fourth Charge asserts a breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR, which\nrequires a legal practitioner to “not act towards any person in a way which is fraudulent,\ndeceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as a member of an\nhonourable profession”. The Law Society alleges that the Respondent acted in a manner\ncontrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession by allegedly\ndemanding that Ms Sunil make the $2,000 payment.\n\n30\n\n\fDid the Respondent demand payment from Ms Sunil?\n\n101. The threshold question therefore is whether the Respondent had in fact demanded that\nMs Sunil pay a sum of $2,000 to Foxwood LLC.\n\n102. Ms Sunil had signed a practice training contract with Foxwood LLC. The terms of this\ncontract were set out in the letter of offer dated 11 October 2019 which the Respondent\nsigned on behalf of Foxwood LLC and which Ms Sunil signed and accepted on 12\nOctober 2019.69 Clause 2 of the contract stated her gross monthly salary as $2,000 and\nClause 3 permitted either party to terminate the contract “with 1 month prior notice in\nwriting”. 70\n\n103. Ms Sunil officially started her employment with Foxwood LLC on 2 January 2020.71 On\n4 January 2020, she decided to leave Foxwood LLC immediately for personal reasons\nthat had nothing to do with the Respondent. 72 She informed the Respondent of this\nover a telephone conversation on 5 January 2020 – the Respondent being overseas at\nthat time. Ms Sunil’s evidence was that during this conversation, the Respondent asked\nif she could serve the entire one-month notice period set out in her training contract. Ms\nSunil said she told the Respondent that she wanted to leave immediately,73 and that the\nRespondent then told her that she would have to pay “1 month’s salary in lieu of notice\nwhich would be $2,000.00 … within seven days of [her] last day at Foxwood LLC. 74\n\n69\n70\n71\n72\n73\n74\n\nAB 33 & 34.\nAB 33.\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Ms Trinisha Ann Sunil (“Ms Sunil’s AEIC”) [30].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [33].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [35(c)].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [35(e)].\n\n31\n\n\f104. Ms Sunil said that she understood from her conversation with the Respondent that “she\nwould have to pay damages in lieu of notice if [she] could not serve the 1 month notice\nperiod”.75 She explained that while she “had doubts on whether [she] was contractually\nobliged to pay this money”, she believed the Respondent must be right as “he was a\nlawyer, a partner at Foxwood LLC and [her boss]”. 76\n\n105. Later that day, after having discussed the matter with her family, Ms Sunil sent the\nRespondent a WhatsApp message stating that she had “decided that it would be best if\n[she] terminate [her] contract here and pay the full month of salary in lieu of notice”.77\nShe was subsequently informed by one of the secretarial staff at Foxwood LLC that the\namount she had to transfer to Foxwood was $1,793.13,78 which she believed was\nderived by deducting from $2,000 a sum of $86.95 for each of her three workings days\nat Foxwood LLC.79\n\n106. On 9 January 2020, the Respondent sent her a WhatsApp message asking her to\n“please kindly make payment towards [her] notice period to clear up the remaining issue\non [her] employment”.80 She responded to say that would only be able to do so later in\nthe week but would do so with the seven-day period he had mentioned.81 Ms Sunil\neventually paid the sum of $1,793.13 on 11 January 2020.82\n\n75\n76\n77\n78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [35(f)].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [37].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [39]; AB 48.\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [47].\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [48].\nAB 237.\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [52]; AB 50.\nMs Sunil’s AEIC [57].\n\n32\n\n\f107. The Respondent denies having made any demands. He says that given Ms Sunil’s\ndesire to leave immediately, he had merely given her the option of doing so by paying a\nmonth’s salary in lieu of notice83 and she had voluntarily accepted this option. 84\n\n108. It is therefore common ground that the Respondent had informed Ms Sunil that she\nwould have to pay one month’s salary in lieu of notice if she wanted to terminate her\nemployment immediately. Whether this is characterized as a demand or merely the\nprovision of an option is, in our view, irrelevant.\n\nDid the Respondent take unfair advantage of Ms Sunil?\n\n109. The material question insofar as the Fourth Charge is concerned is whether the\nRespondent can be said to have taken unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by requiring her to\npay one month’s salary in lieu of notice to immediately terminate her employment with\nFoxwood LLC.\n\n110. The Respondent denied having taken advantage of Ms Sunil. He repeated his position\nthat all he had done was to offer her the option of immediately terminating her\nemployment with Foxwood LLC by paying one month’s salary in lieu of notice.\n\n111. The Law Society asserts that the Respondent took unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by\n“demanding the sum of $2,000 from her when this sum was not recoverable by due\nprocess of law”.85 During oral closing submissions, Counsel for the Law Society clarified\nthat what was meant by the $2,000 not being “recoverable by due process of law” was\nthat there was no enforceable contract because the fact that none of the lawyers at\n\n83\n84\n85\n\nRCS [94].\nRespondent’s AEIC [31].\nLSCS [103].\n\n33\n\n\fFoxwood LLC were qualified to act as supervising solicitors for practice trainees meant\nthat the training contract could not be performed and was therefore a nullity.86\n\n112. To show that the Respondent had taken unfair advantage of Ms Sunil by demanding\npayment of the $2,000, the Law Society must establish that he knew at the material time\nthat the training contract was void. That in turn would require knowledge that none of\nthe directors of Foxwood LLC were able to act as Ms Sunil’s supervising solicitor. The\nLaw Society argued that it had cleared this threshold.\n\n113. First, the Law Society relied on Selena Chiong for the proposition that each Advocate\nand Solicitor is taken to know of the relevant Rules governing his practice, and argued\nthat the Respondent therefore must be taken to have known that he was not qualified to\nact as Ms Sunil’s supervising solicitor.\n\n114. We accept the principles set out in Selena Chiong – an Advocate and Solicitor cannot\nrely on any alleged ignorance of the relevant regulations to avoid liability. However, we\ndo not think that fundamental principle is directly applicable for the purposes of this\ncharge. For the purposes of showing an unfair advantage, the Law Society must show\nthat the Respondent had actual (as opposed to imputed) knowledge of his lack of\nqualifications to be Ms Sunil supervising solicitor and that the training contract was\ntherefore a nullity.\n\n115. The evidence in this case does not go that far, certainly not enough to make the point\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n86\n\nWe have explained above why we cannot say with\n\nTranscript 17 Dec 2021 19(8) to 20(2).\n\n34\n\n\fsufficient certainty that the Respondent’s conversations with Mr Tan and Mr Giam were\nsufficient to bring this fact to his attention.87\n\n116. Second, the Law Society points out that even if we accept the Respondent’s evidence\nthat he only realized that he was not qualified on 6 January 2020, it would mean that the\nRespondent had the requisite knowledge when he repeated his demand for the $2,000\nin his 9 January 2020 WhatsApp message to Ms Sunil.\n\n117. The Respondent says that the WhatsApp message was merely a reminder and the fact\nthat the training contract “does not hold and therefore there is no basis to … make a\nreminder” was not operative on his mind at that time.88 Based on the totality of the\nevidence, we cannot say with the requisite certainty that the Respondent’s version\ncannot be believed.\n\n118. Third, the Law Society referred to and relied on the case of Law Society of Singapore v\nOng Teck Ghee89 for the principle that “an advocate and solicitor has to be scrupulously\nbeyond reproach in terms of his integrity, honesty and fairness”.90\n\n119. While we accept this statement of principle, we do not see how the case assists the Law\nSociety. The facts of Ong Teck Ghee bear no resemblance to the present case, the\nrespondent in that case having entered into prohibited borrowing transactions by\nentering into loan agreements with his client.\n\n120. We therefore find that the Fourth Charge has not been made out.\n\n87\n88\n89\n90\n\nSee paragraphs __ to __ above.\nTranscript 28 Oct 2021 127(16) to 127(25).\n[2014] SGDT 4.\nLSCS [89].\n\n35\n\n\fDid the Respondent act in a manner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable\nprofession?\n\n121. For the Alternative Fourth Charge, the material question is whether the Respondent had\nacted in a manner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession in\nrequiring Ms Sunil to pay one month’s salary in lieu of notice to immediately terminate\nher employment with Foxwood LLC.\n\n122. For the reasons set out above in relation to the Fourth Charge, we accept the\nRespondent’s explanation that he had merely provided Ms Sunil with an option and had\nnot sought to take advantage of her. We therefore find that the Alternative Fourth\nCharge is also not made out.\n\nThe Fifth Charge and Alternative Fifth Charge\n\n123. The Fifth Charge and Alternative Fifth Charge stems from the allegation that the\nRespondent represented to Mr Lim that he would qualify to serve as Mr Lim’s supervising\nsolicitor by May 2020 (the “Alleged Representation”). Both charges assert that the\nmaking of the Alleged Representation amounted to a breach of the requirement under\nRule 8(3)(b) of the Rules that a legal practitioner “not act towards any person in a way\nwhich is fraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to the legal practitioner’s position as\na member of an honourable profession”.\n\n124. The Fifth Charge states: 91\n\n91\n\nSOC page 21.\n\n36\n\n\f“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodaong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 …, by acting in a manner which is deceitful by\nrepresenting to [Mr Lim], a practice trainee of Foxwood LLC, that by May 2020 you\nwould meet the requirements under Rule 18(1) of the Legal Profession (Admissions)\nRules 2011 … to be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor during his practice training period\nwhen you knew this to be false, which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n(Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n125. The Fifth Charge therefore asserts that by making the Alleged Representation, the\nRespondent had breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the Rules by acting in a manner that was\ndeceitful, and that this breach amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\n126. The Alternative Fifth Charge states: 92\n\n“That you, Clarence Lun Yaodaong, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\nof Singapore are guilty of breaching Rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 … by acting towards [Mr Lim], a practice trainee\nof Foxwood LLC, in a manner which is contrary to your position as a member of an\nhonourable profession by representing to Mr Lim that by May 2020 you would meet\nthe requirements under Rule 18(1) of the Legal Profession (Admissions) Rules 2011\n… to be Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor during his practice training period when you\nknew this to be false, which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n127. The Alternative Fifth Charge therefore asserts that by making the Alleged\nRepresentation, the Respondent had breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the Rules by acting in a\nmanner contrary to his position as a member of an honourable profession, and that this\n\n92\n\nSOC page 25.\n\n37\n\n\fbreach amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the\nSupreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\nDid the Respondent make the Alleged Representation?\n\n128. The threshold question therefore is whether the Respondent had in fact made the\nAlleged Representation.\n\n129. Mr Lim’s evidence on this issue was as follows:93\n“[The Respondent] told me that he would meet the requirements to be a supervising\nsolicitor by May 2020. [The Respondent] mentioned in passing that he would have\nto ‘check’, but it was unclear what exactly he felt needed to ‘check’. He never said\nthat he would have to check to see if he would qualify by May 2020. I recall with\ncertainty that he did inform me that he would qualify by May 2020. The impression\nthat [the Respondent] gave me was that he would qualify in May 2020 even though\nhe may have been uncertain as to the actual date of qualification.”\n\n130. This evidence is consistent with what Mr Lim had stated on two earlier occasions. The\nfirst was in an email dated 16 January 2020 to Professor Eleanor Wong from the NUS\nLaw Faculty, where Mr Lim stated that the Respondent had told him on 14 January 2020\nthat “he will qualify as a supervising solicitor in May 2020”.94\n\n131. The second occasion was in an affidavit dated 4 August 2020 that Mr Lim had deposed\nin support of his application to abridge time for the filing of documents for admission to\nthe Bar, where he stated that “[the Respondent] further informed [him] that he would only\nqualify as an supervising solicitor in May 2020.” 95\n\n93\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Mr Lim Teng Jie (“Mr Lim’s AEIC”) [37(a)].\n\n94\n\nAB 249.\n\n95\n\nAB 88, at [9].\n\n38\n\n\f132. The Respondent’s evidence is that after he discovered that he was not qualified to act\nas Mr Lim’s supervising solicitor, he had informed Mr Lim of this fact and had given him\nthe following options for moving forward. One of those options was to continue with\nFoxwood LLC as a paralegal until May 2020, commence practice training with Foxwood\nLLC in May 2020 and be called in November 2020. His evidence in this regard was as\nfollows:96\n\n“[One option was to] offer Mr Lim the position of a paralegal and if I was to qualify as\na supervising solicitor in May 2020, to commence practice training with Foxwood\nLLC and to be called to the [Bar] 6 months thereafter. I informed Mr Lim that I would\nneed to check with the Law Society and SILE on whether I would qualify as a\nsupervising solicitor in May 2020. That is because I did not have the exact dates for\nwhich I was holding a practicing certificate and intended to check on those matters,\nif this was proposal was to be advanced. I recall that I had also mentioned June or\nJuly 2020 depending on how the SILE/Law Society would respond to me.\nAs I did not want Mr Lim to suffer financially from the mistake, I also mentioned that\nif Mr Lim went with this proposal and proceed to become a paralegal, I would ensure\nthat he would not be financially worse off compared with his peers in major firms by\npaying him the big firm rate, which I understood to be $5,600 per month.”\n\n133. In short, the Respondent admits having mentioned being qualified in May 2020 but says\nhe qualified that by saying he would have to check with the Law Society and SILE.\n\n134. Mr Lim struck us as an earnest and truthful witness, and we have no doubt that Mr Lim\ngenuinely believed that the Respondent had made the Alleged Representation to him\non 14 January 2020. His contemporaneous email to Professor Wong supports his\nevidence to the Tribunal and we see no reason why he would say that the Respondent\nhad made the Alleged Representation if he did not believe it had been made. The only\n\n96\n\nRespondent’s AEIC [38(d)] and [38(e)].\n\n39\n\n\fquestion therefore is whether the Respondent had qualified the Alleged Representation\nas he claims to have done.\n\n135. On this issue, we note that Mr Lim accepts that the Respondent had mentioned that he\nwould have to ‘check’ and says that it was unclear exactly what the Respondent felt\nneeded to be checked. The Respondent maintains that he meant that he would have to\ncheck with the Law Society and SILE. It is therefore quite possible on the evidence\nbefore us that there had been a degree of miscommunication or misunderstanding\nbetween Mr Lim and the Respondent as to whether the Respondent had given an\nunqualified representation that he would be qualified to act as supervising solicitor from\nMay 2020.\n\n136. In the circumstances, we are unable to conclude with sufficient certainty that the\nRespondent had in fact made the Alleged Representation. We therefore find that the\nFifth Charge and the Alternative Fifth Charge are not made out.\n\nConclusion\n\n137. We therefore find and determine pursuant to Section 93(1)(c) of the Act that cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists:\n\n(a)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(b) of the Act in respect of the First Charge;\n\n(b)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(j) of the Act in respect of the Second Charge; and\n\n(c)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(h) of the Act in respect of the Alternative First Charge, the\nAlternative Second Charge and the Third Charge.\n\n40\n\n\f138. We also find and determine that the Fourth Charge, the Alternative Fourth Charge, the\nFifth Charge and the Alternative Fifth Charge were not made out.\n\n139. We order, pursuant to Section 93(2) of the Act, that the Respondent pays the Law\nSociety’s costs in relation to these proceedings, such costs to be taxed by the Registrar\nif not agreed.\n\nth\n22nd\nDated this 17\nday of March 2022\n\nSiraj Omar, S.C.\nPresident\n\nTan Jee Ming\nAdvocate\n\n41\n\n\f","timestamp":"2023-03-08T04:00:32+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-mar-2023/"},{"title":"In the Matter of CNH (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-cnh-respondent\">In the Matter of CNH (Respondent), <strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of information referred by the Attorney-General to the Law Society on the Respondent’s conduct.</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-2099037683\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>The Respondent pleaded guilty to, and was duly convicted of the following:</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>Section 509 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (<strong>PC</strong>) for intending to insult the modesty of a 23-year-old woman (<strong>Victim</strong>), and intruding upon her privacy, by using his handphone to take photographs of her chest and brassiere without her consent; and</li>\n<li>Section 509 of the PC for intending to insult the modesty of the Victim, and intruding upon her privacy, by using his handphone to take photographs of her panties without her consent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Respondent had also consented to the following to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing:</p>\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>Section 509 of the PC for intending to insult the modesty of the Victim, and intruding upon her privacy, by using his handphone to take photographs of her panties without her consent; and</li>\n<li>Section 354(1) of the PC for using criminal force on the Victim, by pressing his thigh against her upper arm, knowing it is likely that he would thereby outrage her modesty.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Respondent was sentenced to a total of four weeks’ imprisonment by the State Courts.</p>\n<p>The Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) presided by Ms Kuah Boon Theng SC and Mr Philip Ling as DT member.</p>\n<p>Two charges (<strong>Charges</strong>) were preferred against the Respondent:</p>\n<h4><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (<strong>LPA</strong>) in that the Respondent had intentionally used his handphone to take photographs of the chest and brasserie of the Victim, who was his colleague in the law firm, without her consent.</p>\n<h4><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> Charge</strong></h4>\n<p>For misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that the Respondent had intentionally used his handphone to take photographs of the panties of the Victim, who was his colleague in the law firm, without her consent, and pressed his thigh against her upper arm, knowing it is likely that he would outrage her modesty.</p>\n<h4><strong>Findings and Determination of the DT</strong></h4>\n<p>The Respondent was unrepresented, and failed to attend the DT Hearing, despite due notice being given to him.

In other words, the learned Judge placed\nhhimsotf inthe position of the IC and. applying tho burden of proof applicable to\nthe IC, determined whether or not the IC should have referred the complaint to a\noT\n11, The leamed Judge held as follows:\n“1, Alter consideration of the affidavits and the submissions, | am of\nthe view that there is a necessity for a formal investigation by @\ni\n7\nappticant's\n\nPte Ltdl (\"Swina’)\nInternationa\n2.\n\nThat being the caso, | find that there is a prima facie basis for\ninvestigation to be carried out into Mr Sit\n\n‘AB 248 0250,\n2AB 434\n» See Notes of Hearing (22 Apri 202%) at paragraph [2], AB 443 to 4\n\n\fInhis {sie] regard. | find that the Council\nof the Law Society\nhad erred\n‘in not considering that the evidence disclosed a prime facie case of\n‘professional misconduct that is of sufficient gravity as to warrant\n2 formal investigation by a disciplinary tribunal\n3 Onthe evidence before the Inquiry Committee (IC), did not agree\nthat the other complaints raised by the Applicant in relation to Mr\n‘Singh's alleged professional misconduct are either made out on a\n‘prima facie basis, or were of sufficient gravity as to warrant a format\ninvestigation by a disciplinary tribunal.

At the IC, the IC determines whether. on the material supplied\nto the IC, there exists a prima facie case for referral to a DT. Atthe DT. the burden\n\n\fof proof notches up to a more “onerous” burden, that is, that the Complainant's\n‘case hasto be proven beyond a reasonable doubt *\n13.

The Complainants account is that over the course of several meetings from 12\nDecember 2017 to 11 January 2018, the Respondent told her and her husband\n‘not to be concerned with the Legal Proceedings, 2s it would be a matter of\nformality to adjourn the hearings as negotiations with the respective credtor\nbanks were underway * In this regard, the Respondent assured the Complainant\nthat ne would attend the hearings on their behall to inform the Court that a\nproposal had been made tothe creditor banks, and that the hearings would be\nadjourned. The Respondent also stated that it would take about 6 10 9 months\nforthe Legal Proceedings to be determined due tothe adjournments occasioned\nby the banks needina time to consider the proposals.”\n16. On 11 January 2018, the Respondent informed the Complainant and her\nhusband via WhatsApp that he was “in Court now’, then subsequently callod the\n‘Complainant and her husband to inform them that the bankruptcy orders had\nbeen made.* The Complainant was confused as this was contrary to what had\nbeen discussed in the previous meetings with the Respondent. In response, the\nRespondent stated that the orders had been made as Swina, the Complainant\n‘and her husband had no money to repay the banks The Complainant later\nearned that the Respondent did not attend the hearing, but Maybank’s solicitors\nhad instead mentioned on his behalf\"\n17. On 12 January 2018, the Respondent informed the Complainant and hor\n‘husband via WhatsApp that the winding up application against Swina had been\ngranted. ** The Complainant was shocked and demanded an explanation as to\nwhy the Respondent had not sought an adjournment, but the Respondent was\n\nComplainaAEC\nnts=:3 |73)[73] (60] ano (26).\nAEC\nComplainant'\n©Comp\ns 3 (74)\n2 lainant'AEC\ns\nComplainant'\nAEICs3 [8an7](83)\na s(89)\nAE(C 3 (88t'\nComplain\n\" Complanants AEC an\nat\n[92\n* Complanants AEC at 93)\n\n\frot forthcoming with a response.\"? The Complainant later leamed that the\nRespondent did not represent Swina at the hearing.”\nb.\n\nThe Respondent's Account\n\n18. The Respondent's account is that he repeatedly advised the Complainant and\nher husband that they needed to revise their proposals tothe creditor banks, and\nthat this was the best advice that he could give in the circumstances. As what\nthey had put forward was inadequate given the amounts that were owing, they\nneeded to devise new repayment plans that were acceptable to the creditor\nbanks.\"\n\n19. The Respondent had also taken the positon that it would be possible to adjoum\nthe bankruptcy hearings as Maybank had not yet rejected the existing proposal.\n‘This position changed on 11 January 2018, the day of the bankruptey hearings,\n‘when the Respondent was informed by Maybank’ solicitors before the hearings\nthat his clints' proposals were to be rejected.

The Trbunal's finding is based largely on the admissions of the Respondent in\n‘ot having given advice in relation to the Legal Proceedings\n22, In this regard, we refer to the following extracts from the Notes of Evidence\n(NOE\")\n\nsoro\n\nNOE 14 Decomber 2021, pago 56 line 23to page $7 line 31\n0\nAre you suggesting now that you advised Ms Alka, her\nhusband or Swina about the possibiliy of a scheme of\narrangement for Swana?\nA\nThat—that was from day 1 that was told to her to come up\nwith the proposals.

Asis clear from the extracts, the Respondent simply did not advise his clients on\nthe options availabe to the cont in response to the bankruptcy and winding up\napplications, ie. the prospect of voluntary arrangements, schemes of\narrangement andlor judicial management.\n24. Further, the Respondent failed to advise his clientson the issue of balance sheet\nsolvency:\nNOE 15 December 2021, Page 17 lines to7\n\"Q\nSo, tobe clear, you disagree with my statement that you did\n‘not advise them about the balance sheet solvency. So is\n‘your evidence that you did advise them about balance\nsheet solvency?\nA\n\nNo, I did not advise them on the balance sheet\ninsolvency [sic] because they didn't—because my\ninstructions were they didn't have the money.\n\n25. This was notwithstanding the Respondent's acceptance that (a) Swina’s balance\nsheet recorded an excess of total assets over liabilties and (b) a Cour, at the\ntime when the winding up applications were heard, would consider the issue of\nbalance sheet solvency before granting the applcation.\"* In respect of the\nformer, the Tribunal noted that Swina’s total assets as at 31 December 2016\nwere valued at the amount of SGD 18,577.381.41.\"* which would have been\nlarge enough to settle or substantially settle Swina’s debts to the creditor banks,\n26. This fact could have been relied on to either persuade the creditor banks (in\nparticular, Maybank) to grant mare time for repayment, of at the very least, to\nNOE 14 Docemder 202%, page 25 ine 1910 page 27ine 13.\nAud Statement of Accounts fo\" year ended 31 December 2016, page8 (Ag 1s Bundle\n\"‘of Swra's\nDocuments, page °9),\n\n\fseek an adjournment from the Court. However, this was not done. Nor did the\nRespondent advise his clients on the same\n27. In fact, it would appear that the Respondent never advised nis clients to\nchallenge the bankruptey and winding up proceedings by. for instance, fling a\nreply affidavit exhibiting documents evidencing of Swina’s financial position\nandior legal submissions, The Respondent made no mention of this in his\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief or during the hearing, and did not produce any\ndocuments evidencing that such advice had been given. In this regard, given the\nabsence of credible (or more accurately. any) contemporaneous records taken\nby the Respondent, we found it appropriate to draw an adverse inference against\nthe Respondent\n28. Perhaps mote shockingly, the Respondent did not even advise his clients on\nMaybank’s position in respect of his clients’ repayment proposal, and the\nImplications. of this position on the bankruptcy proceedings, until affer the\nbankruptey orders had been granted by the Court:\nsmber 2021, page 15 lines 7 to 4\n'@\nSo when did you actually inform Ms Alka and her\nhusband about what Maybank solicitors told you?\nA\nAlter ve boen informed ofthis, on that very same morning|\n‘informed her\n@\nWas it before or after\nAttor my cone\nA\nQ\n=the bankruptcy orders were made?\nA\n‘tor my conversation with the.\nQ\nThat's not my question, Mr Singh,\nA\nOkay. After the order was made.\n[emphasis added in bold]\n\nLaw Societyof Srgaporev Tan Phy Khiang (20073 SLR(R) 477 at 82),\n\n\f29. This is despite the fact that the Respondent had. by his own admission, told tho\n‘Complainant that it would be a “matter of formality\" to adjourn the hearings on\nthe basis that negotiations with the creditor banks were underway.\" and that\n‘would take about 6 to 9 months before the applications would be determined by\nthe Court as a result of the creditor banks needing time to consider the\nproposals.®?\n30. AS a result, the Complainant, her husband and Swina were deprived of the\n‘opportunity to consider whether a revised repayment proposal could be pul\nforward to Maybank to avoid the bankruptcy and winding up orders being made.\n31. Finally, after the bankruptcy and winding up orders had been made, the\nRespondent failed to advise his clients on their options moving forward:\nNOE 15 De\n\nmber 2024\n46 to24\nNow, after the orders were made, you also did not\nadvise your clients on the possibility of appeals or\nsetting aside the bankruptcy or winding up orders,\nagree?\nA\nSetting aside, you are agai\n2\n—_Sotting aside or appealing the bankruptcy or winding-up\norders,\nA\nThe bankruptcy order, no, | did not advise them on it.\n[emphasis added in bold]\n32. Throughout the disciplinary proceedings, the Respondent took the position that\nhe had advised his clients by telling them to come up with improved repayment\nproposals that would be acceptable to the banks In our view, this was not at\nall sufficient.\n\n2 NOE 15 December2027, page 10 ines 25 to 29\nNOE 15 December 2027. poge\n1 ines 1210 17\nP Respenents AEIC st (26) NOE 1 December 2021, page S8 Ine 261 page $8 ine 18,\n\n\f33.

In teling his cients to do nothing more than to come up with better repayment\nproposals, the Respondent's advice was plainly perfunctory. Tho very least the\nRespondent would have been expected to do was to, upon learning of Maybank’s\nrejection of his clents’ offer at the door of the Court, update his clients and seek\n‘an adjournment ffom the Court on the basis that he had just been informed that\nhis clients’ offer was rejected.

The specific charge·s were amended\nseveral times, and (as we describe below) the Respondent eventually pleaded guilty to\neach of the charges framed against him.\n\n2.\n\nHaving carefully considered the facts of the case and the parties' respective\nsubmissions, we find that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists:\n\n(a)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 160, the \"Act\") in\nrespect of each of the Charges (as defined below); and\n\n(b)\n\nunder Section 83(2)(h) of the Act in respect of each of the Alternative\nCharges (as defined below).\n\n3.\n\nWe set out our grounds below.\n\nTHE CHARGES\n\n4.\n\nThe Law Society framed eight charges against the Respondent ( collectively, the\n\"Charges\"), alleging that the conduct set out in each of these charges amounted to\n\n\"improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor\" within the meaning of ·\nSection 83(2)(b) of the Act. 1\n\n1\n\nThe Law Society's Statement of Case (Amendment No. 3) (the \"SOC\"), at [21).\n\n1\n\n\f..\n\n5.\n\nThe Law Society also framed alternative charges (collectively, the \"Alternative\nCharges\") in respect of each of the Charges, asserting (in the alternative) that the\n\nconduct described in each of the Charges also amounted to \"misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an\nhonourable profession\" within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Act. 2\n\n6.\n\nThe Charges and Alternative Charges were set out in the Law Society's Statement of\nCase, which was amended a total of four times. At the start of the hearing before us,\nthe iteration of the charges facing the Respondent was set out in the Law Society's\nStatement of Case (Amendment No. 1).\n\nThe Respondent pleaded guilty to the\n\nfollowing part of the Fifth Charge and to the whole of the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth\nCharges:\n\n\"Fifth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 3 April 2018, at about 8pm, at the office of\nSamuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore, have\nconducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or practice as\nan advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Act by\nbreaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (being\na rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section 71 of\nthe Act), in that you:\n\n(ij\n\n(ii)\n\nThreatened to take a knife to kill Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel.\n\nSixth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 17 April 2018, at about 5:54pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\n2\n\nSOC, at [21].\n\n2\n\n\f.'\n\nhava conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of.conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you used criminal force against one Ms Kang Pei Shan\nRachel by using your finger to jab her forehead, and by pushing the files that Ms\nKang Pei Shan Rachel was holding against her chest.\n\nSeventh Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 17 April 2018, at about 5:54pm, atthe office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n'71 of the Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nVoluntarily causing hurt to one Ms Kong Shing Ying Brenda by grabbing her\narms, pushing her against a table, repeatedly slapping her, jabbing your\nfinger at Ms Kong's forehead and pushing Ms Kong with your shoulder such\nthat she lost balance and fell backwards; and/or\n\n(iO\n\nVerbally abused Ms Kong Shin Ying Brenda by aggressively berating her\nand screaming at her.\n\nEighth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 17 April 2018, at about 5:58pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nUsed criminal force against one Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene by pushing her\nwith such force that she fell to the floor; and/or\n\n3\n\n\f.\n\n'\n\n(ii)\n\nVerbally abused Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene by aggressively berating her and\nscreaming at her.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent initially contested the First to Fourth Charges and the remaining part\nof the Fifth Charge, as well as the alternatives to each of these charges.\n\nWe\n\nproceeded to hear evidence from witness for both the Law Society and the\nRespondent in two tranches, from 14 to 16 August 2019 and on 26 and 27 September\n2019. We then directed parties to submit their respective closing submissions by 25\nOctober 2019, and scheduled a hearing for oral closing submissions on 19 November\n2019. 3\n\n8.\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the Law Society sought leave to further amend their Statement\nof Case, and informed us that the Respondent was prepared to plead guilty to the\nremainder of the charges as set out in the proposed amendments. 4 The Respondent\n5\n\nconfirmed this, and we allowed the proposed amendments. 6\n\n9.\n\nAt the hearing on 19 November 2019, the Law Society sought, and was granted, leave\nto file a further amended Statement of Case incorporating one minor amendment. The\nRespondent subsequently pleaded guilty to the First to Four Charges and the\nremainder of the Fifth Charge (and their alternatives) as set out in the Statement of\nCase (Amendment No. 3). These Charges read:\n\n\"First Charge\n\n3\n\n4\n\nThe Tribunal's directions made at the end of the hearing on 26 September 2019.\nLetter dated 1 November 2019 from The Law Society's solicitors Allen & Gledhill LLP to the\nSecretariat.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nEmail dated 1 November 2019 from the Respondent's solicitors Eugene Thuraisingam LLP to the\nSecretariat.\nThe Tribunal's directions dated 4 November 2019.\n4\n\n\f,\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 16 March 2018, at or about 7pm, at the\noffice of Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01,\nSingapore, have conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper\nconduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section\n- 83{2)(b) of the Act by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules {being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council\nunder Section 71 of/he Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nConducted yourself in an intemperate and/or boorish manner towards one\nMs Kang Pei Shan Rachel by throwing files and boxes on the floor in her\ngeneral direction, and/or by screaming at her; and/or\n\n(ii)\n\nVerbally abused Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by screaming at her.\n\nSecond Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 26 March 2018, sometime in the afternoon,\nat the office of Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01,\nSingapore, have conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper\nconduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section\n83(2)(b) of the Act by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules {being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council\nunder Section 71 of the Act), in that you conducted yourself in an intemperate\nand/or boorish manner towards one Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by throwing a metal\nstapler on the floor in her general direction.\n\nThird Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 28 March 2018, at about 3pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2){b) of the\nAct by breaching rule 8(3){b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you conducted yourself in an intemperate and/or boorish\nmanner towards one Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by throwing a metal stapler on the\nfloor in her general direction.\n\n5\n\n.\n\n\f..\n\nFourth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 28 March 2018, at about 9pm, at the office\nof Samuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore,\nhave conducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the\nA_ct by breaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules\n(being a rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section\n71 of the Act), in that you:\n\n(ij\n\nConducted yourself in an intemperate and/or boorish manner towards one\nMs Kang Pei Shan Rachel by advancing towards her in an aggressive\nand/or threatening manner such that she stumbled and fell to the floor,\nand/or by shouting at her; and/or\n\n(iij\n\nVerbally abused Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel by shouting at her.\n\nFifth Charge\n\nThat you, Seow Theng Beng Samuel, an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme\nCourt of the Republic of Singapore, on 3 April 2018, at about 8pm, at the office of\nSamuel Seow Law Corporation at 79 South Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore, have\nconducted yourself in a manner which amounts to improper conduct or practice as\nan advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Act by\nbreaching rule 8(3)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (being\na rule of conduct made by the Professional Conduct Council under Section 71 of\n\nthe Act), in that you:\n\n(i)\n\nConducted yourself in an intemperate and/or ~?orish manner towards one\nMs Kang Pei Shan Rachel by repeatedly throwing your wallet in her\ngeneral direction; and/or\n\n(ii)\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent therefore admitted the facts as set out in the Statement of Case\n(Amendment No. 3) and pleaded guilty to all of the Charges and Alternative Charges\n\n6\n\n\f..\nproffered against him. The Respondent's admissions mean that it is common ground\nbetween the parties that the Respondent's conduct as described in: 7\n\n(a)\n\nThe Charges amounted to improper conduct under Section 83(2)(b)(i) of the Act;\nand\n\n(b)\n\nThe Alternative Charges amounted to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor under Section 83(2)(h) of the Act.\n\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL\n\n11.\n\nThe function of a Disciplinary Tribunal is to act as a filter in order to determine whether\nor not there is 'cause of sufficient gravity' that could, on a finding by the Court of Three\nJudges, be ascertained to constitute 'due cause' that merited the imposition of one of\nthe range of sanctions prescribed in Section 83(1) of the Act: Law Society of\nSingapore v Jasmine Gowrimani dlo Daniel (\"Jasmine Danief'). 8\n\n12.\n\nIt is not for us to determine whether or not 'due cause' has been established in this\ncase - that determination lies solely within the purview of the Court of Three Judges.\nOur role is to decide whether 'cause of sufficient gravity' has been established, and for\nthat we need only be satisfied that there was a prima facie case on the relevant\nevidence that 'due cause' might be present: Jasmine Danie/. 9 If we conclude that\n'cause of sufficient gravity' has been established, the Law Society is obliged pursuant\nto Se.ction 94 of the Act to make an application under Section 98 of the Act to the\nCourt of Three Judges.\n\n7\n\nSee also the Agreed Statement of Facts (Amendment No. 1).\n\n8\n\n[201 OJ 3 SLR 390, at [37].\n\n9\n\nIbid., at [31 ].\n\n7\n\n\f13.\n\nWe are also mindful that the fact that it is common ground that while the Respondent's\nconduct fell within the ambit of limbs (b) and (h) of Section 83(2), this does not\nnecessarily mean that 'cause of sufficient gravity' had been established: Jasmine\nDanie!. 10\n\n14.\n\nWe turn to consider the parties' respective submissions in light of these principles.\n\nTHE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE CASES\n\n15.\n\nThe options available to us at the close of proceedings are set out in Section 93(1) of\nthe Act:\n\n\"93 (1)\n\nAfter hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary\n\nTribunal shall record its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to\nthose facts shall determine that -\n\n(a)\n\nno cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83_ or 83A (as the case may be);\n\n(b)\n\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83 or 83A (as the case may be), the regulated legal\npractitioner should be -\n\n(i)\n\nordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to\nthe misconduct committed;\n\n(ii)\n\nreprimanded;\n\n(iii)\n\nordered to comply with one or more remedial measures; or\n\n(iv)\n\nsubjected to the measure in sub-paragraph (iiij in addition to\nthe measure in sub-paragraph (ij or (iij; or\n\n10\n\nIbid., at [39].\n\n8\n\n\f(c)\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section\n83 or 83A (as the case may be).\"\n\n16.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action, within\nthe meaning of section 93(1)(c) of the Act, had been shown to exist. Its grounds on\nwhich it bases its case can broadly be summarized as follows:\n\n(a)\n\n11\n\nThe nature of the Respondent's conduct is sufficiently serious by itself to amount\nto a prima facie case of \"due cause\" under Section 83 of the Act;\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent was in a position of authority vis-a-vis the victims, who were his\nemployees;\n\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent's conduct was part of a pattern of intemperate, boorish and\nbelligerent conduct, and were not isolated incidents; and\n\n(d)\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent has not shown genuine remorse for his actions.\n\nThe Respondent argued that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\nexisted, but that the circumstances nonetheless warranted him bein·g ordered to pay a\nfine of S$20,000. He described such a fine as the \"most proportionate sanction in this\ncase\", 12 claiming in mitigation that:\n\n(a)\n\n\"little if any harm was caused\" to the individual victims in this case;\n\n11\n\nThe Law Society's Skeletal Submissions on Sanction (the \"LSS' Submissions\"), at [42].\n\n12\n\nThe Respondent's Submissions on Sentence (the \"Respondent's Submissions\"), at [8].\n9\n\n\f18.\n\n(b)\n\nhe was suffering from \"Adjustment Disorder\" at the relevant time;\n\n(c)\n\nhe is \"deeply and genuinely remorseful for his behavior'; and\n\n(d)\n\nhis conduct had caused little harm to the integrity of the legal profession.\n\nThe Law Society's arguments referred to in paragraphs 16(a) to (c) above and the\nRespondent's argument referred to in paragraph 17(a) above all broadly relate to the\nseverity of the Respondent conduct. We shall therefore deal with this issue first.\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS\n\n(a)\n\nThe severity of the Respondent's conduct\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society highlighted several facts which they claimed underscored the severity\nof the Respondent's conduct. First, the Seventh and Eighth Charges relate to overt\nacts of physical violence inflicted by the Respondent on Ms Kong Shin Ying Brenda\n\n(\"Ms Kong\") and Ms Tan Tzuu Yen Serene (\"Ms Tan\"). 13\n\n20.\n\nWhile Ms Tan did not seek medical treatment after the incident, Ms Kong did do so\nand was assessed by the examining doctor at Parkway .East Hospital to have\nsustained \"multiple soft tissue injuries as a result of the assaulf'.\n\nThe examining\n\ndoctor also noted tenderness, bruising and abrasions on various parts of Ms Kong's\nhead and body. 14\n\n13\n\nThe Respondent's Submissions on Sentence (\"Respondent's Submissions\"), at [8].\n\n14\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [47].\n\n10\n\n\f, ,\n\n21.\n\nSecond, it is plain from the video recording of the incident that the Respondent was\nmuch larger than both Ms Kong and Ms Tan, and was clearly the aggressor in both\naltercations. 15\n\nIt is also clear from the video that the Respondent would have\n\ncontinued attacking Ms Kong and Ms Tan, and most likely have inflicted more severe\ninjuries on both of them, if not for the fact that he had been physically restrained by\nother employees and thereby prevented from doing so.\n\n22.\n\n16\n\nThird, the attacks had been triggered by a fairly trivial matter - namely, that the\nRespondent had to meet a client with an associate from the firm but that associate was\napparently not in the office at that time. It had nothing to do with any act or omission\non the part of either Ms Kong or Ms Tan.\n\n23.\n\n17\n\nFourth, the Sixth Charge relates to physically aggressive conduct by the Respondent\nagainst Ms Kang Pei Shan Rachel (\"Ms Kang\"). The Respondent has been charged\nwith an offence of using criminal force under Section 352 of the Penal Code for using\nhis finger to jab Ms Kang's forehead knowing that such action would illegally cause\nannoyance to Ms Kang. 18\n\n24.\n\nFifth, the First to Fifth Charges relate to intemperate and/or boorish conduct by the\nRespondent directed towards Ms Kang on five separate occasions. These incidents\ninvolved (i) throwing files, boxes, a metal stapler and his wallet in Ms Kang's general\n\ndirection, (ii) shouting at, and advancing towards, Ms Kang in an aggressive and/or\nthreatening manner, and (iii) threatening to take a knife to kill Ms Kang.\n\n15\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [50].\n\n16\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [59(a)].\n\n17\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [51].\n\n18\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [62].\n\n19\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [66].\n11\n\n19\n\n\f25.\n\nSixth, the Respondent was charged under Section 3(1 )(a) of the Protection from\nHarassment Act with using threatening words against Ms Kang with intent to cause\ndistress. This was in relation to the Respondent's threat to take a knife to kill Ms Kang,\nwhich also forms part of the Fifth Charge.\n\n26.\n\nThe Law Society referred to and relied on the decision of the Court of Three Judges in\nLaw Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee (\"Wong Sin Yee\"). 20 That case involved an\n\nincident of what is commonly termed 'road rage'. and the respondent advocate and\nsolicitor in that case was charged and convicted in the State Courts under the then\nSection 323 of the Penal Code for having voluntarily caused hurt to a member of the\npublic, as well as under Section 13A(1 )(a) of the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order\n· and Nuisance) Amended Act for uttering insulting words to a member of the public.\n\n27.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in that case found that the respondent advocate and\nsolicitor's behavior \"constitute[d] a defect of character and render[ed] him unfit to be an\nadvocate and solicitor'. and that his conduct fell within the ambit of Section 83(2)(a) of\n\nthe Act. 21 He was consequently suspended from practice for two years.\n\n28.\n\nThe Law Society relied on the decision in Wong Sin Yee to support its contention that\nthe Respondent's acts of physical violence and verbal abuse towards the various\nindividuals were sufficient to constitute 'cause of sufficient gravity'. The Law Society\nsubmits that, as was the case with the respondent advocate and solicitor in Wong Sin\nYee, the Respondent here had also demonstrated a serious lack of self-restraint. 22\n\n20\n\n[2003] 3 SLR(R) 209.\n\n21\n\nIbid., at [15].\n\n22\n\nLSS' Submissions, at [57].\n12\n\n\f, ,\n\n29.\n\nThe Law Society also submitted that the Respondent's conduct had not been borne\nout of mere frustration with Ms Kang's work performance.\n\nThey argued that the\n\nseverity and persistence of the Respondent's physical aggression towards Ms Kang\n(by throwing objects in her general direction and advancing towards her in an\naggressive and threatening manner) was evidence of something more, and in fact\namounted to bullying. 23\n\n30.\n\nThey also argued that the severity of the Respondent's scolding of Ms Kang (in terms\nof volume, frequency and vituperation) was out of proportion to any perceived\nshortcomings in her work performance, and that there were in any event more\nappropriate options for dealing with any such shortcomings. 24\n\n31.\n\nThese facts are not disputed. Taken as a whole, we agree with the Law Society that\nthey paint a clear picture of physical and verbal abuse by the Respondent.\n\n32.\n\nIt is common ground that as their superior at work, the Respondent was in a position of\nauthority vis-a-vis each of Ms Kang, Ms Kong and Ms Tan.\n\nThe Respondent's\n\nphysically and verbally abusive conduct towards these individuals was therefore an\nabuse of his position of authority over them.\n\n33.\n\nWe also note that the conduct set out in the Charges (which Respondent admitted) did\nnot involve \"isolated incidents or momentary lapses\".\n\nInstead, as the Law Society\n\nargues, they appear to be indicative of a pattern of intemperate, boorish and\nbelligerent conduct on the Respondent's part. 25\n\n23\n\nLSS's Submissions, at [72(a)].\n\n24\n\nLSS's Submissions, at [72(b)].\n\n25\n\nLSS's Submissions, at [75].\n\n13\n\n\f' '\n\n34.\n\nWhen all these facts are considered together, the picture that appears is one that\nshows the Respondent physically and verbally abusing his subordinates in a manner\nthat was not 'one-off' of the resulted of momentary lapses.\n\nOn any analysis, such\n\nmisconduct cannot be described as anything other than serious.\n\n35.\n\nThe seriousness of the Respondent's misconduct and the fact that it contravened both\nSection 83(2)(b) and 83(2)(h) of the Act would in our view suffice to constitute cause of\nsufficient gravity within the meaning of Section 93(1 )(c) of the Act in the absence of\nany valid mitigating factors. We therefore turn next to consider whether there are any\nsuch mitigating factors.\n\n(b)\n\nHarm caused. and impact on. the victims\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent argues there was little, if any, harm caused to Ms Kang, Ms Kong\nand Ms Tan. He points to the fact that Ms Tan did not suffer any injuries as a result of\nthe Respondent's conduct described in the Eighth Charge (which is the only Charge\nthat relates to her).\n\n37.\n\nHe also relies on two statements from Ms Kang and Ms Kong dated 28 May 2019 26\nand 26 June 2019\n\n27\n\nrespectively (collectively, the \"Statements\").\n\nIn Ms Kang's\n\nstatement, she states that she \"did not suffer any injuries as a result of [the\nRespondent's] actions on 17 April 2018\". 28\n\n38.\n\nSimilarly, Ms Kong states that \"although the incident may have appeared violent, [she]\nonly suffered minor injuries such as a scratch and bruise\". She describes the incident\n\n26\n\nThe Respondent's Bundle of Documents \"RBOD\") Tab 1.\n\n27\n\nRBOD Tab 2.\n\n28\n\nRBODTab1.\n\n14\n\n\f'I\n\nas \"no more than a noisy and dramatic altercation caused by loud shrieking and some\nshoving\". 29 The Respondent also relies on the fact that both Ms Kang and Ms Kong\n\"have wholeheartedly chosen to forgive the Respondent and continue to affirm him\". 30\n\n39.\n\nThe Law Society objected to these Statements, arguing that they are inadmissible\nbecause the Law Society did not have the opportunity of cross-examining the makers\nof the Statements as they were only tendered as part of the Respondent's closing\narguments. The Law Society also argued that even if admissible, the Statements are\nirrelevant to the question of whether or not sufficient cause of gravity exists.\n\n40.\n\nHaving considered the parties' arguments and authorities on this issue, we find that\nthe Respondent is entitled to tender and refer to the Statements. However, having\nconsidered the contents of the Statements, we find that they are of not much\nassistance to the Respondent in mitigating the seriousness of his conduct.\n\n41.\n\nTaken at face value, the Statements simply set out the purported impact of the\nRespondent's conduct on Ms Kang and Ms Kong, and that they have both forgiven the\nRespondent. Two factors are relevant when considering these Statements. First, both\nMs Kong and Ms Kang may well have been motivated to speak out in support of the\nRespondent in these proceedings because the former is his niece and the latter\nremains an employee of his company.\n\n42.\n\nSecond, the video of the 17 April 2018 incident clearly shows that the Respondent had\nto be physically restrained from further attacking Ms Kong and Ms Tan. Had he not\nbeen so restrained, he would very likely have inflected more serious injuries on them.\nThe fact that Ms Kong's injuries were relatively minor was likely purely fortuitous.\n\n29\n\nRBOD Tab 2.\n\n30\n\nRespondent's Submissions, at [12].\n\n15\n\n\f' '\n\n43.\n\nThe relevance of the Statements is therefore (at best) minimal when considered in the\ncontext of these factors.\n\n(c)\n\n'Adiustment Disorder'\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent argues that he has been \"diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder at the\ntime of the offences\" and that this \"contributed to the commission of the offences\". 31\nHe relies in this regard on two medical reports dated 21 August 2019 32 and 13\nSeptember 2019 33 (the \"Medical Reports\") from Dr Tan Chue Tin, a clinical\npsychotherapist.\n\n45.\n\nDr Tan states in his first report that the Respondent \"suffered from Adjustment\n,--a-.-, ·-\n\nDisorder at the time of the altercation recorded in the audio-video clips of April 2018 I\n2019\". 34 He expands on this in his second report, saying that the Adjustment Disorder\n\"contributed to the commission of the offences as depicted'' in the video of the 17 April\n2018 incident. 35\n\n46.\n\nThe Law Society also objected to these Medical Reports on the same grounds as the\n-\n\nStatements. As with the Statements, we find that while the Respondent is entitled to\ntender and refer to them as part of his mitigation, they do not assist him very much.\n\n47.\n\nWe note that Dr Tan first saw· the Respondent only _in May 2019, more than a year\nafter the incidents that formed the subject of the charges. Yet the Medical Reports do\n\n31\n\nRespondent's Submissions, at [14].\n\n32\n\nRBOD Tab 3.\n\n33\n\nRBOD Tab 4.\n\n34\n\nRBOD Tab 3, at page 10.\n\n35\n\nRBOD Tab 4, at [3].\n\n16\n\n\fnot contain any explanation as to how Dr Tan was able to ascertain that the\nRespondent suffered from Adjustment Disorder at the time of the incidents.\n\nMore\n\nimportantly, Dr Tan does not explain exactly what Adjustment Disorder is and how it\npurportedly contributed to the Respondent's behavior during the incidents.\n\nWe\n\ntherefore found the Medical Reports to be of very little assistance.\n\n(d)\n\nRemorse\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent claimed that he was \"deeply and genuinely remorsefuf' for his\nbehavior. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he stated:\n\n\"Lastly, I acknowledge and take full responsibility for my inability to manage my\nanger. I am also, by nature, a flamboyant and animated person. When I lose my\ntemper, I often scream and shout and throw things about. However, I wish to state\nthat despite my anger management problem, I have never intended to hurt anyone.\n\nI regret and unreservedly apologise for my actions.\n\nI am undergoing medical\n\ntreatment to ensure that this does not happen again.\" [Respondent's emphasis]\n\n49.\n\nThe Law Society. contends that the Respondent has not shown genuine remorse for\nhis actions, arguing that this is clear from his contemporaneous conduct. They point in\nparticular to the following:\n\n(a)\n\nWhen first confronted with the complaints, the Respondent did not admit any\nwrongdoing but instead claimed that Ms Kang had been manipulated by one Mr\nRobert Raj Joseph and Mr Lew Shaun Marc.\n\nThe Respondent's letter of 2\n\nOctober 2018 to the Inquiry Committee36 sought to downplay the physical\naltercation with Ms Kong on 17 April 2018 and sought to justify his conduct by\nalleging that she had hit him first.\n36\n\nLaw Society's Supplemental Bundle of Documents (\"LS Supp BOD\") Tab 7, at [88] to [99].\n17\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn an interview with the Today newspaper published on 17 May 2018, 37 the\nRespondent sought to downplay the incident which forms the subject of the\nSeventh Charge, claiming that Ms Kong had \"shoved him first and he had then\nslapped her for being rude\". He described the incident as a \"typical family type\nof fighf' (Ms Kang being the Respondent's niece).\n\n(c)\n\nIn that same interview, he claimed that he had not shoved Ms Tan to the ground\nbut had rather \"accidentally knocked her to the ground when he turned around'.\nThis is materially different from the facts set out in the Eighth Charge, which the\nRespondent now admits. The Respondent admitted to the quotes attributed to\nhim in this interview.\n\n(d)\n\nIn an interview with 8 Days magazine published on 31 May 2018, the\nRespondent is quoted as having denied punching people, throwing things or\nhurting people. His denial of having been physically violent is clearly untrue in\nlight of his admissions in these proceedings. The Respondent admitted to the\naccuracy of the quotes attributed to him.\n\n(e)\n\nIn posts on his Facebook page dated 26 April 2019 38 and 6 June 2019, 39 the\nRespondent sought to downplay the events which are the subject of some of the\nCharges. He admits having made these posts.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent's conduct from the time of the incident is clearly relevant to\nascertaining whether he is truly remorseful for what happened.\n\n37\n\nLaw Society's Bundle of Documents (\"LSBOD\") Tab 14.\n\n38\n\nLS Supp BOD Tab 3.\n\n39\n\nLS Supp BOD Tab 4.\n\n18\n\nA review of the\n\n\fRespondent's conduct reveals a clear difference in his conduct before and after April\n2019, when the video of the 17 April 2018 incident was made public.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent's correspondence with the Inquiry Committee and the interviews\nreferred to in paragraph 49(a) to (d} above all pre-dated the public disclosure of the\nvideo.\n\nFar from expressing remorse, the Respondent seeks to deflect blame and\n\nresponsibility. His approach changed once the video was made public, as evidenced\nby the social media posts referred to in paragraph 49( e) above.\n\nThe Respondent\n\nexpressly referred to the video and sought to downplay the severity and significance of\nthe events. His conduct at the material time therefore does not reflect any degree of\nremorse on his part.\n\n52.\n\nWe therefore find that the Respondent's contemporaneous conduct does not support\nhis assertion that he is genuinely remorseful about the incidents that are the subject of\nthe complaints.\n\n(e)\n\nThe Respondent's other arguments\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent also makes two broad arguments in support of his submission that no\ncause of sufficient gravity exists and that a high fine would be the appropriate sanction\nin this case.\n\nFirst, he argues that he \"manifests a high potential for rehabilitation\n\nbecause he demonstrates insight into his psychiatric condition\" 40 (his emphasis). He\n\nrelies on the fact that he voluntarily sought psychiatric help and \"is receiving help from\nDr Augustine Tan, an experienced psychotherapisf'.\n\n40\n\nRespondent's Submissions, at [19].\n19\n\n\f.\n\n_,\n\n54.\n\nWe find it self-serving for the Respondent to claim that he has a high potential for\nrehabilitation. We note that while he relies on the fact that he sought medical help, he\ndid not do so until more than a year after the incidents and only after the video of the\nincident had been made public. We also note that we do not have the benefit of Dr\nAugustine Tan's views on this issue.\n\n55.\n\nIn any event, we do not think that the Respondent's potential for rehabilitation is a\nfactor for us to consider in deciding whether 'cause of sufficient gravity' exists on the\nfacts of this case.\n\nThat may well be relevant for the Court of Three Judges'\n\nconsiderations on the appropriate sentence should they find that 'due cause' has been\nestablished. Even if we are wrong, and the potential for rehabilitation is a factor that\nwe should consider at this stage, there is no evidential basis for us to conclude that the\nRespondent has a high potential for rehabilitation.\n\n56.\n\nSecond, the Respondent refers to the judgment of the Court of Three Judges in Law\nSociety of Singapore v Ravi s/o Madasamy (\"Ravi Madasamy''), where the Court\noutlined the principles governing the imposition_ of sanctions in disciplinary proceedings\n- namely (i) the need to protect members of the public, (ii) the need to uphold public\nconfidence in the integrity of the profession, (iii) the need to deter the same or other\nsolicitors from similar behavior, and (iv) the need to punish the particular solicitor\ninvolved.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these factors, when considered in the context of the facts\nof this case, support his submission that the imposition of a fine would suffice.\n\n58.\n\nWe do not agree. In our view, the Respondent's reference to and reliance on Ravi\nMadasamy is misplaced. The Court of Three Judges in that case set out the principles\ngoverning the sentencing of advocates and solicitors where 'due cause' is found to\n\n20\n\n\f\\\n\nhave been established. That is plainly evident from the principles themselves, which\ninclude considering the impact on members of the public as well as the legal\nprofession as a whole.\n\n59.\n\nSuch considerations are not within our remit. Our role is limited to deciding whether\n'cause of sufficient gravity' has been established to warrant the referral of this matter to\nthe Court of Three Judges. If we answer that question in the affirmative, it would then\nbe for the Court of Three Judges to decide whether 'due cause' has been established,\nand if so to impose the appropriate sentence having considered the various principles\ndiscussed in Ravi Madasamy.\n\n60.\n\nWe therefore find that the arguments raised by the Respondent in mitigation are not\nsufficient to persuade us that the severity of his misconduct does not amount to 'cause\nof sufficient gravity'.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n61.\n\nWe therefore find and determine, within the meaning of Section 93(1 )(c) of the Act,\nthat cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83(2)(b) of\nthe Act in respect of each of the First to Eighth Charges.\n\n62.\n\nWe also find and determine, within the meaning of Section 93(1)(c) of the Act, that\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section 83(2)(h) of the\nAct in respect of each of the Alternative First to Eighth Charges.\n\n21\n\n\f63.\n\nWe also order, pursuant to Section 93(2) of the Act, that the Respondent pays the Law\nSociety's costs in relation to these proceedings, such costs to be taxed by the\nRegistrar if not agreed.\n\nfl,\n\nDated this\n\n/0\n\nSiraj Omar, C\nPresident\n\nday of March 2020\n\nPradeep Pillai\nAdvocate\n\n22\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-12-05T02:00:23+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-dec-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Yeo Poh Tiang [Yang Baozhen] (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Yeo Poh Tiang [Yang Baozhen] (Respondent), </strong><strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from a complaint lodged by one Mdm Koh Hwee Miem (<strong>Complainant</strong>).</p><div class=\"lawga-mid-article\" id=\"lawga-1279675203\"><a href=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/mid_article_1\" aria-label=\"mid article 1\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature.jpg 768w, https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/inlinemidarticle2021_feature-300x56.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" width=\"768\" height=\"143\"></a></div>\n<p>On 12 February 2020, the Complainant paid Yeo &amp; Associates LLC (<strong>the Firm</strong>) a sum of fees to utilise the services offered on an online portal developed by the Respondent to facilitate and expedite uncontested divorces (<strong>the Portal</strong>).</p>\n<p>On 5 March 2020, the Complainant requested for a full refund of fees paid as there had been no communication with either the Firm or the Respondent following the payment made on 12 February 2020.

Sreenivasan SC,\nand Ranita Yogeeswaran from M/s Straits Law Practice LLC.\n\nProcedural History\n\n6\n\nThese proceedings involve 2 charges for breaches of Rule 17(3) as well as Rule 5(2) of\n\nthe Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (\"Rules\"), which amount to\nimproper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under Section 83(2Xb) of the\n\nLPA, with 2 altemative charges for misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor\nunder Section S3(2)(h) of the LPA. In essence, the l't Charge under Rule 17(3) of the\n\nRules alleges that the Respondent failed to inform the Complainant that fees paid for\nservices were charged on a non-refundable basis, while the 2nd Charge under Rule 5(2)(c)\n\nand (h) of the Rules alleges that the Respondent failed to provide/contact/instruct the\n\n\fa\nJ\n\nComplainant in respect of the services after 22 days even though the services were\nrepresented as\n\n7\n\noofast\n\nand expedient\".\n\nPursuanl tu the tlircul.iurrs of this Triburral, the Defenus was filcd ul 1 1 August 2021, tlte\n\nLists of Documents were filed on26 August 2021, the Affidavits of Evidence in Chiel\nBundles of Documents and Bundles of Authorities were filed on 28 September 202I,the\n\nOpening Statements were filed on 14 October 2011 and the matter was scheduled for\nhearing from 20 to 22 October 2021. On the 1't day of the hearing, Counsel for the Law\n\nSociety sought leave to amend the Statement of Case and in particular, to clarifir the\nelements of the 2 charges, and to separate the altemative charges. Counsel for the\nRespondent had no objections. The Tribunal granted leave for the amendments and the\n\nhearing was completed on the 2\"d day after receiving testimony from the Complainant\nand the Respondent. Following the hearing and as directed by the Tribunal in consultation\n\nwith the parties, the parties submitted and exchanged their respective written closing\nsubmissions on 2 December 2021 as well as written reply closing submissions on 23\nDecember 2021.\n\nBackground\n\n8\n\nThe Firm owns and operates \"DivorceBureau@\" a\n\nwebsite\n\n(WUirUdjyr:Ioelglgglf.gQ.n.sg) described as a \"Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Portal\" (o'Portal\")\ndeveloped by the Respondent to facilitate and expedite uncontested divorces at lower\n\ncost. DivorceBureau@ Service (\"DBS\") was the basic service to assist users with\ngenerating the necessary Court documents. The Portal offered the \"PLUS Service\" (also\n\nreferred to as \"PLUSS\") to assist users with filing the Court papers and the \"Legal\n\nAdvice Service\" (also referred to as \"LAS\") to provide a consultation with a \"senior\nfamily lawyer\". DBS costs 5$599, PLUSS costs 5$380 and LAS costs S$150.\n\n9\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the Complainant opted for the DBS, PLUSS and LAS and paid the\nsum of S$1,129 to the Firm through the Portal. Thereafter, the Complainant did not\n\ncomplete the online forms and had no communication with the Firm and/or the\n\n\f-4Respondent until the Complainant requested a full refund on 5 March 2020, ie,22 days\nlater.\n\n10. On 6 March 2020, the Firm's staff replied to reject this request and despite the\nComplainant's appeal, the Firm maintained that the payment was \"non-refundable\". On\n11 March 2020, there was further communication with the Complainant and the Firm's\n\nstaff highlighted the disclaimer that the payment was \"considered fully utilised\" with\naccess to the subsequent pages and extended this position beyond DBS to include PLUSS\n\nand LAS as well.\n\nl1\n\nOn 1 I March 2020, the Complainant attempted to contact the Respondent to no avail and\nreplied to the Firm and Respondent via email. The Complainant called the Firm, but the\n\nstaff was unwilling to discuss the matter fuither. On 12 March 2020, the Complainant\nand Respondent communicated via email. However, there was no amicable solution or\n\nresolution to this issue.\n\n12. On 15 March 2020, the Complainant informed the Firm to stop work (if any) and the\nRespondent reiterated the previous position and the \"terms and conditions\" of the Portal.\n\nThe Complaint\n\n13. By way of a letter to the Law Society of Singapore dated 13 May 2020, the Complainant\nlodged the Complaint against the Respondent for:\n\n(a) acting in a way which was contrary to a legal practitioner's position by using\nintimidating language and accusing her of harassment when she repeated her\nrequest for a refund of fees for services which, from her point of view, had not been\n\nprovided;\n\n(b) lacking honesty about the services covered by the fees which the Complainant had\npaid for, and for refusing to provide services which the Complainant had already\npaid for; and\n\n\f-5-\n\n(c) failing to act with reasonable diligence in the provision of services, as no\ndocuments were prepared and no appointment had been made for legal\nconsultationo and the services were not completed by the time the Respondent\nrequested a refund on 5 March 2020, which was 22 days after she paid for the\nservices through the Portal.\n\nLaw Society's Case\n\n14. The Law Society took the position that the Complainant became a client of the Firm and\nthe Respondent upon making payment for legal services (DBS, PLUSS and LAS) on 12\n\nFebruary 2020. The Law Society submitted that the purported disclaimers relied on by\n\nthe Respondent: (i) did not negate the solicitor-client relationship, and (ii) did not\nadequately inform the Complainant that the legal fees were paid on a\n\noonon-refundable\"\n\nbasis. The Law Society further submitted there was a failure to act with reasonable\ndiligence and competence and to provide timely advice since the Respondent did not\ncontact the Complainant for 22 days and the Portal represented that the process would be\n'ofast and easy\". The Tribunal notes that the Law Society has not proposed a particular\n\nsanction but highlighted relevant precedents that supported a reprimand for breach of\n\nRule 17(3) and a fine for breach of Rule 5(2) of the Rules. The Tribunal understood the\n\nLaw Society's position to be that there was no dishonesty and no cause of sufficient\ngravity for disciplinary action under Section 83 of the LPA.\n\nRespondent's Case\n\n15. The Respondent contends there was no solicitor-client relationship with the Complainant\nbecause the Portal provided \"DIY services\" and sought to separate the distinct services.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Complainant was a litigantin-person and that\nthe purported disclaimers highlighted: (i) there was no solicitor-client relationship, and\n\n(ii) the payments were \"fully utilized\" upon access to the Portal pages. The Respondent\nexplained that the Complainant would have been contacted after 30 days if the forms had\nnot been submitted because the Portal allowed users to \"edit the online form for the next\n\n30 days\" and that the Complainant did not request for PLUSS and LAS. The Tribunal\n\n\f6notes that the Respondent has proposed a fine or reprimand if one or both charges are\nestablished.\n\nTribunal's Determination\n\n16. During the hearing, the Tribunal heard the testimony of the Complainant and the\nRespondent and after the hearing, the Tribunal has considered the written submissions\nand written reply submissions of the parties in arriving at its findings on the pertinent\nissues. From the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Charges do not include DBS and relate\n\nto PLUSS and LAS only. The Charges (as amended) are set out below.\n\nFIRST CHARGE\n\nT'hat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\n\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") Iocated at I0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People's Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are charged that you had, on or around I 2 February 2020, breached\nRule l7(3) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, in that you hadfailed\n\nto inform Koh Hutee Miem that the fees which she paid on 12 February 2020 for the\n\"PLUS Service\" and \"Legal Advice Service\" were being charged on a non-refundable\nbasis, such breach amounting to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and\n\nsolicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.\n\nALTERNATIVE FIRST CHARGE\nThat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") located at l0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People's Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are cltarged that you had, on or around l2 February 2020, failed to\ninform Koh Hwee Miem that thefees which she paid on 12 February 2020for the \"PLUS\n\nService\" and \"Legal Advice Service\" were being charged on a non-refundable basis,\nand are thereby guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an\n\n\f-7 -\n\nfficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the\nmeaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act.\n\nSECOND CHARGE\nThat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") located at I0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People's Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are charged thatyouhad, between I2 February 2020 and 5 March\n2020, breached Rule 5(2)(c) and (h) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules, in that you hadfailed to provide tlte services which Koh Hwee Miem had paid.for\n\non l2 February 2020, includingfiling of court documents in Court under the \"PLUS\nService\", and providing legal advice under the \"Legal Advice Service\", ond that no\ndocument had beenfiled and no appointment had beenfixed with Koh Hwee Miem even\n\nafter a period of 22 days had passed, despite the fact that the aforesaid services were\nstated to be fost and expedient; further, that you had failed to contact Koh Hwee Miem\n\nin respect of the services that had beenpaidfor on 12 February 2020 or instruct Koh\nHwee Miem on how to avail herself of the qforesaid services, such breach amounting to\n\nimproper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section\n83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act.\n\nALTERNATIVE SECOND CHARGE\nThat you, YEO POH TIANG (YANG BAOZHEN), an Advocate and Solicitor of the\nSupreme Court of Singapore, whilst practicing with the firm of Yeo & Associates LLC\n\n(\"the Firm\") located at I0lA Upper Cross Street #12-13, People.'s Park Centre,\nSingapore 058358, are charged thatyouhad, between 12 February 2020 and 5 March\n2020, failed to provide the services which Koh Hwee Miem had paidfor on I2 February\n\n2020, including /iling of court documents in Court under the \"PLUS Service\", and\nproviding legal advice under the \" Legal Advice Service \" , and that no document had been\n\nfiled and no appointment had beenfixed with Koh Hwee Miem even after a period of 22\ndays had passed, despite the foct that the aforesaid services were stated to be fast and\n\n\f-8expedient; .further, that you had failed to contact Koh Hwee Miem in respect of the\nservices that had been paidfor on I2 February 2020 or instruct Koh Hwee Miem on how\n\nto avail herself of the aforesaid services, and are thereby guilty of such misconduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an fficer of the Supreme Court or as a member\n\nof an honourable profession within the meaning of Section S3(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act.\n\n17. Based on the Portal and the available evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that a solicitorclient relationship was established between the Complainant and the Respondent upon\npayment being made on 12 February 2020. There is no dispute that the DBS service was\n\nprovided by and that the payment was received by the Firm, as a consequence of which\nthese payments would constitute legal fees for legal services. On the facts, the Tribunal\n\nfinds that the purported disclaimers do not negate the presence of a retainer and that the\nComplainant engaged the Firm and the Respondent via the Portal and paid for legal\nservices. The Tribunal notes that the legal fees for PLUSS and LAS have not been\nrefunded.\n\n1't Charge - Rule 17(3) of the Rules\n\n18. Rule 17(3)(a) of the Rules provides as follows:\n(3) A legal practitioner must\n\n-\n\n(a) inform his or her client of the basis on whichfees for professional services will be\ncharged, and of the manner in which those fees and disbursements (f any) are to be\n\npaid by the client;\n\n19. The Respondent places heavy reliance on 2 disclaimers, the first of which is referred to\nas \"the Page 180 Disclaimer\", which stated:\n\n\"... Clients are able to take as much time as they need to complete the forms. Thus,\nyour payment is considered fully utilized when you access the subsequent pages for\nthe paid service.\"\n\n\f9-\n\nThe Page 180 Disclaimer can be found in Exhibit YPT-4 to the Respondent's affidavit\n\nof evidence-in-chief (\"AEIC \") at p180.\n\n20. The Page 180 Disclaimer, which is set out right before the Payment section on the\noolnformations\n\n[sic] & Payment\" page, stated as follows:\n\n\"Divorcebureau.com.sg seel<s to provide assistance to the best of our ability to help users\n\nprepare and generate the legal document necessary to .file for divorce in the Family\nJustice Courts of Singapore but is not responsible.for the content of the legal document\ngenerated from our website, neither are we responsible for the rejecting of the said\ndocuments by the Singapore Courts due to inaccurate input or false information, or qny\n\nreasons whatsoever.

All correspondence\nby registered users will have to be via email only.\"\n\n2L The Page 180 Disclaimer did not state that no solicitor-client relationship was formed\nbetween the Firm and users of the Portal. This was acknowledged by the Respondent\n\nunder cross-examination. In fact, the Page 180 Disclaimer, as highlighted above,\nsuggested that a solicitor-client relationship was formed, as it referred to registered users\nas \"clients\" on three occasions. In a similar vein, there were numerous references to users\n\nbeing \"clients\" elsewhere on the Portal:\n\n\f- 10-\n\n(a) The header of every page of the Portal stated: \"Contact our client care specialist\nat +65 8588 8824for 24 hr/weekends support\".\n\n(b) The link to access the DivorceBureau@ Service, which was included in the header\nof every page of the Portal, was titled \"Client Login\".\n\n(c) The 'oContact Us\" Page of the Portal stated: \"Complete the [Client SupportJ form\nbelow and afamily lawyer will contact you within lworking day\".\n\n22. Thus, the Page 180 Disclaimer did not negate a solicitor-client relationship between the\nFirm and users of the Portal; to the contrary, it indicated that users are clients of the Firm.\n\n23. The second disclaimer relied on by the Respondent is referred to as oothe Page 135\nDisclaimer\", which essentially provided that there was no solicitor and client relationship\nfor the DBS, and which stated as follows:\n\n\" DivorceBureau. com. s g Dis claimer\n\nDivorceBureau.com.sg seeks to provide assistance to the best of our ability to help users\n\nprepare and generate the document necessary to file for divorce in the Family Justice\nCourts of Singapore but is not responsible for the content of the document generated\n\nfrom our website, neither are we responsible for the rejection of the said documents by\nthe Singapore Courts due to inaccurate input or folse information, or any reqsons\nwhatsoever.

However, there was no contemporaneous evidence before the Tribunal to show that the\nPage 135 Disclaimer was in fact incorporated into the Portal when the Complainant\naccessed it on 12 February 2020. Furthermore, the Page 135 Disclaimer was never\n\nbrought to the attention of users like the Complainant.\n\n25. Unlike the Page 180 Disclaimer, which was set out in full before the Payment section on\nthe \"Informations [sic] & Payment\" page on Page 180 of the Respondent's AEIC, the\n\nPage 135 Disclaimer was purportedly accessible only when users clicked on a\n\"Disclaimer Details\" link which was hidden in the footer of each page of the Portal. In\nshort, taking the Respondent's argument at its highest, not only was the Page 135\nDisclaimer not highlighted on each page of the Portal, it was also hidden and buried in\nthe \"Disclaimer Details\" link in the footer of each page of the Portal.\n\n26. As the Tribunal sees it, there are two possible reasons why the second paragraphof the\nPage 135 Disclaimer, which informed users that no solicitor-client relationship was\nestablished, was not reflected in the Page 180 Disclaimer:\n\n(a) the Page 135 Disclaimer did not exist on 12 February 2020 v,rhenthe Complainant\naccessed the Portal; or\n\n\f-t2(b) the Respondent did not want to highlight to users, immediately before they made\npayment on the 'olnformations [sic] & Payment'o page on Page 180 of the\nRespondent's AEIC, that it was intended that no solicitor-client relationship exist\n\nin respect of the Divorce Bureau Service.\n\n27. The Tribunal is not convinced that the Page 135 Disclaimer existed as of 12 February\n2020, when the Respondent accessed the Portal as the provision therein for the absence\n\nof a solicitor- client relationship would be contrary to the language in the Page 180\nDisclaimer which referred to users of the Divorce Bureau Service as clients of the Firm.\nEven if it existed then, the Tribunal would not give effect to the Page 135 Disclaimer as\n\nit was not brought to the attention of users such as the Respondent prior to the making of\nany payment for the Divorce Bureau Service. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the\n\nComplainant had become a client of the Respondent and the Firm from the time she\naccessed and used the Portal and made payment on 12 February 2020.\n\n28. The Tribunal also notes that the Page 180 Disclaimer did not inform users that their\npayments were non-refundable. Stating that a payment was \"considered fully utilized\"\n\ndid not mean that the payment would be non-refundable.\n\n29. As the Respondent had admitted under cross-examination, even monies which the\nRespondent considered to be \"fully utilized\" could still be refunded by the Firm on a\n\ngoodwill basis. In fact, the Respondent's evidence was that she and the Firm would have\nbeen willing to consider a partial refund, if the Complainant had requested for a refund\n\nin respect of the PLUS Service and the Legal Advice Service, as demonstrated in\nparagraph 34 below. Thus, even if the Respondent was entitled to treat any payment as\n\nfully utilised, it did not follow that such payment was non-refundable.\n\n30. Moreover, the Respondent's reasoning that the payment was considered fully utilised\nbecause \"fc]lients are able to take as much time as they need to complete the forms\"\n\ncould at best only apply to the DBS, which involved users accessing the Portal and\ncompleting the forms. The reasoning could not apply to the PLUSS and the LAS, which\n\ndid not entail accessing the Portal and filling in forms. Moreover, as the Respondent\n\n\f-13admitted, nowhere in the text of the Page 180 Disclaimer does it refer to the PLUSS or\nthe LAS.\n\n31\n\nOn thc stand, the Respondent tried tu uxplain LhaL the Page 180 Disclaimer extended to\nthe PLUSS and the LAS because, immediately below the Page 180 Disclaimer, users\nwere given the option of selecting the PLUSS and the LAS.\n\n32. However, this explanation/argument by the Respondent is untenable. Whether users had\nthe option of selecting the PLUSS and LAS has no bearing on and does not alter the\nmeaning conveyed by the clear words of the Page 180 Disclaimer, which clearly stated,\n\nfor the DBS, with no reference to the PLUSS and LAS, that\"your payment is considered\n\nfully utilized when you access the subsequent pages for the paid service.\"\n\n33. The Tribunal also noted that, even when the Respondent was questioned by the Tribunal\nabout the logic behind payment for the PLUS Service being utilised when no filing\nservices was provided, the Respondent was unable to provide any logical justification for\n\nthis. The relevant extract from the transcript of the hearing on 21 October 2021reads as\n\nfollows:\n\n'oPresident\n\nsorry, can we then go to page 180? I am struggling to understand how you say or\nlogically iustify a position that payment of the PLUS Service could be utilised if no\nservice has been done and tlte user has simply accessed the subsequent pages of the\n\nportal. How do you justify that?\n\n.. My question was simply this: IIow do you justify saying or taking the position, right,\n\nthat the paymentfor the PLUS Service is utilised if a user has accessed the subsequent\npages on the paid service, but no service---no filing has been done?\n\nWitness\n\n\f-14Yes, because in---as l---as I mentioned, is to make it hassle free for them. At the time\n\nwhen they complete the generation of their documents, the next logical step is to file it.\nSo when---we want them to be responsible when they use our services. ll/hen they click\n\nonto this PLUS Service, then they already decide that they want someone else to file it\n\nfor you because they want to save the hassle to file your own divorce papers, they click\non it. So tf they click on it, it means that it is fully utilised, and it's not refundable\nbecause users have to be responsible, in a way, on the segment that they cltoose.\n\nPresident:\n\n--for the.filing service. Your position is still the same, \"Once you've opted for it, it's\nconsidered utilised, even though nothing is done in relation to the service\"?\n\nWitness\n\nYes, at that time, it was the concept that everything is based on the---the responsibility\n\nof the users as well on what they think they want. So eventually, it didn't materialise\ndue to many reasons, For our website, it's considered as utilised, no refunds. But as\n\nI\n\nsaid, I always said, there's always a better practice, and I'm constantly looking at\nimproving it because it is reallyfor the benefit of myself; there's no reason that I don't\nimprove it, I'm happy to improve it. And I also said before, on the hindsight, if, at the\ntime, Ms Koh has askedfor the refund of these two parts, I might have considered.\"\n\n34. Clearly, the Page 180 Disclaimer did not inform users that their payment was nonrefundable. Apart from the Page 180 Disclaimer, the Respondent does not assert that any\nother part of the Portal informed users that their payments were non-refundable.\n\n35. With respect, the Tribunal does not accept the Respondent's explanation that the phrase\nin the Portal (\"your payment is consideredfully utilized when you access the subsequent\npages for the paid service\") adequately conveys that the legal fees were paid on a non-\n\nrefundable basis because a \"fully utilized\" payment can still be refunded. Even if the\n\n\f-15phrase \"fully utilized\" could be equated with \"non-refundable\", the Tribunal finds that\nthe Page 180 Disclaimer would refer and relate to DBS only and not to PLUSS and LAS.\n\n36. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the 1't Charge has been made out.\n2nd Charee\n\n- Rule 5(2) of the Rules\n\n31. Rule 5(2)(c) and (h) of the Rules provide as follows:\n(2) A legal practitioner must\n\n-\n\n(c) act with reasonable diligence and competence in the provision of services to the\nclient;\n\n(h) provide timely advice to the client;\n\n38. With respect, the Tribunal does not accept the Law Society's position that the Respondent\nfailed to act with reasonable diligence and competence and to provide timely advice to\nthe Complainant. There was no dispute that the Complainant did not complete the forms\nand that the Portal allowed users to \"edit the online forms for the next 30 days\". There\n\nis also no dispute that the Complainant did not reach out to the Firm or the Respondent\n\nto request specifically for the LAS during this 30-day period. If the forms had been\ncompleted, PLUSS could have been available. If advice had been requested, LAS could\nhave been provided. The Tribunal accepts that the Respondent did not act unreasonably\n\nin waiting 30 days for the Complainant to edit the forms and there was no impediment\nfor the Complainant to contact the Firm and Respondent during this period. Accordingly,\nTribunal finds that the 2\"d Charge has not been made out.\n\nAppropriate Sanction\n\n39. In The Law Society of Singapore v. Huang Lui IDT 11120201, the regulated practitioner\npleaded guilty to a charge under Rule 17(3) of the Rules and the Tribunal determined that\n\n\f-t6the regulated practitioner should be reprimanded and ordered to pay the Law Society's\ncosts of those proceedings fixed at 5$5,000 plus reasonable disbursements. In that case,\n\ncounsel for the Law Society directed the tribunal's attention to two cases: The Law\nSociety of Singapore v Anand K Thiagarajan [2009] SGDT 2 and The Law Society of\n\nSingapore v Chung Kok Soon 120021SGDSC 2. In both those cases, a breach of the\nobligation to inform a client of the basis on which fees for professional services would\nbe charged attracted a reprimand and an order that the Respondent pay the Law Society's\n\ncosts of the Disciplinary Tribunal proceedings.\n\n40. Considering all the relevant facts of the case, the findings made by the Tribunal and the\nrelevant precedents, Tribunal recommends that the Respondent be reprimanded.\n\n41. Further, given the materials filed, the duration of the hearing, the extent of the written\nsubmissions and the fact that the Law Society had made out the 1't Charge but not the 2nd\n\nCharge, the Tribunal considers that cost in the sum of $8,000, plus reasonable\ndisbursements, to be fair and reasonable and should be paid by the Respondent to the\n\nLaw Society.\n\n42.

Mr Lee did a search on the\n.17 Mr Lim claimed he was\nshocked. Mr Lee also wrote 2 letters to the Respondent on 26 January 2017 and 8 February\n2017 complaining that he found the files very poorly kept, the former in the following terms:18\n\nWe are in receipt of your 2 bundles handed by your Mr Ooi personally at our office\nthis morning We note that there is no schedule of documents listing out all the\ndocuments in the 2 bundles. We have perused the 2 bundles and we are unable\nto sort out which are the documents that belong to MC/MC 228/2014 and DC/DC\n2679/2015 as they are not listed out in chronological order.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, our taking over conduct of these 2 matters will be\n15 2PB at p. 604\n16\n\nAEIC of Mr Lim at [13]-\n\nNE 15 Sep\n\n15-22), p. 65 (ln 3-9), p. 148 (ln 8-30), p. 150 (ln 21-28), p. 151 (ln 31-32), p. 152 (ln 1 to 21), p. 160 (ln 3-18) and\np. 163 (ln 13-29)\n17\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 160 (ln 11-14) and p. 161 (ln 6-11)\n\n18\n\n2PB at pp. 699-700\n\n9\n\n\fsubject to the availability of the complete set of documents, i e. correspondence\nand cause papers as the suits are in the advance stage of the proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nEventually, Mr Lee did not take over conduct of the Suit as he was not comfortable\n\nwith the organisation of the documents handed over by the Respondent to him.19\n\n19.\n\nOn 9 January 2019, M/s Andrew Goh Chambers filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors\n\nto take over conduct of the Suit from\n\n20.\n\nW\n\n. The Suit was never restored.\n\nfor personal injury if commenced in a fresh suit at the time\n\nit was struck out on 20 January 2017 would have potentially been time-barred.\n\n21.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, Mr Lim filed DC Suit No. 873/2019\n\nDC 873\n\nagainst the\n\nRespondent for professional negligence, suing the Respondent\nnegligent handling of the Suit leading to the Suit being struck out.20\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 January 2020, in\n\nin DC 873, which the Respondent appeared in person to contest, interlocutory judgment was\nentered against the Respondent for damages and costs to be assessed, and judgment for\ncertain liquidated sums.21\n2020.22\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 June 2020,\n\nMr Lim made his present\n\ncomplaint to the LSS against the Respondent.23\n\n19\n\n2PB at p. 700\n\n20\n\n2PB at pp. 513-521\n\n21 2PB at p. 753\n22\n\n2PB at p. 775\n\n23\n\n2PB at p. 818\n\n10\n\n\f24.\n\nOn 14 September 2021, a day before the evidential hearing of this matter began, the\n\nDistrict Court adjudged the Respondent as liable to pay Mr Lim damages of $72,879.03 with\ncosts fixed at $15,000 and disbursements to be agreed or taxed.24\n\nThe charges\n\n25.\n\nEssentially, the LSS 3 charges against the Respondent relate to his failure to perform\n\nhis professional duties to his client in respect of discovery requests and orders, which repeated\nfailure ultimately led to the Suit being struck out. The First Charge was amended by consent\non the day of the oral closing submissions on 1 November 2021 by deleting the first letter\nitemised twice, first\n\nThe letter fr\nand second as\n\n. Each of the 3 charges relate to one obligation or another in the professional conduct\nrules of informing a client timeously on the progress of their matters, advising the client,\nadvancing the cl\n\n26.\n\nWe shall not repeat the details of the 3 charges as they have been reproduced in the\n\nIntroduction above. Suffice to say that they all engage various sub-rules under Rule 5 of the\nLegal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (S 706/2015) PCR\nthe following principles in Rule 5(1) in the interpretation of the rules which follow:\n\n24\n\n(a)\n\nThe relationship between a legal practitioner and his or her client imports\na duty to be honest in all dealings with the client.\n\n(b)\n\nA legal practitioner must have the requisite knowledge, skill and\nexperience to provide competent advice and representation to his or her\nclient.\n\n(c)\n\nA legal practitioner has a duty to be diligent in the advice and information\n\nNE 15 Jan at p. 11 (ln 7-15); Transcript of Evidential\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 173\n\n(ln 8-16); 2PB at p. 960-965 (introduced as an exhibit during oral closing submissions on 1 November 2021)\n\n11\n\n\fgiven to his or her client, and in the manner the legal practitioner\nrepresents the client.\n27.\n\nSpecific to each of the 3 charges, the following sub-rules under Rule 5 of the PCR are\n\nengaged in respect of what a legal practitioner is expected to do:\na)\n\nFor the First Charge, Rules 5(2)(b) and 5(2)(e) of the PCR:\n(b)\nwhen advising the client, inform the client of all information\nknown to the legal practitioner that may reasonably affect the\ninterests of the client in the matter, other than\n(i)\nany information that the legal practitioner is\nprecluded, by any overriding duty of confidentiality, from\ndisclosing to the client; and\n(ii)\nany information that the client has agreed in writing\nneed not be disclosed to the client;\n(e)\n\nb)\n\nkeep the client reasonably informed of the progress of the\n:\n\nFor the Second Charge, Rules 5(2)(c), 5(2)(h) and 5(2)(j) of the PCR:\n(c)\nact with reasonable diligence and competence in the\nprovision of services to the client;\n(h)\n\nprovide timely advice to the client;\n\n(j)\nextent that the legal practitioner may reasonably be expected to\ndo so;\nc)\n\nFor the Third Charge, Rule 5(2)(i) of the PCR:\n(i)\nfollow all lawful, proper and reasonable instructions that\nthe client is competent to give;\n\nThe Respondent\n\n28.\n\npre-hearing conduct\n\nAs the 3 charges relate primarily to a\n\ndilatory\n\nand lackadaisical conduct in attending to his professional duties, it was very surprising to the\nTribunal that the Respondent failed and/or refused to file his defence, list of documents, and\nhis affidavit of evidence-in-chief, despite several reminders and extensions given by the\nTribunal.\n12\n\n\f29.\n\nBy letter dated 17 May 2021, pursuant to Rules 8, 9 and 10 of the Legal Profession\nDT Rules , the Respondent was directed\n\nto file his defence by 25 May 2021, and both parties were directed to file their list of documents\nby 8 June 2021, and\n\n30.\n\naffidavits of evidence-in-\n\nAEIC\n\nThe Respondent failed to comply with the deadline for all 3 filings. In his email dated\n\n1 June 2021 to the Secretariat, the Respondent requested more time as he claimed that his\npersonal computer had crashed some time ago and he had difficulty retrieving documents. By\nemail dated 8 June 2021 from the Secretariat to the Respondent, the Tribunal asked the\nRespondent to provide his proposed deadlines to meet all filing obligations before the Tribunal\ndecided on whether to grant the appropriate extensions of time for the 3 filings.\n\n31.\n\nBy email dated 21 June 2021, the LSS requested the Respondent to reply to the\nemail dated 8 June 2021 on the deadlines the Respondent would be proposing\n\nin complying with the filing obligations. It was a generous and conciliatory act on the part of\nthe LSS in writing this email, and yet, the Respondent did not give any reply thereto, nor to\nthe Secretariat\n\n32.\n\nearlier email.\n\nThen, by letter dated 28 June 2021,\n\nRule 22\n\nof the DT Rules for extensions of time, the Tribunal directed that the\n\nefence\n\nbe filed by 6 July 2021, the list of documents of parties be filed by 30 July 2021, and the AEICs,\nBundle of Authorities BA and B\n\nBD be filed by 10 September 2021.\n\nThe Tribunal warned that if the\n\nwas not filed by 6 July 2021, the\n\nTribunal would nonetheless advance the proceedings and might take into account the conduct\nof the Respondent for any defence filed late.\n\n33.\n\nA pre-hearing conference took place on 13 July 2021. At that hearing, the Tribunal\n13\n\n\fexpressed its displeasure to the Respondent for again failing to file his defence, and gave yet\na further opportunity to the Respondent to file his defence, this time by 19 July 2021. The\nTribunal also directed parties to file their list of documents by 30 July 2021, and AEICs, BA\nand BD by 20 August 2021, and fixed the evidential hearing on 15 and 16 September 2021.\nBy letter dated 14 July 2021, the Tribunal also directed the opening statements of both parties\nto be filed by 8 September 2021.\n\n34.\n\nWhilst the LSS duly fulfilled all its filing obligations in time, the Respondent did not at\n\nall. When the matter came up for the evidential hearing on 15 September 2021, the Tribunal\nagain expressed its displeasure that the Respondent had failed and ignored his filing\nobligations of his defence, list of documents, AEIC and opening statement. The Tribunal\nsought an explanation. The Respondent apologised profusely saying: I really have no good\nexcuse other than I just have difficulty getting the whole out (sic).25 The Tribunal was unsure\nwhether it was a case where the Respondent was mentally unable to conduct the defence of\nhis own case or was simply not revealing his case to the LSS until the hearing. For whatever\nreason, the directions of the Tribunal were not complied with.\n\n35.\n\nIn its Closing Submissions dated 18 October 2021, the LSS pointed to an earlier\n\nprosecution against the Respondent in The Law Society of Singapore v Ooi Oon Tat [2018]\nSGDT,26 in which he was charged with causing\n\nof $138,148.11 to be deposited\n\ninto the office account of J&C (of which he was the sole proprietor\naccount. There, he was held to be in breach of Rule 3(1) of the\nAccounts) Rules. The Court of Three Judges suspended the Respondent from practice for 1\nyear with effect from 9 September 2019. However, that is not the reason why we have referred\nto that earlier prosecution against him.\n\n25\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 3 (ln 1-2)\n\n14\n\n\f36.\n\nWhat is relevant to this Tribunal is that the earlier Tribunal had similarly expressed\ndid not comply with any of the timelines and failed to file any\n\ndefence, provide any documents or evidence\n\nchosen not to comply\n\nwith the procedures prescribed in the rules which govern disciplinary proceedings or accept\nthe latitude the DT has offered him to properly defend himself given the serious nature of these\nproceedings\nhearing and gave further directions for the Respondent to file his defence and AEIC by an\nextended date. And again, the Respondent chose to ignore those directions and the hearing\nproceeded without the proper filing. Thus, it was disturbing to this Tribunal that in these\nproceedings, the Respondent likewise ignored\n\nseveral directions to file his\n\ndefence, list of documents, AEICs and opening statement. The Respondent also did not file\nany written closing submissions by 18 October 2021 as directed by the Tribunal at the close\nof the evidential hearing, saying during oral closing submissions I have no real excuse 27\n\nEvidential hearing on 15 and 16 September 2021\n\n37.\n\nOn the first day of the evidential hearing on 15 September 2021, the Respondent\n\ntendered a bundle of documents RB which he had apparently produced earlier before the\nInquiry Committee. The Tribunal asked why those documents could not have been tendered\ntimeously as the documents before the Inquiry Committee would not be before this Tribunal.\nNo sensible explanation was given. The documents comprised WhatsApp and SMS\nmessages from\n\nhandphone, and emails from his personal computer which\n\nhad allegedly crashed.\n\n38.\n\n27\n\nAs the Respondent did not file his defence nor his AEIC, the counsel of the LSS rightly\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 6 (ln 17-19)\n\n15\n\n\fobjected to the manner in which the Respondent started to make various allegations in the\ncourse of cross-examining Mr Lim.\n\nany prior notice of his\n\ncase also obliged the Tribunal to take greater effort to understand the Respondent defences\nto the charges. Be that as it may, the Tribunal proceeded to hear the evidence.\n\n39.\n\nMr Lim provided an AEIC dated 27 August 2021. The Respondent cross-examined Mr\n\nLim at length on issues, the relevance of which was at times difficult to understand and, at\nother times, clearly irrelevant to the charges against the Respondent.\n\n40.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent claimed that he had orally informed Mr Lim of the progress\n\nof the Suit and the orders made against him.28 Mr Lim denied that strenuously. The only\nrelevant admission Mr Lim\n\nto J&C\n\nof 17 August 2016, which admission led to the\ndeleting reference to this letter (see [25] above). The Respondent also sought to prove that\nMr Lim and he had reached an agreement on the reinstatement of the Suit at a meeting\nsometime in February 2017. In that regard, he cast blame on Mr Lim for having a bad case in\nthe Suit on the basis that the injuries Mr Lim suffered in the November 2012 accident were\nsimilar to the injuries he suffered in the March 2012 accident and Mr Lim had provided very\npoor testimony in relation to the same in MC 228. He had given Mr Lim written advice on this\nafter the Suit was struck out and claimed that Mr Lim had agreed with him to reinstate the Suit\nonly after more progress was made in the assessment of damages in MC 228.29\n\n41.\n\nWe however do not see how this is relevant to the charges of the Respondent failure\n\nto inform and advise his client Mr Lim timeously of the Discovery Request and subsequent\norders made in relation thereto.\n\n28\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 89 (ln 17-32) and p. 125 (ln 1-9)\n\n29\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 9 (ln 17-19)\n\n16\n\n\f42.\n\nWhat instead is clear to the Tribunal is that Mr Lim as the client was very keen to make\n\nsure that the Suit was prosecuted properly and expeditiously. This is shown by his visit to the\nR\n\noffice on 27 June 2016 when he handed over to the Respondent his IRAS\n\nnotices of assessment, CPF statements and signed clinical abstract form. This was followed\nreminder email on 30 June 2016 that the Respondent expedite matters and reply\nto ULA and copy him in the process. This evidence is undisputed, and the Respondent\n. Whilst the Tribunal\ngave the Respondent ample opportunity to explain why he did not send out those documents\nto ULA to fulfil the Discovery Request, he had no real answer.30\n\n43.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Respondent failure to provide ULA with any of the documents\nDiscovery Request led to a discovery application in DC/SUM 2793/2016 on 29 August\n\n2016,31 which in turn led to an order for discovery against Mr Lim in DC/ORC 3529/2016 on 4\nOctober 2016\n\nDiscovery Order .32 The Respondent admitted to having attended the\n\nhearing and receiving the Discovery Order on 4 October 2016.33 Yet, he appeared to have\ndone nothing about it.\n\n44.\n\nIn oral closing submissions and in his evidence, the Respondent admitted that he had\n\nmost if not all of the documents requested by ULA and ordered by the court.34 This admission\nmade it more incomprehensible as to why the Respondent did not comply with the Discovery\nRequest and later the Discovery Order. When probed on this, the Respondent said he could\n\n30\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 70 (ln 9-32), p. 71 (ln 1-18), p. 72 (ln 22-32), p. 73 (ln 1-2), p. 83 (ln 7-30), p. 84 (ln 31-32) and\n\np. 85 (ln 1-30)\n31\n\n2PB at p. 609\n\n32\n\n2PB at pp. 640-642\n\n33 NE 16 Sep at p. 89 (ln 15-21)\n34\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 70 (ln 9-32), p. 71 (ln 1-18), p. 72 (ln 22-32), p. 73 (ln 1-2) and p. 83 (ln 7-30); NE 1 Nov at p.\n\n40 (ln 18-32) and p. 41 (ln 5-16)\n\n17\n\n\fnot think of any reason and that\n(sic).35 He also chose to ignore\n\n31 October 2016 which then\n\nled to an application for an unless order against Mr Lim in DC/SUM 3586/2016 filed on 8\nNovember 2016.36 The unless order was made on 13 December 2016 in DC/ORC 94/2017\nUnless Order .37 The Respondent attended that critical hearing.\n\n45.\n\nThe Unless Order gave Mr Lim up to 10 January 2017 to comply with the Discovery\n\nOrder failing which his claim in the Suit would be struck out. But nothing seemed to have been\ndone by the Respondent to comply with the strict terms of the Unless Order, let alone inform\nMr Lim of the same.\n\n46.\n\nOn 20 January 2017, the Suit was struck out.38\n\ncommenced in a fresh suit at that time would have potentially been time-barred.39\n\n47.\n\nThus, a prima facie case of breaches of professional obligations was made out by the\n\nLSS on all 3 charges against the Respondent.\n\n48.\n\nThe LSS drew our attention to the case of Vijayalakshmi Sivaprakasapillai v Mrinalini\n\nPonnambalam [2009] SGHC 183, a case in which the respondent was then practising in M/s\nSalem & Ibrahim & Partners as counsel for the plaintiff. There, the r\n\nhad\n\nfailed to comply with an unless order. The High Court held that in order for the action to be\nrestored, the plaintiff must give a proper explanation to establish good reasons for failure to\n\n35\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 41 (ln 9-16)\n\n36\n\n2PB at p. 644-645\n\n37 2PB at p. 655\n\n38 2PB at p. 658-659\n39 Under Section 24A(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap. 163), an action for damages in respect of personal injuries\ncannot be brought after the later of 3 years from the date the cause of action accrued or 3 years from the earliest\ndate on which the plaintiff has the knowledge required for bringing an action for damages in respect of the\nrelevant injury.\n\n18\n\n\fcomply with a peremptory order and that no further breach of a court order would occur again.\nThe LSS drew our attention to this case to show that the Respondent ought to have known\nthe seriousness of any unless order.\n\n49.\n\nWhilst that case is instructive, even without it, it must be obvious to every advocate\n\nand solicitor that he must help a client to comply with discovery orders, even more so where\nthere is an unless order against the client, as failing to comply with it carries very serious\nconsequences for the client. And\n\nCertainly for a lawyer of the\n\nstanding with some 27 years experience at the material time, his failure to\ncomply with the Discovery Order and Unless Order was incomprehensible to the Tribunal,\nparticularly when considered in the light of his admission that he had the documents in his\noffice all the while and could have complied to avert the consequence of the Unless Order.40\n\n50.\n\nIn Law Society of Singapore vs Mahtani Bhagwandas [2021] SGHC 170, the Court of\n\nThree Judges clarified that whilst the LSS bears the burden to proof the elements of a charge\nlegal burden (at [79(a)]).\nWhere the LSS has proven a prima facie case that the Respondent has failed in his duties to\nhis client based on the facts\n\nevidential burden\n\nondent to prove\n\notherwise. Thus, in this case, the LSS has indeed proven a prima facie case that the various\nletters, applications and court orders had not been advised to Mr Lim timeously and properly,\nand that the Respondent had not properly advised and assisted Mr Lim in complying with the\nOrders of Court. The evidential burden therefore shifts to the Respondent. He has to satisfy\nthe Tribunal that he has given notice of these documents to his client and advised his client\non the progress of the Suit, additionally advising and assisting his client to meet the Discovery\nOrder and related Unless Order, among other things.\n\n40\n\nNE 1 Nov at p. 42 (ln 11-21)\n\n19\n\n\f51.\n\nThe LSS rightly complained that given\n\nfailure to file a defence, list of\n\ndocuments and AEIC, he should not be permitted to assert a positive case against Mr Lim\ncomplaint forming the crux of the charges. However, the Tribunal gave the Respondent much\nleeway given that these proceedings were very serious in nature such that, if the LSS could\nnot proceed, we would consider whether giving the LSS an adjournment of the proceedings\nat the cost of the Respondent would be appropriate. The LSS was however able to deal with\nall the evidence, arguments and assertions put forward by the Respondent in his defence and\ndid not seek any adjournment. This defence (which was never tendered) is based on what the\nh\n\nTribunal could deduce from (i) the\n\ncross-examination of Mr Lim, (ii) the evidence\n\ngiven by the Respondent when he was cross-examined, (iii) and his oral closing submissions,\nwhich is as follows:\n\na)\n\nHe had orally advised Mr Lim on the letters, applications and orders of court;41\n\nb)\n\nHe claimed that there were no attendance notes to verify this because at\ntimes, he did not record a note, and on other occasions, when he did, he had\nlost them when allegedly his personal computer crashed in around July\n2018;42\n\nc)\n\nHe believed that there might have been written advice to his client through\nemails but they were lost in the computer crash.43 He claimed that he did not\nhave back-up copies of the emails in his server; and\n\n41 NE 16 Sep at p. 89 (ln 17-32), p. 125 (ln 1-9); NE 1 Nov at p. 30 (ln 1-10)\n42\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 83 (ln 25-30); NE 16 Sep at p. 11 (ln 2-14); NE 1 Nov at p. 30 (ln 11-30)\n\n43\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 69 (ln 13-24), p. 77 (ln 26-32) and p. 90 (ln 1-28); NE 1 Nov at p. 31 (ln 1-7)\n\n20\n\n\fd)\n\nAs for the hard copy documents, he had destroyed the correspondence file in\n2018 (though the file was less than 6 years old).44 Yet, he claimed that he kept\nthe cause papers and documents files of the Suit45. He further claimed that\ndespite knowing Mr Lim was going to commence a civil claim against him, he\nnevertheless proceeded to destroy the correspondence file.46\n\n52.\ncredible at all. We much preferred the clean and consistent evidence of Mr Lim that he had\nreceived no updates or advice despite his email reminder on 30 June 2016, up to the time he\nfound out about the Suit being struck out when he instructed another lawyer (Mr Lee) to take\nover the file from J&C in around January 2017.\n\n53.\n\nWe now deal with the RB which the Respondent tendered at the opening day of the\n\nevidential hearing on 15 September 2021. It comprised SMS messages between the\nRespondent and Mr Lim in 2 periods, between August 2016 to March 2017 and between June\n2017 to April 2018; emails between them in 2 periods, between November 2016 to December\n2016 and September 2017 to April 2018; and finally WhatsApp messages between them from\nApril 2017 to September 2019.\n\n54.\n\nA perusal of the SMS messages, since they cover the relevant period of August 2016\n\nto January 2017, shows that there were various messages from Mr Lim asking the Respondent\nRB relates more\nto MC 228 with only passing reference to the subject Suit, and it does not speak to the Suit\nand the charges.47\n\n44\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 16 (ln 1-18) and p. 22 (ln 20-24)\n\n45 NE 16 Sep at p. 151 (ln 17-20)\n46\n\nNE 16 Sep at p. 23 (ln 1-4)\n\n47\n\nNE 15 Sep at p. 4 (ln 20-32)\n\n21\n\n\f55.\n\nWe think otherwise. It in fact throws more light on how Mr Lim continued to press the\n\nRespondent for updates on the progress of his Suit and that there was written advice on\noccasions from the Respondent on other matters, except that they do not support the\n\ncompliance with the discovery related matters.\n\n56.\n\nIn one such SMS dated 13 September 2016 where Mr Lim asked: Hi Mr Ooi this is\n\nLim See Ming..can you update me the hearing today to consolidate tq (sic), the answer from\nthe Respondent was: Later follow up. Adjourned (sic). Another was on 7 November 2016\nwhen Mr Lim asked: Hi mr.Ooi this peter can I call you to tele to discuss the AFFIDAVIT from\ndefendant now? (sic), to which the Respondent replied: Busy. Later in the afternoon (sic).\nNeither party referred to this in much detail at the evidential hearing and we will not presume\nwhat happened.\n\n57.\n\nIn an email dated 16 December 2016 from Mr Lim to the Respondent, there was further\npursuit of the Respondent to attend to his case. This email was sent 3\n\ndays after the Respondent attended the hearing where the Unless Order was made against\nMr Lim, and is helpful to reproduce:\nDear Mr Ooi,\n1. I have sent you 2 text message on 15th Dec 2016. I wonder if you have receive.\n2. I would like to hold a meeting with you with regards to my 2 cases.\n3. Kindly update me of the latest developments to my 2 cases.\n4. As I have been discharged from hospital, I would like to send you the bills of\nmy accident claim to be sent to the defendant.\nThank you.\n58.\n\nThe Respondent provided no document to evidence how the concerns of Mr Lim were\n\nmet and whether his requests for a meeting were acceded to. There was also no document\nshowing that the Respondent informed Mr Lim of any Unless Order. No attendance notes exist\nof any meeting. There was written advice from the Respondent on the issue of consolidation\nof MC 228 and the Suit in an email on 7 December 2016, but the issue of advice on\n22\n\n\fconsolidation does not speak to the present 3 charges.\n\n59.\n\nThe WhatsApp messages pertained to a later period of April 2017 to September 2019.\n\nAgain, a perusal of those messages suggests a recurring theme of Mr Lim chasing the\nRespondent for a meeting to discuss his matters. On 31 July 2017, we see one such message\nwhere Mr Lim states Hi Mr. Ooi can I know when can we meet to discuss about the matter\nof two cases? Please reply thank you (sic).\n\n60.\n\nIn the course of the evidential hearing, the Respondent produced a further document\n\n(marked RB85 ), containing an undated exchange of messages apparently between a\ncomputer technician and the Respondent over the crash of his personal computer which he\nclaimed happened and resulted in the loss of most if not all of his relevant documents. But a\nplain reading of the messages does not suggest that. For instance, in the message at 1:34 pm\n(undated), the person (unidentified) wrote: Those which r kept on mail server is there. If not\nwrong, last time ur system was using POP3, so technically, all emails are on that hard disk\n(sic). The Tribunal asked why the Respondent did not call the relevant technician to testify on\nthe crash and loss of documents. He had no good answer.\n\nanations as\n\nto why records which would have exculpated him could not be found elsewhere, for example\non a server, physical files or carbon copied to Ms Cheng, are also difficult to believe and were\nriddled with inconsistencies. For instance, the Respondent admitted that there could have\n\ncomputer despite the Respondent offering to purchase the computer from Ms Cheng. It is also\nto be noted that the alleged sale of the computer by Ms Cheng took place well after the\nRespondent alleged he lost information due to his computer crash.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent also sought to suggest, without basis, that the LSS might not have\n\nobtained all relevant evidence from Mr Lim. The LSS strenuously objected to the casting of\naspersion on the LSS of improper conduct. This objection was rightly made by the LSS.\n23\n\n\f62.\n\nLastly\n\nample opportunities to do so, coupled with his convenient assertion that he was unable to\nproduce any exculpatory documents as he lost them to a computer crash (although still being\nable to produce certain emails in his RB), leads us to draw an adverse inference against the\nRespondent pursuant to Rule 20 of the DT Rules, specifically that he has no real defence to\nthe 3 charges, whereas the prima facie evidence is wholly against him.\n\nThe decision of the Tribunal\n\n63.\n\nUnder Section 93(1) of the\n\nLPA , the Tribunal shall\n\nrecord its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according to those facts shall\ndetermine that:\n\na)\n\nThere is no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section 83\nof the LPA;\n\nb)\n\nWhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under Section\n83 of the LPA, the legal practitioner should be: (i) ordered to pay a penalty\nthat is sufficient and appropriate; (ii) reprimanded; or (iii) ordered to comply\nwith one or more remedial measures. The Tribunal may administer the\nsanction in (iii) in addition to the sanctions in (i) or (ii); or\n\nc)\n\nThere is cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section 83 of\nthe LPA.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided by the\n\nsubmission that in the case of The Law Society of\n\nSingapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2019] SGDT 4, where there was a failure to attend a single\n24\n\n\f, it constituted an occasion of being\na cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\n\nupheld by the\n\nCourt of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2020] 4 SLR 1173\nwhich sentenced that lawyer to a 2 year\n\n65.\n\nsuspension ([6]).\n\nIn a less serious case of The Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar S/O Sethuraju\nhis client and to keep the client\n\ninformed was also a cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action which led the Court of\nThree Judges to sentence the lawyer to a 3 months suspension.\n\n66.\n\nIn this case, quite clearly, the Respondent\n\ncontumelious and repeated failure to\n\nreasonably inform Mr Lim of his discovery obligations which ultimately led to the Suit being\nstruck out, seemed far worse than the above 2 precedents. In our view, all 3 charges have\nbeen made out on the evidence.\n\n67.\n\nT\n\nand lackadaisical conduct is seen over a prolonged period\n\nbetween August 2016 to January 2017, when there were several occasions the Discovery\nRequest, Discovery Order and finally the Unless Order could have been complied with. The\nconduct regrettably brings dishonour to the profession and falls far below the\nconduct expected of an advocate and solicitor.\n\n68.\n\nIn our view, all 3 main charges of improper conduct in the discharge of the\namounting to improper conduct or practice as an advocate\n\nand solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA have been proven against\nthe Respondent beyond all reasonable doubt. There appeared to be no mitigating factor, and\nthere were aggravating factors in this case.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds in the alternative that the alternative framing of the 3 charges,\n25\n\n\fas amounting to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor in the discharge of his\nprofessional duty as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, has also been made out. The\n\nstated above and it would no doubt constitute misconduct that is unbefitting. We would sound\nstrong disapprobation of such conduct. It bears repeating the disturbing fact that the\nRespondent could have complied with the Discovery Request and several orders but simply\nfailed to, eventually causing the clien\n\nall this while leaving the client\n\nin the dark.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that where a Respondent pleads guilty to charges, it is good\n\npractice that alternative charges be withdrawn. In Law Society of Singapore v Chan Chun\nHwee Allan [2018] 4 SLR 859, the Honourable\n\nthe\n\nresult of the Resp\ncharges fell away as a matter of course\n\nShe\n\nthe practice of\n\nwithdrawing alternative charges based on the same conduct as those to which a solicitorrespondent has pleaded guilty, is to be encouraged . However, as this is not a case of a plea\nof guilt, the Tribunal also finds that the alternative charges as framed are made out.\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal thus determines, pursuant to Section 93(1)(c) of the LPA, that that there\n\nare obvious causes of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under Section 83 of the LPA on\nall 3 main and alternative charges.\n\nCosts\n\n72.\n\nUnder section 93(2) of the LPA, the Tribunal has the power to make an order for the\n\npayment of costs where it finds cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action:\nWhere a Disciplinary Tribunal makes a determination under subsection (1)(b)(i),\n26\n\n\f(ii) or (iv) or (c), the Disciplinary Tribunal may make an order for payment by any\nparty of costs, and may, in such order, specify the amount of those costs or direct\nthat the amount be taxed by the Registrar.\n73.\n\nThe LSS sought a sum of S$8,000 inclusive of disbursements which the Tribunal thinks\n\nis fair and reasonable. The Respondent did not challenge the sum but asked the Tribunal to\nbe lenient. The Tribunal does not think the sum is in any way unfair to Respondent. The matter\ninvolved a 2 day\n\nhearing and a half day of oral closing submissions. Further regard\n\nis also had to\n\ncontumelious disregard\n\nfiling orders which\n\nresulted in a greater task for the LSS to\n\nDated this 20th day of December 2021\n\nMr Jimmy Yim Wing Kuen, SC\n\nMr Andrew Chan Chee Yin\n\n(President)\n\n(Member)\n\n27\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-10-08T04:00:58+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Mohammad Nizam Bin Ismail (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Mohammad Nizam Bin Ismail (Respondent), </strong><strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from a complaint filed by RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP (now known as RHTLaw Asia LLP), a limited liability partnership (<strong>RHTLaw</strong> or <strong>Complainant</strong>).

In the mitigation plea, the Respondent urged the Tribunal to find\nthat no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed against him and that he should\nbe reprimanded pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(ii) of the LPA.\n\n8.\n\nWe highlight some of the mitigation factors which were included in the mitigation plea and\nsubmitted during the Hearing:\n\n\f(1)\n\nThe Respondent was suffering from a major depressive disorder which had a direct\ncausal link to the commission of the criminal offences. He was clinically depressed at\nthe time of the criminal offences, and his depressed mood, poor emotional regulation\nand inadequate coping skills were likely to have contributed significantly to his poor\njudgment and lack of self-control at the material time.\n\n(2)\n\nTo ensure that he did not relapse into drug use, he attended numerous psychiatric\nconsultations, counselling sessions, pastoral sessions and recovery support meetings.\nConsequently, he has fully recovered from the disorder and did not require any antidepressant medication for a year. He has also been abstinent from drugs for almost four\nyears. The risk of relapse is low.\n\n(3)\n\nThe Respondent fully cooperated with the Law Society and the Attorney-General’s\nChambers.\n\nIn particular, in October 2021, he promptly\n\nimposed by the Attorney-General’s\n\nChambers\n\nagreed to the conditions\n\nin relation to his application for a\n\npracticing certificate.\n\n(4)\n\nPrior to the commission of the criminal offences, the Respondent had no antecedents.\nThe offences were not committed in the course of his duties as an advocate and solicitor.\nThere was no dishonesty or deception involved in his professional capacity as an\nadvocate and solicitor.\n\n(5)\n\nThe Respondent has good personal character and exemplary conduct. The criminal\noffences committed were highly uncharacteristic of him. They were caused by his\ndepressed mental condition.\n\nOur Finding\n\n9.\n\nHaving considered the Law Society’s Statement of Case and the Respondent’s mitigation plea,\nwe are of the view that in the present case, no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\nexists under section 83 of the LPA. Our reasons are as follow:\n\n(1)\n\nThe Respondent was not a drug addict or trafficker.\n\n(2)\n\nIt was due to a major depressive disorder that he committed the criminal offences.\n\n\f(3)\n\nThe offences had no connection with his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor;\nthey were not committed in the course of such duties. In fact, he was not practising at\nthe time of the criminal offences in March 2018.\n\n(4)\n\nThe impact of the offences was limited to the Respondent himself and his family, but\nnot any third party.\n\n(5)\n\nThere was no dishonesty or deception involved’in his professional capacity as an\nadvocate and solicitor.\n\n(6)\n\nHe pleaded guilty to the criminal charges as well as the three charges formulated by the\nLaw Society and agreed to have two other charges taken into consideration for the\npurpose of sentencing) — this shows that he was remorseful and contrite.\n\n(7)\n\nHe promptly agreed to the conditions imposed by the Attorney-General’s Chambers in\nrelation to his application for a practising certificate.\n\n(8)\n\nHe made diligent efforts to ensure that he did not relapse into drug use by attending\nnumerous\n\npsychiatric\n\nconsultations,\n\ncounselling\n\nsessions,\n\npastoral\n\nsessions\n\nand\n\nrecovery support meetings. The likelihood of re-offending is low.\n\n(9)\n\nThe offences and the surrounding circumstances of the case did not imply a defect of\ncharacter which makes the Respondent unfit for the profession within the meaning of\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n10.\n\nFor the above reasons also, and given that the Respondent has already been punished with\nimprisonment,\n\nwe\n\nfind that a reprimand\n\nwould\n\nserve the ends\n\nof justice in this case.\n\nConsequently, and pursuant to section 93(1)(b)(ii) of the LPA, we determine that while no cause\nof sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent\nshould be reprimanded.\n11.\n\nAt the Hearing, Mr. Suressh asked us to award disbursements to the Law Society. Pursuant to\n\nsection 93(2) of the LPA, we make an order for disbursements to be paid to the Law Society.\nThe amount of the disbursements is to be agreed by the parties, failing which the amount is to\nbe taxed by the Registrar.\n\n\f14th\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-07-09T02:00:31+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jul-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Naidu Priyalatha (Respondent) Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<p><strong>In the Matter of Naidu Priyalatha (Respondent)</strong><br>\n<strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></p>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Ms Wong Siew Lan (<strong>the</strong> <strong>Complainant</strong>).</p>\n<p>The Complainant was an employee and shareholder of a company, which operated a wanton mee stall (<strong>the Company</strong>).

The Complainant thus filed a complaint accordingly.\n\nIn relation to the complaint, the Chief Justice empanelled a Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) presided by Mr Kenneth Michael Tan Wee Kheng SC and Ms Audrey Chiang Ju Hua as DT member.\n\nOne main charge and one alternative charge were preferred against the Respondent, with the Respondent pleading guilty to the main charge:\n\nCharge\n\nFor grossly improper conduct in the discharge of her professional duty within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161) (LPA) in that, on 18 April 2017, the Respondent released the Cashier’s Order to her clients despite having given a solicitor’s undertaking not to release the Cashier’s Order until a comprehensive agreement had been reached between the parties in full and final settlement of all issues and claims between them.\n\nAlternative Charge\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA in that, on 18 April 2017, the Respondent released the Cashier’s Order to her clients despite having given a solicitor’s undertaking not to release the Cashier’s Order until a comprehensive agreement had been reached between the parties in full and final settlement of all issues and claims between them.\n\nOn 7 June 2021, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the main charge of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of her professional duty within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT, Council’s Sanctions\n\nThe DT accepted that the Respondent did not act dishonestly and did not benefit personally when she breached her solicitor’s undertaking.\n\nCiting the Court of Three Judges in Lim Kiap Kee, the DT drew a distinction between a breach that was an oversight and one that was deliberate, and found that the Respondent deliberately disregarded the trust reposed in her and released the Cashier’s Order to her clients.\n\nThe DT emphasised that “it is the foundation of an honourable profession that a member abides by her undertaking” and that “a deliberate breach by a member will seriously undermine the integrity of the profession”.\n\nThe DT found that the Respondent was guilty of the main charge, and that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed, with the Respondent to be referred to the Court of Three Judges (C3J). The DT had also awarded costs amounting to $6,000 (inclusive of disbursements), to the Law Society.\n\nCouncil adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and on 9 May 2022, the C3J ordered the Respondent to be suspended from practice for a period of three (3) months commencing 1 June 2022, and to pay the Law Society for disbursements incurred in the C3J action (to be agreed or taxed) with the costs orders made by the DT to remain.\n\nTo access the full report, click here.\n","pdf-link":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DT_Report_Priyalatha_Naidu_1.pdf","pdf-content":"1 October 2021\n\n\fDT/1/2021\n\nBetween\n\nTHE LAW SOCIETY OF SINGAPORE\nApplicant\nAnd\n\nNAIDU\n\nPRIYALATHA\n\n..-Respondent\n\nTHE DISCIPLINARY TRIBUNAL’S DECISION\n\n4.\n\nMs Wong Siew Lan (the Complainant”) lodged a complaint against the Respondent\nwith the Law Society on 29 November 2019, on the ground that the Respondent had\nbreached an undertaking given by her (“the Complaint”).\n\n2.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent\n\nis a senior\n\nmember\n\nadvocate and solicitor of the Supreme\n\nof the\n\nprofession:\n\nshe\n\nwas\n\nadmitted\n\nas\n\nan\n\nCourt of Singapore on 8 October 1980, and at\n\nthe material time, was a sole proprietor of the firm Messrs P.

It was essentially a bare breach or\na technical breach, which did not cause “any turmoil in anyone [sic] lives, the standing\nof the Law Society, or that of the Bar or that of anyone of us”.\n\nThe Respondent contended that in determining whether there has been a breach of\nundertaking\n\nthe\n\ncourt\n\nwill\n\nput\n\nitself\n\nin the\n\nposition\n\nof the\n\nparties\n\nin the\n\nexact\n\ncircumstances at the time the undertaking was given and accepted.\n\nIn this regard, the Cashier's Order which was the subject of the Undertaking was made\nin favour\n\nof the\n\nCompany,\n\nand\n\nnot the Respondent\n\nor her firm.\n\nThere\n\nprolonged\n\ndelay of any sort\".

Her conduct was also not such that it lacked the\nqualities of character and trustworthiness which are necessary attributes of a person\nentrusted\n\nwith the responsibilities ofa legal practitioner.\n\nThe Respondent,\n\nlike the Applicant,\n\nreferred to A/lan Chan,\n\nas a reference point, and\n\ncontended that there was no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action.\n\nThe Respondent in her further submission also referred to Shanmugam and contended\nthat as in the case\n\nof Shanmugam,\n\nthere\n\nwas\n\nno dishonesty\n\non the\n\npart of the\n\nRespondent in her breach of the Undertaking.\n\nThe Tribunal’s Determination\n\n17.\n\nA solicitor's\n\nword\n\nis her bond;\n\nall the\n\nmore\n\nso when\n\nthe solicitor gives\n\na formal\n\nundertaking.\n\n18.\n\nAs the Court of Three Judges in Lim Kiap Khee made\n\nclear at [21]: *..It is of utmost\n\nimportance that a solicitor should abide by the undertaking he formally gives.

Although the parties had filed\nAffidavits of Evidence-in-Chief,\n\n21.\n\nOn the evidence\n\nthey were\n\nnot admitted\n\nbefore us, the Respondent\n\nin evidence\n\ngave the Undertaking\n\nfacilitating the resolution of the dispute between\n\nin the context of\n\nher clients on the one\n\nhand, and the\n\nComplainant and Seah on the other.\n\n22,\n\nThe Complainant\n\nand Seah\n\ndid not want to deposit the cash takings of $26,896.45\n\nearned\n\nstall\n\nthe\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\ninto\n\nCompany’s\n\nbank\n\naccount\n\nas they\n\nRespondent's\n\nclients were issuing cheques from the Company's\n\nthe\n\nor consent\n\nknowledge\n\nof the Complainant.\n\nThe\n\nalleged\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nbank account without\n\nRespondent\n\nheld\n\nthe Cashier's\n\nOrder, which embodied the cash takings of $26,896.45, as a stakeholder; she was not\nto release the Cashier's Order to her clients until a comprehensive settlement had been\nteached by the parties.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent however released the Cashier's Order to her clients on 18 April 2017,\n\nand her clients deposited it into the Company's bank account to pay for the Company’s\noverheads that had fallen due.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent admits that the release of the Cashier's Order by her when there was\nno comprehensive\n\nagreement\n\nreached\n\nby the parties in full and settlement\n\nof all the\n\nissues and claims between them amounts to a breach of the Undertaking by her.\n\n25.\n\nWe\n\naccept\n\nUndertaking.\n\nthat the\n\nRespondent\n\ndid\n\nnot act dishonestly\n\nwhen\n\nshe\n\nbreached\n\nthe\n\nShe was forthright in telling Allen & Gledhill, when they requested the\n\nreturn of the Cashier's Order, that she had released the Cashier's Order to her clients.\n\n13\n\n\fThe Respondent did not benefit personally from her release of the Cashier's Order: it\nwas made\n\nout in the name of the Company\n\nand deposited into the Company's\n\nbank\n\naccount.\n\n26.\n\nWe\n\ndo not accept the Respondent’s\n\nnot deliberate. The Agreed Statement\npart of the Respondent,\nHer handing\n\nsubmission\n\nthat her breach of undertaking\n\nof Facts do not refer to any uncertainty on the\n\nor any dispute by her as to the meaning\n\nover the Cashier's\n\nwas\n\nof the Undertaking.\n\nOrder to her clients was a deliberate act, as opposed\n\nto an accidental or inadvertent act.\n\n27.\n\nWe also do not accept the Respondent's submission\n\nthat any breach was a bare or\n\ntechnical breach as there was no settlement forthcoming, and she had no alternative\nbut to give the Cashier's Order to her clients as the purpose of the Undertaking to have\na meeting for the comprehensive\n\n28.\n\nagreement, was not achieved.\n\nFirst, it is not correct that the Respondent\n\nhad no alternative but to give the Cashier's\n\nOrder to her clients. She could have continued to hold on to the Cashier's Order to\nmaintain\ncould\n\nthe contemplated\n\nhave simply\n\nInstead,\n\nreturned\n\nplatform for the parties to resolve their disputes,\nthe\n\nCashier's\n\nOrder to Messrs\n\nLinus\n\nLaw\n\nor she\n\nChambers.\n\nshe chose to release the Cashier's Order to her clients on 18 April 2017, less\n\nthan a month after the Cashier's Order had been given to her.\n\n29.\n\nSecondly, of the alternatives she had, the choice to release the Cashier's Order to her\nclients was\n\nnot open\n\nto her; the very purpose of the Undertaking\n\nwas to ensure that\n\nthe Respondent would not release the Cashier's Order to her clients if there was no\ncomprehensive\n\nagreement.\n\n\f30.\n\nWe\n\nfurther do not accept the\n\nto perform the Undertaking\nthe Company’s\n\nRespondent's\n\nsubmission\n\nthat it was\n\nimpossible\n\nfor her\n\nas the Cashier's Order had already been deposited\n\nbank account.\n\nWith respect,\n\nthis submission\n\ninto\n\nhas no merit whatsoever\n\nSuch impossibility was created by the Respondent's act of handing over the Cashier's\nOrder to her clients in breach of the Undertaking.\n\n31.\n\nWe now address the submission made by both the Applicant and the Respondent that\nin the present case no loss was suffered\n\nby the breach\n\nof the Undertaking\n\nas the\n\nCashier's Order did not represent monies that belonged to the Complainant (or Seah);\nrather\n\nthe\n\nmonies\n\nCompany's\n\nbelonged\n\nto the\n\nCompany,\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nbank account. The Applicant also submitted\n\nmonies\n\nwere\n\npaid\n\ninto the\n\nthat when the parties finally\n\nagreed to a settlement, it was the Complainant who had to pay a further sum of $18,703\nto the Respondent's clients.\n\n32.\n\nIn our view, the fact that Cashier's Order did not represent monies that belonged to the\nComplainant or Seah is not central to the culpability of the Respondent's breach of the\nUndertaking.\n\nThe dispute among\n\nthe parties was whether the Respondent's\n\nwere\n\nto\n\nfrom\n\nentitled\n\nComplainant’s\n\nissue\n\ncheques\n\nknowledge\n\nthe\n\nCompany's\n\nand\n\naccount\n\nwithout\n\nthe\n\nSeah\n\naccordingly did not\n\nwant to deposit the cash takings of $26,896.45 into the Company's\n\nbank account until\n\nthere was a comprehensive\n\nor consent. The Complainant\n\nbank\n\nclients\n\nagreement of all issues and claims between them and the\n\nRespondent's clients. The Undertaking therefore required the Respondent to hold the\nCashier's\n\nOrder which embodied\n\nUndertaking,\nCompany's\n\nthe Respondent\n\nthe $26,896.45\n\nas stakeholder.\n\nfacilitated her clients paying\n\nBy breaching\n\nthe $26,896.45\n\nbank account which was precisely what the Complainant\n\nobjected to in the absence of a resolution of the disputes.\n\n15\n\nthe\n\ninto the\n\nand Seah had\n\n\f33.\n\nSave\n\nthat a settlement\n\namong\n\nthe\n\nparties was\n\nreached\n\nduring\n\nthe Court\n\nDispute\n\nResolution Process in the State Courts before the District Judge in April 2018 — about\na year after proceedings were started — no details of the settlement were provided in\nthe Agreed\n\nStatement of Facts. We however take into consideration the Applicant's\n\nadmission in its submissions that at the settlement, the Complainant agreed to pay the\nRespondents\n2018\n\n$18,703. The context of the negotiations which led to the settlement in\n\nhas however changed from the context of any negotiations\n\nin 2017 when the\n\n$26,896.45 had not been paid into the Company's bank account. Any settlement may\nwell have taken a different form or contained different terms if the Cashier's Order had\nnot been released by the Respondent in breach of the Undertaking.\n\n34.\n\nThe Complainant had entrusted the Respondent\naccordance with the Undertaking.\n\nto hold on to the Cashier's Order in\n\nHowever, the Complainant lost any benefit she may\n\nhave had in being able to negotiate a settlement while the Cashier's Order remained\nunbanked\n\ninto the\n\nCompany's\n\nbank\n\naccount\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nbreached\n\nthe\n\nUndertaking.\n\n35.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Lim Kiap Kee at [26] drew a distinction between a breach\nthat was an oversight and one that was deliberate. In our view, the Respondent in the\npresent case had deliberately breached the Undertaking.\n\n36.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges in Thomas Tham made clear that even in that case where\nthe\n\nrespondent\n\nundertaking\n\nsolicitor\n\nbut wanted\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\nintend\n\nto\n\nbenefit\n\nto facilitate the performance\n\npersonally\n\nof the transaction\n\ncannot be lost sight of that the respondent solicitor “had disregarded\nin him” by the party to whom\n\nhe had given his undertaking\n\n16\n\nfrom\n\n(at [29]).\n\na\n\nbreach\n\nof\n\n(at [32]), it\n\nthe trust reposed\n\n\f37.\n\nAlthough the Applicant and the Respondent\n\npresent case and Alian Chan,\n\nand\n\ninvited us to draw similarities\n\nShanmugam\n\nbetween the\n\n(especially the former),\n\nin our view\n\nboth cases can be distinguished from the present case.\n\n38.\n\nIn Allan Chan the respondent\n\nsolicitor had furnished\n\nan undertaking\n\nfor security for\n\ncosts for an appeal to prevent his erstwhile client's case from being struck out by an\nunless order as the client was overseas\n\nat the time,\n\non the faith of his client’s promise\n\nto put him in funds in due course (at [13]). He has given his undertaking due to the\nurgency of the appeal timeline. There was no such urgency or Court deadline to meet\nin the present case.\n\n39\n\nThe\n\nrespondent\n\ncomplainant\n\nsolicitor had ultimately\n\nmade\n\ngood\n\non his undertaking\n\nwith interest (at [6(8)] and [16]), and the Complainant\n\nwithdraw her complaint (at [18]). The Respondent\n\nby paying\n\nthe\n\nwas prepared\n\nto\n\nin the present case has not made\n\ngood on the Undertaking, and indeed cannot make good on the Undertaking because,\nby her own\n\nact of handing\n\nover the Cashier's Order to her clients in breach\n\nof the\n\nUndertaking, she has rendered any compliance by her with the Undertaking impossible.\n\n40.\n\nThe Disciplinary Tribunal in Allan Chan found that the respondent solicitor had through\nhis own misjudgement\n\nor foolishness extended\n\nhis undertaking on costs without first\n\nsecuring from his client the funds necessary to make\n\ngood on the undertaking\n\nin the\n\nevent it was called on. He was unfortunately placed in a position where he was obliged\nto honour his undertaking without any assurance of repayment from his client (at [29]).\nThis is not the case in the present matter: there is nothing in the Agreed Statement of\nFacts or any assertion by the Respondent that she had breached the Undertaking out\nof misjudgement\n\nor foolishness.\n\ni\n\n\f41.\n\nAs for Shanmugam,\nundertaken\n\nto\n\nthe respondent solicitor had taken steps to pay the $2,500 he had\n\npay,\n\nbut\n\nintervening circumstances;\namount.\n\nthe\n\namount\n\nremained\n\nbecause,\n\nbecause\n\nof\n\nunexpected\n\nhe did eventually make good his undertaking and paid the\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent\n\nthe Undertaking,\n\nunpaid\n\nhas not taken any step to make good\n\nas stated previously,\n\nby her own act of handing\n\nCashier's Order to her clients in breach of the Undertaking,\n\nover the\n\nshe rendered compliance\n\nof the Undertaking by her impossible.\n\n42.\n\nIt bears repeating that it is the foundation\n\nof an honourable profession\n\nthat a member\n\nabides by her undertaking. A deliberate breach by a member will seriously undermine\nthe integrity of the profession.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent was entrusted to hold on to the Cashier's Order in accordance with\nthe\n\nUndertaking.\n\nShe\n\ndisregarded\n\nthe trust reposed\n\nin her as she\n\nbreached\n\nthe\n\nUndertaking.\n\n44.\n\nIn the\n\ncircumstances\n\nof the\n\npresent\n\ncase,\n\nnotwithstanding\n\nthe\n\nsubmissions\n\nof the\n\nApplicant and the Respondent to the contrary, we find that on the scale of culpability,\nthere is cause\n\nof sufficient gravity for disciplinary action under s 83 of the LPA\n\nin\n\nrelation to the Charge.\n\nConclusion\n\n45.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, and based on the Respondent's acceptance that she\nis guilty of the Charge, the Tribunal determines,\n\npursuant to s 93(1)(c) of the LPA, that\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under s 83 of the LPA.\n\n18\n\n\f1 October 2021\n\n\f\f","timestamp":"2022-07-09T02:00:31+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jul-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Zheng Shengyang Harry (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-zheng-shengyang-harry-respondent-advocate-solicitor\">In the Matter of Zheng Shengyang Harry (Respondent), Advocate &amp; Solicitor</h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from a complaint lodged by one Lee Kuan Fung (<strong>Complainant</strong>).

In this regard, the Law Society accepts that the\nabsence of a legal basis or a law permitting posting would\n\nnot make\n\nposting of a letter of demand, in itself, a breach of the PCR; however, the\n\nLaw Society asserts that such absence will constitute a breach in the\nparticular circumstances of the present case. '2\n\n15.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent's position is as follows, namely that:\n\n(i)\n\nThe 7 October Letter was not a letter of demand,\n\nbut a proposal for\n\nsettlement.'?\n\n(ii)\n\nAlthough the 7 October Letter was posted openly, there was no harm to\nthe Complainant and that the complaint did not arise from a genuine\ngrievance\n\nbut was\n\nmotivated\n\nby the Complainant\n\nto get back\n\nat the\n\nRespondent for his actions in acting for his client (the counter party to\n\nthe Complainant).\"4\n\n(iii) | There was no evidence of harm to the Complainant.'®\n\n1 LSCS at [14] to [17]\n12 LSCS at [18] to [26]\n13 RCS [12] to [15]\n14 RCS [17] to [19]\n15 RCS [21]\n\n\f(iv)\n\n| The\n\nRespondent\n\nhad\n\nno\n\nintention\n\nto expose\n\nthe\n\n7 October\n\nLetter\n\npublicly.\"®\n\n(v)\n\nThe Law Society has not proved that there was no necessity or legal\n\nbasis to post the 7 October Letter.\"\n\n(vi)\n\n| Onthe facts, there was no breach of the PCR which amounted to conduct\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor.\n\nFactual Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal\n\n16.\n\nSome of the issues in this matter can be determined easily, while others are\ncertainly more nuanced. This is particularly so as both Rule 8 (3) (b) of the PCR\nand section 83(2)(h) of the LPA do not precisely set out the types of elements of\nthe behaviour that is to be sanctioned.\n\nIn this regard, both counsels\n\nhave very\n\nhelpfully set out the authorities and commentaries, which will be considered in\ndetail further below. The state of mind of the Respondent is also an important\nissue in this case.\n\n17.\n\nWe shall deal with the factual issues first. We find as follows:\n\n(i)\n\nThe question of whether the 7 October Letter’® is or is not a letter of\ndemand\n\ncan and\n\nshould\n\nbe determined\n\nfrom\n\nan examination\n\nof the 7\n\nOctober Letter itself and from its contents. We find that it is clearly a letter\n\n168 RCS [27] to [30]\n17 RCS [35] to [41]\n18 The 7 October Letter is exhibited at pages 34 to 38 of the Complainant's affidavit\n\n\fof demand as it requires action on the part of addressee and threatens\nlegal\n\nproceedings\n\ndemanded.\n\nThe\n\nas\n\na consequence\n\n7 October\n\nof failure\n\nto take\n\nLetter sets out the alleged\n\nthe\n\naction\n\nbreaches,\n\nthe\n\nassertion ofa right to wind up the company in question and the proposed\nrelief of a buy out, which is the statutorily provided alternative relief to a\nwinding up. All letters of demand, if complied with, will resolve matters\nand the distinction that the Respondent has attempted to make, between\na letter of demand\n\nand an attempt to settle, in this case,\n\nis somewhat\n\nfarfetched. In this regard, we also note that the 7 October Letter was not\n\nmarked “Without Prejudice” and the intention of service was to use the\nfact of service and delivery in subsequent proceedings.\n\n(ii)\n\nDuring the hearing, some\n\nattempts were made\n\nby the Respondent to\n\nshow that the posting was not in a public place as the main door of the\nComplainant’s flat was not in a common\n\ncorridor, but in a stairwell with\n\njust two units. We accept the factual assertions made, that is that the\nComplainant’s flat was in a stairwell with only one other unit at that level.\nHowever, we find that the posting was in a public place as the stairwell\nwas open to and intended for public access, not just to the opposite unit\nbut also to members of the public using that set of stairs.\n\n(iii)\n\nThe Complainant gave evidence that she was distressed and humiliated\nand embarrassed’? However, we accept the Respondent's submissions\nthat the harm done, if any, was limited by the location of the main door\nin a stairwell and we accept that there is no evidence that the openly\nposted 7 October Letter was actually seen by any member of the public\n\n19 Complainant’s affidavit at [20], [21] and [23]\n\n\for even the Complainant’s family members.”° Whether this goes towards\nculpability in the context of an adverse finding of guilt on the charge itself,\nor towards culpability and harm in relation to the appropriate sanction if\nthe Respondent is found guilty, is dealt with further below. In this regard,\nit is apposite\n\nto\n\nnote\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nRespondent,\n\nat the\n\ntime\n\nhe\n\ngave\n\ninstructions, did not know the precise location of the unit and main door,\nand how “public” that location was.\n\n(iv)\n\nOn the questions of necessity to post, the legal basis for posting, if any,\nand whether the law permitted such posting, we find that there is no legal\nrequirement for posting the 7 October Letter, even if the fact of delivery\nof the letter was to be relied upon in subsequent proceedings. The 7\nOctober Letter was not an originating process or statutory notice. It is\nnoted that while there was no legal requirement to post, and there is no\nlaw expressly permitting such posting, the Law Society did not adduce\nevidence or make submissions that such a posting is prohibited. In any\nevent, we find the question of whether there was a legal basis or law\npermitting such posting to be a moot point in the present case. If posting\nwas required, which it was not, that would be a defence. If posting was\nprohibited, which it was not, that would make out the Law Society’s case.\nThe\n\nreal\n\nissue\n\ncircumstances\n\nis whether\nof this case\n\nthe\n\nposting\n\nbreached\n\non\n\nRule\n\nthe\n\nwall\n\n8(3)(b)\n\nin the\n\nof the\n\nfactual\n\nPCR\n\nand\n\nwhether such breach amounted to conduct unbefitting an advocate and\nsolicitor contrary to section 83(2)((h) of the LPA.\n\n20 RCS at [21], [23] and [24]\n\n10\n\n\fPeripheral Issue\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent has made extensive submissions that the Law Society had put\na case beyond what is set out in the Charge and in the Statement of Case. The\nRespondent\n\nsubmits*',\n\nwith relevant and well-researched\n\nauthorities, that a\n\nconviction on a basis other than the Charge and Statement of Case should not\nbe allowed. We accept the legal principles put forward by the Respondent as\ncorrect and applicable.\n\n19.\n\nHowever, we do not find that the four iterations in relation to the Respondent’s\n\nstate of mind that was put to him by counsel for the Law Society go beyond the\nCharge or Statement of Case. They were questions put in cross-examination to\ntest the state of mind of the Respondent to ascertain his intentions in giving\ninstructions for the 7 October Letter to be posted. We note that the Respondent\n\ndenied\n\neach\n\nof the four iterations put to him. We\n\nare mindful that the Law\n\nSociety’s case in the Charge and in the Statement of Case is pitched at the lower\nlevel of culpability, in that the intention to openly post the 7 October Letter in\npublic view is in itself sufficient to make out the offence, because the Law Society\n\nhas taken the position that the gravamen of the charge is the unfairness to the\nComplainant by the public posting of the 7 October Letter.?¢\n\nAnalysis of Section 83(2)(h)\n\n20.\n\nof the LPA and Rule 8(3)(b)\n\nthe PCR\n\nSection 83(2) of the LPA sets out the conduct and acts that render an advocate\nand solicitor liable for the sanctions set out in section 83(1) of the LPA. Specific\nreference to breaches of the PCR is made in section 83(2)(b) of the LPA where\nsuch\n\nbreach\n\namounts\n\nto improper\n\nconduct\n\n21 RCS [5] to [11]\n\n22 LSCS [38] and [39]\n\n11\n\nor practice\n\nas\n\nan\n\nadvocate\n\nand\n\n\fsolicitor. However, this is not the section that the Respondent is being dealt with.\n\nThe Charge is pursuant to section 83(2)(h) of the LPA under which the charge\nis made out if the Respondent has been guilty of such misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate\n\nand solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\n\nCourt of member\n\nof an\n\nhonourable position. Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA does not make reference to a\nbreach of the PCR.\n\n21.\n\nCounsel for the Law Society and the Respondent made extensive submissions\non the application of the test laid out in section 83(2)(h) of the LPA. We do not\nneed to consider these submissions extensively as both counsel submitted that\nthe test is the test laid down by the Court of Three Judges in Wong Sin Yee.”\nWe set out the test:\n\nSection 83(2)(h) of the LPA is broader than section 83(2)(b). It is a ‘catch all\nprovision’ operating when a Solicitor’s conduct does not fall within any of the\nother subsections of s 83(2) but is nonetheless considered unacceptable (Law\nSociety of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2001] 1 SLR(R) 466 (“Ng Chee Sing”) at\n[40]).\n\nThe standard of ‘unbefitting conduct’ is less strict, and a solicitor only\n\nneeds to be shown to have been guilty of such conduct as would render him\nunfit to remain as a member of an honourable profession. As a practical guide,\nit may be asked whether reasonable people, on hearing what the solicitor had\ndone,\n\nwould have said without hesitation that as a solicitor he should not have\n\ndone it. (Ng Chee Sing at [41], citing Wong Kok Chin v Singapore Society of\nAccountants [1989] 2 SLR (R) 633 at [17]). It is sufficient that if his misconduct\nbrings him discredit as a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a\nwhole.\n\n23 [2018] 5 SLR 1216at [24] cited by Law Society at LSCS at [44] and by the Respondent at RCS at\n\n[61]\n\n12\n\n\f22.\n\nAt first blush, the first part of the test set out by the Court of Three Judges\nappears to set a very high bar for section 83(2)(h) of the LPA to be made out that the conduct renders the advocate and solicitor unfit to remain as a member\nof an honourable profession, suggesting conduct so reprehensible that striking\nout may\n\nbe called for. However,\n\nthe Court of Three\n\nJudges\n\nhad\n\ndescribed\n\na\n\nbreach of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA as being less serious than breaches of\nother sub-sections of section 83(2) of the LPA. In the latter part of the passage\ncited and set out above, the Court of 3 Judges has given us the practical test,\nwhich we will apply. The practical test has two elements. The first is whether\nreasonable\n\npeople,\n\non\n\nhearing\n\nwhat\n\nthe solicitor had\n\nwithout hesitation that as a solicitor he should\n\ndone,\n\nwould\n\nhave\n\nsaid\n\nnot have done it. The second\n\nelement is whether his misconduct brings him discredit as a lawyer or brings\ndiscredit to the legal profession as a whole. (emphasis added)\n\n23.\n\nWe note that the charge is not one pursuant to section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, even\nthough that sub-section specifically refers to breaches of the PCR. We note that\nsection 83(2)(b) of the LPA does not sanction every breach of the PCR, but only\nsuch breaches which amount to improper conduct or practice. By not proceeding\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, the Law Society has pitched the alleged\nbreach in this case at the lower level of culpability of section 83(2)(h) of the LPA,\nthat is of unbefitting conduct, rather than a breach of a higher level of culpability\nthat is improper conduct or practice.\n\n24.\n\nOne\n\nissue that has\n\nnot been\n\nraised\n\nby parties,\n\nbut which\n\nwe\n\naddress\n\nfor\n\ncompleteness, is whether a breach of the PCR can be dealt with under section\n83(2)(h) of the LPA, where the PCR is not expressly mentioned, even though\nsuch breaches are expressly addressed under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA. We\n\n13\n\n\fare of the view that section 83(2)(h) of the LPA, as a catch-all clause, would\ncover PCR breaches that show unbefitting behaviour which does not amount to\nimproper conduct or practice. We are mindful that the Law Society has chosen,\nin the Charge and in the Statement of case to narrowly state the unbefitting\nbehaviour to be the breach\n\nof a specific rule, that is Rule 8(3) of the PCR.\n\nAccordingly, in considering whether the Respondent’s conduct is unbefitting, we\nwill not consider whether it is unbefitting conduct even if the specific rule is not\nbreached.\n\n25.\n\nFollowing upon the above analysis, the Law Society has to satisfy us that:\n\n(a) On the facts, the Respondent breached Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR.\n\n(b) On the facts, the breach is such that reasonable people, on hearing what the\nRespondent had done, would have said without hesitation that as a solicitor\nhe should not have done it, and that his conduct had brought him discredit\nas a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a whole.\n\n26.\n\nWe\n\nnow consider Rule 8(3)(b) of the PCR.\n\nThe starting point is the general\n\nguiding principles set out in Rule 4 that apply to the entire PCR. We set out the\nsalient portions of Rule 4:\n(c) A legal practitioner has a duty to discharge honourably and with integrity all\nof the legal practitioner’s responsibilities to any tribunal before which the\nlegal practitioner appears, the legal practitioner's clients, the public and other\nmembers of the legal profession.\n\n(f)\n\nA legal practitioner must be fair and courteous towards every person in\nrespect of the legal practitioner's professional conduct.\n\n14\n\n\f27.\n\nRule 8 of the PCR sets out a further set of guiding principles, specific to Rule 8.\nThe salient portions are:\n(a) A legal practitioner who deals with any person must, regardless of whether\nthat person\n\nis involved in any matter with which the legal practitioner is\n\nconcerned,\n\nbe honest and courteous, and behave in a manner befitting the\n\nlegal practitioner's professional standing.\n\n(b) oon:\n\n28.\n\nRule 8(3)(b) provides that:\n3) A legal practitioner\n—\n(a) ....\n(b)\n\nmust not act towards any person in a way which is fraudulent,\n\ndeceitful or\n\notherwise contrary to the legal practitioner's position as a member of an honourable\nprofession.\n\nDetermination\n\n29.\n\nWe now frame the question that we need to address:\n\nWas the Respondent’s conduct in giving instructions to post the 7 October\nLetter openly in public\n\nview contrary to his position as a member\n\nof an\n\nhonourable profession such that that reasonable people, on hearing what the\nRespondent had done, would have said without hesitation that as a solicitor\n\nhe should not have done it, and that his conduct had brought him discredit\nas a lawyer or brings discredit to the legal profession as a whole.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted that the meaning of “otherwise contrary to the legal\n\n15\n\n\fpractitioner's\n\nposition\n\nas\n\na member\n\nof an\n\nhonourable\n\ninterpreted in the context of the earlier words,\n\nprofession”\n\nshould\n\nbe\n\nthat refer to fraudulent or deceitful\n\nconduct.”4 On this argument, a breach is only constituted if the extent of departure\nfrom the practitioner's position as a member of an honourable position is akin to\nfraudulent or deceitful conduct.\n\n31.\n\nThe Law Society has submitted that the guiding principles in Rule 4 and Rule 8(1)\nof the\n\nPCR\n\nshould\n\nbe applied\n\nin interpreting\n\nRule\n\n8(3)(b) of the\n\nPCR,\n\nciting\n\nextensively from the commentary by Pins/er.*° The Law Society has also cited the\ncase of Law Society v Seow\n\nTheng Beng Samuel where\n\nphysical and verbal\n\nabuse amounted to a breach of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA and the case of Law\nSociety v Carolyn Tan-Au, where exerting unfair pressure by failing to consider\nthe ethical propriety of her conduct resulted in the advocate and solicitor being\n\nreprimanded.”\n\n32.\n\nWe\n\nare of the view that an\n\ninterpretation\n\nof the phrase\n\n“contrary to the legal\n\npractitioner's position as a member of an honourable profession” in Rule 8(3)(b) of\nthe\n\nPCR\n\ndoes\n\nnot\n\nrequire\n\na\n\nfinding\n\nnotwithstanding the use of these words\n\nof culpability\n\nakin\n\nto\n\nfraud\n\nor\n\ndeceit,\n\nin the earlier part of the Rule. Such an\n\napproach will be inconsistent with both the general guiding principles in Rule 4 of\nthe PCR and the specific guiding principles in Rule 8(1) of the PCR.\nspecific\n\nuse\n\nof the words\n\n“or otherwise\n\ncontrary”\n\nclearly\n\nintend\n\nFurther, the\nto indicate\n\na\n\ndeparture from the earlier parts of the rule and to distinguish this third limb from the\nearlier limbs of fraud and deceit.\n\n24 RCS at [44] to [49]\n25 LSCS at [29] and [30]\n\n26 LSCS at [32] and [36]\n\n16\n\n\f33.\n\nThe Law Society has submitted that the gravamen of the Charge is unfairness to\nthe Complainant in that unfair pressure was being brought to bear upon her, and\nthat this was sufficient to make out the charge. We find that the instruction to post\nthe 7 October\n\nLetter would\n\nhave\n\nthe effect of putting\n\nunfair\n\npressure\n\non\n\nthe\n\nComplainant, whether this was intended or otherwise. However, this in itself does\nnot dispose of the matter. It is a necessary condition, given the reliance on Rule\n8(3)(b) of the PCR, but it is not sufficient in itself. The test set out for a breach of\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA must also be satisfied.\n\n34.\n\nThe crucial argument upon which the Respondent has rested his case is the failure\nof the Law Society to show that he had the intention to be unfair to the Complainant\nor to embarrass\n\nher. The Respondent’s evidence\n\nis that he did not think of the\n\nconsequences of giving the instruction to post and that his omission is one of simple\nneglect. The crux of the argument is that a mistake does not bring discredit to the\nprofession and therefore cannot be misconduct.2” The Respondent submits that in\nthe present case, his instruction to post the 7 October Letter arose from his failure\nto apply his mind to the issue of whether the 7 October Letter was placed in an\nenvelope, stating “if / had applied my mind to it if | had thought about it, | would not\nhave posted if openly because for me it’s not regular to send letters without an\nenvelope\n\n... “. The\n\nshort point made\n\nby the Respondent\n\nis that he made\n\nan\n\nunthinking mistake and that not all mistakes amount to professional misconduct.\nThe Respondent submits that the current situation is akin to simple negligence and\nrelies on the Law Society v Iskander bin Rahmat® for the proposition that simple\nnegligence or want of skill does not amount to misconduct under section 83(2) of\nthe LPA.?°\n\n27 RCS at [63]\n28 Iskandar bin Rahmat v Law Society of Singapore [2021] SGCA 107\n\n29 RCS at [62]\n\n17\n\n\f35.\n\nThe Law Society argues that the gravity of the act must be viewed in the context of\nthe circumstances of the case and that it is in the public interest to adopt a standard\nwhich would encourage members of the profession to maintain a high degree of\ndiligence and professionalism at all times*°, citing Iskandar and Law Society of\nSingapore v Lim Kiap Khee.\n\n36.\n\nThe issue is, in essence, whether the actions of an advocate and solicitor should\n\nbe viewed\n\nobjectively or whether the subjective intentions of the advocate\n\nand\n\nsolicitor should be considered. We are of the view that the test should be one from\nthe view of the objective observer. First, the law is clear that what reasonable people\nwould make of the conduct is the primary criterion. This clearly points to an objective\ntest and not the state of mind of the solicitor concerned.\n\nSecond,\n\nthe question of\n\nbringing discredit to the profession or the potential risk of such discredit is a question\nthat must be answered objectively. Third, the question of whether third parties have\nbeen dealt with fairly must be answered\n\nwith reference to the act alleged to be\n\nmisconduct and the effect of that act, not the intent behind it.\n\n37.\n\nAfter considering all the evidence, we find that the Respondent did not intentionally\ncause embarrassment to the Complainant or intentionally indulge in unfair conduct.\nWe appreciate that the Complainant does feel very strongly that the Respondent\ndid have such an intention and sees the open posting in public view as a deliberate\nstep in the Respondent's efforts on behalf of his client. However, having seen and\nheard the Respondent’s evidence and having considered his explanation, we are\nnot satisfied that the Complainant’s position on the Respondent's subjective intent\nis made out. However, for the reasons set out in [36] above, that is not the end of\n\n30 Law Society Reply Closing Submissions (LSRCS) at [18]\n\n18\n\n\fthe inquiry.\n\n38.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent has submitted that the precedents relate to cases which were\n\nmore egregious, that is cases where letters of demand were copied to bankers and\nauditors or to immediate supervisors.*' We agree that the present case is certainly\nless\n\nserious,\n\nbut the question\n\nstill remains\n\nas to whether the line of unbefitting\n\nconduct has nonetheless been crossed.\n\n39.\n\nWe find that the Respondent did breach\n\nRule 8(3)(b) of the PCR\n\nin that openly\n\nposting the 7 October Letter in public view was unfair to the Complainant and was\nin breach of the duty of fairness and courtesy and that the breach was contrary to\nthe Respondent's\n\nposition as a member of an honourable profession. Letters of\n\ndemand are assertions by one party against the other, and there was no reason in\nlaw for publication. Although there was no applicable prohibition in the present case,\non the facts, there was no reason to post the 7 October Letter in the manner that it\nwas done. The 7 October Letter contained both personal details and matters in\ndispute that had to be resolved\n\nbetween the parties and a public display of its\n\ncontents would clearly embarrass and put pressure on the Complainant. While we\naccept that intent to cause such pressure and embarrassment has not been proven,\n\nthe very act of public display is clearly likely to cause such a consequence.\n\n40.\n\n| We further find, on the facts of the present case, that the breach of Rule 8(3)(b) of\nthe PCR amounts to unbefitting conduct contrary to section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\nThe Respondent knowingly gave instructions for posting of the 7 October Letter.\nPosting on the door (or beside the door) would inevitably mean that the contents of\nthe 7 October Letter would\n\nbe and could be seen by any member\n\n31 RCS at [56] and RCS Annex A\n\n19\n\nof the public\n\n\fpassing by. The assertion by the Respondent that it did not occur to him that the\nletter would be posted outside of any envelope does not excuse the Respondent.\nThe Respondent did not address his mind to this possibility and did not cast his\nmind on the manner of posting. A reasonable person considering the conduct of the\nRespondent, and the consequences of his failure to address his mind to what his\ndirection to post would result in, would unhesitatingly say that he should not have\ndone it and that he fell short of the standards of an honourable profession. Legal\nmatters and disputes are serious matters and usually not a matter of routine for\nparties. Having a letter of demand\n\nposted openly is a drastic measure and using\n\nsuch a measure without thought brings discredit to the profession. In the present\ncase,\n\nthe\n\nabsence\n\nacknowledgment\n\nof\n\nany\n\nlegal\n\nrequirement\n\nto\n\ndo\n\nso\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nexpress\n\nby the Complainant of receipt of the 7 October Letter by email\n\ndispels any lingering doubt that we have that the Respondent’s conduct crossed\nthe line into unbefitting conduct contrary to section 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\n41.\n\nWe accordingly find that the Respondent is guilty of the charge.\n\nAppropriate sanction\n\n42.\n\nWe now consider the appropriate action to be taken upon our finding, as provided\nfor in section 93 of the LPA. We note that the Law Society has taken the position\nthat no cause of sufficient gravity exists for reference to the Court of Three Judges\nand that the Respondent should be reprimanded.\n\n43.\n\nWe agree with the position taken by the Law Society. We have been referred to\nprecedents where a reprimand has been ordered. We find that the culpability in the\npresent\n\ncase\n\nis lower\n\nthan\n\nthe\n\nprecedents.\n\nWe\n\nalso find that that the\n\nharm\n\noccasioned by the breach is at the lowest end of the scale, as no direct harm to the\n\n20\n\n\fComplainant has been shown. The harm in the present case is the discredit brought\nto the profession. That harm is sufficiently addressed by the fact of prosecution and\nconviction,\n\nwhich\n\nserves\n\nas\n\na\n\ndeterrent\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nand\n\nsends\n\nthe\n\nappropriate message to others - that we as lawyers have to constantly bear in mind\nthat the way we go about our duties requires us to consciously apply the PCR and\nits guiding principles. In this respect we take note of the Respondent's submission\nthat he has been subject to the disciplinary process for more than a year, with the\nattendant\n\nstress\n\nand\n\npersonal\n\nembarrassment.*?\n\nWe\n\nalso\n\nnote\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nRespondent's conduct is one-off and that he is a fairly junior practitioner.\n\n44,\n\nIn\n\nthe\n\npremises,\n\nthis\n\nTribunal,\n\nhaving\n\nheard\n\nand\n\ninvestigated\n\nthis\n\nmatter,\n\ndetermines that while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists\nunder section 83 of the LPA, the Respondent should be reprimanded pursuant to\nsection 93(b)(ii) of the LPA.\n\n45.\n\nCosts of Disciplinary Tribunal proceedings normally would follow upon a finding of\nguilt and there are no reasons in the present case to depart from this norm. We\nhave considered the nature of the offence and the circumstances\n\nof the case.\n\nPursuant to section 93(2) of the LPA, we order the Respondent to pay the Law\nSociety's costs fixed at $5,000 (inclusive of GST) and also to pay the Law Society's\nreasonable disbursements, to be taxed if not agreed.\n\ntw\nDated this!

Following the findings or remarks of the High Court from [59]\nto [65] in BOK v BOL [2017] SGHC 316\n\nBOK v BOL , Victor lodged his\n\ncomplaint against Peter resulting in DT 12.\n\nII.\n\nTHE CHARGES IN DT 12\n\n4.\n\nThe same Tribunal in DT 2 and 2A was appointed to hear the complaint against\nPeter in DT 12. In DT 12, the following charges were preferred against Peter, which\nin their amended form reads as follows:\n\n\f3\n\nFIRST CHARGE\nYou, Gabriel Peter, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that on or about 26 March 2014, you:\n\naided the misrepresentation of your daughter, Calista\nMarella Peter, to her then husband, Lim Wei De Victor, that\nthe Deed of Trust would only take effect upon his death, until\nwhich time he was free to deal with his assets,\n\nwhich were acts that took unfair advantage of Lim Wei De Victor or was\nfraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to your position as an advocate\nand solicitor or officer of the Court, and you are thereby guilty of a breach\nof Rule 53A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\nR 1, 2010 Rev Ed), and such breach amounts to conduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nSECOND CHARGE\nYou, Gabriel Peter, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that on or about 26 March 2014, you:\n\nexerted undue influence upon Lim Wei De Victor or aided\nCalista Marella Peter to exert undue influence upon Lim Wei\nDe Victor, thereby inducing the said Lim Wei De Victor into\nsigning the Deed of Trust;\n\n\f4\n\nwhich were acts that took unfair advantage of Lim Wei De Victor or was\nfraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to your position as an advocate\nand solicitor or officer of the Court, and you are thereby guilty of a breach\nof Rule 53A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\nR 1, 2010 Rev Ed), and such breach amounts to conduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nTHIRD CHARGE\nYou, Gabriel Peter, an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore, are charged that on or about 26 March 2014, you:\n\nfailed, refused and/or neglected to advise Lim Wei De Victor\nto seek independent legal advice in circumstances where\n\nmisrepresentation as to the legal effect of the Deed of Trust\nand of the vulnerability and impairment of the said Lim Wei\nat the material time when he was\n\nwhich were acts that took unfair advantage of Lim Wei De Victor or was\nfraudulent, deceitful or otherwise contrary to your position as an advocate\nand solicitor or officer of the Court, and you are thereby guilty of a breach\nof Rule 53A of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\nR 1, 2010 Rev Ed), and such breach amounts to conduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor within the meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n\n\f5\n\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\nIII.\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES ON 26 MARCH 2014\n\n5.\n\nAs far as it relates to the complaint against Peter,\n\naccount of the events\n\non 26 March 2014 are that while Victor and Calista were arguing in\n1, Peter came home\n\nbedroom whilst staying in\n\nfrom work and Calista went to Peter in his bedroom to show him the DOT.2 Victor\noverheard Calista complaining to Peter that Victor refused to sign the DOT and\n\nDOT.3 Victor asked Peter if he would do the same if Peter were in his shoes and\nPeter replied yes.4 Victor understood this to mean that the DOT was a standard,\nnormal document which is commonly executed.5\n\n6.\n\nIn the presence of Peter, Calista stated that the DOT\nson S\n\nS\n\n6\n\nCalista stated that Victor would in the meantime be free to deal with all of his assets\nas he deemed fit.7 Peter also stated that he himself did not own anything (which\nVictor understood to mean immovable properties) and that everything Peter had\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n\f6\n\nbelonged to his wife and children.8 Victor felt intimidated by Peter (being his fatherin-law and senior lawyer)9 and pressured by Calista to sign the DOT, which he\ndid.10\n\n7.\nin the evening, playing with his grandson with his wife in their bedroom.11 Calista\nentered her parents bedroom to tell them that Victor was leaving the house to stay\nelsewhere.12 Peter recalled that there had been an issue between Victor and\n\nthe couple to resolve the issue.13\nand did not enter Calista\n\n8.\n\nbedroom.14\n\nThe linchpin of the three Charges against Peter was that he had followed Calista\nback to her bedroom and it was there that the events giving rise to the three\nCharges took place.\n\nand no other date. A fortiori, if the Law Society failed to prove that Peter did follow\nCalista back to her bedroom, the three Charges would fail.\n\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14 DT 12 Transcripts 30 September 2021, page 86 line 18 to page 87 line 29\n\n\f7\n\nIV.\n\n9.\nhear and investigate\nthe matter\n\nSection 89(1) of the Legal Profession Act\n\nemphasis added\n\nLPA ,\n\nclarify doubts arising\n\nfrom the evidence given. For example, in paragraph [40] of\n\nAEIC, he\n\naffirmed the following:\n\nfter I refused to sign the Declaration of Trust Calista became agitated\nand started raising her voice. We argued. During the course of our\nargument, Calista told me that the Declaration of Trust was just a\nit was not meant to take effect until my death, and that\n\nthat effect) until then. Calista said that the Declaration of Trust was just\n\nof Trust, in the event of my death, all my assets would be left to [S] and until\nthen, I was free to deal with my money and assets as I deemed fit. Calista\nwas only interested and insistent in getting me to sign the Declaration of\nTrust.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n10.\n\nCalista said it was not meant to take effect until [his] death\ngave rise to a doubt as to whether Calista did in fact represent to him that in law,\nthe DOT was to take effect only upon his death. When someone describes a\n\n\f8\n\nit was not meant to\nof the document in law was otherwise. Obviously because while the effect of a\ndocument in law may be one thing, the understanding between parties as to how\nand when the document is be used is another. Otherwise, it makes no sense (on\nit was not meant to take effect until [his]\ndeath\n\n11. The Tribunal was therefore compelled to clarify this doubt with Victor during his\ncross-\n\nV.\n\nhear and investigate the matter\n\nUNUSUALLY CONVINCING STANDARD\n\n12. For the three charges against Peter to be made out, it was incumbent on the Law\nSociety to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Peter followed Calista back\ninto her bedroom.\n\n13. This resulted in a face-off between what Victor said had occurred (Peter entered\nthe bedroom) and what Peter said had occurred (he did not enter the bedroom) as\nneither the Law Society or Peter had called Calista as a witness in DT 12.\n\n14. This face-off called into operation the test propounded in Public Prosecutor v GCK\nand another matter [2020] 1 SLR 486 PP v GCK in which the Court of Appeal\nunusually convincing\nin convicting an accused, at [87] to [89]:\n\n\f9\n\n87\n\nWe agree with the parties that\n\nstandard is the only standard to be\nuncorroborated testimony forms the sole basis for a conviction\n\n88\n\ncase [is] proven beyond reasonable doubt, solely on the basis of the\n\nMamat v Public Prosecutor and other appeals [2016] 5 SLR 636 at [28],\nthis court considered that (citing Mohammed Liton at [39]):\n\navailable facts and circumstances, contains that ring of truth\nwhich leaves the court satisfied that no reasonable doubt exists\nin\n\ndemeanour, and the internal and external consistencies of the\n\n89\nnothing to do with the status of the witness concerned (namely,\nwhether he or she is an alleged victim or an eyewitness), and\n\nProsecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt\nXP ([72] supra) at [31]. In the absence of any other corroborative\nevidence, the testimony of a witness, whether an eyewitness or an\n\n\f10\n\nentire case will rest. Such evidence can sustain a conviction only if it is\n\narising from the lack of corroboration and the fact that such evidence will\ntypically be controverted by that of the accused person.\n\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n15.\n\nunusually convincing\nDisciplinary Tribunals (see, The Law Society of Singapore v Lim Kien Thye [2002]\nSGDSC 6 at [12]), and the Tribunal sees fit to apply it in this circumstance.\n\n16. The Tribunal finds\nentered the bedroom,\n\nunusually convincing\n\nfor a\n\nnumber of reasons.\nInternal and external inconsistencies\n17.\n\nas beset with internal inconsistencies. The most\nglaring of which was his allegation that Calista had misrepresented to him when\nthe DOT took effect in law. Upon questioning by the Tribunal, Victor admitted that\nthere was no such misrepresentation as to when the DOT took effect in law, but\nonly what and when the DOT was meant or intended to be used for:\n\nDT 12 Transcripts 28 September 2021, page 84 line 13 to page 85 line 9\n\nthe High Court what you say here---no, to be fair to\n\n\f11\n\nmisrepresentation about the effect of the DOT was? So that we are fair to you.\nA I disagree.\nQ No, no. What are you saying then?\nPresident: What are you saying? Yes.\n\nPresident: No. No, no. Okay. Let me give you two scenarios so you can\nunderstand, right? One is a misrepresentation that this DOT would only take\neffect on your death, correct?\nAdvocate: As a matter of law.\nPresident: As a matter of law. The other [interpretation] is I made no\n\ndocument until you die\nWitness: Your Honour, CMP represented the second one.\nPresident: The second one.

In fact, this admission by Victor was not just an internal inconsistency as to his\naccount of the events, but it shows that he was not truthful about\nmisrepresentation altogether. Further, if there was no misrepresentation by\nCalista, why would there be a need for Peter to follow Calista back to her bedroom\nand persuade Victor? This in and of itself raised a reasonable doubt as to whether\n\n15\n\nChinese [whore]\n[S] would end up getting\n\n\f14\n\nPeter did in fact follow Calista back to her bedroom. Without Peter doing so, all\nthree Charges against Peter fail.\n\n19. As for the First and Third Charges in particular, they fail also because they are\nspecifically predicated on Calista having allegedly misrepresented when the DOT\ntook effect in law. The First Charge against Peter is for aiding Calista in her alleged\nmisrepresentation, and the Third Charge is in failing to advise Victor to seek\n\nmisrepresentation. Both predicated on the alleged misrepresentation.\n\n20. Counsel for the Law Society attempted to remedy this clear admission in reexamination by asking Victor what he understood when he signed the DOT:\nDT 12 Transcript 29 September 2021 page 7 lines 10 to 13\nOn the evening of the 26th of March 2014 when you signed the\nDOT, as far as you understood at that time, when would the DOT\ntake effect?\nA\n\nAfter CMP made her statements, I was led to believe that would\n\n21. Read plainly, this answer by Victor in re-examination\nadmission in cross-examination that the DOT was not meant to be used until\ngiven that that was what Calista had told him as part of a family\narrangement.\n\n\f15\n\n22.\n\n-examination were\ncontradicting his answers in cross-\n\ncredibility would be put in\n\nfurther doubt as there would be no way to reconcile his two contradictory accounts.\n\ninconsistency.\n\n23.\n\nalso suffered the internal inconsistency between what he says he\nunderstood the DOT to mean at two different portions of his AEIC.\n\n24. First, at [43] of his AEIC, Victor alleges that when he asked Peter whether he would\n\nalleges that Peter told him that he himself did not own anything and that everything\nhe had belonged to his wife and children. Victor says he understood this to mean\nthat Peter did not own any property. Taking these two statements together, Victor\nmust have understood that signing the DOT would be akin to putting himself in\nof his own. Victor said as much in [9] of\nhis complaint to the Law Society dated 31 May 201916:\nWhen I asked Peter Gabriel, whom I knew and respect to be a senior\nlawyer, whether he would sign the DOT if he was in my shoes, Peter Gabriel\n\nown anything and that everything belonged to his wife and children.\n\n25. Yet later at [55] of his AEIC, Victor says that he honestly believed that under the\nDOT, all of his assets would be to left to S only when he died, and he would\n\n16\n\n\f16\n\ncontinue to own and be free to deal with his assets as he deemed fit without any\nreference to S. This was clearly not the position that Victor understood Peter to be\nin. Obviously because Peter was still alive and yet his wife and children owned the\nproperty.\nhow could Peter have aided any misrepresentation as to when the DOT took effect\nin law?\n\n26. This was picked up by Peter and the Tribunal in the cross-examination of Victor:\nDT 12 Transcripts 28 September 2021, page 74 line 1 to page 72 line 2\nQ Now, I would like you to---just to finish off, just one question on paragraph\n\nParagraph 9.\n\nSo, Mr Lim, what you had done in this paragraph 9 is effectively try to\nsummarise the various points you have raised in your affidavit, and your\n\nthat I was---if I was in your shoes, I would do it and that everything I own\n\nfrom those words, I didn't say it, but all you gathered from those words is\nthat you were being unreasonable for not signing the DOT, correct?\nA I'm not just unreasonable but yah.\n\nQ I said, after reading---\n\n\f17\n\nthose words was that you were being unreasonable for not signing the DOT.\n\nA\nQ And nowhere did you get that impression that you had stated earlier that\nsomehow I had given you the impression that by these words I could\n\nPresident: I have difficulty, Mr Lim, with paragraph 9.

So\nMr Peter, you want to carry on this line?\n\n\f18\n\n---his defence\nis an all-orBut even assuming he did, this paragraph 9 has an inherent\ninconsistency.\n(emphasis added in bold and underline)\n\n27.

I asked for illustrations, you told me that this was\nsomething that was acceptable to you and that also you were not\n\n\f19\n\nholding any assets under your name, and that most if not all your assets\nwere held by your wife and your children.\nQ Can you point out in your affidavit you have said that you asked me\nwhether it was a standard document?

As Victor admitted, he did not further\nask questions about whether it was commonly executed, whether there was a\nyes\nfrom Peter could not encapsulate all of those concerns.\n\n30. The Tribunal also found\n\nwas externally inconsistent with the\n\nobjective evidence. Victor says in his AEIC (at [42]) that while he was in\nbedroom, he could hear Calista and\n\nvery\n\nclearly as the bedroom door was open. The floor plan of the house and the two\nbedrooms was exhibited to the Tribunal, and it was clear that the distance between\nthe two bedrooms was approximately 7.5 metres diagonally across (with walls in\nbetween). This is assuming that Peter and Calista were standing at the doorway\nof one room and Victor was listening in from the other. Even then, it would be\ndifficult to accept that at that distance, Victor could hear the conversation very\nclearly.\nLaw Society.\n\n31. That said, the Tribunal recognises that nothing turns on this in that no allegations\nare being raised in relation to what was said between Calista and Peter while they\nThe Tribunal, however, takes this to be an external\nsatisfying the standard\nunusually convincing.\n\n32.\n\nGiven these internal and external inconsistencies, it could not be said that\nevidence\n\nunusually convincing\n\n\f22\n\nDemeanour of the witness\n33.\n\n-examination in\nDT 12 by Peter, his former father-in-law, was also telling.

For completeness, the Tribunal considered the\n\nreliance on the covert\n\nrecording by Victor of his conversation with Calista and her Mother at [64] of BOK\nv BOL:\n\nbedroom on the evening of 26 March 2014 comes from the transcript of\nthe confrontation of 12 February 2015. During the confrontation, the\n\nShe is\n\nknow why you keep saying someone force you. How can any of us\n\nto read the DOT.

Indeed, the transcript of the covert recording\nmakes it clear that Victor was the one who prompted the mention of\n\nalleged\n\ninvolvement:\n[Calista]: Victor, you have already signed it. I d\nto force you?\n[Victor]: You even got your dad to read through it and to force me to sign\nit.\n\n\f24\n\n[Calista]:\none force you. How can any of us force you?\n[Victor]: You just told me to get lost, and you a[Calista]:\n\n38. This was the same concern expressed by the court in Re A (a child) (Hague\nConvention: wrongful retention) [2021] EWHC 1204 (Fam), in which the Court\ngave very little weight to covert recordings made by a father of his conversation\nwith his child. The Court held:\n\nrecordings as evidence at the hearing. I did so because they had been\nmade covertly and the father had sole control over what was recorded\nand could have steered recorded conversations with his child to suit\nhis purposes. Hence, the evidence would be of very little weight.\n\n39. Notwithstanding the above, even if the Tribunal were to place the utmost weight\non what Calista said in this covert recording, it cannot prove that Peter was in the\nroom. Giving the words their natural meaning, all she is saying is that no one in\nher family could have forced Victor to sign the DOT. It cannot prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Peter\n\n40. In view of the above, all three charges against Peter are not made out on the\nevidence. Further, as far as the First and Third Charges are concerned, as stated\nabove at [19], Victor has admitted that there was no misrepresentation by Calista\nas regards when the DOT was to take effect in law. The Third Charge also fails to\n\n\f25\n\nsatisfy the conjunctive requirement that Peter was aware that Victor was suffering\nfrom vulnerability and impairment of his mental state, for the reasons stated in DT\n2 and 2A at [30] to [39].\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n41. In view of the findings in [40] above, the Tribunal determines pursuant to Section\n93(1)(a) of the LPA that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action against\nPeter exists under Section 83 of the LPA.\n\nDated this the\n\n20th\n\nday of February 2022.\n\n_________________________________________\nMr Roderick E Martin SC\nPresident\n\n_________________________________________\nMr Chan Hock Keng\nMember\n\n\f","timestamp":"2022-04-08T04:00:27+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-may-2022/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Constance Margreat Paglar (Respondent), Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<h3 id=\"in-the-matter-of-constance-margreat-paglar-respondent\">In the Matter of Constance Margreat Paglar (Respondent), <strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose out of a complaint made against the Respondent by one Lim Beng Heng Bernard (<strong>Complainant</strong>).

K ANPARASAN/MISS AUDREY\nWONG\n\nDATED THIS\n\n12th\n\nDAY OF MAY 2020\n\n\f-1-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n1.\n\nConstance Margreat Paglar (“Respondent”) was admitted to the roll of advocates and\nsolicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore on 21 March 1998 and was, at all material\ntimes, the sole proprietor of C Paglar & Co (“CPC”).\n\n2.\n\nThese proceedings arose out of a complaint made by way of a letter dated 7 August 2018\nagainst the Respondent by one Lim Beng Heng Bernard (“Complainant”).\n\n3.\n\nIn the Statement of Case filed by the Law Society against the Respondent dated 5\nNovember 2019, the original charges preferred were as follows:\n\ni)\n\nThe main charge was that the Respondent was guilty of a breach of rule 5(2)(a)\nof the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, Legal Profession Act\n(Chapter 161) (“PCR“) in that she renegotiated and accepted a higher global\nsettlement sum for the Complainant without informing or obtaining his\nauthorization for the same after he had instructed her to accept the offer of a lower\nsum and she purported to keep the difference as her fee without the Complainant’s\nauthorization or instruction and this breach of Rule 5(2)(a) amounted to improper\nconduct or practice within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act (Chapter 161) (“LPA”).\n\nii)\n\nThe first alternative charge was that the same conduct as in the main charge also\namounted to misconduct unbefitting of an advocate and solicitor as an officer of\nthe Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession under section\n83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\niii)\n\nThe second alternative charge was that the Respondent was guilty of a breach of\nRule 17 of the PCR in that she failed to act in the best interests of the Complainant,\nto wit, by renegotiating and accepting a higher global settlement sum for the\nComplainant without informing or obtaining his authorisation of the same after he\nhad instructed her to accept the offer for a lower sum and she purported to keep the\ndifference as her fees without the Complainant‘s authorisation or instruction and\n\n\f-2-\n\nsuch breach of Rule 17 amounted to improper conduct or practice as an advocate\nand solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n4.\n\nBy a letter dated 4 March 2020 from the solicitors for the Law Society, the Tribunal was\ninformed that based on representations from the Respondent’s solicitors, the Law Society\nwas amending the main charge under rule 5(2)(a) to a charge under rule 5(2)(e) of the\nPCR, and that the Respondent was willing to plead guilty to the amended charge which\nwas that:\n\ni)\n\nthe Respondent was guilty of a breach of Rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR in that she failed\nto inform the Complainant of the progress of the matter by failing to inform him\nwhen she negotiated a higher settlement sum with the insurance company and by\nfailing to explain the breakdown of the settlement sum to him and such breach of\nRule 5(2)(e) amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor\nwithin the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n5.\n\nBy separate emails dated 18 March 2020, the solicitors for the Law Society provided the\nAgreed Statements of Facts (“ASOF”) whilst the solicitors for the Respondent submitted\nthe Mitigation Plea (“MP”). The facts as agreed between the parties are set out below\nfrom [7] to [16].\n\n6.\n\nA hearing was fixed for 23 March 2020 but at the start of the hearing the Tribunal was\ninformed that the Respondent was denied entry to the Supreme Court due to certain\nanswers made in the Heath Declaration Form required by the Supreme Court. The\nhearing was accordingly adjourned and re-fixed for 2 April 2020. At this hearing, the\namended charge was duly read to the Respondent and she pleaded guilty.\n\nTHE ASOF\n\n7.\n\nThe Complainant had engaged CPC to make a claim for personal injuries that he\nsustained in a road traffic accident on 28 September 2017 (“Accident”).\n\n\f-3-\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 March 2018, CPC issued a letter of demand to India International Insurance Pte\nLtd (“III Pte Ltd”), the insurers of the motor vehicle that was involved in the\nAccident. CPC, on the Complainant’s instructions, demanded a sum of S$9,418.05\ninclusive of S$2,996.00 as costs.\n\n9.\n\nThereafter, the following proposals were exchanged between CPC and III Pte Ltd, as full\nand final settlement of the Complainant’s claim:\n\n(1)\n\nby way of an email dated 20 April 2018, at 3.31 pm, III Pte Ltd offered the sum of\nS$3,041.35, inclusive of S$1,605.00 as costs and disbursements;\n\n(2)\n\nby way of an email dated 7 June 2018, at 2.38 pm, CPC counter-proposed the sum\nof S$5,540.65, inclusive of S$2,140.00 as costs; and\n\n(3)\n\nby way of an email dated 7 June 2018, at 4.39 pm, III Pte Ltd offered the sum of\nS$3,281.35, inclusive of S$1,605.00 as costs and disbursements (“7 June\nProposal”).\n\n10.\n\nBy way of a letter dated 11 June 2018 (“11 June Letter”), CPC informed the\nComplainant of the 7 June Proposal and enclosed a copy of the email from III Pte Ltd,\nwhich stated that the settlement sum was S$3,281.35. In the 11 June Letter, the\nRespondent explained that the sum the Complainant would get was S$1,552.00, derived\nas follows:\n\nBreakdown\n\nAmount (S$)\n\nGeneral Damages\n\n1,800\n\nMedical Expenses\n\n120\n\nTransport Expenses\n\n20\n\nAt 80% liability\n\n1,552\n\n\f-4-\n\n11.\n\nThe 11 June Letter further stated that after deduction of the sum of S$535.00, being the\nlegal costs incurred by CPC, from the compensation sum of S$1,552.00, the Complainant\nwould get S$1,017.00. The 11 June Letter also contained the Respondent’s advice to the\nComplainant to accept the 7 June Proposal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 13 June 2018, the Complainant instructed the Respondent to accept the 7 June\nProposal. However, the Respondent did not write to III Pte Ltd to communicate the\nComplainant’s acceptance of the 7 June Proposal.\n\n13.\n\nInstead, the following proposals were subsequently exchanged between CPC and III Pte\nLtd without the Complainant’s knowledge or instructions:\n\n(1)\n\nBy way of an email dated 21 June 2018, at 2.40 pm, CPC made a revised global\nsettlement offer to III Pte Ltd of S$4,000.00 (“21 June Offer”).\n\n(2)\n\nBy way of an email dated 21 June 2018, at 4.29 pm, III Pte Ltd counter-proposed\nthe sum of S$3,800.00 as global settlement of the Complainant’s claim (“21 June\nProposal”).\n\n14.\n\nBy way of an email dated 26 June 2018, at 11.25 am, CPC accepted the 21 June\nProposal. By way of an email dated 27 June 2018, at 11.05 am, III Pte Ltd sent CPC a\nDischarge Voucher for the sum of S$3,800.00.\n\n15.\n\nOn 29 June 2018, the Complainant received a Discharge Voucher issued by III Pte Ltd,\nwhich stated that the settlement sum was S$3,800.00 and not S$3,281.35, as stated in the\n7 June Proposal, which was annexed to the 11 June Letter. The Complainant did not\nreceive an explanation or breakdown of the sum of S$3,800.00.\n\n16.\n\nBy reason of the foregoing, the Respondent has breached Rule 5(2)(e) of the PCR in\nfailing to keep the Complainant reasonably informed of the progress of his matter, by\nfailing to inform the Complainant when she negotiated a higher global settlement sum\nwith III Pte Ltd, and by failing to explain the breakdown of the $3,800 settlement sum.\n\n\f-5-\n\nTHE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that having regard to the matters submitted in the MP, the\nTribunal should impose only a reprimand for the misconduct which may bring the legal\nprofession into disrepute.\n\n18.\n\nEssentially, the Respondent’s main arguments in mitigation were as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nShe was remorseful and had acknowledged that there were shortcomings in her\nconduct, had made representations at an early stage and had agreed to plead guilty\nat the earliest possible opportunity following the reply to her representations,\nthereby saving time and cost for the parties.\n\n(2)\n\nNo prejudice was caused to the Complainant. His interest has not been prejudiced\nor compromised as she had managed to secure the amount of damages which the\nComplainant was prepared to accept in settlement of his claim. Furthermore, no\nissue was raised by the Complainant as to the reasonableness of the amount of\ndamages which she had advised the Complainant to accept in full and final\nsettlement of his claim in the 7 June Proposal.\n\n(3)\n\nHer conduct was not motivated by personal interest or dishonesty and did not seek\nto unfairly benefit herself over the Complainant’s interest. The lapses in\ncommunication with the Complainant was not malicious or motivated by personal\ninterest or dishonesty but stemmed from a genuine belief that the Complainant did\nnot have any interest in the party and party cost component of any offer from III\nPte Ltd because of the structure of the solicitor-and-client cost agreed between the\nComplainant and CPC. She genuinely believed that the 7 June Proposal was\nreasonable and had advised the Complainant to accept it. Furthermore, the party\nand party cost which CPC had sought to negotiate with III Pte Ltd was also in line\nwith the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims in Appendix E of the State\nCourt Practice Directions.\n\n\f-6-\n\nTHE LAW SOCIETY’S ARGUMENTS\n\n19.\n\nThe Law Society, however, argued that the Respondent should be ordered to pay a\npenalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct in the sum of $$6,000.\n\n20.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that relevant precedents show that where a legal practitioner\nis charged and found liable for breach of Rule 5(2) of the PCR (or its predecessor\nequivalent, Rule 17), absent aggravating factors, a monetary penalty is appropriate.\n\n21.\n\nIn The Law Society of Singapore v Sham Chee Keat [2018] SGDT 55 (\"Sham\"), the legal\npractitioner there was found guilty of one charge under Rule 5(2)(c) for\nfailing to act with reasonable diligence and competence in his provision of services to\nthe client by including or causing to be included in an affidavit deposed to by the client\nstatements which he ought to have known were inaccurate and false. The legal\npractitioner had attended a Pre-Trial Conference (\"PTC”) on behalf of his client, where\nthe bifurcation of the client's case was discussed. The legal practitioner claimed that he\nmisunderstood the outcome of the PTC and subsequently provided inaccurate\ninformation to his client about the PTC. Thereafter, the client deposed to an affidavit\nprepared by the legal practitioner, which contained statements that were inaccurate or\nfalse, based on the legal practitioner's misunderstanding of the outcome of the PTC. The\nDisciplinary Tribunal found that the legal practitioner had \"acted carelessly with\ninsufficient professional diligence and competence\", and was ordered to pay a penalty of\n$5,000.\n\n22.\n\nAlthough the legal practitioner in Sham was sanctioned for a breach of a different rule\nunder Rule 5 [i.e. 5(2)(c)], the Law Society submitted that the case is nevertheless\ninstructive, given that Rule 5(2)(c) (which relates to the duty to act with reasonable\ncompetence) and the Rule under which the Respondent here was charged, namely Rule\n5(2)(e) (which relates to the duty to keep the client reasonably informed of the progress\nof the client's matter), both fall under the broad category of duties of honesty, competence\nand diligence under Rule 5. The duty of reasonable diligence necessarily entails keeping\nthe client reasonably informed of the progress of his case (Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 2015 Commentary (Academy Publishing 2016) at para 05-041).\n\n\f-7-\n\n23.\n\nAccordingly, Law Society's position was that, based on the sanction in Sham, a penalty\nof S$5,000, as a starting point, is appropriate in the present case.\n\n24.\n\nThe Law Society went on to submit that the Respondent's seniority is a significant\naggravating factor. As stated by the High Court in Law Society of Singapore v Nathan\nEdmund [1998] 2 SLR(R) 905, it is trite that the more senior an advocate, the more\ndamage he does to the integrity of the legal profession (at [33]). This was acknowledged\nrecently by the High Court in Law Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju and\nanother matter [2017] 4 SLR 1369, where the legal practitioner having been in practice\nfor 29 years was found to have warranted a more onerous sentence (at [88]). Likewise,\nin the present case, the Respondent being a senior practitioner of about 22 years’ standing\njustified a more serious sanction, warranting an uplift of the penalty from $5,000 to\n$6,000.\n\n25.\n\nThe Law Society also submitted that the mitigating factors relied on by the Respondent\nin the MP should be treated with circumspection and not viewed charitably. As\nacknowledged by the Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Kurubalan\ns/o Manickam Rengaraju [2013] 4 SLR 91, mitigating factors should be viewed in a\nqualitatively different light in disciplinary proceedings as opposed to in a criminal case\n(at [48]- [49]):\n\n“48. A court that exercises disciplinary jurisdiction is likely to view mitigating factors\nin a different light than would a court in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction: see Law\nSociety of Singapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick [1999] 3 SLR(R) 68 at [22]:\n\nBecause orders made by a disciplinary tribunal are not primarily punitive,\nconsiderations which would ordinarily weigh in mitigation of punishment have less\neffect on the exercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in\ncriminal cases: Bolton v Law Society [1994] 2 All ER 486 at 492. To state the matter\nanother way, whatever might have been the appropriate sentence in the criminal\nproceedings, the objective there was rather different from that in show cause\nproceedings, which are civil and not punitive in nature.\n\n\f-8-\n\n49. The point simply is that even if a mitigating circumstance might be found that could\nweaken the case for punishment in a criminal case, this circumstance may often not avail\nan Advocate and Solicitor in proceedings because an equally, if not more, important\nconsideration is the protection of public confidence in the administration of justice. This\ninterest can legitimately trump the individual offender's interest in having his punishment\nfinely calibrated according to his precise degree of culpability. Where aggravating factors\nare concerned, there is usually less need to draw this distinction since a factor that\naggravates the offender's particular culpability would generally tend also to aggravate the\nadverse impact on confidence in the administration of justice, although there may be\nexceptions to this.\"\n\n26.\n\nThe Law Society's position is that the mitigating factors relied on by the Respondent\nshould be disregarded in the present proceedings, for the following reasons:\n\n(1)\n\nThe Respondent's assertion that no prejudice was caused to the Complainant, and\nthat her conduct was not motivated by personal interest or dishonesty, is of no help\nto the Respondent. A similar line of argument was pursued in Law Society of\nSingapore v Tham Yu Xian Rick [1999] 3 SLR(R) 68, where the High Court found\nthat the legal practitioner not having benefitted from his misdeeds apart from\nearning the usual conveyancing fees \"was beside the point\", given that \"because\norders made by a disciplinary tribunal are not primarily punitive, considerations\nwhich would ordinarily weigh in mitigation of punishment have less effect on the\nexercise of the disciplinary jurisdiction than on sentences imposed in criminal\ncases\". The mitigating factors highlighted by the Respondent should therefore not\nbe relied on.\n\n(2)\n\nFurther, and in any event, the Respondent's \"remorse and plea of guilt at the earliest\nopportunity\" was a mischaracterization of the events that transpired in the present\nproceedings. The Respondent did not plead guilty at the earliest possible\nopportunity, and her conduct cannot be said to have saved costs and time for all\nparties involved. Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief were exchanged on 25 February\n2020, and the matter was fixed for 2 days of trial, on 10 and 11 March. It was only\n6 days before the hearing on 4 March 2020 that the Respondent agreed to plead\n\n\f-9-\n\nguilty. Therefore, the Respondent's plea of guilt was not timeous, and should not\nbe considered a mitigating circumstance.\n\nMATTERS OF CONCERN TO THE TRIBUNAL\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal struggled to understand the position of the Law Society in amending the\noriginal charges to the amended charge as it appeared not to give adequate weight to the\npossible severity of the actions of the Respondent which was clearly detrimental to her\nclient, the Complainant. The amended charges appeared to trivialise the Complaint and\ndo disservice to the Complainant and any other client who was in a position similar to\nthat of the Complainant.\n\n28.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal felt it had no option but to respect the prosecutorial discretion of\nthe Law Society when it chose to prefer the amended charge instead of the original\ncharges. Furthermore, it was not apparent whether the relevant representatives of the Law\nSociety who made the decision to prefer the amended charge were aware of the\nRespondent’s antecedent misconduct referred to later in this report.\n\n29.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal noted the facts set out below.\n\n30.\n\nIn CPC’s letter dated 11 June 2018 to the Complainant, which attached the 7 June\nProposal which had provided for an offer aggregating $3281.35 comprising, inter alia,\n“Cost and Disbursements including GST-$1605”, CPC had also informed the\nComplainant that:\n\n(1)\n\n“Pursuant to the Warrant to Act, the sum of $535, inclusive of GST, will be\ndeducted from the compensation amount”;\n\n(2)\n\n“Given the injuries diagnosed, we would advise you that the offer made thereon is\nreasonable and can be seriously considered for acceptance”; and\n\n\f- 10 -\n\n(3)\n\n“ you may be required to sign a Discharge Voucher for an amount that is higher\nthan what is stated herein as that amount will include our legal costs and\ndisbursements incurred for this file”.\n\n31.\n\nThe 11 June 2018 letter contemplated that the cost of $535 pursuant to the Warrant to\nAct was in addition to the costs of $1605 payable by III Pte Ltd and this appears to have\nbeen so understood and accepted by the Complainant in the Complaint. The Warrant to\nAct, dated 5 October 2017, provided that the Respondent could deduct from any\nsettlement sum received party and party costs, described as “costs paid by the third party\non [the client’s] behalf” as well as the solicitor and client costs, the minimum of which\nwas stated to be $500 plus GST. It appears that in accepting the 7 June Proposal for a\ntotal of $3,281.35, the Complainant was aware and agreed that the Respondent would\ncharge as her cost a sum of $535 plus $1,605, totalling $2,140, which amounted to 65.2%\nof the proposed settlement sum.\n\n32.\n\nInstead of acting in accordance with the Complainant’s instructions to accept the 7 June\nProposal, the Respondent without authorization or instruction from the Complainant,\nmade an increased offer by way of CPC’s 21 June Offer to III Pte Ltd for a global\nsettlement sum of $4,000. In the 21 June Offer, the Respondent had stated “Purely to\nfacilitate an amicable settlement, we counter proposed global sum of $4,000 all-in and\nno less”. This was a counter offer which in law rejected the 7 June Offer, including the\noffer to pay party and party costs of $1605, and was totally opposite and contrary to the\nComplainant’s instructions to accept the 7 June Proposal which the Respondent had\nadvised the Complainant to accept. Indeed, had III Pte Ltd rejected the 21 June Offer and\nsought to reduce its proposal to an amount less than that in the 7 June Proposal, it would\nhave been legally entitled to do so.\n\n33.\n\nAs it turned out, III Pte Ltd made an increased global settlement offer of $3,800 vide its\n21 June Proposal which was accepted vide CPC’s email response dated 26 June 2018.\n\n34.\n\nClearly, the Respondent knew from experience that it was very unlikely that III Pte Ltd\nwould reject her counter offer and seek to reduce its offer to an amount less than the 7\nJune Proposal and that it was a safe gamble for her to seek a higher global settlement,\nwhich leads to the question: whose benefit was this for? Given that the Respondent had\n\n\f- 11 -\n\nin the 11 June Letter to the Complainant advised the Complainant to accept the 7 June\nProposal and the Complainant agreed to accept the 7 June Proposal, it meant also that the\nRespondent was prepared to and agreed to accept the party and party costs of $1605 from\nIII Pte Ltd and that the Complainant likewise agreed to this. As such, the counter offer\nby the Respondent for a global settlement amount larger than the 7 June Proposal, even\nwhere made without the Complainant’s instructions, which resulted in a global settlement\nfor an amount larger than the 7 June Proposal, would result in the entire\nfinal global settlement amount of $3,800, including the increased differential, being held\nby the Respondent on behalf of and to the benefit of the Complainant, given that the\nRespondent was at all relevant times an agent and solicitor for the Complainant for which\nthere was a duty on the Respondent’s part to account to the Complainant. The Respondent\nhad likely sought a larger “global settlement” from III Pte Ltd, instead of merely seeking\nan increased amount of “party and party costs“, for her own benefit because she wanted\nto give III Pte Ltd the impression that it was the Complainant who wanted a larger amount\nof damages to achieve a settlement, which III Pte Ltd obviously believed. If the\nRespondent truly believed that III Pte Ltd would have agreed to pay a larger amount of\n“party and party costs“, whilst the amount of damages payable to the Complainant\nremained as per the 7 June Proposal, she could have simply stated that a larger amount\nof “party and party costs“ was required to achieve a settlement.\n\n35.\n\nUnder cover of an email dated 27 June 2018, III Pte Ltd forwarded to CPC a discharge\nvoucher for the settlement sum of $3,800 and asked that it be signed by the Complainant\nand returned to them before they issued the cheque for $3,800. As it turned out, the need\nfor the signing of the discharge voucher for the settlement sum of $3,800 became the\ntrigger for the Complaint.\n\n36.\n\nAs admitted by the Respondent, she did not keep the Respondent informed nor obtained\nhis instructions in making the 21 June Offer or in accepting the final $3,800 global\nsettlement amount. In the Complaint, the Complainant stated that he had been asked to\nsign a discharge voucher for $3,800 instead of the $3281.35 under the 7 June Proposal\nand he was concerned that the 7 June Proposal might have been “fabricated“ and that\n“there [was] an unaccounted sum of $581.65 and the issue is whether there [was] an\nattempt to misappropriate it“. In the Complaint, he also stated that he relied on the\nRespondent’s advice in the 11 June Letter (which forwarded the 7 June Proposal) which\n\n\f- 12 -\n\nhe understood to mean that “there was no possibility of getting a higher settlement“ as a\nresult of which he accepted the 7 June Proposal under which he was to receive $1,552\n(being damages of $1,940 X 80%, accepting 20% contributory negligence on his part),\nwhich after deducting the solicitor and client cost of $535 inclusive of GST, meant that\nhe would receive a nett sum of only $1,017. Further, if there had been an uplift in the\nsettlement sum to $3,800, he would have wanted to participate in it.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent has placed emphasis on the argument that the 7 June Proposal which she\nadvised the Complainant to accept was reasonable. As the Tribunal sees it, whether or\nnot the 7 June Proposal was reasonable is not the issue. The issue is whether having\nadvised that the 7 June Proposal was reasonable, and having caused the Complainant to\naccept that offer for his damages, the Respondent could act in a manner which was not\nonly totally contrary to the Complainant’s instructions to accept the 7 June Proposal but\namounted to a rejection of the 7 June Proposal, by going back to III Pte Ltd to give the\nfalse impression that her client was not agreeable to the 7 June Proposal and to counter\noffer a larger global settlement without first informing the client and obtaining his\nauthorisation, with the increased differential amount in the counter offer to be attributed\nto the “party and party costs” at the expense of any potential increase in the amount of\ndamages payable to the Complainant and whether in the absence of any such further\nagreement or instruction from the client, the Respondent was obliged to account to the\nComplainant for any increase in the global settlement sum eventually secured and paid.\nTo the Tribunal, the answer to the first issue is in the negative, whilst the answer to the\nsecond issue is in the positive.\n\n38.\n\nAs it turned out, following the Respondent’s acceptance of the final global settlement\nsum of $3,800, the Respondent expected to receive a total cost of $2,658.65, comprising\nof the solicitor and client cost of $535 plus “party and party costs” of $2,123.65. In short,\nthe Respondent’s cost component increased from 65.2% to 70% of the settlement\namount, whilst the Complainant’s recovery component fell from 34.8% to 30% of the\nsettlement amount.\n\n39.\n\nThe statement in CPC’s 11 June Letter to the Complainant “Please note that you may be\nrequired to sign a Discharge Voucher for an amount that is higher than what is stated\nherein as that amount will include our legal cost and disbursements incurred for this\n\n\f- 13 -\n\nfile“ (“the Higher DV Clause”), which has been relied on by the Respondent to justify\nher self-proclaimed entitlement to negotiate and retain the additional “party and party\ncosts“, is really of no assistance to the Respondent because:\n\n(1)\n\nby advising the Complainant to accept the 7 June Proposal and by the\nComplainant’s acceptance of the proposal, there was effectively a separate\nagreement between the Respondent and the Complainant whereby the Respondent\nagreed to charge and the Complainant agreed for the Respondent/CPC to charge\nthe solicitor and client costs of $535 as well as party and party costs of $1,605,\nnotwithstanding any further work which may need to be done as well as further\ndisbursements to be incurred by CPC to bring about the settlement;\n\n(2)\n\nif the aforesaid separate agreement did not extend to any further cost and\ndisbursements incurred by CPC to facilitate the settlement, then the application of\nthe Higher DV Clause should be limited to any additional cost and disbursements\npayable as the party and party cost after the acceptance of the offer and certainly\nnot to an upward variation of the party and party cost already agreed to be paid by\nIII Pte Ltd. As is common knowledge, there is always a reasonable range or\nestimate of damages for personal injury. It should not be the case that a legal\npractitioner should advice his client to accept a lower reasonable offer when there\nis still room to negotiate a higher reasonable figure and then use that headroom to\nnegotiate a higher party and party cost for himself after the client had accepted the\nlower reasonable offer based on the legal practitioner’s advice. Otherwise, it\nwrongly encourages the acceptance of lower reasonable offers for the benefit of the\nlegal practitioner. If any provision in any letter of engagement or warrant to act is\nintended\n\nto\n\nachieve\n\nsuch\n\na\n\npurpose,\n\nit\n\nneeds\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nspelled\n\nout\n\nclearly and in no uncertain terms. The reality is that one rarely finds any clearly\nagreed provision to this effect as most, if not all, reasonable clients would not agree\nto its insertion as the client would realize that he would be giving the legal\npractitioner a licence to advise him to accept a lower reasonable offer and then go\non to negotiate and secure a higher offer with the upward differential to be kept for\nthe benefit of the legal practitioner’s own cost, which would otherwise have been\nfor the benefit of the client.\n\n\f- 14 -\n\n40.\n\nIn the Respondent’s explanatory letter dated 30 November 2018 to the Inquiry\nCommittee, it was stated that the counter proposal of the global settlement amount of\n$4,000 which CPC made on 21 June 2018 “was to take into account disbursements not\npreviously offered as well as to renegotiate costs”. It was clearly not for any party and\nparty cost or disbursements incurred after the acceptance of the 7 June Proposal.\n\n41.\n\nMore importantly, given that the Respondent’s counter-offer by way of the 21 June Offer\nto III Pte Ltd was for a global settlement of $4,000, and this eventually led to a full and\nfinal global settlement of $3,800:\n\n(1)\n\nIII Pte Ltd never agreed to pay any part of the said $3,800 as party and party costs.\nThe party and party costs of $1,605 under the 7 June Proposal was no longer\noperative as it had been rejected by the counter-offer. As such, there was really no\nbasis for the Respondent to claim that any part of it was being paid as “party and\nparty costs” to which she was entitled; and\n\n(2)\n\nstrictly speaking, this global settlement overrode the terms of the 7 June\nProposal (which had been rejected) so that the entire sum of $3,800 or failing that,\nthe increased differential of $518.65 (being the difference between $3,800 and\n$3281.35), is for the benefit of the Complainant and the Respondent is duty bound\nto account to the Complainant for the same. This means that the Respondent has to\nagree with the Complainant as to her total fees instead of unilaterally seeking to\ngazump $2,123.65 or the increased differential by self-proclaiming it as “party and\nparty costs”.\n\n42.\n\nClearly, the Respondent well knew that had she sought the Complainant’s instructions to\nmake the 21 June Offer, or indeed any larger offer, she would have to explain why she\nhad previously advised the Complainant to accept the 7 June Offer in the first place and\nthe Complainant would very likely have wanted all or a substantial part of any increased\namount for himself.\n\n43.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal arrived at the conclusion that the Respondent’s failure to inform\nthe Complainant and obtain the Complainant’s instructions and authorisation before (a)\nmaking the 21 June Offer and (b) accepting the final global settlement offer of $3,800\n\n\f- 15 -\n\nwas not due to any oversight on the Respondent’s part, or any misguided belief as to her\nentitlement to renegotiate the “party and party costs“ after the Complainant had accepted\nthe 7 June Proposal, but was instead part of a deliberate approach designed by the\nRespondent to benefit herself at the expense of the Complainant.\n\n44.\n\nFurthermore, in response to the Tribunal’s query to the Respondent to clarify whether\nshe was still intending to charge the Complainant for legal fees, and if so, the amount\nthereof, the Respondent stated that she was intending to recover her “party and party\ncosts” of $2,123.65 pursuant to the $3,800 global settlement but she was still undecided\nas to whether she would charge the Complainant for the sum of $535 which was the\nsolicitor and client costs which the Complainant had agreed to pay. The Respondent had\nalso explained that her firm was discharged before the settlement monies were paid to\nher firm, but that she still intended to write to the Complainant’s present solicitors to\nfollow up on the recovery of her fees.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal raised the aforesaid query as it wanted to clarify the Respondent’s statement\nin mitigation to the effect that there was no prejudice to the Complainant and that no\nfinancial benefit was received or intended to be received from the matters complained\noff. Indeed, given the Respondent’s response as set out in the preceding paragraph, the\nTribunal considered her statement to the effect that there was no prejudice to the\nComplainant and that no financial benefit was received or intended to be received, to be\nwholly inaccurate and misleading. The solicitors for the Respondent sought to clarify by\nsaying that the Respondent was receiving no financial benefit beyond what she was\nentitled to. The Tribunal found this explanation to be lacking in substance and that her\nstatement in mitigation, to the effect that there was no prejudice to the Complainant and\nno financial benefit was received or intended to be received from the matters complained\nof, was intended to pull wool over the eyes of the Tribunal. In any event, as stated earlier\nin this report, the entire final global settlement amount of $3,800 or failing that, the\nincreased differential amount of $518.65 was rightfully for the benefit of and belonged\nto the Complainant and the Respondent was under a duty to account to the Complainant\nfor the same, and her actions were analogous to or, arguably, even constituted potential\nbreaches of trust.\n\n\f- 16 -\n\nANTECEDENT\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal had enquired before the hearing on 23 March 2020 whether the Respondent\nhad any antecedents of misconduct and was notified by the Law Society that the\nRespondent had a recent antecedent in The Law Society of Singapore v Constance\nMargreat Paglar [2019] SGDT 11 (DT 8/2019) (“Antecedent”). A copy of the same\nwas provided to the Tribunal before the 23 March hearing.\n\n47.\n\nIn that case, the Respondent’s firm CPC was engaged by various owners of vehicles\ninvolved in traffic accidents to claim for losses and/or damages arising therefrom. These\nvarious owners, who were her clients, had appointed the complainant there, JKS Motor\nWorks (Accident Claims) Pte Ltd (“JKS”) as their agent vis-a-vis the Respondent’s firm\nwhich was to take instructions from JKS and keep JKS informed. Nineteen (19) charges\nwere originally preferred against the Respondent, but following representations made on\nher behalf, the Law Society proceeded only with 4 charges, one in relation to each of 4\nseparate clients, under which the Respondent had failed to provide an update of the case\nto the client from various dates ranging from 24 December 2015 to 22 July 2016, up to\nvarious later dates, and was guilty of having breached Rule 5(2)(c) of the PCR as\namounted to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor under section\n83(2)(b)(i) of the LPA. The Respondent pleaded guilty to the 4 charges and the tribunal\nimposed a penalty of $4,000.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal invited submissions from the parties as to whether the Tribunal was at\nliberty to consider the Antecedent for purposes of arriving at the appropriate sanction in\nview of the guilty plea to the amended charge.\n\n49.\n\nThe Law Society submitted that it was not its practice to rely on antecedents but was of\nthe view that for purposes of determining the appropriate sanction after the issue of\nliability had been determined, as in the present case where the Respondent had pleaded\nguilty, the Tribunal was at liberty to give consideration and weight to the Antecedent,\nshould it choose to do so.\n\n\f- 17 -\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent, however, objected to the Tribunal considering the Antecedent for\npurposes of determining the appropriate sanction. The Respondent’s arguments may be\nsummarised as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nThe legislative framework only permitted the Court of Three Judges (“court”) to\ntake into account the past conduct of a respondent to determine what order should\nbe made under section 83(1) of the LPA as provided for in section 83(5) of the LPA\nwhich reads: “In any proceedings under this Part, the court may in addition to\nthe facts of the case take into account the past conduct of the person concerned\nin order to determine what order should be made.”\n\n(2)\n\nSection 82B(5) of the LPA, which concerns disciplinary proceedings of regulated\nnon-practitioners, and section 83A(3) of the LPA, which concerns disciplinary\nproceedings of regulated foreign lawyers, also provide that only the court can take\ninto account a respondent's past conduct when determining what orders should be\nmade.\n\n(3)\n\nUnder section 91(2) of the LPA, there is no provision for a disciplinary tribunal to\nrequest for and take into consideration for purposes of determining the appropriate\norder a respondent’s past conduct. Instead, a disciplinary tribunal is only\nempowered to administer oaths and \"sue out subpoenas to testify or to produce\ndocuments\".\n\n(4)\n\nUnder section 93(1) of the LPA, a disciplinary tribunal “shall record its findings in\nrelation to the facts of the case and according to those facts” (emphasis ours) make\nthe determination prescribed under that section. This implies that a disciplinary\ntribunal can only look at the facts of the specific misconduct that was before it and\ndecide the appropriate order and not have regard to any antecedent past conduct.\n\n(5)\n\nSection 228 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which is encapsulated under the\nCriminal Procedure Code's Plead Guilty Procedures, permits the Court to consider\nan accused's criminal records and any relevant factors which may affect the\nsentence.\n\n\f- 18 -\n\n51.\n\nThe thrust of the Respondent’s submission was that absent a similar express provision\nenabling a disciplinary tribunal to consider the past conduct of a respondent, the Tribunal\nwas simply not empowered to consider the Antecedent for the purpose of determining\nthe appropriate order where liability has already been established.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that given the potentially serious ramifications faced under\nsection 83(1) of the LPA, Parliament had enacted section 83(5) of the LPA empowering\nonly the court to ensure that sufficient checks and balances were in place to ensure fair\nprocess of the proceedings.\n\n53.\n\nThe consequences of the submission are that no matter how bad a past misconduct was\nor how many acts of past misconduct there were, a disciplinary tribunal simply had to\nignore them and deal only with the facts of the misconduct that were before it.\n\n54.\n\nIt would also mean that where there is antecedent misconduct, it would be better to leave\nit to the court to decide on the appropriate order for the present misconduct so that the\norder to be made is reflective of the object of disciplining the errant advocate. In a\nsituation like that, a disciplinary tribunal may have no choice but to send the matter up\nfor the appropriate order to be made by the court.\n\n55.\n\nBy way of illustration, in the Antecedent the Respondent asked for a fine and was given\na fine for the past conduct. In the present proceedings, the Respondent asks only for a\nreprimand, a lower form of punishment. If the Tribunal had not on its own volition asked\nfor antecedents, it would not have known of the Respondent’s past conduct and could\nhave resulted in it making a wrong order.\n\n56.\n\nGiven the above situation, the Tribunal at the conclusion of the hearing invited the\nRespondent to consider whether the Tribunal could look into the Antecedent in deciding\nthe appropriate sanction for the present misconduct, with the caveat that if she did not\nagree there was the possibility that the Tribunal may feel constrained to refer the matter\nto the Court of Three Judges. The Respondent maintained her position that the Tribunal\nshould not consider the Antecedent.\n\n\f- 19 -\n\nDECISION OF TRIBUNAL\n\n57.\n\nSection 93 of the LPA provides as follows:\n\n“93.— (1) After hearing and investigating any matter referred to it, a Disciplinary\nTribunal shall record its findings in relation to the facts of the case and according\nto those facts shall determine that —\n\n(a)\n\nno cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83\nor 83A (as the case may be);\n\n(b)\n\nwhile no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under\nsection 83 or 83A (as the case may be), the regulated legal practitioner should\nbe —\n(i)\n\nordered to pay a penalty that is sufficient and appropriate to the\nmisconduct committed;\n\n(ii)\n\nreprimanded;\n\n(iii) ordered to comply with one or more remedial measures; or\n(iv) subjected to the measure in sub-paragraph (iii) in addition to the\nmeasure in sub-paragraph (i) or (ii); or\n\n(c)\n\ncause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 or\n83A (as the case may be).”\n\n58.\n\nHaving regard to only the facts of the case, the Tribunal determines that cause of\nsufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83. The Tribunal wishes to\nclarify that in arriving at this decision, it has not given weight to the Antecedent.\n\n\f- 20 -\n\n59.\n\nNevertheless, it would be useful if a Court of Three Judges could clarify for the benefit\nof future disciplinary tribunals whether a tribunal is empowered and be at liberty to\nconsider and give weight to a respondent’s antecedent misconduct in arriving at a\ndecision and/or determining the appropriate sanction for the misconduct that is before\nthe tribunal.\nCOSTS\n\n60.\n\nHaving determined under s 93(1)(c) that there is cause of sufficient gravity for\ndisciplinary action, the Tribunal is permitted under section 93(2) of the LPA to make a\ncosts order. The Law Society submitted that the Respondent should pay costs of $8,000\n(all in) for, inter alia, the following reasons:\n\n(1)\n\nbased on the documents given by the Complainant, the Law Society prepared a\nStatement of Case and framed charges against the Respondent;\n\n(2)\n\nthe Law Society prepared a List of Documents;\n\n(3)\n\nthe Law Society reviewed the Respondent's Defence and subsequent\nRepresentations, and engaged in negotiations with the Respondent;\n\n(4)\n\nthe Law Society had to consider and respond to the Respondent’s Mitigation Plea;\n\n(5)\n\nthe Law Society had to amend the initial charges that were preferred against the\nRespondent;\n\n(6)\n\nthe Law Society prepared a substantive affidavit of evidence in chief for the\nComplainant, and a Bundle of Documents for the Disciplinary Tribunal;\n\n(7)\n\nthe Law Society prepared Submissions on Sanction for the Disciplinary Tribunal.\n\n\f- 21 -\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that costs should be about $2,000. Having heard the parties\nin relation to costs, and taking into account also that the Respondent pleaded guilty to the\namended charge, the Tribunal orders that the Respondent pay costs to the Law Society\nof $4,000 (all in).\n\nDated this\n\n12th\n\nday of May 2020\n\n______________________________________\nPresident: Mr Andre Yeap, SC\n\n_________________________________\nMember: Mr G.

The\nRespondent is a practicing advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of\nSingapore who was admitted to the roll on 14 February 1968. At the material\ntime, she was practicing at M/s Wee Swee Teow LLP.\n2\n\nThe charge against the Respondent is that in breach of Rule 17(3)(a) of\n\nthe Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 (the “Rules”), she\nfailed to inform or sufficiently inform her clients of the basis on which fees for\nprofessional services will be charged, and she has thereby committed an act\namounting to improper conduct in the discharge of her professional duty as an\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nadvocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court, contrary to Section 83(2)(b) of the\nLegal Profession Act (the “LPA”).1\n3\n\nThe Respondent pleads guilty to the charge preferred against her by the\n\nLaw Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”).\n4\n\nThe Respondent having pleaded guilty, the main issue before this\n\nTribunal is whether there is cause of sufficient gravity for the Respondent to be\nreferred to the Court of Three Judges for disciplinary action under Section 83\nof the LPA, or whether the Respondent should be reprimanded and/or ordered\nto pay a penalty sufficient and appropriate to the misconduct, pursuant to\nSection 93(1)(b) of the LPA.\nThe background facts\n5\n\nThe Complainants are amongst the 9 beneficiaries to the Estate of Mdm\n\nTan Bee Eng, deceased, the mother of the Complainants.\n6\n\nThe aforementioned Mdm Lim Lay Choo and Mr Lim Teck Seng,\n\nanother beneficiary to the Estate, were named in the will dated 11 October 2007,\nand were appointed as Joint Executors of the Estate (“Joint Executors”)\npursuant to the will.2\n7\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the 9 beneficiaries attended a meeting with the\n\nRespondent at the Respondent’s office to seek advice on the will. During this\nmeeting, the Joint Executors agreed to appoint the Respondent and her firm,\n\n1\n\nRespondent’s Opening Statement dated 3 February 2021 at page 4\n\n2\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 4\n\n2\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nM/s Wee Swee Teow LLP as the solicitors in the matter of the probate of Mdm\nTan Bee Eng, deceased, with the Respondent taking up principal conduct of the\nmatter.3\n8\n\nDuring this meeting, the Joint Executors signed a Warrant to Act with 2\n\nenclosures: Information on Costs and Information on Disclosure of Documents.\nNotably, both the Warrant to Act and the Information on Costs did not contain\nany provision on the hourly rate of the Respondent or any other fee earner\napplicable for the handling of this matter.4\n9\n\nA fee deposit of S$2000.00 was duly paid into the Respondent’s firm’s\n\nclient account.5\n10\n\nFrom the outset, there were disputes among the 9 beneficiaries over the\n\nactual value of the Estate and their share entitlements under the will. These\ndisputes were resolved at a mediation and the beneficiaries entered into a\nSettlement Agreement dated 25 April 2018. Neither the Respondent nor her firm\nrepresented any of the parties at the mediation.6\n11\n\nOn 15 May 2018, the Respondent obtained the Grant of Probate.7\n\n12\n\nOn 24 May 2018, the Respondent issued tax invoice no. 783/2018 for\n\nthe sum of S$162,897.32. This sum comprised her professional fees of\n\n3\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 3\n\n4 Statement of Case at paragraphs 3-5\n5 Statement of Case at paragraph 3\n6\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 6\n\n7\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 6\n\n3\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nS$150,000, as well as disbursements and taxes. The tax invoice contained a\ngeneral description of the professional services rendered. However, it did not\ngive a breakdown of the work done, time spent, the fee earners involved, and\nthe rates charged.8\n13\n\nSometime in July 2018, Mr Lim Teck Seng paid a sum of S$1,300,000\n\nto the Respondent’s office to be distributed to the beneficiaries in accordance\nwith the terms of the Settlement Agreement.9\n14\n\nOn 17 July 2018 at 10.13am, the Respondent sent an email to the Joint\n\nExecutors seeking confirmation that the sum of S$974,102.68 was payable to\nthe beneficiaries after deducting her bill, as set out in the issued tax invoice,\nfrom the original amount of S$1,300,000.10\n15\n\nMdm Lim Lay Pheng replied to the Respondent on the same day at\n\n2.15pm, objecting to this deduction and requesting that the Respondent release\nthe full sum of S$1,300,000 to the beneficiaries of the Estate. In this same email,\nMdm Lim Lay Pheng also assured the Respondent that there would be sufficient\nmoney to settle her bill, and that her bill could be settled separately to the\ndistribution of the S$1,300,000.11\n16\n\nHowever, the Respondent continued to assert that she was entitled to\n\ndeduct her bill before paying out the distribution to the beneficiaries.\nSpecifically, in her reply email to Mdm Lim Lay Pheng on the same day at\n\n8 Statement of Case at paragraphs 7-9\n9 Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 16\n10\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 18\n\n11\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 19\n\n4\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\n3.18pm, the Respondent stated that under Clause 3 of the Settlement\nAgreement, her bill had to be paid before the distributions were paid out to the\nbeneficiaries.12\n17\n\nFollowing this, still on 17 July 2018 but at 8.32pm, Mdm Lim Lay Pheng\n\nemailed the Respondent on behalf of the Complainants, informing her that the\ntax invoice issued was unclear as to how the professional fees of S$150,000 had\nbeen derived and requesting for a detailed breakdown of the fees. In particular,\nshe requested for: (a) the amount of time spent on each piece of work done (with\na description of the work done), (b) the date on which the work was done, and\n(c) who had done the work together with his/her hourly rate.13\n18\n\nHaving received no reply from the Respondent to the request made on\n\n17 July 2018 for a detailed breakdown of the Respondent’s professional fees,\nMdm Lim Lay Choo emailed the Respondent twice more, on 20 July 2018 and\n29 July 2018, requesting a response to Mdm Lim Lay Pheng’s 17 July 2018\nemail.14\n19\n\nOn 30 July 2018, the Respondent replied to Mdm Lim Lay Choo, stating\n\nthat she was in the course of preparing the breakdown of the bill. However, by\nJanuary 2019, the Respondent still had not provided the Complainants with such\na breakdown.15\n\n12\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 20\n\n13\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 28\n\n14\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 29\n\n15\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraphs 30-31\n\n5\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\n20\n\nOn 24 January 2019, Mdm Lim Lay Choo forwarded an email (sent to\n\nher by Mdm Lim Lay Pheng) to the Respondent, asking the Respondent to have\nher bill taxed by the court. However, the Respondent did not respond to this\nemail either.16\n21\n\nOn 10 February 2019, Mdm Lim Lay Choo sent the Respondent a further\n\nemail. In this further email, Mdm Lim Lay Choo noted the Respondent’s failure\nto reply to the earlier 24 January email and requested the Respondent to respond\nwithin the next 7 days. Mdm Lim Lay Choo also informed the Respondent that\nif she failed to respond within the next 7 days, steps would be taken as may be\nnecessary to tax the Respondent’s bill.17\n22\n\nOn 15 February 2019, the Respondent responded to inform Mdm Lim\n\nLay Choo that she was still in the course of finishing the detailed bill and that\nshe would require an additional week before she could present the detailed bill.\nThe Respondent also explained that this delay in presenting the detailed bill was\ncaused by the fact that a large portion of the work done towards finishing the\ndetailed bill had been accidentally deleted, and had to be re-done.18\n23\n\nOn 5 April 2019, the Complainants wrote to the Law Society to make a\n\ncomplaint (“the Complaint”) against the Respondent. At this time, they had\nstill not received a breakdown of the tax invoice or a response from the\nRespondent in relation to the earlier requests for the bill to be taxed. This was\n\n16\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 32\n\n17\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 33\n\n18\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on 30 December 2020 at paragraph 34\n\n6\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nmore than 8 months since the Complainants had first requested the Respondent\nto provide a breakdown of her bill.19\n24\n\nIn the Complaint, the Complainants alleged that, inter alia, the\n\nRespondent had grossly over-charged them for the probate matter, had failed to\nprovide full particulars or details of the work done despite repeated requests and\nqueries, had refused to respond to repeated requests to tax her bill, and had\ndelayed providing the breakdown of her bill for 9 months.20\n25\n\nFollowing the lodging of the Complaint, on 11 April 2019, the\n\nRespondent finally provided a breakdown of the tax invoice. In the details, the\nRespondent outlined the dates and items of work done. However, the\nRespondent did not provide the time spent, the fee earners involved and their\nhourly rates.21\nProcedural history and amendment of the charge\n26\n\nSometime on or around 1 October 2020, the Law Society’s Statement of\n\nClaim was served on the Disciplinary Tribunal Secretariat.\n27\n\nThe Statement of Claim set out two charges against the Respondent. The\n\n1st charge was that the Respondent had breached Rule 17(3)(a) of the Rules for\nfailing to inform or sufficiently inform her clients of the basis on which her\nprofessional services had been charged, and had thereby committed an act\namounting to “grossly improper conduct” in the discharge of her professional\n\n19\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 12 and Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief of Lim Lay Pheng filed on\n30 December 2020 at paragraphs 35-36\n\n20\n\nBundle of Documents of the Law Society of Singapore, Tab 16, at paragraph 2\n\n21\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 13\n\n7\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nduty as an advocate and solicitor contrary to Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA\n(emphasis added). The alternative first charge was that by her breach of Rule\n17(3)(a), the Respondent had committed an act of misconduct unbefitting of an\nadvocate and solicitor under Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA. 22\n28\n\nThis Disciplinary Tribunal was subsequently appointed by the\n\nHonourable The Chief Justice on 16 October 2020.\n29\n\nOn 11 November 2020, the Respondent’s Statement of Defence was\n\nserved on the Tribunal and the Secretariat.\n30\n\nOn 19 November 2020, the Law Society filed their List of Documents.\n\nThe Respondent filed her List of Documents the next day on 20 November\n2020.\n31\n\nOn 30 December 2020, pursuant to the timelines set by the Tribunal, the\n\nRespondent and the Law Society filed affidavits of evidence-in-chief, and the\nLaw Society filed their bundles of documents and bundles of authorities.\n32\n\nOn 2 February 2021, the Law Society filed its Opening Statement\n\ntogether with supplementary bundles of authorities and documents. The\nRespondent filed her Opening Statement the next day on 3 February 2021.\nNotably, in her Opening Statement, the Respondent invited the Law Society to\namend the 1st charge against her by deleting the word “grossly” from the\nexpression “grossly improper conduct” in the 1st charge.23 The Respondent\n\n22\n\nStatement of Case at paragraph 21\n\n23\n\nRespondent’s Opening Statement at paragraph 1\n\n8\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nfurther stated that if the requested amendment to the 1st charge was made, she\nwould re-assess her position in relation to her denial of the charges.24\n33\n\nOn 4 February 2021, during the hearing, the Law Society requested for\n\nleave from the Tribunal to amend the 1st charge against the Respondent to\nremove the word “grossly” from the expression “grossly improper conduct”.\nThe Tribunal granted the Law Society leave to make such an amendment.\nFollowing this amendment, the Respondent changed her position to plead guilty\nto the amended 1st charge, with the result that the alternative 1st charge against\nthe Respondent also fell away.\n34\n\nThe Respondent having pleaded guilty to the amended charge, the only\n\nissue for the Tribunal to decide concerned the sanction to be issued against the\nRespondent, if any. Accordingly, the Tribunal heard submissions from both\nparties regarding what sanctions would be appropriate in the circumstances.\nThe parties’ respective positions\n35\n\nCounsel for the Law Society directed the Tribunal’s attention to two\n\ncases: The Law Society of Singapore v Anand K Thiagarajan [2009] SGDT 2\n(“Anand”) and The Law Society of Singapore v Chung Kok Soon [2002]\nSGDSC 2 (“Chung Kok Soon”).\n36\n\nIn Anand, the respondent admitted to his failure to comply with Rule\n\n35(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161, R1, 2000\nRev Ed), which stated that “[a]n advocate and solicitor shall inform the client\nof the basis on which fees for professional services will be charged and the\n\n24\n\nRespondent’s Opening Statement at paragraph 7\n\n9\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nmanner in which it is expected that those fees and disbursements, if any, shall\nbe paid by the client”. This provision was a precursor to Rule 17(3)(a) of the\nRules. The Tribunal in that case ruled that a reprimand pursuant to s.93(1)(b) of\nthe LPA would be appropriate bearing in mind that the respondent had still\nprovided the complainant with a bill for the work. The Tribunal also ordered the\nrespondent to pay the costs incurred by the Law Society in those proceedings.25\n37\n\nIn Chung Kok Soon, the respondent was charged, inter alia, with grossly\n\nimproper conduct in the discharge of his professional duty within the meaning\nof Section 83(2)(b) of the LPA, for failing to comply with the provisions of\nRule 35(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 1998. The\nTribunal found that the respondent had breached Rule 35(a) and, in light of this\nbreach, ordered the respondent to be reprimanded for this conduct and to pay\nthe costs of the Law Society.26\n38\n\nCounsel for the Respondent submitted that the present case was not one\n\nof sufficient gravity to be referred to the Court of Three Judges. Instead, it was\nsubmitted that a reprimand and an order to pay the Law Society’s costs would\nnot be inappropriate sanctions for the Respondent’s misconduct.\nThe Tribunal’s determination\n39\n\nThe two cases which Counsel for the Law Society brought to the\n\nTribunal’s attention concerned Rule 35(a) of the Legal Profession (Professional\nConduct) Rules 1998. That Rule is substantively identical to Rule 17(3)(a) of\nthe Rules which provides that “[a] legal practitioner must inform his or her client\n\n25\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Anand K Thiagarajan [2009] SGDT 2 at [28] and [31]\n\n26\n\nThe Law Society of Singapore v Chung Kok Soon [2002] SGDSC 2\n\n10\n\n\fThe Law Society of Singapore v Huang Lui\n\nof the basis on which fees for professional services will be charged, and of the\nmanner in which those fees and disbursements (if any) are to be paid by the\nclient”.\n40\n\nIn both those cases, a breach of the obligation to inform a client of the\n\nbasis on which fees for professional services would be charged, attracted a\nreprimand and an order that the Respondent pay the Law Society’s costs of the\nDisciplinary Tribunal proceedings. Bearing these precedents in mind, and\nconsidering all the facts of this case, the Tribunal finds that pursuant to Section\n93(1)(b)(ii) of the LPA, while no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary\naction exists under section 83, the Respondent should be reprimanded.\n41\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent should be reprimanded\n\nand ordered to pay the Law Society’s costs fixed at S$5,000 plus reasonable\ndisbursements.\n\n24th day\nFebruary 2021\nDated ________________\nof ______________\n\nMr Cavinder Bull, S.C.\n\nMr Ian Lim\n\nPresident\n\nAdvocate & Solicitor\n\n11\n\n\f","timestamp":"2021-10-06T06:00:51+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-oct-2021/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Koh Tien Hua (Respondent), Advocate and Solicitor","html":"<h3><strong>In the Matter of Koh Tien Hua (Respondent), Advocate and Solicitor</strong></h3>\n<p>These proceedings arose from information referred by the Attorney-General pursuant to section 85(3)(b) of the LPA and as such Council is required to refer the matter to a Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) for formal investigation.

The Complainants’ judicial management fees, billed at an hourly rate, would be paid out of the said cash deposit and that Gibson Dunn had received and held $500,000 as part of the said deposit for the JMs’ fees.\n\nThe Complainants had (through a letter issued by the Complainants’ then-solicitors, Tan Kok Quan Partnership) requested for payment of the said $500,000 to the Complainants’ account. Contrary to the agreement, in response to the Complainants’ said request, the Respondent had informed them that Gibson Dunn were not holding any fee deposit for the Complainants. Consequently, the sum of $500,000 was not paid out to the Complainants.\n\nIn relation to the complaint, the Chief Justice empanelled a DT presided by Ms Molly Lim SC and Mr Tan Kheng Ann Alvin as DT member.\n\nCharges\n\nTwo main and four alternative charges (collectively, the Six Charges) were preferred against the Respondent:\n\n1st Charge (Charge 1)\n\nFor fraudulent or grossly improper conduct as an advocate and solicitor within meaning of Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (LPA) in which the Respondent, while he and Jai Swarup Pathak were acting for Punj Lloyd Limited (PLL), knowing that PLL had agreed to deposit S$2 million towards the costs of managing Punj Lloyd Pte Ltd and Sembawang Engineers and Constructors Pte Ltd (the Companies) whilst

Managers and is therefore guilty of a breach of Rule 10(6)(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (PCR).\n\nAlternative 1st Charge (Charge 1A)\n\nFor misconduct unbefitting an

acting for PLL, knowing that PLL had agreed to deposit S$2 million towards the costs of managing the Companies whilst under judicial management, and having received two tranches of S$250,000 on or

The Respondent had failed to comply with the PCOs within reasonable time and without reasonable explanation for such delay, and she had also failed to accord the respective State Counsel of the Attorney-General’s Chambers (<strong>AGC</strong>) the courtesy of responding to their letters (specifically, a final reminder from the AGC) in connection with the PCOs. In addition, the Respondent had chosen to ignore the final chaser from the AGC to comply with the PCOs.</p>\n<p>As a result of the said circumstances, a total of three charges were formulated against the Respondent.</p>\n<p>The First Charge and the Second Charge were for the Respondent’s failure to comply with cost orders (in HC/OS 130/2015 and HC/OS 226/2015, respectively) made against her within a reasonable time and without any reasonable explanation which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Act.</p>\n<p>The Third Charge was for the Respondent’s breach of Rule 7(2) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules by neglecting, refusing and/or failing to respond to AGC’s letter of 23 February 2018 in relation to her payment obligations under the costs orders, which amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Act.</p>\n<p>An Alternative Third Charge referencing section 83(2)(h) of the Act was also formulated.</p>\n<p><strong>Findings by the DT</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to the proceedings by the DT proper, the Respondent made payment for the outstanding amount. However, the AGC stated that it wished to proceed with the matter.</p>\n<p>The DT noted that the final payment for the costs were made some three years after the orders were made and it was the Respondent who had sought the AGC’s indulgence to settle the costs orders along with the proposed quantum and timing for the instalments. Thereafter, she repeatedly failed to honour the payment schedules as agreed between her and the AGC, and as a result the AGC had to chase for the overdue payments and repeatedly remind her of her obligations. Further, it was only after AGC had referred the matter to the Society that the Respondent decided to make the final payment.</p>\n<p>To this end, the Respondent was not able to provide any satisfactory explanation as to why she could not have responded to AGC’s letter dated 23 February 2018 or why she could not have paid that amount.

F. Violet Netto, Advocate & Solicitor\n\nThe Disciplinary Tribunal (DT) had determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (the Act) that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be reprimanded.\n\nThe proceedings against the Respondent arose out of a complaint by the Attorney-General, in relation to two Personal Costs Orders (PCOs) that had been made against the Respondent. The Respondent had failed to comply with the PCOs within reasonable time and without reasonable explanation for such delay, and she had also failed to accord the respective State Counsel of the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) the courtesy of responding to their letters (specifically, a final reminder from the AGC) in connection with the PCOs. In addition, the Respondent had chosen to ignore the final chaser from the AGC to comply with the PCOs.\n\nAs a result of the said circumstances, a total of three charges were formulated against the Respondent.\n\nThe First Charge and the Second Charge were for the Respondent’s failure to comply with cost orders (in HC/OS 130/2015 and HC/OS 226/2015, respectively) made against her within a reasonable time and without any reasonable explanation which amounts to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the meaning of section 83(2)(h) of the Act.\n\nThe Third Charge was for the Respondent’s breach of Rule 7(2) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules by neglecting, refusing and/or failing to respond to AGC’s letter of 23 February 2018 in relation to her payment obligations under the costs orders, which amounts to improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Act.\n\nAn Alternative Third Charge referencing section 83(2)(h) of the Act was also formulated.\n\nFindings by the DT\n\nPrior to the proceedings by the DT proper, the Respondent made payment for the outstanding amount. However, the AGC stated that it wished to proceed with the matter.\n\nThe DT noted that the final payment for the costs were made some three years after the orders were made and it was the Respondent who had sought the AGC’s indulgence to settle the costs orders along with the proposed quantum and timing for the instalments. Thereafter, she repeatedly failed to honour the payment schedules as agreed between her and the AGC, and as a result the AGC had to chase for the overdue payments and repeatedly remind her of her obligations. Further, it was only after AGC had referred the matter to the Society that the Respondent decided to make the final payment.\n\nTo this end, the Respondent was not able to provide any satisfactory explanation as to why she could not have responded to AGC’s letter dated 23 February 2018 or why she could not have paid that amount. Her dilatory conduct in failing to comply with the costs orders within a reasonable time and without out any reasonable explanation goes against the “interest of the judicial administration of justice”. Accordingly, the DT found the Respondent guilty of the First Charge and Second Charge.\n\nFor the Third Charge, the DT noted that between 13 April 2015 and 22 February 2018, the Respondent had failed to respond to approximately 14 letters from the AGC in relation to the costs orders, including the letter dated 23 February 2018 which was the final chaser from the AGC and she was not able to provide any satisfactory explanation as to why she could not have done so. As such, the DT found her guilty of the Third Charge.\n\nGiven the said circumstances, the DT had determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Act that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be reprimanded. The DT made no order as to costs.\n\nThe Council’s Decision\n\nPursuant to section 94(3)(a) of the Act, the Council of the Society agreed with the determination of the DT and reprimanded the Respondent.\n","timestamp":"2020-07-06T06:00:09+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jul-2020/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Chan Chun Hwee Allan Advocate & Solicitor","html":"<p><strong>In the Matter of Chan Chun Hwee Allan</strong><br>\n<strong>Advocate &amp; Solicitor</strong></p>\n<p>The Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) has determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (<strong>the Act</strong>) that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be ordered to pay a penalty of $5,000.</p>\n<p>The disciplinary proceedings were brought by the Law Society against the Respondent for breach of ethical and professional standards that were expected of the Respondent as an advocate and solicitor.

As the funds in question had properly been deposited into a client account initially, the accountant was able to highlight issues with the accounts that led to the breaches being discovered and rectified.

The aforementioned Accountant’s Report showed that the Respondent’s Firm’s client account was overdrawn and the accountant could not verify with supporting documents (such as bills, disbursement schedules or other authorisation documents) transfers from the Firm’s client account to its office account for payment of legal fees in respect of six cases, as well as a general journal entry. These issues raised by the accountant in the said Account Report revealed several breaches of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Account) Rules (‘SAR’), and the said breaches formed the substance of the five charges preferred against the Respondent.\n\nThe following charges were preferred against the Respondent:\n\n1st Charge\n\n“You, Kangatharan Kandavellu, being an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, on or about 30 June 2014, withdrew a total sum of $36,328.26 from the Clients Account of KANGA & CO which exceeded the sum of $11,078.65 being the total of the money held at the material time in the said Clients Account and in so doing you have thereby breached Rule 7(2) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).”\n\n2nd Charge\n\n“You, Kangatharan Kandavellu, being an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, on or about 31 December 2014, withdrew a total sum of $53,520.70 from the Clients Account of KANGA & CO which exceeded the sum of $28,270.99 being the total of the of the money held at the material time in the said Clients Account and in so doing you have thereby breached Rule 7(2) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).”\n\n3rd Charge\n\n“You, Kangatharan Kandavellu, being an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, failed to keep proper accounting records for the accounting period of 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, namely, records of payment of $10,000.00, $11,200.00, $6,000.00, $8,000.00, $3,500.00 and $1,400.00 into the Clients Account of KANGA & CO and in so doing you have thereby breached Rule 11(1) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).”\n\n4th Charge\n\n“You, Kangatharan Kandavellu, being an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, failed to keep a record of all bills of costs (distinguishing between profit costs and disbursements) and of all written intimations under Rule 7(1)(a)(iv) and 9(2)(c)(i) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules delivered or made by your clients for the accounting period of 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014, namely, your bills of costs for $11,200.00 which sum was withdrawn on or around 21 February 2014 and in so doing you have thereby breached Rule 11(3) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).”\n\n5th Charge\n\n“You, Kangatharan Kandavellu, being an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Singapore, failed to conduct monthly reconciliation of the balance of your clients’ cash books with your clients’ bank statements and to keep a statement showing the reconciliation for the months of June 2014 and December 2014, and you have thereby breached Rule 11(4) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and are guilty of grossly improper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Chapter 161).”\n\nAdditionally, five alternative charges were tendered against the Respondent citing section 83(2)(h) of the Act for misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession.\n\nFindings and Determination of the DT\n\nThe Respondent pleaded guilty to the five alternative charges at the onset of the proceedings.\n\nThe DT agreed with the Society’s Counsel that the breaches of Rules 7 and Rule 11 of the SAR in the present case could be seen as less serious than a failure to deposit client’s money into a client account, in contravention of Rule 3 of the SAR. As the funds in question had properly been deposited into a client account initially, the accountant was able to highlight issues with the accounts that led to the breaches being discovered and rectified. Furthermore, the Respondent had neither been fraudulent nor dishonest and the breaches did not lead to a permanent loss to any client.\n\nIn Law Society of Singapore v Tay Choon Leng John [2012] 3 SLR 150, the DT noted that where dishonesty or deceit on the solicitor’s part was not made out, the starting point should be a monetary penalty. Whilst the sum of $15,000 imposed in Tay Choon Leng John was related to a more serious breach of Rule 3 of the SAR, the client account in the present matter was overdrawn to a greater extent.

Further, pursuant to section 93(2) of the Act, the DT ordered the Respondent to pay the Society costs of $3,000 plus reasonable disbursements.\n\nThe Council’s Decision\n\nPursuant to section 94(3)(a) of the Act, the Council of the Society agreed with the findings of the DT and ordered the Respondent to pay a penalty of $2,500.\n\n\n","timestamp":"2020-06-06T06:00:04+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/dtr-jun-2020/"},{"title":"In the Matter of Yeo Kan Kiang Roy Advocate and Solicitor","html":"<p><strong>In the Matter of Yeo Kan Kiang Roy</strong><br>\n<strong>Advocate and Solicitor</strong></p>\n<p>The Disciplinary Tribunal (<strong>DT</strong>) had determined pursuant to section 93(1)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (<strong>the Act</strong>) that whilst no cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under section 83 of the Act, the Respondent should be reprimanded.</p>\n<p>The proceedings against the Respondent arose out of his failure to keep the client’s daughter/Complainant informed of matters concerning his High Court Suit of various matters in the client’s High Court Suit and his subsequent discharge from the matter.

The\nRespondent is Mr Lee’s daughter-in-law, and she is married to the\nyoungest of Mr Lee's three children, Mr Lee Hsien Yang (“Mr LHY”).\nThe Last Will increased Mr LHY’s share in Mr Lee's estate (the\n“Estate”), as compared with Mr Lee’s immediate preceding will.\nThe Respondent is an advocate and solicitor of 37 years’ standing.\nShe is the founder of Stamford Law Corporation (‘Stamford Law’),\nnow Morgan Lewis Stamford LLC (‘MLS’), and was its Senior\nDirector at the material time. She is currently a director of MLS.\nOn 13 February 2019, the Honourable Chief Justice appointed this\nDisciplinary Tribunal (the “Tribunal’) to hear and investigate the\nmatter.\n\nThe Charges against the Respondent\n\nThe Law Society preferred two primary charges against the\nRespondent. These are brought on the ground of grossly improper\nconduct under section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n2009 Rev Ed) (the “LPA’), read with the Legal Profession\n(Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap. 161, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) (the\n“PCR’). Alternative and further alternative charges were also\n\n\fformulated,\n\nof the two primary charges\n\nfor each\n\n(collectively the\n\n“Charges”). The Charges are:\nFirst Charge\n\nThat\n\nyou,\n\nMrs\n\nLee\n\nSuet\n\nFern\n\n(Lim\n\nSuet\n\nFern),\n\nare\n\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule\n25(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules (Cap. 161, R14, 2010 Rev Ed) in that you failed to\nadvance your client's interest unaffected by your interest\nand/or the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang,\nby preparing and arranging for the execution of your\nclient's will where a one-third share in ‘your client's\nestate was to be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, such act amounting to grossly improper conduct\nin the discharge of your professional duty within the\nmeaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap.\n161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(‘Charge 1”)\nOR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE\n\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule\n25(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct)\nRules (Cap. 161, R1, 2010 Rev Ed) in that you failed to\nadvance your client's interest unaffected by your interest\n\nand/or the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang,\n\nby preparing and arranging for the execution of your\nclient's will where a one-third share in your client’s\nestate was to be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, such act amounting to improper conduct or\npractice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning\nof s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).\n\n\f(‘Charge 1A’)\nOR, IN THE FURTHER ALTERNATIVE\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n\n2013, you failed to advance Mr Lee Kuan Yew's interest\n\nunaffected by your interest and/or the interest of your\nhusband,\n\nMr\n\nLee\n\nHsien\n\nYang,\n\nby\n\npreparing\n\nand\n\narranging for the execution of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s will\nwhere a one-third share in Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s estate\nwas to be given to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang,\nsuch act amounting to misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\nCourt\n\nor as a member\n\nof an\n\nhonourable\n\nprofession\n\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\nAct (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Eq).\n(‘Charge 1B”)\nSecond Charge\n\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\n\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 46 of the Legal\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap. 161,R1,\n2010 Rev Ed) by acting in respect of a significant gift (a\none-third share in your client's estate) that your client\nintended to give by will to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, and failing to advise your client to be\nindependently advised in respect of this significant gift,\nsuch acts amounting to grossly improper conduct in the\ndischarge of your professional duty within the meaning\nof s 83(2)(b) af the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161, 2009\nRev Ed).\n(“Charge 2\")\nOR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE\n\n\fThat\n\nyou,\n\nMrs\n\nLee\n\nSuet\n\nFern\n\n(Lim\n\nSuet\n\nFern),\n\nare\n\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, during the course of your retainer for your client,\nMr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule 46 of the Legal\n\nProfession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap, 161, R1,\n2010 Rev Ed) by acting in respect of a significant gift (a\none-third share in your client’s estate) that your client\n\nintended to give by will to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien\nYang, and failing to advise your client to be\nindependently advised in respect of this significant gift,\nsuch act amounting to improper conduct or practice as\nan\n\nadvocate\n\nand\n\nsolicitor\n\nwithin\n\nthe\n\nmeaning\n\n83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap.\nRev Ed).\n\nof s\n\n161, 2009\n\n(‘Charge 2A”)\nOR, IN THE FURTHER ALTERNATIVE\nThat you, Mrs Lee Suet Fern (Lim Suet Fern), are\ncharged that, sometime between 16 and 17 December\n2013, by acting in respect of a significant gift (a one-third\nshare in Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s estate) that Mr Lee Kuan\nYew intended to give by will to your husband, Mr Lee\nHsien Yang, and failing to advise Mr Lee Kuan Yew to\nbe independently advised in respect of this significant\ngift, such\nadvocate\n\nact amounting to misconduct unbefitting an\nand solicitor as an officer of the Supreme\n\nCourt or as a member of an honourable profession\nwithin the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\nAct (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).\n(‘Charge 2B\")\n\nThe Respondent has defined the first primary Charge as “Charge 1\",\nand the alternative first Charge and further alternative first Charge as\n“Charge 1A” and “Charge 1B” respectively. Similarly, the second\nprimary Charge has been defined as “Charge 2”, and the alternative\nsecond Charge and further alternative second Charge as “Charge 2A”\n\n\fand “Charge\ndefinitions.\n\n2B”\n\nrespectively.\n\nThe\n\nTribunal\n\nwill\n\nadopt\n\nthese\n\nAs would be apparent, each of the alternative and further alternative\n\nCharges are premised on the same conduct, as their corresponding\nprimary Charges. However:\n(a)\n\nThe primary Charges (Charges 1 and 2) are premised on the\nconduct in question being grossly improper conduct, as\ndefined in section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n(b)\n\nThe alternative Charges (Charges 1A and 2A) are brought on\nthe alternative ground in section 83(2)(b) of the LPA\n(‘improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor’).\n\n(c)\n\nThe further alternative Charges (Charges 1B and 2B) are\nunlike their respective primary and alternative Charges, in that\n(i) they\n\nare\n\nnot\n\npremised\n\non\n\nthe\n\nexistence\n\nof a retainer\n\nbetween the Respondent and Mr Lee, and (ii) they are brought\nunder section 83(2)(h) of the LPA (“misconduct unbefitting an\nadvocate and solicitor’).\nThe Respondent pleaded not guilty to all the Charges. Proceedings\nbefore the Disciplinary Tribunals are quasi-criminal in nature. This\n\nmeans that the Law Society has to prove\nRespondent beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nits case\n\nagainst the\n\nBackground\n\nWe will first set out briefly the undisputed background facts. We will,\nwhere necessary, also refer to emails and other documents. The\nrespective parties’ evidence and positions will be considered, as\nappropriate, when we set out our views.\n\n\f(A)\n\nThe relevant parties\n\n10.\n\nMr Lee was the first Prime Minister of Singapore, and served in that\nrole from 1959 to 1990. Subsequently, he served as Senior Minister,\nand thereafter Minister Mentor.\n\n11.\n\nOther than Mr LHY, Mr Lee’s two other children (in order of age) are\nMr Lee Hsien Loong (“Mr LHL”) and Dr Lee Wei Ling (\"Dr LWL\").\n\n12.\n\nMr Lee’s wife, Mdm\nThereafter,\n\nand\n\nKwa Geok Choo, passed away in October 2010.\nbefore the Last Will in December 2013, Mr Lee\n\nexecuted six other wills (the “First Will” to the “Sixth Will” or\n“Penultimate Wil”). Ms Kwa Kim Li (“Ms KKL”), a partner in the law\nfirm Lee & Lee, prepared all these six Wills for Mr Lee.\n13.\n\nMr Lee was 90 years old when he signed the Last Will in December\n\n2013. He passed away in March 2015.\n\n(B)\n\nMr Lee’s First to Sixth Wills\n\n14.\n\nMr Lee’s First to Sixth Wills were executed on the following dates:\n\n(a) _ First Will - 20 August 2011;\n(b)\n\nSecond Wil! = 24 December 2011;\n\n(c)\n\nThird Will ~ 6 September 2012;\n\n(d)\n\nFourth Will - 20 September 2012;\n\n(e)\n\nFifth Will - 4 October 2012; and\n\n\f(f)\n\nSixth (or Penultimate) Will — 2 November 2012.\n\n15.\n\nMs KKL retained the originals of ail six Wills‘.\n\n(C)\n\nMr Lee’s First Will\n\n16.\n\nMr Lee executed his First Will on 20 August 2011. It is not in dispute\nthat this First Will was drafted by Ms KKL. It is also not in dispute that\nthe Respondent made some drafting suggestions to Ms KKL, with Mr\nLee's approval, on the First Will. At the time, there had been\ndiscussions between Mr Lee and his three children, Mr LHL, Dr LWL\n\nand Mr LHY, regarding the future of Mr Lee’s residence at 38 Oxley\nRoad (“38 Oxley’). These discussions sometimes included Mr Lee's\ndaughters-in-law, namely the Respondent and Ms Ho Ching.\n\n17.\n\nOn 17 August 2011, the Respondent emailed Mr Lee, with Mr LHY\n\nand Dr LWL in copy, with a draft of a passage to be included in Mr\nLee's First Will?. Mr Lee then instructed Ms KKL to include the portion\ndrafted by the Respondent in his First Will>.\n18.\n\nOn 19 August 2011, at 11.06pm, the Respondent\nand Ms KKL,\n\nemailed Mr Lee\n\nattaching a document titled “WILL-LKY — Draft of 19\n\nAugust 2011 — v3.DOC’4, The document contained additional edits\nthat the Respondent had made to the draft. The changes made to the\n\ndraft document were marked up. This was the final draft of the First\nWill, which Mr Lee executed the following day, on 20 August 201 18.\n+ See paragraph 266 of this Decision.\n\n2 Law Society's Bundle of Documents (“LSS BOD\"), Vol 4, p 91, email from the Respondent to Mr Lee,\nMr LHY and Dr LWL dated 17 August 2011, 11.21pm.\n3 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 91, email from Mr Lee to the Respondent, Ms KKL, Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 17\nAugust 2011, 11.23pm.\n4 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 101 — 108, email from the Respondent to Ms KKL and Mr Lee dated 19 August\n2011, 11:06pm, with the attachment “WILL-LKY — Draft of 19 August 2011 - v3.DO0C\".\n3 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 107 — 112, First Will executed by Mr Lee on 20 August 2011.\n\n\f(D)\n\nMr Lee's subsequent changes to his Wills\n\n19.\n\nSubsequently, Mr Lee executed five further wills before the Last Will.\nSome\n\nof the\n\ndifferences\n\nbetween\n\nMr\n\nLee’s\n\nFirst to\n\nSixth\n\nWills\n\nconcerned the following areas:\n(a)\n\n(bo)\n\nWhat shares in the Estate each child would receive;\n\n| Whether the Will contained a Demolition Clause (setting out\nMr Lee's wishes for his residence at 38 Oxley to be\ndemolished after his passing) and, if so, which of two versions\nof the Demolition Clause; and\n\n(c)\n\n| Whether Dr LWL was to be given a\nafter Mr Lee’s passing and, if so:\n(i)\n\nright to reside at 38 Oxley\n\n| Whether Dr LWL'’s right to reside at 38 Oxley was (A)\nstated to be free of rent; and/or (B) subject to Mr LHL’s\nconsent; and\n\nii}\n\nWhether Mr LHL was to pay for the upkeep of 38 Oxley,\nfor as long as Dr LWL stayed there.\n\nA table setting out these differences is at Annex A®.\n20.\n\nSome of the changes in the Wills were as follows:\n(a)\n\nIn the Second Will, the clause granting Dr LWL a right to reside\nin 38 Oxley was removed;\n\n® The Wills are in LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 264 - 289.\n\n\f(b) — In the Third Will, Dr LWL was granted a\n\nlife interest in the\n\nEstate in place of the one-third share she had been given in\nthe First and Second Wills;\n\n(c)\n\nIn the Fourth Will, the distribution of the Estate in equal shares\nwas restored;\n\n(d)\n\nInthe Fifth Will, a right to reside at 38 Oxley was granted again\nto Dr LWL. The Demolition Clause (relating to the demolition\nof 38 Oxley) was removed; and\n\n(e)\n\nIn the Sixth (or Penultimate) Will, the shares that Mr Lee’s\nchildren would receive upon his death were amended, such\nthat there was a total of seven shares. Mr LHL and Mr LHY\neach received two shares, whilst Dr LWL received three\nshares (one share more than each of her brothers).\n\n21.\n\nAll of Mr Lee's First to Sixth Wills contained a gift-over clause, which\nmade provision for the scenarios where any of Mr Lee's children\npredeceased him. The same gift-over clause was included in all of\nthese wills, save for the Third Will (which granted Dr LWL only a life\ninterest in the Estate), wherein the gift-over clause was amended to\nprovide that if Or LWL pre-deceased Mr Lee, her share in the Estate\nwould lapse. (See Annex A.)\n\n(E)\n\nMr Lee’s Sixth (or Penultimate) Will\n\n22.\n\nAs stated above, Mr Lee’s Sixth (or Penultimate) Will, which was\nsigned slightly over a year before the Last Will, gave Dr LWL an extra\nshare in the Estate.\n\n23.\n\nThis appears to be the only difference between the Fifth and Sixth\nWills. Like Mr Lee’s Fifth Will, the Sixth Will did not contain any\n\n\fDemolition Clause, and Dr LWL’s right to reside at 38 Oxley was\nmade subject to Mr LHL’s consent.\n24,\n\nThus, the position as of the Sixth Will was that (a) Mr Lee did not want\nto include the Demolition Clause for 38 Oxley, and (b) Dr LWL’s right\nto reside at 38 Oxley was made subject to Mr LHL's consent.\n\n25.\n\nOn Mr Lee’s instructions, both the Fifth and Sixth Wills also expressly\nstated that Dr LWL's right to reside at 38 Oxley did not give Dr LWL\na life interest in the property.\n\n26.\n\nThe Last Will made significant changes to the Sixth Will in respect of\nthe shares that each child would receive. A Demolition Clause was\n\nadded. There were also other changes (these will be dealt with later).\n\n(F)\n\nEvents preceding the Last Will\n\n27,\n\nIn 2013,\n\nMr Lee’s\n\nhealth\n\nBetween\n\ndeteriorated.\n\nSeptember\n\nand\n\nOctober 2013, Mr Lee was hospitalised for an extended period, over\nseveral weeks, due to a number of different medical issues. These\nincluded pneumonia,\n\natrial fibrillation, and transient ischemic attack\n\n(or mini strokes)’.\n28.\n\nThe\n\ndocumentary\n\nevidence,\n\nand\n\nin\n\nparticular,\n\nthe\n\nemail\n\ncorrespondence between Ms KKL and Mr Lee, shows that sometime\naround 30 November 2013 (17 days prior to Mr Lee signing his Last\n\nWill), Mr Lee had asked Ms KKL about his Sixth (or Penultimate) Will.\nIt is apparent that Ms KKL envisaged that Mr Lee would make\n7 Itwas the Respondent's own case before the Tribunal that Mr Lee had been in and out of the hospital\nin September and October 2013.\nSee Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 23, 24; Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August\n2019) at para 11; Counsel for the Law Society canfirmed that they were not challenging Mr LHY's\nevidence on the issue. See Transcripts, 4 July 2019, Page 147 line 7 to line 5 (hereinafter the notation\nused will be: “Transcripts (4 July 2019), 147:1-5\").\n\n10\n\n\famendments or changes to the Sixth Will. Mrs KKL sent an email of\n30 November 2013? and the final line of her email to Mr Lee read:\n“Please let me know your thoughts, and | can make the appropriate\n\nchanges to the Will’. The last email exchange between Mr Lee and\nMs KKL, on his will, during this period was on 13 December 20139.\n\n29.\n\nThe upshot of the discussions between Mr Lee and Ms KKL was that,\nas of 13 December 2013, Mr Lee instructed Ms KKL to make two\n\nchanges, through a codicil, to the Sixth (or Penultimate) Will: (a) first,\nto give his three children equal shares in his Estate; and (b) second,\nto bequeath two carpets (one silk and the other wool) to Mr LHY. Thus,\nas of four days before the Last Will was signed on 17 December 2013,\nMr Lee's decision was to keep to the terms of his Penultimate Will,\n\nwith the above two changes to be made, and these changes were to\nbe made through a codicil.\n\n(@)\n\nThe Last Will\n\n30.\n\nIn the evening of 16 December 2013, at 7.08pm, the Respondent sent\n\nMr Lee a draft of what-eventually became the Last Will. The\ncircumstances in which the Respondent came to send this draft to Mr\nLee are discussed in Section VIII(B) below. The Respondent's\nposition\" is that Mr Lee independently decided that he would make\nthe Last Will, the terms of which were substantially different from what\nhe had discussed with Ms KKL, three days earlier (see paragraphs\n\n28 - 29 above).\n\n® LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 162 — 163, email from Ms KKL to Mr Lee dated 30 November 2013, 11.25am.\n\n® LSS BOD, Vol 1, 189, email from Mr Lee to Ms KKL dated 13 December 2013, 10.50pm.\n19 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 76.\n\n11\n\n\f31.\n\nttis not disputed that both the Respondent and Mr LHY were aware,\nwhen the Respondent's email was sent, that Ms KKL was likely to be\n\ntravelling, and might not respond\".\n32,\n\nThe Respondent’s email of 7.08pm on 16 December 2013 stated as\n\nfollows\":\n“Dear Pa Pa\n\nThis was the original agreed Will which ensures that all 3 children\nreceive equal shares, taking into account the relative valuations (as\nat the date of demise) of the properties each receives.\n\nKim Li\nGrateful if you could please engross.\nKind regards\nFern”\n33.\n\nParties are agreed that the Respondent intended, by the phrase\n“original agreed Will’, to refer Mr Lee’s First Will (signed in August\n2011), and that the phrase would have been understood by Mr Lee\nas such.\n\n34,\n\nHowever, the draft which the Respondent attached was not the First\nWill. The draft which the Respondent sent to Mr Lee differed from the\nFirst Will in the following main respects:\n\n41 Transcript (3 July 2019), 86:7-11; Transcript (4 July 2019), 132:34 - 133:31; Transcript (6 July 2019),\n4:20-32.\n12LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 174, email from the Respondent to Mr Lee, Mr LHY and Ms KKL dated 16\n¥\nDecember 2013, 7.08pm.\n12\n\n\f(a)\n\nFirst, the\n\nFirst Will contained\n\na gift-over\n\nclause.\n\nThis was\n\nmissing from the draft.\n\n(b)\n\n| Second, the First Will made provision for Mr LHL to pay for the\nupkeep of 38 Oxley while Dr LWL was in occupation. This was\nalso missing from the draft.\n\n(See Annex B for a detailed comparison.)\n\n35.\n\nIt is not in dispute that what the Respondent told Mr Lee (“This was\n\nthe original agreed Will...\") is not accurate’. It is also not in dispute\nthat Mr Lee was\n\nentitled to, and would\n\nhave\n\nrelied\n\non, what the\n\nRespondent had told him\"*, The draft which the Respondent sent to\nMr Lee (in addition to being different from the First Will) was also\ndifferent from the Sixth (or Penultimate) Will in the following ways:\n(a)\n\nAs the Respondent’s email indicated, the draft gave Mr Lee's\nthree children equal shares in his estate. The Penultimate Will\nhad\n\ngiven\n\nDr\n\nLWL\n\nan\n\nextra\n\nshare,\n\ncompared\n\nto her two\n\nbrothers.\n\n(b)\n\nIn addition, the draft reinserted a version of the Demolition\nClause. This was not in the Penultimate Will.\n\n(c)\n\nThe draft also gave Dr LWL an unfettered right to stay at 38\nOxley. In the Penultimate Will, this was conditional upon Mr\nLHL’s consent.\n\n(d)\n\nFinally, the draft removed the gift-over clause which was in the\nPenultimate Will (and which was also in Mr Lee's First to Fifth\nWills (see paragraph 21 above)).\n\n13 Transcript (3 July 2019), 20:8-12; 28:1-4; see also Annex B.\n14 Transcript (3 July 2019), 30:30 — 31:8.\n13\n\n\f(See Annex C for a detailed comparison.)\n\n36.\n\nThe Last Will, signed on 17 December 2013, was in the same terms\n\nas the draft that the Respondent sent to Mr Lee on 16 December\n2013. it is not in dispute that other than the change in shares, the\ndifferences between the Penultimate Will and the Last Will were not\nbrought to Mr Lee’s attention (see also paragraphs 534 - 544 below).\nIt is also not in dispute that the Last Will did not incorporate the\nsecond change that Mr Lee had wanted to make to his Penultimate\n\nWill (see paragraph 29 above), which he had discussed with Ms KKL.\n\n37. Thus, the Last Will was substantially different from what Mr Lee had\nwanted, when he had jast discussed and agreed (with Ms KKL) on\namendments to his Penultimate Will, four days earlier on 13\n\nDecember 2013 (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above)'®. Mr Lee had\nthen decided, as of 13 December 2013, to keep his Penultimate Will\n\nintact, with only the two changes (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above)\nto be made by way of a codicil.\n38.\n\nThe Respondent then spoke to Mr Bernard Lui (\"Mr BL’), a partner\nfrom her law firm (Stamford Law), to brief him about the Last Will, and\n\nrequest his assistance with its engrossment and witnessing’®.\n\n46 The final email exchange between Mr Lee and Ms KKL was on 13 December 2013 (see paragraphs\n28 and 29 of this Decision}. The Respondent sent the draft Last Will to Mr Lee on 15 December 2013\n\n(which was 3 days after 13 December 2013), and Mr Lee signed it (the Last Will) on 17 December 2013\n(which was four days after 13 December 2013). The Tribunal will refer to the events of 16 and 17\nDecember 2013 as taking place three to four days after the discussions between Mr Lee and Ms KKL.\n(on 13 December 2013), as appropriate.\n\n18 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 41-43; the Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 19.\n\n14\n\n\f39.\n\nAt 7.31pm, after the Respondent spoke to Mr BL, Mr LHY replied to\nthe email the Respondent had sent. Mr LHY's email was addressed\nto Mr Lee, and read’”:\n\n‘Pa\n| couldn't get in touch with Kim Li. | believe she is away. | don’t think\nit is wise to wait till she is back. | think all you need is a witness to\nsign the will.

(Apart from Mr Lee and\nMr LHY, only the Respondent and Ms WLH were copied.) Thereafter,\nMs KKL was not copied on subsequent email exchanges leading up\nto the execution of the Last Will.\n\n40. The Respondent emailed Ms WLH, Mr LHY and Mr BL at 8.12pm’.\nThe Respondent said that she introduced Mr BL to Mr LHY and Ms\n\nWLH through this email?°.

Do not wait for Kim Li.\n\nEngross and | will sign it before a solicitor in Fern’s office, or from\nany other office.”\n42,\n\nVarious emails were then exchanged, regarding Mr Lee’s execution\nof the Last Will. The parties to these emails included the Respondent,\nMr LHY, Ms WLH and/or Mr BL.\n\n43.\n\nAt the time of these exchanges, the Respondent and Mr LHY were\n\nrespectively en route to, or in Paris and Australia.\n\n44,\n\nAt 4.53am on 17 December 2013, Mr LHY replied to Mr Lee’s email\n\n(see paragraph 41 above)”2. He informed Mr Lee:\n“We will get someone to come to execute if either in Oxley Road or\nat your office at your convenience. Lin Hoe has the contacts and will\narrange it.

Mr LHY\nrequested that Mr BL engross a copy of the will, as Mr Lee wished to\nhave it executed. He asked that Mr BL be available, when Ms WLH\ngot in touch.

However, Mr LHY appears not\nto have been copied in this email from the Respondent.

This is borne out by the fact that Ms WLH emailed Mr Lee\n\nat 10.17am* (with the Respondent,\n\nMr LHY and Dr LWL\n\nbeing\n\ncopied), to inform Mr Lee that Mr BL and Ms Elizabeth Kong (“Ms EK”)\n(another lawyer from the Respondent's law firm, Stamford Law),\nwould be seeing Mr Lee at his residence at 11am.

This was in accordance with what\nMr Lee had previously discussed with Ms KKL (see paragraphs 28\nand 29 above).\n72.\n\nThe next day, Ms WLH emailed the Respondent, attaching a copy of\nthe Codicil®. Ms WLH’s email was sent as a follow-on, to an earlier\nchain of emails on 16 and 17 December 2013, regarding the Last Will.\n\n59 LSS BOD, Vol 4, p 229, Codicil executed by Mr Lee on 2 January 2014.\n\n® LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 230, email from Ms WLH to the Respondent, Mr Lee, Mr LHL, Mr LHY, Dr LL,\nMs Ho Ching and Ms KKL dated 3 January 2074, 10.30am.\n25\n\n\f73.\n\nMs WLH's email stated as follows:\n“Dear Mrs Lee,\n\nFurther to our emails below, attached is a copy of Mr Lee’s\ncodicil for your information.\nAs instructed by Mr Lee, we will retain the original copy of Mr\nLee’s fast Will & Testament and the Codicil in my office for\n\nsafekeeping, and send a copy to Ms Kwa Kim Li for her record.\nThank you.\n\nRegards\nLin Hoe”\n\n74.\n\nMrLee, Mr LHL and his spouse (Ms Ho Ching), Dr LWL, Mr LHY, and\nMs KKL, were also copied in Ms WLH's email.\n\n()\n\nMr Lee’s passing\n\n75.\n\nMr Lee passed away on 23 March 2015. Mr LHY and Dr LWL\n(collectively, the \"Executors\") were appointed the executors of the\nEstate, in accordance with the terms of his Last Will.\n\nIV.\n\nProcedural History\n\n(A)\n\nAGC referral\n\n76.\n\nThe disciplinary process was commenced following a complaint filed\nby Deputy Attorney-General, on 4 December 2018 (the “AGC\nstated that the\nAttorney-General\nDeputy\nThe\nComplaint”).\n\n26\n\n\fRespondent may have “potentially breached Rules 25 and 46\" of the\n\nPGR in force at the material time®. The Complaint (hereafter referred\nto as the “AGC Complaint”) was made pursuant to section 85(3) of\nthe LPA, and contained a request that the Council of the Law Society\n(the “Council”) refer the matter to a Disciplinary Tribunal. Section 85(3)\nof the LPA obliged the Council to do so.\n\n77.\n\nThe Law Society filed its Statement of Case on 1 February 2019. The\nDisciplinary Tribunal Secretariat (the “Secretariat”) served the\nRespondent the Notice of Disciplinary Tribunal Proceedings, along\nwith the AGC Complaint and the Statement of Case, on 19 February\n\n2019.\n\nThe\n\nDefence\n\nwas\n\nfiled on\n\n10 April 2019.\n\nA Pre-Hearing\n\nConference was first fixed on 8 May 2019.\n78.\n\nThe Law Society wrote on 16 April 2019, seeking for directions from\nthe Tribunal. By way of its Submissions on 23 April 2019, the Law\n\nSociety sought: (a) further discovery of documents from the\nRespondent; and (b) directions from the Tribunal on the question of\nconfidentiality of the proceedings. The latter aspect of the Law\nSociety's application arose from various Facebook posts that were\n\nmade by Mr LHY and Dr LWL, about the proceedings before this\nTribunal.\n79.\n\nMr LHY\n\nposts, relating to these\nand referring to documents which were filed in these\n\nand Dr LWL\n\nproceedings,\n\nhad\n\nmade\n\nFacebook\n\nproceedings® (see also paragraphs 486 - 496 below). They appear\nto have been given documents from these proceedings,\n\nand were\n\nmaking public statements about them. These proceedings are (by law)\nconfidential until the matter is disposed of. The Respondent filed\n\nWritten Submissions on these issues, on 26 April 2019°.\n\nAfter\n\n1 LSS BOD, Vol 2, p 803, AGC Complaint.\n82 LSS BOD, Vol 2, p 1336 - 1341.\n\n®3 Respondent's Skeletal Written Submissions dated 26 April 2019.\n27\n\n\fhearing\n\nCounsel\n\nfor both\n\nparties,\n\nthe Tribunal\n\nno order in\n\nmade\n\nrelation to the Law Society's application for further discovery of\ndocuments. While we considered the documents to be relevant, we\nmade no order because it was not clear to us that a Disciplinary\nTribunal had the powers to order discovery. We told the Law Society\nthat it had other means to seek production of the documents. On the\nquestion of confidentiality, parties were directed to desist from\ndisclosing\n\ndetails\n\nand/or\n\ndocuments\n\nrelated\n\nto the\n\nproceedings,\n\nexcept to the relevant witnesses, and that there should be no public\n\nstatements. The Tribunal also fixed the timetable for parties to file\ntheir respective Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC’s), and fixed 4\n5-day evidentiary hearing (\"Hearing\") from 1 to 5 July 2019.\n80.\n\nParties had been directed to exchange their AEICs on 10 June 2019.\nThe Law Society filed and exchanged the AEIC of Mr K Gopalan (“Mr\nGopalan’s Affidavit’). The Respondent filed and exchanged the\nRespondent's\n\nAEIC\n\n(the\n\n“Respondent's\n\nAffidavit\")\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nLHY’s\n\nAEIC (“Mr LHY’s Affidavit’).\n81.\n\nMr Gopalan’s Affidavit enclosed various documents. The Respondent\n\ntook objections to the documents being in evidence. The Tribunal\ndirected parties to state their position by letter, and received the\nfollowing letters: (a) a letter dated 11 June 2019 from solicitors for the\nRespondent, Providence Law Asia LLC (“Providence Law’); (b) a\nletter dated\n\n12\n\nJune\n\n2019\n\nfrom\n\nsolicitors\n\nfor ihe\n\nLaw\n\nSociety\n\n(‘WongPartnership”); (c) a letter dated 13 June 2019 from Providence\nLaw; and (d) a letter dated 17 June 2019 from WongPartnership.\n82.\n\nHaving considered the parties’ positions, the Tribunal directed that it\nwould allow the Law Society to rely on Mr Gopalan’s Affidavit at the\nHearing. The Tribunal also indicated that the parties would be at\nliberty to make any submission(s), in Closing (including on\nadmissibility), on the evidence adduced by the other party.\n\n28\n\n\f83.\n\nOn 24 June 2019, the Law Society informed the Tribunal and the\n\nRespondent,\n\nthat it had\n\nissued\n\na subpoena\n\nfor Mr BL,\n\nto give\n\nevidence before the Tribunal. Mr BL was the Respondent's colleague\n\nat MLS, and (as stated earlier) was her colleague at Stamford Law,\nat the time the Last Will was executed. Mr BL had attended the\nexecution of the Last Will, and had signed as a witness to the same.\n84,\n\nAfter the subpoena was issued, Mr BL's Affidavit, giving his evidence\non the material events, was filed. Documents were produced by Mr\nBL (the “BL Documents”), and annexed to Mr BL's Affidavit. and put\n\nin evidence. This was done on 1 July 2019, about three weeks after\nthe parties had (on 10 June 2019), exchanged AEICs.\n\n(B)\n\nOriginating Summons 639 of 2019 (“OS 639\")\n\n85.\n\nOn 17 May 2019, an application was brought in the High Court by the\nEstate by way of OS 639. The Executors of the Estate (as stated\nearlier) were Mr LHY and Dr LWL. The documents which were the\nsubject of OS 639 were the First to Sixth Wills, the Last Will and the\n\nCodicil thereto, and all drafts of these wills (see also paragraph 143\nbelow). These were the documents\n\nnumbered\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8\n\nand 9 in the Law Society's Notice te Admit Hearsay Evidence, dated\n\n24 June 2019 (\"LSS Hearsay Notice”).\n86. The Estate sought, in the main, an injunction against the use of these\ndocuments in the disciplinary proceeding. The basis of the Estate's\napplication was that the documents in question were confidential, and\n\nprotected by legal professional privitege.\n\nLSS Closing Submissions (20 September 2019) at paras 186 - 190 sets out what happened in OS\n639 and how the Executors’ position evolved, The Executors started with a broad objection. But at the\nhearing before Justice Hoo, they offered to disclose the Last Will and narrowed their claims of\nconfidentiality.\n\n29\n\n\f87.\n\nLaw Society accepted that the documents were confidential.\nJustice Hoo, who heard OS 639, noted that the documents were\nalready in the Law Society’s possession. The Estate was not\nasserting privilege to withhold disclosure and the question was\nThe\n\nadmissibility of evidence.\n88.\n\nJustice Hoo held that the Revoked Wills and the draft Last Will were\nprotected by legal advice privilege, and were also confidential. The\nLast Will and Codicil, on the other hand, were no longer protected by\nlegal advice privilege, having been proven in probate. However, the\nLast Will and Codicil remained confidential, save for paragraph 7 of\nthe Last Will, the Demolition Clause, which expressly provided that\nthe clause could be publicly disclosed.\n\n89.\n\nJustice Hoo however declined to grant injunctive relief that the Estate\nsought, on the basis that the interests of justice in disclosure of a third\n\nparty's iniquity prevail over the privilege of a client. Justice Hoo held\nthat\n\n“where\n\na sufficient\n\nconnection\n\ncan\n\nbe\n\ndrawn\n\nbetween\n\nthe\n\nprivileged material and the inquiry before the DT, the [Law Society]\nshould not be unduly constrained in how it conducts its prosecution\nof the DT proceedings’. The argument based on confidentiality also\ndid not succeed. Justice Hoo accordingly dismissed the Estate's\napplication for an injunction restraining the use of Mr Lee's wills and\ndrafts thereof. The Law Society was thus not prevented from relying\non the documents.\n\n(©)\n\nThe Hearing & submissions\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal heard the Law Society’s case on 1 and 2 July 2019.\nAfter the Law Society’s Opening Statement, the Law Society called\nfour witnesses, namely, Mr K Gopalan, and three other witnesses\nwho had been issued with subpoenas. They were: (a) DSP Lim Seng\nChuan, the Commanding Officer of VIP Protection Unit 3 of the Police\n\n30\n\n\fsubpoena issued to Police\nSecurity Command); (b) Mr BL; and (c) Mr Manoj Pillay. Mr Manoj\nPillay was an agent of MLS, who was subpoenaed by the Law Society,\n\nSecurity\n\nCommand\n\n(pursuant\n\nto the\n\nfor emails from the firm's email accounts.\n\nof the Law Society's case on 2 July 2019, the\nRespondent made a submission of no case to answer. The Tribunal\nreceived the following written submissions: the Respondent's\nSkeletal Submissions for No Case to Answer dated 2 July 2019\nclose\n\n91. At the\n\n(\"Respondent’s No Case Submissions’), and the Close of Law\nSociety's Case dated 3 July 2019 (\"Law Society’s Close of Case\nSubmissions’).\n92.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal heard Oral Submissions from Counsel for\n\non 3 July 2019. Having read the Parties’ Written\nSubmissions, and having heard oral arguments from the Parties’\nCounsel, the Tribunal found that the Law Society had established a\nprima facie case against the Respondent, and rejected the\nsubmission of no case to answer. The Respondent then called two\nboth\n\nparties\n\nwitnesses in her Defence, namely, herself, and Mr LHY.\n\n93.\n\nAt the end of the 5-day Hearing, on 5 July 2019, the Tribunal\ndirected parties to provide the Tribunal with Written Closing\nSubmissions. The Respondent was directed to file her Closing\nSubmission on 2 August 2019 and the Law Society was directed to\nfile its Closing Submission four weeks later (on 30 August 2019).\nThe Respondent subsequently asked for an extension of time,\nwhich was granted. The Respondent filed her Closing Submissions\non 16 August 2019 (“Respondent's Closing Submissions”). The Law\nalso asked for an extension of time to file its Closing\nSubmission by 20 September 2019. That request was also granted.\nThe Law Society filed its Closing Submissions on 20 September\n2019 (“Law Society's Closing Submissions”). At the Respondent's\nSociety\n\n31\n\n\frequest, the Tribunal also fixed a half-day hearing for Oral Closing\nSubmissions, on 7 October 2019. The Respondent and the Law\nSociety prepared Skeletal Submissions, to assist the Tribunal at this\nHearing, namely the Respondent's Skeletal Submissions dated 27\nSeptember 2019 (“Respondent's Closing Skeletals’), and the Law\nSociety's Skeletal Submissions dated 5 October 2019 (“Law\nSociety’s Closing Skeletals’).\nPreliminary Issues\n\n94.\n\nBefore dealing with the legal and factual issues that arise from the\nCharges, we will first address three Preliminary Issues that were\nraised by the Respondent.\n\n(A)\n\nJurisdiction\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that the Tribunal does not have the\njurisdiction to hear Charges 1B and 2B. She contended that these\nCharges fall beyond the remit of the AGC Complaint, which is\npremised on the existence of a retainer between the Respondent and\nMr Lee. She advanced this position in her Defence, her No Case\nSubmissions, and her Closing Submissions.\n\n96.\n\nIn support of this argument, the Respondent relies on the cases of\nRe Seah Pong Tshai [1991] 2 SLR(R) 744 (\"Seah Pong Tshai’) and\n\nRe Lim Chor Pee [1990] 2 SLR(R) 117 (“Lim Chor Pee’).\n97.\n\nHaving considered these cases, we are unable to agree that they\nsupport the Respondent's position — either by reason of their facts, or\nas a matter of law.\n\n32\n\n\f98.\n\nSeah Pong Tshai and Lim Chor Pee involved complaints which were\nreferred to an Inquiry Committee, and thereafter culminated in formal\ninvestigations by a Disciplinary Committee (the predecessor of\nDisciplinary Tribunals under the current LPA). in both these cases,\nthe charges were found to be defective because they: (a) went\nbeyond the scope of the complaint, and (b) were not considered by\nthe Inquiry Committee, and therefore fell outside the scope of notice\ngiven by the Inquiry Committee to the lawyer (see Lim Chor Pee at\n[35] and Seah Pong Tshai at [14]).\n\n99.\n\nIn our view, neither of these objections applied on the facts before us.\n\nThe Gravamen of the AGC Complaint\n100.On the former, the cases establish that the charges must reflect the\n\n“gravamen” of the complaint (Seah Pong Tshai at [9]); the “subject\nmatter” of the charges must accord with the complaint (Lim Chor Pee\nat [35]). In other words, if the charge framed is different from the\ncomplaint\n\n“both\n\nin form\n\nin substance’,\n\nand\n\nit will be found\n\nto be\n\ndefective (Seah Pong Tshai at [9}).\n101.We note that this position has been affirmed more recently, by the\nHigh Court, in Law Society of Singapore v Yeo Khirn Hai Alvin [2020]\nSGHC 3 (“Yeo Khim Hai’). The Court held (at [66]) that:\n\n“In my judgment, the following propositions emerge from Seah\nPong Tshai and the case law which I discuss in turn below:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the “matter” that has to be heard and investigated\nby the DT is the complaint, and in a typical case, it is\nassumed that the matter would be the complaint as\nproperly framed by the Law Society in the charge. Put\nanother way, it is assumed that the substance of the\ncomplaint\n\n_will\n\nbe\n\nreflected\n\nin the\n\ncharge,\n\nand_that\n33\n\n\fthe\n\nconstitutes\n\nmatter to be\n\nand_investigated.\n\nheard\n\nWhere the Law Society has erred in framing the charge,\nthen the DT’s determination is liable to be set aside, as\n\n,\n\nit was in Seah Pong Tshai.\n(b)\n\nSecond, the DT has a duty to hear and investigate the\ncomplaint. The DT also has a duty to hear and\ninvestigate the charges. The two duties are not mutually\nexclusive and in fact are complementary to one another,\nin that the expectation must be that the charges reflect\n\nthe gravamen of the complaint and fall within the scope\nof the complaint.”\n{Emphasis added.]\n\n102.The\n\ncorollary to these\n\npropositions\n\nis that a complaint is not and\n\nshould not itself be regarded as a charging document; the two are\ndistinct, albeit related. it is for the Law Society (and not a\ncomplainant) to determine what charges should be brought against a\nrespondent lawyer, taking into account the essence of the complaint\nthat has been made; this reflects the principle of self-regulation set\nout in the LPA (see also Yeo Khirn Hai at [80]). As the cases set out,\n\nwhat is required is not a complete identity between the complaint and\nthe charges,\n\nbut that the charges\n\nencapsulate\n\nthe substance,\n\nor\n\nessence of the complaint.\n103.In Seah Pong Tshai, the complaint was that the respondent lawyer\nrefused\n\nto\n\nrefund\n\nhis\n\nclient\n\na\n\nsum\n\nof\n\n$1,000\n\nwhich\n\nhe\n\nhad\n\nhim was defective, because it\naccused him of something entirely different - that he “falsely denied\nthe receipt of the said sum of $1,000\".\novercharged.\n\nThe\n\ncharge\n\nagainst\n\n104.In Lim Chor Pee, the first charge against the respondent lawyer was\nthat he had wrongfully evaded tax in respect of a sum of $85,000.\n\n34\n\n\fThis went beyond the scope of the complaint, which had not made\nany specific allegation in respect of this sum of $85,000.\n105.In Yeo Khim Hai, two of the charges against the respondent lawyer\nwere found to be “wholly outside the scope of the [clomplaint” (at\n[92]). These charges alleged overcharging, whereas the gravamen of\n\nthe complaint related to the adequacy of steps that the lawyer had\ntaken to ascertain his client's mental capacity.\n106. The circumstances before us are quite clearly different. Charges 1B\nand 2B are premised on the same conduct that Charges 1 and 1A,\n\nand 2 and 2A respectively, are premised on. Charges 1B and 2B are\nbased on the same information in the AGC Complaint, as the other\ncharges. The gravamen (or subject matter) is the same for all the\nCharges — namely, that the Respondent was guilty of misconduct\nbecause of her involvement in the preparation and execution of Mr\nLee’s Last Will.\n\n107.The\n\nconduct\n\ncomplained\n\nof in Charges\n\nconduct which is the subject of Charges\n\n1B and 2B is the same\n1 and\n\n1A, and 2 and 2A,\n\nrespectively. For instance, Charge 7 reads:\n\n\"you failed to advance your client’s interest unaffected by your\ninterest and/or the interest of your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, by\npreparing and arranging for the execution of your client's will where\n\na one-third share in your olient’s estate was fo be given fo your\nhusband, Ms Lee Hsien Yang, such act amounting to grossly\nimproper conduct in the discharge of your professional duty within\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161,\n\n2009 Rev Ed).”\n\n35\n\n\fwhile Charge 1B reads:\n\n\"you failed to advance Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s interest unaffected by\nyour interest and/or the interest of your husband,\n\nMr Lee Hsien\n\nYang, by preparing and arranging for the execution of Mr Lee Kuan\nYew’s will where a one-third share in Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s estate was\nto be given fo your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, such act\namounting to misconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor as an\nofficer of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable\nprofession within the meaning of s 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession\n\nAct (Cap. 161, 2009 Rev Ed).”\n408. The Respondent accepts that the conduct complained of in Charges\n1B and 2B is the same as the conduct complained of in Charges 1\nand 1A, and 2 and 2A respectively®. Charges 1B and 2B are\npremised on information in the AGC Complaint, like Charges 1, 1A,\n2 and 2A. The substance of all these Charges is the same, and\nreflects that of the AGC Complaint.\n\n109. For completeness, we should also address a related point which the\nRespondent raised - that because the inquiry stage had been\nbypassed, and the Deputy Attorney-General’s complaint was referred\ndirectly to this Tribunal, the scope of the complaint therefore had to\nbe construed even more carefully.\n\n110. She submitted that the power of direct referral under section 85(3(b)\nof the LPA is a power that should be exercised “only in cases where\nthe Respondent would undoubtedly be guilty of grossly improper\nconduct if the evidence supports his specific complain?. and\ntherefore, where this power was exercised, the Law Society does not\n\n85 Respondent's Skeletal Submissions for No Case fo Answer (2 July 2019) at paras 65 - 66.\n\n36\n\n\fhave the power to change the “basis on which the Respondent is tried\n\nbefore the Tribunal®.\n111. The Tribunal is unable to accept this Submission. The exercise of the\npower under section 85(3)(b) of the LPA, to request that a complaint\nbe escalated directly to a Disciplinary Tribunal, does not change the\n\nnature of the Law Society's role and duty, in framing the charges\narising from the complaint. In Yeo Khirn Hai, Justice Thean accepted\nthat the Law Society's responsibility in framing charges was the same\nwhether the complainant was\n\na jay complainant\n\nor a complainant\n\nunder section 85(3) of the LPA (see Yeo Khir Hai, at [82]).\nAdequate Notice of the Charges\n\n112. The second ground relied upon in the Seah Pong Tshai line of cases,\nnamely\n\nthat notice of the relevant charges\n\nwas\n\nnot given\n\n(see\n\nrespondent at the Inquiry Committee stage\nabove), is also quite clearly inapplicable here.\n\nto the\n\nparagraph\n\n98\n\n113.To begin with, no Inquiry Committee was convened in this case. The\nadequacy of notice arising from this phase of proceedings therefore\ndoes not arise.\n\n114. More fundamentally, the Tribunal is also guided by the decision of\nthe Court of Three Judges in Law Society of Singapore v Wong Kai\nKit [1993] 3 SLR(R) 721 (\"Wong Kai Kit’). In Wong Kai Kit, the Court\nrejected the proposition that, based on Seah Pong Tshai and Lim\nChor Pee, matters outside an original complaint can never form the\nsubject matter of disciplinary proceedings commenced, as a result of\nthat complaint.\n\nWhat\n\nwas\n\ncrucial, the Court\n\nopined,\n\nwas that the\n\n66 Respondent’s Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at paras 49 - 50.\n\n37\n\n\fadvocate and solicitor against whom disciplinary proceedings\nbeen brought, had notice of the charges against him.\n\nhad\n\n115.The Court in Wong Kai Kit held (at [18] and [31]) that:\n“It is plain from these [LPA] provisions that the primary concern of\nthe Legislature was that an advocate and solicitor whose conduct is\nbeing investigated by an Inquiry Committee should be given a\nreasonable\n\nopportunity\n\nto\n\npresent\n\nhis case...\n\nNowhere\n\nin the\n\nlegislation is the leap made from this to the suggestion that matters\n\noutside an original complaint can never form the subject maiter of\ndisciplinary proceedings commenced as a result of that complaint...\n\n.. The fact that_a charge was\nreferred\n\nby the AG\n\nto the Law\n\nnot contained in the information\nSociety\n\nis not by reason\n\nof this\n\npassage [in Lim Chor Pee at [36]| sufficient to render such charge\ninvalid or improper if notice of it was in fact given by the Inquiry\nCommittee as statutorily required.”\n[Emphasis added,]\n\n416. In the present case, the charges brought against the Respondent by\nthe Law Society have remained consistent throughout these\nproceedings. The Respondent was not taken by surprise.\n117.We should also highlight that this aspect of the Courts’ findings in\nSeah Pong Tshai and Lim Chor Pee pre-dated amendments to the\nLPA, which broadened the scope of Disciplinary Tribunals’\njurisdiction to consider additional charges.\n\n418.The Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 1993 introduced a new\nprovision (section 89(4) of the LPA), that provided as follows:\n\n38\n\n\f“Where, in the course of ifs investigation of any matter against an\nadvocate and solicitor referred to it under subsection (1) or (3), a\nDisciplinary Committee receives information touching on or\nevidence of the conduct of the advocate and solicitor which may give\n\nrise to proceedings under this Part, the Disciplinary Committee may,\n\non the application of the Council, prefer such additional charge\nagainst the advocate and solicitor as it thinks fit with respect to such\nmisconduct and, after giving notice to him, hear and investigate such\ncharge and section 93 shail apply to such charge accordingly.”\n\n[See section 19 of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 1993 (No.\n41/93)\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n119.As the Explanatory Statement to the Amendment Bill set out, the aim\nof this amendment was to “enable a Disciplinary Committee to prefer\nother charges against an advocate and solicitor in certain\ncircumstances”. In other words, a Disciplinary Committee (and now,\n\na Disciplinary Tribunal) is endowed with the statutory jurisdiction to\nextend its investigation to “fresh matters”, and even to prefer “fresh\ncharges”, once adequate notice of its intention to do so is given to the\nrespondent lawyer (see Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay\nKhiang [2007] SGHC 83 (\"Tan Phuay Khiang’), at [58)).\n120.As stated above, the Respondent had ample notice of all the Charges\nagainst her. She was given sufficient time to respond, and did in fact\n\ndo so, substantively, for all the Charges (including Charges 1B and\n2B).\n421. This Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Charges 1B and 2B.\n\n39\n\n\f(B)\n\nAdmissibility of evidence\n\n422.The Second Preliminary Point raised by the Respondent relates to\nadmissibility of documents into evidence (to prove the truth of the\nin Mr\n\nunderlying facts). The Respondent says that the documents\n\nGopalan’s Affidavit are inadmissible.\n123. First, the Respondent argues that the Evidence Act (Cap. 97, 1997\n\nRev Ed) (“Evidence Act’) requires that only direct evidence may be\ngiven of any fact. Mr Gopalan was not the maker of any of the\nstatemenis in the documents exhibited in his Affidavit. Therefore, the\nRespondent submits, “save for a limited number of documents which\n\nmay be admissible as exceptions to the hearsay rule,” all the\ndocuments exhibited in Mr Gopalan’s Affidavit are inadmissible.\n124. The Respondent relies on Lee Chez Kee v Public Prosecutor [2008]\n3 SLR(R) 447, for the proposition that only direct evidence may be\ngiven of any fact.\n125. Section 62 of the Evidence Act relates to oral evidence. The other\nprovisions in the Evidence Act, which deal with documentary\nevidence, are more relevant to the exhibits to Mr Gopalan’s Affidavit.\n\n126. Section 67A of the Evidence Act provides:\n“Where in any proceedings a statement in a document is admissible\n\nin evidence by virtue of section 32(1), it may be proved by the\nproduction of that document or (whether or not that document is still\nin existence) by the production of a copy of that document, or of the\nmaterial part of it, authenticated in a manner approved by the court.”\n127.Section\n\n32(1)\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nEvidence\n\nAct,\n\nin\n\nturn,\n\nprovides\n\nfor\n\nthe\n\nadmissibility of the type of evidence, which, at common law, would be\n\n40\n\n\freferred to as hearsay evidence. Both parties have filed notices to\nadmit hearsay evidence, and this issue will be dealt with, later.\n\n128. The effect of section 67A of the Evidence Act, read with section 32(1)\nof the Evidence Act, has been summarised by Justice Woo Bih Li, in\nColumbia Asia Healthcare Sdn Bhd and anotherv Hong Hin Kit\nEdward and another [2016] 5 SLR 735, at [23] to [25]:\n\"23\n\nSection 32(1)(b) [of the Evidence Act]\n\ndeals with the\n\nexceptions to the hearsay rule. Moreover, s 66 must be read\n\nsubject to s 67A of the EA which states that where a statement\nin a document is admissible in evidence by virtue of s 32(1) it\nmay be proved by the production of that document (fe, the\noriginal) or a copy.\n\nIn summary, in so far as the Hongs submitted that the\n24\nmaker_of the document must _be called to give evidence,\ns 32(1)(b)(iv) states that this is not necessary under certain\ncircumstances.\n\n25\nbe\n\nIn so far as the Hongs submitted that the original must\nproduced, s66 must be read subject to s67A which\n\nprovides that where s 32(1) applies, a copy may be produced.”\n\n{Emphasis added.]\nquestion of admissibility of the documents exhibited to Mr\nGopalan’s Affidavit (to prove the truth of the statements therein) will\nhave to be determined by whether these documents are admissible,\nby virtue of section 32(1) of the Evidence Act.\n\n129.This\n\n130.We will therefore consider whether the documents\n\nLaw\n\nSociety are admissible,\n\nrelied on by the\n\nwith reference to the LSS\n\nHearsay\nAL\n\n\fNotice®’. Both the Law Society and the Respondent have relied on\nsection 32 of the Evidence Act for admissibility of various documents\ninto evidence.\n131.lnsofar as hearsay\n\nevidence\n\nis adduced\n\nin relation to statements\n\nmade by Mr Lee, we find these documents admissible pursuant to\nsection 32(1)(i)(i) of the Evidence Act, read with section 67A of the\nEvidence Act, on the ground that the maker of the statemenis,\n\nMr\n\nLee, has passed away.\n132. This will include documents numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 42, 13,\n15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 in the LSS Hearsay Notice. In addition, we\nalso find that these documents\n\nare admissible pursuant to section\n\n32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act, being documents forming part of a\n\nrecord kept by Ms KKL, in the course of her profession as Mr Lee’s\nlawyer (see also paragraph 135 below).\n133. The Respondent also objected to various documents in Mr Gopalan’s\nAffidavit, which related to correspondence between Mr LHY and Dr\n\nLWL,\n\nand\n\nthe Ministerial\n\nCommittee\n\n(the \"MC”)®;\n\nas well\n\nas\n\ncorrespondence between various family members and Mr Lee. The\nauthenticity of these documents is not in dispute. They are admissible\nto show what had been said by the various parties. In so far as these\ndocuments originated from Mr LHY and/or the Respondent, both of\nthem gave evidence and were cross-examined. The Tribunal\nreceived direct evidence on some of the documents and is able to\n87 LSS Hearsay Notice dated 24 June 2019.\n* On 1 June 2016, a Ministerial Committee (\"MC\") had been formed by the Singapore Cabinet to\nconsider the options for 38 Oxley Road and the implications of those options [Report of the MC on 38\n\nOxley\n\nRoad,\n\ndated\n\n2 April\n\n2018\n\n(httos:/Awww.pmo.gov.sq/-/media/PMO/Newsroom/Files/Media-\n\nRelease/MC Report 38 Oxley Road.pdf]. These included looking into various aspects, including the\nhistorical and heritage significance of 38 Oxiey Road, as well as to consider Mr Lee's thinking and\nwishes in relation to 38 Oxley in the Last Will (see paras 7 — 30 of the Report). The MC stated that it\nhad engaged in correspondence with Mr LHL, Mr LHY and Dr LWL, to obtain as full a picture as possible\non Mr Lee's thinking on 38 Oxley Road (see para 24 of the Report}. Some of the questions raised,\nrelated to the Last Will (See paras 4 and 9 of Annex C to the Report: https:/Avww.pmo.gov.sa//media/PMO/Newsroom/Files/Media-Release/MC_ Report 38 Oxley Road Annex C.pdf}.\n\n42\n\n\fform views on the matters set out in the documents, in the context of\nthe evidence given. The same goes for documents that Mr LHY sent\nto the MC.\n\n134.Next we consider the documents relating to statements made by Ms\nKKL, which are documents numbered 10, 11, 14, 17, and 23 in the\nLSS Hearsay Notice. It appears from the LSS Hearsay Notice that\n\nthe Law Society relies on two grounds for the admission of these\ndocuments:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the Law Society states in the LLS Hearsay Notice, that\nthese documents are emails sent by Ms KKL, and therefore,\n\nform part of “a document constituting, or forming part of, the\nrecords\n\n(whether\n\npast\n\nor present)\n\nof a\n\ntrade,\n\nbusiness,\n\nprofession or other occupation that are recorded, owned or\nkept by any person, body or organisation carrying out the trade,\nbusiness, profession or other occupation”, pursuant to section\n32(1)(b)(iv) of the Evidence Act.\n(b)\n\n| Second,\n\nthe Law\n\nSociety states that these\n\ndocuments\n\nare\n\nadmissible pursuant to section 32(1)(i}(iv) of the Evidence Act;\nas statements made by a person who “being competent but\nnot\n\ncompellable\n\nto give\n\nevidence\n\non\n\nbehalf of the party\n\ndesiring to give the statement in evidence, he refuses to do\n”\nso.\n\n135.First,\n\nin relation to section\n\n32(1)(b\\(iv) of the Evidence\n\nAct, this\n\nTribunal finds that the documents numbered 10, 11, 14, 17, and 23\nin the LSS Hearsay Notice are admissible pursuant to that provision.\n\nThese documents form a record, or part of a record, kept by Ms KKL,\nas a lawyer in the ordinary course of business.\n\n43\n\n\f136.In relation to section 32(1}(j)iv) of the Evidence Act, it appears that\nMs KKL has said that she will not give evidence.\n\n137. The Tribunal was informed that Ms KKL had refused to participate in\n“any meeting and/or discussion with the Law Society regarding the\ndocuments referred fo in your email and any information or\n\ndocuments pertaining to my engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor®.\nCounsel\n\nfor the Law Society\n\ninformed this Tribunal that the Law\n\nSociety was “told in no uncertain terms that she is not allowed and\nthe estate fof Mr Lee] has asserted privilege”. The Executors of Mr\n\nLee’s Estate (namely, Mr LHY and Dr LWL) had taken this position’®.\nThe Law Society stated that it did not subpoena Ms KKL, inter alia,\nbecause “a subpoena fo her will not waive privilege if she maintains\n\nthat privilege’”' (see also paragraph 153 below).\n138.The documents will be admissible,\n\nEvidence _Act\n“compellable’.\n\nif Ms\nThere\n\nunder section 32(1)()(iv) of the\n\nKKL (as a solicitor to\nis no direct case law\n\nMr Lee) was\nprecedent on\n\nnot\nthe\n\ncompellability of a solicitor, though there is some learning which has\nbeen referred to us by the parties. We do not see the need to decide\n\non the question\n\nof whether\n\nMs KKL was\n\ncompellable,\n\n(and thus\n\nwhether the documents are admissible under section 32(1)(j)(iv) of\n\nthe Evidence Act), since we have stated (above), that the documents\n10, 11, 14, 17 and 23, are admissible under section 32(1)(b)(vi) of the\nEvidence Act.\n\n6 Transcripts (5 July), 60:31 - 61:2.\n7° Transcripts (5 July), 60:27- 63:14.\n\n71 Transcripts (5 July), 63:8-10.\n\n\fExclusionary Discretion\n\n139. The Respondent submits that even if the evidence is admissible, this\nTribunal should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence, which\nshe says was obtained by the Law Society in breach of legal privilege.\nSave for documents numbered 1 and 2, which are the Last Will and\nthe Codicil to the same, the Respondent submits that all the other\n\ndocuments ought to be inadmissible on this ground”.\n140. The Court of Appeal in Mykytowyeh, Pamela Jane v V/ P Hotel [2016]\n4 SLR 829 (“Pamela Jane”) has cautioned (at [57]) that the “concepts\nof admissibility, privilege and confidentiality should not be confused”.\n\nThe Court of Appeal, considering the admissibility of a report by one\nDr Tay opined, at [58] — [59]:\nPrivilege allows a party to withhold the disclosure of\n‘58\nto\ncompulsory\nbe\notherwise\nwould\nwhich\ninformation\ndisclose. Admissibility, on the other hand, relates to the question of\nwhether a particular piece of evidence may be received by the court,\nand is governed by whether that piece of evidence is relevant to the\n\nmatters in issue (see Kuruma, Son of Kaniu v The Queen [1955]\n2 WLR 223 at 226-227 as cited in Wee Shuo Woon at [19}). Where\nthe document in respect of which privilege is being asserted — such\nas Dr Tay’s medical report in the present case — is already in the\npossession of the other party, the issue is no longer one of\nand the\ndisclosure,\nwithholding\nadmissibility rather than privilege.\n\nquestion\n\nbecomes\n\none\n\nof\n\nThe question of whether Dr Tay’s medical report is protected\n59\nby litigation privilege is, strictly speaking, irrelevant to the issue of\nwhether it is admissible as evidence. It may, however, have a\nbearing on whether the report should be admitted. This arises from\n\nthe fact that equity may, through the grant of injunctions, intervene\nto prevent the unauthorised use in court proceedings of information\n72 Respondent's No Case Submissions (2 July 2049) at paras 26 — 27.\n\n45\n\n\fcontained in privileged material, which would, in most instances, be\n\nof a.confidential nature (see Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch\nBuilding\nNationwide\nv\n(‘Lord Ashburton\"), Goddard\n469\nSociety [1986] 3 WLR 734 (\"Goddara\"), Tentat Singapore Pte Lid v\n\nMultiple Granite Pte Ltd[2009] 1 SLR(R) 42 (\"Tentat\") and Wee\nShuo Woon at[22]). The court’s equitable jurisdiction to restrain\nbreaches of confidence is invoked in these instances.”\n\n141.The\n\nRespondent's position, in summary, is that the documents in\nquestion (being the Wills and other documents) were privileged\nbetween\n\nMr Lee and Ms\n\nKKL.\n\nThe Estate of Mr Lee now\n\nhas the\n\nbenefit of that privilege, and thus, she says, the documents cannot\nbe relied upon in these proceedings.\n\n142.The first point to note is that the Respondent has no privilege in\nrespect of the documents. It is for the Estate, which is not a party to\nthese proceedings, to assert any legal privilege. This is a basic point,\n\nwhich the Respondent accepted”. Second, that the documents may\nbe\n\nprotected\n\nby\n\nprivilege\n\nis in itself\n\ninsufficient to affect their\nadmissibility. The question for the Tribunal is, if these documents are\nindeed protected by privilege, nonetheless (and if such privilege is\nasserted by the Estate), should the Tribunal exercise its discretion to\nexclude this evidence? The Tribunal has the discretion to exclude\n\notherwise admissible evidence”*.\n\n143. This question was in substance dealt with by the High Court in OS\n639 (see paragraphs 85 — 89 above). In OS 639, the Estate (acting\nthrough Mr LHY and Dr LWL) made an application to the High Court\nseeking an injunction against the Law Society. The Estate wanted to\nrestrain the Law Society from relying on all of Mr Lee’s wills and the\nCodicil, and all drafts of these Wills, in these Disciplinary\n78 Transcript (3 July 2019), 94:18-21.\n74 See Muhammad bin Kadar v PP [2011] 3 SLR 1205.\n\n46\n\n\fproceedings. This included the Last Will, the Codicil, the First to Sixth\n\nWills, and all drafts of these wills’5. In relation to the Last Will, the\nCodici], the First to Sixth Wills,\n\nand the drafts thereof, the Estate\n\nclaimed that these documents\nlegal privilege.\n\nwere confidential and protected by\n\n144.As stated earlier (see paragraph 89 above), Justice Hoo declined to\ngrant the injunction against the Law Society. The attempt to prevent\n\nthe Law Society from relying on these documents was rejected. This\nTribunal notes that the documents which were the subject of OS 639,\nwere the documents numbered\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in the LSS\n\nHearsay Notice. !n coming to her decision, Justice Hoo applied the\nprinciples set out by the Court of Appeal in Pamela Jane.\n145. In relation to the documents numbered\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 in\n\nthe LSS Hearsay Notice, this Tribunal finds that if the Court did not\ndeem fit to exercise its equitable discretion, to restrain the Law\nSociety from using these documents in these proceedings, then there\nis no reason for this Tribunal to exclude the same. The Estate tried\nbut failed, to prevent the documents from being in evidence in the\n\nproceedings.\n\n146.In relation to the documents in the LSS Hearsay Notice, which are\nemail communications between Ms KKL and Mr Lee, in relation to Mr\nLee’s Wills, (the documents numbered 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,\n\n20, 21 and 22 (“LKY-KKL Emails”)), this Tribunal is of the view that\nthese\n\ndocuments\n\nwould\n\nordinarily be protected\n\nby legal privilege.\n\nHowever, this privilege is for the Estate to claim, not the Respondent.\nThis is accepted by the Respondent”. The Tribunal notes that the\nEstate did not seek to restrain the Law Society from using the LKYKKL Emails, in OS 639, Further, the High Court’s reasoning in OS\n78 See paragraph 86 and fn 64 of this Decision.\n\n7 Transcripts (3 July), 94:13-21.\n47\n\n\f639 applies equally to the LKY-KKL\nexclude the documents.\n\nEmails. This Tribunal will not\n\n147.Excluding these documents will mean, infer alia, that the Tribunal will\n\nbe precluded from considering the differences between the different\nWills, and understanding the positions taken by Mr Lee.\nRespondent's Hearsay Notice\n\n148.We\n\nhighlight that the Respondent\n\ntoo had filed a Notice to Admit\n\nDocumentary Hearsay Evidence (“Respondent's Hearsay Notice”),\ndated 24 June 2019. The Respondent relies on the same sections,\nviz, section 32(1)(b) of the Evidence Act and section 32(1)(/)(i) of the\n\nEvidence Act. The Law Society has not objected to the admissibility\nof the evidence listed in the Respondent's Hearsay Notice. The\nevidence listed in the Respondent's Hearsay Notice is admissible.\n(C)\n\nUnfair Conduct\n\n149. We will now consider the Third Preliminary Point. In the Respondent's\nClosing\n\nSubmissions,\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nsubmitted\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nLaw\n\nSociety acted unfairly to the Respondent. At Annex C of the\nRespondent's Closing Submissions (the “RAC”), the Respondent has\nset out a list of instances where she alleges she was treated unfairly.\n\nThe Law Society, in its Closing Submissions, has responded to the\ninstances of alleged unfairness, also in table form. The Tribunal will\nbriefly\n\naddress\n\nthese\n\nsubmissions,\n\nwith\n\nreference\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nserial\n\nnumber assigned to these instances in the RAC.\n450. Items 1 and 2 of the RAC state (a) that the charges did not conform\nto the AGC Complaint, and (b) that the Law Society used documents\nwhich were disclosed in breach of confidentiality and legal\n\n48\n\n\fprofessional privilege. These points have been deait with earlier (see\nSections V(A) and V(B) above).\n151. items 3 and 4 of the RAC relate to procedural matters before the trial\nstage of the hearings before the Tribunal. The Respondent submitted\nthat the Law Society failed to inform the Respondent why an urgent\nPre-Hearing Conference (“PHC”) was required, when the Law\nSociety requested for one on 16 April 2019 (Item 3), and that the Law\n\nSociety made an illegitimate demand for immediate disclosure of all\ncopies of documents in the Respondent's list of documents (Item 4).\nIn relation to the request for an urgent Pre-Hearing Conference, the\nTribunal had addressed the same in its directions to parties. No\nurgent PHC was fixed, and the Law Society was directed to address\n\nthe issues it wished to bring to the Tribunal’s attention (by way of the\nurgent PHC) in written submissions. The Respondent was given an\nopportunity to provide submissions in reply, and both parties were\nheard during the PHC on 8 May 2019. In relation to the request for\ncopies of documents (and the Tribunal fails to see how such a request\nbe illegitimate), the Tribunal directed that the inspection and\nfurnishing of documents be done in accordance with Rule 9 of the\ncan\n\nLeaal Profession (Disciplinary Proceedings) Rules. Leaving aside the\nfact that the Respondent did not suffer any prejudice procedurally,\nthe Tribunal does not see any force in the argument that the\nRespondent was treated unfairly. The Law Society sought directions.\nThe Tribunal, having considered the Law Society’s requests for\ndirections, declined to grant the directions sought for the urgent PHC,\nand in respect of inspection and furnishing of documents, directed\nthat this be done in accordance with the Rules.\n\n152. ltems 5 and 6 of the RAC relate to the Law Society's failure to call Ms\nKKL as a witness, and the “delayed decision” to call Mr BL as a\nwitness. The Law Society had indicated in its list of witnesses,\n\n49\n\n\fprovided on 27 May 201977, that it would be calling Ms KKL as a\nSociety's position is that its list of witnesses,\nprovided on 27 May 2019 was “fentative and subject fo change’.\n\nwitness.\n\nThe\n\nLaw\n\n153.The Law Society said that it eventually decided not to call Ms KKL\nbecause Ms KKL had declined to participate in “any meeting and/or\ndiscussion with the Law Society regarding the documents referred to\nin [the\n\nLaw\n\nSociety’s]\n\nemail\n\nand\n\nany\n\ninformation\n\nor documents\n\npertaining to [Ms KKL’s] engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor’”® (see\nalso paragraph 137 above), and that her evidence was not necessary\n\nbecause the Law Society was able to rely on various documents\n\nwhich had become available®. Ms KKL’s position was based on the\nobjections raised by the Executors of the Estate. We do not find any\nmerit in the points made in the RAC about Ms KKL not being called\nas a witness. It is for each party to decide, at the Hearing, which\nwitnesses are called. The Tribunal is entitled to also draw the\nappropriate inferences when a witness is not called, and regardless\n\nof whether a witness is called or not called, the burden of proof (to\nprove the case beyond reasonable doubt) lay on the Law Society. We\nalso note that the Respondent’s husband, Mr LHY, as Executor, had\nasserted legal privilege, vis-a-vis Ms KKL (see paragraphs 423 — 434\n\nbelow).\n154. In relation to the Law Society's decision to subpoena\n\nMr BL as a\n\nwitness, the Tribunal does not find any unfairness. The evidence he\n\ngave and the documents he preduced were within the Respondent's\nknowledge. The Respondent also had the opportunity to crossexamine Mr BL. We have made some further observations below on\n77 Email from the Law Society to the Respondent and the Tribunal, setting out the list of its witnesses,\ndated 27 May 2019.\n78 LSS Closing Submissions (20 September 2019)\n\nat p 123, Item 5.\n\n79 Transcripts (5 July 2019), 60:31 - 61:2.\n8 Transcripts (1 July 2019), 5:28 - 6:18.\n50\n\n\fthis objection, in relation to Mr BL being called to give evidence (see\nparagraphs 182 — 193 below).\n155. Items 7 and 8 of the RAC relate to the subpoena issued against MLS\nfor documents. The Law Society informed the Tribunal on 2 July 2019,\nthe second day of the Hearing, that the Law Society was considering\nissuing a subpoena against MLS. The Respondent submitted that\nissuing the subpoena, after the close of the Law Society’s case,\nresulted in unfairness to her. The Tribunal notes that the witness from\n\nMLS, Mr Manoj Pillay, simply confirmed that MLS had not been able\nto retrieve any document responsive to the subpoena. The Tribunal\nfails to see how this (the fact that the Respondent’s law firm did not\nproduce any documents) caused any unfairness, to the Respondent.\nThe Respondent was put on notice on the second day of the Hearing\nthat the Law Society may issue a subpoena against MLS. The\nsubpoena was in relation to the specific email(s) on the question of\nfrom\n\nwhom\n\nMr\n\nBL\n\nthe\n\nreceived\n\nhad\n\ndraft document,\n\nwhich\n\nwas\n\nexecuted to become the Last Will. This issue arose as a consequence\nof the evidence given by Mr BL.\n156.The Respondent also alleges that Mr LHY was subject to unfair\nallegations in cross-examination (Item 9 of the RAC). The Tribunal\ndoes not see any merit in this submission, or how this amounts to\nunfairness. In the Tribunal’s view, cross-examination of Mr LHY by\nCounsel for the Law Society was in accordance with the rules and\nprinciples governing evidence and cross-examination. Counsel for\nthe Respondent did not raise any objection in this regard during Mr\nLHY’s cross-examination.\nat Item 10 of the RAC,\n\n157.Lastly,\nreading\n\nof\n\nan\n\nreceived\n\nby\n\nthe\n\nLaw\n\nsubmits that the\n\nSociety's\n\nsolicitors,\n\nKKL,\n\nwas\n\nunfair as the Estate did not\n\nan opportunity to respond.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent\n\nWongPartnership,\nhave\n\nemail\n\nthe Respondent\n\nfrom\n\nMs\n\nclaims that the\n\n54\n\n\fallegation by the Law Society that the Estate had refused to allow Ms\nKKL to testify in these proceedings was based on this email. We do\nnot see any merit in this argument. The Respondent did not raise any\nobjections at the hearing. Second, the Respondent had the\nopportunity to object at the oral hearing on 7 October 2019, but did\nnot do so. We have also dealt with this matter at paragraphs 431 —\n\n434 below.\n458. There was no unfairness to either party in respect of these matters.\nMany of the objections relate to procedures which are normal and\nroutine in hearings: calling / not calling of witnesses, seeking\ndirections from the Tribunal, cross-examination, issue of subpoenas,\n\nproduction of documents, and so on.\n\nVi.\n\nSummary of the Parties’ Positions on the Charges\n\n159.We will now set out a short summary\nrelation to the Charges®'.\n(A)\n\nof the parties’ positions in\n\nThe Law Society’s Case\n\n160.The Law Society's case was that there was an Implied Retainer\nbetween the Respondent and Mr Lee. The Law Society said that the\nRespondent acted as Mr Lee's solicitor. She prepared the draft Last\nWill and advised Mr Lee on it. Mr LHY, the Respondent’s husband,\n\nwas a beneficiary under the Last Will. The Law Society argues that\nRespondent's conduct is in breach of Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR.\n\n161. The Law Society argued that the Respondent had failed to advance\nMr Lee’s interests unaffected by her interests and/or those of her\nhusband, Mr LHY. The Law Society's case is that there were material\n81 We will only set out brief details here. The points made by the parties are dealt with in greater detail,\nhereafter.\n52\n\n\fdifferences between\n\nthe draft sent by the Respondent, which was\n\nexecuted to become the Last Will, and the First Will (contrary to her\nrepresentation that the draft Last Will was in the same terms as the\n\nFirst Will). Mr Lee was also not advised in detail on the draft Last Will,\non the various clauses in the Last Will (which Mr Lee had earlier\ndecided to drop), and how the Last Will was different from the\nPenultimate Will. The Law Society also points to the fact that Mr Lee’s\nusual lawyer, Ms KKL, was absent from the matters surrounding the\npreparation and execution of the Last Will and that the Respondent\nrushed the execution of the Last Will, contrary to Mr Lee’s interests.\n\n162.As regards the differences between the draft Last Will (which the\nRespondent sent Mr Lee on 16 December 2013, and which was\nexecuted to become the Last Will), and the First Will, the Law Society\npoints to the following in particular:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Last Will omitted (infer alia) the Gift-over Clause, which\nhad been present in the First Will.\n\n(b)\n\nThe\n\nLast Will also included various clauses,\n\nincluding the\n\nDemolition Clause, which, while present in the First Will, had\n\nbeen removed by Mr Lee in later wills, including the Sixth Will,\nwhich immediately preceded the Last Will.\nThe Law Society argued that the Respondent, by not advising Mr Lee\n\n(amongst other things) on these differences or changes, had failed in\nher duties to Mr Lee as his solicitor.\n\n163.[n addition, the Law Society also argues that Charges 1B and 2B can\nbe maintained even if the Tribunal were to find that there was no\nImplied Retainer between Mr Lee and the Respondent.\n\n53\n\n\f(B)\n\nThe Respondent's Case\n\n164. The Respondent said that she was not Mr Lee's lawyer in relation to\nthe\n\nLast\n\nWill,\n\nand\n\nthat\n\nthere\n\nwas\n\nno\n\nImplied\n\nRetainer.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent's position is that she was helping as a family member,\nand\n\nas\n\nMr\n\nLee’s\n\ndaughter-in-law\n®; she\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\ngive\n\nor take\n\ninstructions from Mr Lee®’, and Mr Lee had access to his own lawyer\n\nat all times®*. (See also paragraph 265 below.)\n\n:\n\n165. The Respondent also said that there was no conflict of interest as she\nWas unaware of the circumstances giving rise to the conflict. It is the\nRespondent’s case that both she and Mr LHY were unaware of the\nterms of the Sixth Will, and in particular, that it provided for distribution\nwhich gave Mr Lee’s daughter, Dr LWL, a larger share than Mr Lee's\nsons, Mr LHL and Mr LHY. If the Respondent was indeed in a position\nof conflict, the Respondent argued that Mr Lee was fully aware of the\nRespondent’s involvement and consciously chose to proceed®®.\nVil.\n\nIssues for determination\n\n166.The\n\nmain\n\nissues that arise for our determination,\n\nin respect of the\n\nCharges, are as follows:\n\n(A)\n\nImplied Retainer\n\nWas the Respondent\nImplied Retainer?\n\nMr Lee’s lawyer, for the Last Will, by way of an\n\n82 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 141.\n83 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 149.\n® Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 169.\n85 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 192.\n\n54\n\n\f(B) Breach of duties/Misconduct\nIf an Implied Retainer is made out:\n\n(a)\n\nDid the Respondent\n\nunder\n\nbreach the professional duties,\n\nRule 25 and/or 46 of the PCR?\n\n(b)\n\nIf so, did this amount to:\n\n(i)\n\ngrossly\n\nimproper\n\nconduct\n\n(pursuant\n\nto the\n\nprimary\n\nCharges (Charges 1 and 2)); or\n(ii)\n\nimproper\n\nconduct,\n\nor practice,\n\nas an\n\nadvocate\n\nand\n\nsolicitor, (pursuant to the alternative Charges (Charges\n1A and 2A)),\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA?\n\n(c)\n\nAside from the question of Implied Retainer.

The transcript of\nthe Hearing ran to 627 pages. The parties covered fairly extensive\nground, both on procedures, preliminary issues and on the\nsubstantive issues.\n169.We have considered the points made. We will deal with the points\nraised, in respect of the three issues set out at paragraph 166 above.\nWe will also deal with several other points raised, even though some\nof them were not strictly necessary for our decision. This has resulted\nin some repetition of the facts and reasoning, as we have tried to deal\nwith many of the points and arguments raised.\nVill.\n\nRetainer\n\n170,Parties are agreed that there was no Express Retainer between the\n\nRespondent and Mr Lee. The issue is whether there was an Implied\nRetainer between the Respondent and Mr Lee, in respect of the Last\nWill.\n171.We will set out:\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nThe applicable\nRetainer.\n\nlegal\n\nprinciples,\n\non the question\n\nof Implied\n\n:\n\nThe relevant questions to be considered, on the question of\nImplied\n\nRetainer, the evidence\n\nthat was\n\npresented,\n\nand\n\nour\n\nviews.\n\n(C)\n\nOur conclusions, on the question of Implied Retainer.\n\n(D)\n\nThe positions that the parties had taken previously, in respect\nof some of the questions that arose before us.\n\n56\n\n\f(A)\n\nThe applicable principles\n\n172.No legal formalities are required for a retainer to exist (Law Society\n\nof Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani [2006] SGHC\n(‘Ahmad Khalis’) at [64]).\n\n143\n\n173. The assessment turns on whether, on “an objective consideration of\n\nall the circumstances”, a contractual relationship of lawyer and client\n“ought fairly and properly to be imputed to all the parties” (see Ahmad\nKhalis at [66]). [Emphasis added.]\n174.To that end, an objective analysis is applied, from both perspectives\n— that of the lawyer, and of the putative client (Anmad Khalis at [66]).\nA tribunal must undertake “the objective inquiry” of considering —\n\nwhether the putative client reasonably considered\n\n(a)\n\nthat the\n\nlawyer was acting for him, and\n\nwhether the lawyer ought to have reasonably known that he\nwas acting for the putative client\n\n(b)\n\n(see BOM v BOK [2019] 1 SLR 349 (“BOM’) at [109]).\nThe parties’ subjective perspectives, are “by no means conclusive”.\nThey must be consistent with the objective facts, and reasonable,\nwhen construed against that context (Ahmad Khalis at [66]).\n\n175. The final assessment rests on a “holistic and careful consideration of\nthe factual matrix’ (BOM at [109]). Factors that will be considered\ninclude:\n(a)\n\n| Whether the lawyer gave advice to the putative client on the\n\nrelevant document (see Anwar Patrick Adrian and another v\n57\n\n\fNg Chong & Hue LLC and another [2014] SGCA 34 at (52);\nBOM at [109]);\n\n{b)\n\nWhether there was another lawyer acting for the putative client\n(Ahmad Khalis at [67]);\n\n(c)\n\nWhether the lawyer asked the putative\nindependent advice (BOM at [109]); and\n\n(d)\n\nWhether the lawyer and the putative client are spouses, in a\n\nclient\n\nto\n\nseek\n\nmarital relationship (BOM at [112]).\n\n(B)\n\nThe\n\nrelevant questions\n\nto_be\n\nconsidered\n\non\n\nthe question\n\nof\n\nImplied Retainer, the evidence that was presented and our views\n\n176. The questions we will consider on the issue of Implied Retainer are\nas follows:\n(a)\n\nDid Mr Lee and the Respondent proceed on the basis that the\nRespondent was his lawyer, for the Last Will;\n\n(b)\n\nThe actual nature and extent of the Respondent’s role, in the\nLast Will; and\n\n(c)\n\nThe nature and extent of Ms KKL’s involvement (Mr Lee’s\nusual lawyer), in the Last Will.\n\n177.Before we deal with the above three questions, we will refer briefly to\nsome of the important evidence that was put before us, and the\n\nmanner in which some of it came before us.\n\n58\n\n\fProduction of Relevant Evidence\n\n178. The documentary evidence which was put before us provides a fairly\ncomprehensive record of what transpired, in the period leading up to,\nduring, and immediately after Mr Lee signed the Last Will. This is\nprimarily contained in the form of email correspondence.\n179. This evidence was\n\nparticularly relevant,\n\ngiven\n\nits contemporaneity\n\nand being a written record.\n\n180. In this regard, as more than five years have lapsed between the Last\nWill and these proceedings, the Court of Appeal’s observations in\nSandz Solutions (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Strategic Worldwide Assets\nLtd [2014] 3 SLR 562 (“Sandz”) are instructive. In Sandz, the events\nin question took place nearly five years before the trial (see Sanaz at\n[77]). The Court of Appeal said (Sandz at [50] and [77]):\n«_. As a rule of thumb, the longer the lapse of time between the\nhappening of the event or matter being recollected and the witness's\nappearance on the witness stand, the less the reliance that should\nbe placed on pure oral evidence and the more searching the court\nought to be in assessing and testing that evidence...\n..AS\n\nwe\n\nobserved\n\nabove...even\n\nthe\n\nrecollections\n\nof the\n\nmost\n\ntruthful of witnesses would be tested by the lapse of time. In the\npremises, we think it preferable in these proceedings to place more\nreliance _on the objective documentary evidence before us as well\nas the actual conduct _of the parties, as opposed to their _hazy\nrecollections of past events on the witness stand.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nso\n\n\f181.We found the documentary evidence inherently more reliable than\nthe witness testimony, for the reasons set out by the Court of Appeal,\nand also because of the nature of same of the oral testimony that was\ngiven.\n\n182. The key factual witnesses before us were Mr BL, on behalf of the Law\nSociety, and the Respondent and her husband, Mr LHY, on behaif of\nthe Respondent. Mr BL’s evidence was largely unchallenged by the\nRespondent, save for one point, on what the Respondent told him\nabout the contents of the Last Will (we will refer to this later (see\nparagraph 514(b) below)).\n183.The other witnesses before us, (namely, Mr Gopalan,\n\nChuan,\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nManoj\n\nPillay\n\n(see\n\nparagraph\n\n90\n\nMr Lim Seng\n\nabove)),\n\ngave\n\nevidence of a more formal nature, relating to documents.\n\n184.We had referred earlier (at paragraphs 83 - 84) to the BL Documents\nwhich were produced by Mr BL, a few days before ihe Hearing\n(pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Law Society).\n185.The BL Documents contained, inter alia:\n\n(a)\n\nEmails before the Last Will was signed, which showed\n\nthe\n\nRespondent giving Mr BL instructions, on the preparation and\nexecution of the Last Will (see paragraphs 47 — 49 and 51\nabove);\n(b)\n\nEmails\n\nafter the\n\nLast Will was\n\nsigned,\n\nwhich\n\nshowed\n\nthe\n\nRespondent giving Mr BL and her other colleagues at\nStamford\nLaw instructions on how to follow-up (see\nparagraphs 53 — 55, 57, 59 - 60, 64 and 67 above); and\n\n60\n\n\f(c)\n\nMs EK’s Attendance Note (see paragraph 69 above), which\nshowed what transpired when Mr Lee signed the Last Will, and\nher email exchange with the Respondent, which recounted Mr\nLee's queries on who drafted the Last Will.\n\nSome significant parts of the facts set out in Section IN(G) were\nbased on the BL Documents. (See also paragraph 370 below.)\n486.We will consider these BL Documents, in detail, later.\n\n187.The BL Documents (and Mr BL’s Affidavit) deal with issues and\nmatters that are also dealt with by the Respondent in her Affidavit.\n\n(a)\n\n| The Respondent stated in her Affidavit®* that her involvement\nin the Last Will was limited to forwarding the draft of the Last\nWill and the introducing of Mr BL to Ms WLH. Mr LHY\n\ndescribed\n\nthese\n\ntasks\n\nas\n\n“administrative\n\ntasks’ ®’.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent said that she ceased involvement in the Last Will,\nafter introducing Mr BL to Ms WLH and Mr LHY, in the evening\nof 16 December 2013 (see paragraph 40 above).\n\nThe BL Documents and Mr BL’s evidence showed that the\nRespondent remained closely involved throughout, and\ncontinued to exchange multiple emails with Mr BL and others,\nregarding the Last Will, until after the Last Will was signed (we\ndeal with this later (see paragraphs 367 — 394)).\n\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent stated in her Affidavit® that there was no\nreason for Mr Lee to have believed that she was his lawyer.\n\n®6 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 27 and 29.\n87 Transcript (4 July 2019), 127:28; see also Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 36 and 56.\n\n88 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 28.\n\n61\n\n\fThe BL Documents and Mr BL’s evidence showed that just\nbefore he signed the Last Will, Mr Lee asked Mr BL, more than\n\nonce, who drafted the Last Will. The BL Documents state that\nMr Lee was told that the Respondent was the primary lawyer\nwho drafted the Last Will. The Respondent knew that Mr Lee\n\nwas told this, and had not objected (we deal with this later (see\nparagraphs 200 —- 221)).\n\n(c)\n\n| The Respondent also said, on Affidavit®®, that Mr LHY and Dr\nLWL\n\nhad never sought her inputs on their correspondence\n\nwith the MC (which, inter alia, dealt with the Last Will). The BL\n\nDocuments showed that the Respondent was kept informed of\nMr LHY and Dr LWL’s correspondence with the MC, and\nhelped them gather information for their responses (we deal\nwith this later (see paragraphs 459 - 471)).\n\n188. The Respondent knew about the BL Documents (many of them were\ncorrespondence sent to or sent by her), and what Mr BL’s evidence\nwas. She had possession of several of the BL Documents. Mr LHY\nwas also aware of them:\n(a)\n\nDecember 2016, the Respondent received the EK\nAttendance Note (see paragraph 69) from Ms EK, when she\nIn\n\nwrote to Ms EK, to gather information on Mr LHY and Dr LWL’s\n\nbehalf, to prepare responses to the MC%®.\n(b)\n\nIn late 2018,\n\nafter AGC\n\nfirst wrote\n\nto the Respondent,\n\nthe\n\nRespondent had spoken with Mr BL, who recounted to her his\n\n8° The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 35.\n01 SS SBOD, p 18, email fram Ms EK to Mr BL and the Respondent dated 19 December 2016, 10.49am.\n\n62\n\n\frecollection of what happened in December 2013. Mr BL gave\n\nevidence on this and this was not disputed®*.\n(c)\n\nMore recently, during the discovery phase of the current\nproceedings, the Respondent's lawyers also met with Mr BL\n\nto check what documents were in his possession®.\n189. The Respondent did not give discovery of the BL Documents. She\nsaid that she chose not to disclose or refer to the BL Documents, as\n\nshe “didn’t think that they were relevant at alf’®.\n190.In our view, the BL Documents go to important issues before us (as\nwill be seen hereafter). The questions we have to deal with include:\nwhether the Respondent acted as Mr Lee’s lawyer, for the purposes\nof the Last Will. The BL Documents provide relevant evidence, inter\nalia, on the nature and extent of the Respondent's involvement in the\n\nLast Will, that Mr Lee wanted to know who had drafted the Last Will,\nand that he was told that the Respondent had (primarily) drafted the\nLast Will.\n\n191.We will also deal briefly with how the parties dealt with discovery, in\nrespect of some documents.\n\n192.As part of the discovery process, the Law Society sought specific\ndiscovery,\n\ninter\n\nalia,\n\nof:\n\n(a)\n\nall\n\ncorrespondence\n\nRespondent, Mr BL and Ms EK, on the Last Will,\nAttendance Note for Mr Lee’s signing of the Last Will.\n\nbetween\n\nand\n\nthe\n\n(b) the\n\n51 Transcript (3 July 2018), 46:23-28.\n52 Transcript (3 July 2019), 47:10-19.\n3 Transcript (3 July 2019), 47:30 - 48:42, 49:11-14.\n63\n\n\f193.As regards the Law Society's request for the former category of\ndocuments, the Respondent took the position that the Law Society's\nrequest was “unnecessary” because she had already listed “various\ncorrespondences between herself or [Mr LHY] with [Mr BL] and [Ms\nEK] in her list of documents’. The Respondent thus gave the\nimpression that the correspondence disclosed in her List of\nDocuments reflected the entirety of her exchanges with Ms EK and\n\nMr BL.\n\nThe Respondent's List of Documents however, made no\n\nmention of the BL Documents.\n\n194.As\n\nregards\n\nthe Law\n\nSociety's\n\nrequest for the latter category\n\nof\n\ndocuments, the Respondent refused to disclose the EK Attendance\nNote, on the basis that it was “wholly irrelevant to these\nproceedings’. The EK Attendance Note, inter alia, set out Mr Lee's\nqueries on who prepared the Last Will. In our view, that is relevant to\n\nthe issue of whether the Respondent (or someone else) acted as Mr\nLee’s lawyer, in drafting the Last Will.\n195.Both the Respondent and Mr LHY were in possession of the EK\nAttendance Note. Mr LHY said that he may have been given a copy\n\nof the same by the Respondent in December 2016, or he may have\nreceived it earlier® (see also paragraphs 465 - 466, 493 - 495 below).\n196. We will now deal with the three questions set out at paragraph 176\nabove, to determine whether there was an Implied Retainer, by\nreason of the circumstances, including the Respondent's conduct.\n\n4 Respondent's Skeletal Written Submissions (26 April 2019) at para 28.\n95 Respondent's Skeletal Written Submissions (26 April 2019) at para 42.\n°% Transcript (4 July 2049), 11:11-18, 22:22 ~ 23:11, 43:18 ~ 44:5, 112:25-30.\n\n\f(1)\n\nDid Mr Lee and the Respondent proceed on the basis that the\n\nRespondent was his lawyer for the Last Will?\n197.We\n\nwill now\n\ndeal with the first of the three\n\nquestions\n\nset out\n\nin\n\nparagraph 176 above. The Law Society argued that Mr Lee regarded\nthe Respondent as his lawyer for the Last Will. The Respondent and\nMr LHY took the position that Mr Lee regarded Ms KKL, and not the\nRespondent, as his lawyer for the Last Will. They said that there was\n\nno reason\n\nfor Mr Lee to have\n\nregarded\n\nthe Respondent\n\nas his\n\nlawyer*”. They said that Mr Lee never spoke with the Respondent\nabout the Last Will, and gave his instructions to execute the Last Will\n\nonly to Mr LHY®.\n198. We have considered these points, and the evidence carefully. The\nevidence shows that Mr Lee regarded the Respondent as, and\nbelieved her to be, his lawyer for the Last Will. The Respondent also\n\nproceeded on that basis. We will refer to three points:\n(a)\n\nJust before he signed the Last Will, Mr Lee asked, twice, who\nprepared the Last Will. He was told that the Respondent was\nthe primary lawyer for the Last Will. Mr Lee accepted this and\n\nsigned the Last Will on this basis. The Respondent knew what\nMr Lee was told, and did not contradict what Mr Lee was told\n\n(see paragraphs 200 ~ 222};\n(b)\n\nThe Respondent took instructions directly from Mr Lee, on the\n\nLast Will (see paragraphs 223 — 249); and\n\n57 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 23, 27 and 28; Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at\nparas 56 and 84(a); Transcript (3 July 2019), 34:15-17; (4 July 2019), 51:4-5, 71:11-12.

Ms KKL was sent a copy. Mr Lee also made sure that\n\nthe Respondent was informed, when he signed the Codicil to\nthe Last Will, the following month (see paragraphs 250 — 263).\n199.We will set out the evidence in respect of these three points.\n\n(a)\n\nMr Lee was told that the Respondent prepared the Last Will\n\n200.Mr Lee was told that the Last Will was primarily prepared by the\nRespondent. This took place immediately before he signed the Last\nWill, when Mr BL and Ms EK were at 38 Oxley for its execution.\n201.The Respondent was also\nexchange later that day.\n202.Slightly\n\nover an\n\nDecember\n\ninformed\n\nhour after Mr Lee\n\n2013),\n\nMs\n\nof Mr\n\nLee’s\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nBL’s\n\nsigned the Last Will (on\n\nEK told the Respondent\n\nin an email\n\n17\n(see\n\nparagraph 59 above) that®:\n\"he [Mr Lee] is definitely still very lucid - he asked Bernard who\n\ndrafted the will, twice... and Bernard wasn’t entirely sure but\nmentioned it was primarily you and Ms Kwa from Lee & Lee”.\n[Emphasis added.]\n203. The contemporaneous attendance note prepared by Ms EKlater that\nafternoon (namely, the EK Attendance Note (see paragraph 69\n\nabove)), also states that “he [Mr Lee] asked us who drafted the wilf'™.\n#9 LSS SBOD,\n\np 6, email from Ms EK\n\nto the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 12.25pm.\n\n10 LSS SBOD, p 26, Attendance note contained in the email from Ms EK to Mr BL dated 17 December\n\n2013, 4.32pm.\n\n66\n\n\fcorroborated\n\nwere\n\naccounts\n\n204. These\n\nby Mr BL's evidence.\n\nIn his\n\nAffidavit, Mr BL said that:\n\nBefore Mr Lee signed the Last Will, he asked Mr BL, who\ndrafted the Last Will. Mr BL told Mr Lee that the Respondent\n\n(a)\n\nhad drafted the Last Will'®\".\nMr Lee then asked Mr BL again (i.e. a second time), who\ndrafted the Last Will. On this second occasion, Mr BL told Mr\n\n(b)\n\nLee that it was the Respondent, and Ms KKL'®?,\n205.The\n\nRespondent\n\nnot challenge\n\ndid\n\nMr\n\nBL’s\n\nevidence\n\nin cross-\n\nexamination on this aspect.\n\n206.We consider this exchange\n\nbetween\n\nMr Lee and Mr BL significant,\n\nfor a number of reasons.\n207.First, Mr Lee’s questions to Mr BL show that it was important to Mr\nLee to have a lawyer prepare the Last Will. It was the only question\nthat Mr Lee asked (and he asked it twice), before he signed the Last\nWill. We note that Mr Lee had also wanted even the witnesses to the\n\nLast Will to be lawyers. He gave express instructions to get “a solicitor”\n(or a \"notary public”) to witness the signing of the Last Will (see\nparagraphs\n\n41\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nLHY’s\n\nresponse,\n\nset out at paragraph\n\n44\n\nabove).\n208.Second, in response to Mr Lee's queries, Mr BL said to Mr Lee, both\n\ntimes, that the Respondent was the lawyer for the Last Will. On the\n\n101 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 25.\n102 Mr BL’s AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 25,\n\n67\n\n\fsecond occasion he also referred to Ms KKL. Mr BL was mistaken in\nthis and Ms KKL had no role in drafting the Last Will (see Section\nVII(BY3) below). Mr Lee was given the impression that the\nRespondent had primarily drafted the Last Will. Mr Lee proceeded to\nsign the Last Will after being told this.\n209. Third,\n\nthe\n\nmaterial.\n\nown\n\nRespondent's\n\nThe\n\nRespondent\n\nreaction\n\nto what\n\nreplied to other\n\ntranspired\n\naspects\n\nis also\n\nof Ms\n\nEK’s\n\nemail'’°?, But she did not object to Mr BL saying that she drafted the\nLast Will. She knew that she was held out as the lawyer, who had\n\nprimarily prepared Mr Lee’s Last Will, and was content to leave Mr\nLee with that belief.\n\n210.As will be apparent from the email correspondence, set out earlier\n(see Section ING) above, and Section Vill(B\\(3) below), Ms KKL was\n\nnot involved in the drafting of the Last Will. She was left out of the\nrelevant emails. Thus, in fact, the Respondent was the only lawyer\nwho drafted the Last Will. But the inaccurate statement made to Mr\nLee, that Ms KKL was also involved in drafting the Last Will, was also\n\nnot corrected.\n211. The\n\nRespondent\n\nsaid\n\nto\n\nus\n\nthat\n\nMr\n\nLee\n\n“never\n\ntrusted\n\n[the\n\nRespondent] as a lawyer 1, and therefore could not have regarded\nher as his lawyer for the Last Will. Both Mr Lee and the Respondent's\nown acceptance of the representation, that she drafted the Last Will,\ncontradicted this assertion. Mr Lee had also (for example) agreed to\nthe Respondent helping Ms KKL draft aspects of the First Will (see,\n\nfor example, paragraphs 16 - 18 above).\n\n108 LSS SBOD, p 6, email from the Respondent to Ms EK dated 17 December 2013, 12.31pm.\n4% Transcript (3 July 2019), 31:12-18.\n\n68\n\n\f242. As mentioned earlier (see paragraphs 83 — 84 and 182 - 193 above),\nthe evidence of Mr Lee’s exchange with Mr BL came to light just\nbefore the Hearing.\n\n213. The Respondent's Affidavit was filed on 10 June 2019, before the BL\nDocuments and Mr BL's Affidavit were produced. When she filed her\nAffidavit, the Respondent would have had no reason to believe that\n\nthe BL Documents and Mr BL’s Affidavit would be produced before\nthe Tribunal. Her Affidavit gave a very different picture from that\nshown by the BL Documents and Mr BL’s Affidavit. Her evidence was\ncontradicted by the BL Documents and Mr BL’s evidence.\n\n214. The Respondent said in her Affidavit that\":\n“t simply did not consider Papa as a client nor did | contemplafe\neven for a moment that Papa would be relying on me for any legal\nadvice. It was clear to me_and indeed to all of us that KKL was his\nlawyer...\n\nAs for Papa, he did net consider me as his lawyer or rely on me for\nlegal advice... in fact, as far as | am aware, Papa never intended or\nexpected that | would be involved in making arrangements for the\nexecution of {the Last Will.”\n{Emphasis added]\n\n215.This is untrue. As set out earlier, the evidence is that Mr Lee was\nexpressly told, twice, that the Respondent had prepared the Last Will.\nMr Lee accepted this. The Respondent also knew that this was what\nMr Lee had\n\nbeen told.\n\nDespite\n\nknowing\n\nthat, she said the direct\n\nopposite in her Affidavit.\n105 Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 27 — 28.\n\n69\n\n\f216.The Respondent’s Submissions on No Case to Answer, and Written\nClosing Submissions (made after the BL Documents had been\nproduced), were silent on the BL Documents, and the variance with\nher Affidavit evidence.\n217.1n Oral Closing, Counsel for the Respondent submitted that this was\nan ‘irrelevant’ point, and a “fruitless” line of enquiry’. In their Closing\n\nSubmissions, Counsel for the Respondent said that: (a) first, Mr Lee’s\nexchange with Mr BL related to who had drafted the First Will, and\nnot the Last Will. It was therefore not surprising that the Respondent\ndid not object to what Mr BL said, since she had assisted “in the tiny\n\nbit on the demolition clause” for the First Will’; and (b) second,\nCounsel said there was no reason to ascribe significance to what Mr\nBL had said, because he had, in his evidence, admitted that he was\n\nunsure who had drafted the Last Will8,\n218. We\n\nare unable to accept the above submissions from Counsel for the\n\nRespondent. The unchallenged evidence is that Mr Lee's exchange\nwith Mr BL was directed to the Last Will, which Mr Lee was about to\nsign, and not the First Will (which Mr Lee would have known was\nprepared by Ms KKL). This is confirmed by Mr BL’s Affidavit, which\nthe Respondent did not challenge. His Affidavit expressly stated that\n“Mr Lee...asked me who drafted the Last Will...Mr Lee asked me\n\nagain who drafted the Last Wiif\"°®. [Emphasis added.]\n219.In our view, it is quite clear that the Respondent was represented to\nMr Lee as the lawyer responsible for the Last (and not the First) Will.\n106 Transcript (7 October 2019), 24:14-16.\n\n17 Transcript (7 October 2019), 24:5-16.\n18 Transcript (7 October 2019), 23:28 — 24:4.\n402 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2019) at para 25.\n\n70\n\n\f220.Further, the Respondent's position is that her role in the First Will\nrelated to only a “tiny bit’. If that is true, then it does not explain why\nshe did not take issue with Mr BL’s representation, that she was the\n\nlawyer, even if she understood Mr BL to be referring to the First Will.\n221. We also do not regard it as relevant, as the Respondent suggests,\nthat Mr BL may not have known, what the full facts were. What\n\nis\n\nmaterial is that the Respondent knew that Mr BL told Mr Lee that she\ndrafted the Last Will. If that was untrue, she could and should have\ntold Mr Lee what she considered to be the truth. But she accepted\nwhat Mr BL told Mr Lee. She accepted it because as the evidence\nshows, she did prepare the Last Will. In fact, she was the only lawyer\nwho had responsibility for the Last Will. Mr BL’s error was in referring\nto Ms KKL, in addition to the Respondent (see paragraph 204(b)\nabove).\n222. The Respondent's answers in cross-examination on several points,\nwere quite unsatisfactory. She often refused to answer questions,\n\nand was evasive. On Mr Lee asking twice about who drafted the Last\n\nWill, this was her evidence’:\nMrTanCM:\n\nDoes it not show that in Mr Lee’s mindset, mind, at all\ntimes the fact that either you or Kwa Kim Li was involved\nin the preparation of the will that he was to sign was\nimportant?\n\nRespondent:\n\n/ think what was important fo him was that he had decided\nto go back to the original agreed will and he--\n\nMrTanCM:\n\nSorry.

Both the Respondent and Mr LHY sought to resile from this account\nof events, in their testimony before us. They said that Mr Lee had\nnever spoken with the Respondent about the Last Will, and that Mr\nLee had given instructions, exclusively, to Mr LHY throughout, and\nnot to the Respondent.\n\n229.This directly contradicted what Mr LHY had said previously, to the\nMC, and what the Respondent had said to AGC.\nRespondent nor Mr LHY provided any coherent\nexplanation, as to why Mr LHY had said to the MC that Mr Lee had\ninstructed the Respondent, if that statement was incorrect. °\n\n230.Neither\n\nthe\n\n231.The Respondent said that Mr LHY’s statement (“Mr Lee gave\ninstructions to Mrs Lee Suet Fem’) was always incorrect and simply\n\nhis “typical...way’ to “shortcut...his statements’\"'®, This does not\nmake any sense, To adopt an analogy that the Respondent used, this\nwas not a case where Mr LHY “jumped” steps by going “from A fo D\n\nand misse[d] the B, C D in between''®. This was a case where Mr\nLHY said the exact opposite or something quite different from what\nhe purportedly meant to say. If Mr LHY meant to say that “Mr Lee\n[never] gave instructions to Mrs Lee Suet Fern”, or alternatively, that\n“Mr Lee gave instructions to me, [Mr LHY],” then it is surprising that,\n\nthe view, Mr LHY would in fact say “Mr. Lee gave\ninstructions to Mrs ‘Lee Suet Fern’. We find it difficult to accept that\nto convey\n\nthis is a form of “shorthand”, intended to convey the very opposite/\na meaning quite different, from what the words suggest.\n\n115 Transcript (4 July 2019), 18:32 - 19:2, 25:17-23,\nTranscript (4 July 2019), 109:31-32, 4 10:31 — 111:2.\n\n26:12-14,\n\n53:23,\n\n109:29 — 110:1; see also\n\n116 Transcript (4 July 2019), 25:17-23; see also Transcript (4 July 2019), 109:31-32.\n117 Transcript (4 July 2019), 18:32 — 19:2.\n\n75\n\n\f232.Second, the Respondent and Mr LHY characterised this as one of the\n“litte .exceptions and details’ that had been omitted in the\n\ncorrespondence with the MC\",\n233.They both drew distinctions between statements to the MC on the\none hand, and court documents on the other and in the case of Mr\nLHY,\n\nhe\n\nwent\n\nfurther\n\nand\n\nmade\n\na further\n\ndistinction\n\ndocuments “1°. They said that different standards\n\nwith\n\nIPO\n\nof care and\n\nprecision apply between the two, because the former are merely in\n\nthe nature of “optional explanations””°. This was said by reference to\npublic and private statements made by Mr LHY. In plain\nlanguage, the effect of what they said is this: Mr LHY may make\n\nboth\n\nuntrue statements, in public and in private, whenever there is no legal!\npenalty for telling untruths; his public and private statements cannot\n\nbe relied upon to be accurate. This is a surprising statement.\n\n234.We do not find their explanations credible.\n235. These contradictions were not subtle discrepancies, or small details,\n\nthat would only be apparent on close scrutiny. Mr LHY’s assertion to\nthe MC was direct and unequivocal - “Mr Lee gave instructions to\nMrs Lee Suet Fern”. lt related to a basic fact — did Mr Lee instruct the\nRespondent, or did he not?\n\n236.This was all the more so, given the significance of this particular\nquestion,\n\nin the context of the correspondence\n\nwith the MC.\n\nThe\n\npossibility of the Respondent having acted in conflict of interest in\npreparing the Last Will had been raised to the MC, including\n148 Transcript (4 July 2019), 53:5-13.\n149 Transcript (3 July 2019), 17:22-26; see also Transcript (4 July 2019), 111:4-8.\n120 Transcript (4 July 2019), 18:4-11, 16-19, 111:4-7.\n\n76\n\n\fspecifically the question: “What was [the Respondent's] role in the\npreparation and execution of the Last Will?”\"2’. The MC brought this\nissue to the Executors’ (including Mr LHY) attention. It was referred\nto as “serious questions in relation to [the Respondent's] involvement\n\nas a lawyer\" for the Last Will’??. Mr LHY accepted,\n\nunder cross\n\nexamination, that serious allegations had been made in respect of the\n\nRespondent and Mr LHY'?°. Mr LHY was responding to the questions\nraised by the MC, by way of the Executors’ letter of 28 February 2017,\nin that context.\n237.As\n\nsuch,\n\nwe\n\nfind\n\nit difficult to believe that\n\nMr\n\nLHY\n\nwould\n\nhave\n\nunequivocally asserted that Mr Lee instructed the Respondent, if that\nwas not the case.\n\n238.The first attempt to correct this alleged error was made in Mr LHY’s\n\nAffidavit before the Tribunal’*+. This was more than two years after\nMr LHY’s representation to the MC in February 2017. The Defence\nalso made no mention of it. This is one of a number of assertions that\nwere\n\nmade,\n\nfor the first time,\n\nin Mr LHY\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nRespondent's\n\nAffidavits.\n239.We also note that on 25 April 2017, the MC had written to Mr LHY\nand Dr LWL, posing further questions about the preparation of the\n121 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 460 at para 38(1), part of Letter from Mr. Lawrence Wong, Minister for National\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n12211 $§ BOD, Vol 1, p 365 at para 10, Annex A attached fo the Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\n\nfor National Development, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 16 December 2016.\n\nSee also LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 377 at paras 51 and 56, part of Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\nfor National Development, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 13 January 2017, Para 51 highlighted concerns\nregarding “what appears fo be a confifct of interest: SF was involved in the preparation and/or signing\nof the Last Will, while LHY was a beneficiary...”. Para 56 raised, inter alia, “the following serious\n\nquestions’ in light of the facts set out — “What was LSF's role in the preparation and execution of the\nLast Wilt?\".\n123 Transcript (4 July 2019), 106:23-26.\n124 Mr LHY's AEIC (41 June 2019) at para &4(a).\n\n77\n\n\fLast Will\"5, In particular, the MC expressly highlighted the Executors'\nearlier representations, that Mr Lee had instructed the Respondent,\nand asked for further details on the nature of the Respondent's\n\ninvolvement'?6.\n240.Despite this, Mr LHY never corrected his purported error.\n241.As stated above (see paragraph 226), the Respondent also adopted\nMr LHY’s representations to the MC, in her own correspondence with\nAGC, in December 2018. During cross-examination, the Respondent\nclaimed that she\n\n“did realise” the error,\n\nbut intended\n\nto “clarify if\n\nfurther down”, because her letter was not “the time or place to go\n\nthrough that\"?”.\n242.It\n\nis not\n\ncredible\n\nto say\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\ndeliberately\n\nleft\n\nuncorrected, a critical error, which overstated her involvement in the\n\nLast Will. This was the Respondent’s response to AGC, regarding\nserious allegations, that she had misconducted herself, in respect of\n\nthe Last Will. The Respondent knew that her professional conduct\nwas in question, and had been raised by AGC.\n\n243,When cross-examined on the Estate’s Letter of 28 February 2017 to\nthe MC, and her letter to AGC, the Respondent was evasive and\nmade numerous attempts to prevaricate. The Respondent said the\nposition in respect of the passages in her letter dated 21 December\n2018 was “nuanced”. The Respondent said that she “was terrified”\n\nand “wantfed] to go back and check””®, Then her evidence changed,\n125 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 442 - 447, Letter from Mr. Lawrence Weng, Minister for National Development,\nto Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n126 1§S BOD, Vol 1, p 444 at para 6(d), Letter from Mr. Lawrence Wong,\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n\nMinister for National\n\n127 Transcript (4 July 2019), 58:17-19.\n\n128 Transcripts (3 July 2019), 11:8-10.\n\n78\n\n\fand the Respondent's position was that when she received the first\nletter from\n\nAGC\n\n(on\n\n30\n\nDecember\n\n2018),\n\nshe\n\nknew\n\nthat it was\n\n“foreshadowing [her] sitting here before the Tribunaf’'®, which was\nan answer she repeated a number of times. Her responses did not\nanswer the question posed.\n\n:\n\n244.Finally, when it was put to the Respondent that her letter, dated 21\n\nDecember 2018 to AGC, adopted the position the Estate had taken\nin the letter of 28 February 2017, she disagreed. This was\nnotwithstanding her admission that in writing to the AGC on 21\nDecember 2018, she had reviewed the two letters from the Estate\n\nshe made reference to'®?.\n245, Mr LHY’s and the Respondent's evidence on this issue was neither\ntrue nor honest. They changed completely their positions from what\nthey had said previously. Their evidence is contradicted by the clear,\ncontrary,\n\ncontemporaneous\n\nevidence,\n\nincluding\n\ntheir\n\nown\n\nearlier\n\nstatements. Their new position (that it was Mr LHY who had taken\ninstructions from Mr Lee, and not the Respondent) seems to have\nbeen crafted late in the day, just prior to the Hearing, and for the\nspecific purpose of the Hearing.\n246.Our conclusion on the evidence is that, when the Estate wrote to the\n\nMC in February 2017, presenting the Respondent as having acted in\na manner consistent with there having been a solicitor-client\nrelationship, this was a reflection that the Respondent did indeed see\nher role as such.\n\n129 Transcripts (3 July 2019), 11:25-26.\n\n180 Transcripts (3 July 2019), 7:31.\n\n79\n\n\f247.Now faced with potential disciplinary action, the Respondent has\nchanged her position, and has instead adopted the position that her\n\ninvolvement was only “peripheral''$*.\n248.Mr LHY’s original account, to the MC — that Mr Lee gave instructions\nto the Respondent — is also consistent with the Respondent's conduct,\nin sending the draft Last Will to Mr Lee. As discussed below (see\n\nparagraphs 274 — 281 below), the Respondent and Mr LHY gave no\ncredible explanation as to why it was the Respondent who\nsubsequently sent the draft Last Will to Mr Lee, if Mr Lee’s\ninstructions had been given to Mr LHY.\n\n249. The giving and taking of instructions is one of the important hallmarks\nof a solicitor-client relationship.\n250.We will now deal with the third point referred to at paragraph 198,\nrelating to whether Mr Lee and the Respondent proceeded on the\nbasis that the Respondent was his lawyer, for the Last Will.\n(c)\n\nMrLee’s conduct following the execution of the Last Will\n\n251.The Respondent and Mr LHY said that Mr Lee’s decision to send Ms\nKKL a copy of the Last Will, and (later), the Codicil thereto, showed\n\nthat he regarded Ms KKL as his lawyer for the Last Will'®?.\n252. In our view, these events do not support such an interpretation, For\n\nthe reasons set out below, Mr Lee’s conduct, in the way he handled\nthe originals and copies of both the Last Will, and the Codicil, are\n\nconsistent with him regarding the Respondent as his lawyer.\n\n131 The Respondent’s AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 37.\n132 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 31; Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 54.\n\n80\n\n\f{i}\n\nThe Last Will\n\n253. Mr Lee signed two originals of the Last Will. After the signing, Ms\nWLH informed Mr Lee that the Respondent had sent one of the\noriginals (Original A) to Mr Lee's office for safe-keeping. She told Mr\nLee that the other original (Original B) would be sealed and locked in\n\nthe Respondent's office safe'** (see paragraph 65 above).\n254. Ms WLH asked Mr Lee if he would like to keep Original A in his office\n\nsafe'™*, Alternatively, she suggested that he could pass it to Ms KKL\nfor safekeeping, as Ms KKL was also keeping the originals of Mr\nLee's title deeds to all the properties.\n\n255.Mr Lee initially responded: “Yes, Kwa Kim Li’?9®, However, when Ms\nWLH\n\nreplied to confirm that she would arrange for Ms KKL to safe\n\nkeep Original A’, Mr Lee responded: “You keep original in office and\nsend Kim Lia copy”*’. [Emphasis added.] (See paragraph 66 above.)\n256.Thus, despite Ms WLH’s suggestion to send one of the originals to\nMs KKL, Mr Lee ultimately opted to retain this himself, and send Ms\nKKL a copy instead. This was a departure from the practice for Mr\nLee’s First to Sixth Wills. Ms KKL, who was Mr Lee’s lawyer for these\n\nprevious Wills, had kept the originals for all of them\".\n\n133 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 215 — 216, email from Ms WLH\nso\noO\n2013; 4.29pm.\n\nto Mr Lee and Ms Lilian Ho dated 17 December\n.\n.\n\n184 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 215 — 216, email from Ms WLH to Mr Lee and Ms Lilian Ho dated 17 December\n2013, 4.29pm,\n138 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 215, email from Mr Lee to Ms WLH dated 17 December 2013, 6.38pm.\n136 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 215, email fram Ms WLH to Mr Lee, Mr LHY, the Respondent and Dr LWL dated\n17 December 2013, 7.01pm.\n— 215, email from Mr Lee to Ms WLH dated 17 December 2013, 10.27pm.\n137 1 SS BOD, Vol 1, p 214\n\n138 See LSS’s Opening Submissions (Transcript (1 July 2019), 24:12); see also LSS Submissions for\nNo Case to Answer (3 July 2019) at paras 12(c), 29, LSS Closing Submissions (20 September 2019)\n\nat paras 69(g) and 83, This was not disputed by the Respondent.\n\n81\n\n\f257.Mr Lee also knew that the Respondent would retain the only other\noriginal of the Last Will, in her office safe. He accepted this.\n258. In our view, it is material that Mr Lee chose to have the Respondent,\n\nand not Ms KKL, retain the original of his Last Will. Mr Lee's practice\n(in respect of the First to Sixth Wills), was to have his lawyer retain\nthe originals of his wills. Mr Lee asking the Respondent to keep the\noriginal of his Last Will is consistent with him proceeding on the basis\nthat the Respondent,\n\nand not Ms KKL, was\n\nhis lawyer for the Last\n\nWill. As we discuss below (see paragraphs 395 - 401), the\nRespondent's own conduct, in deciding to keep an origina! of the Last\nWill, was equally relevant.\n(ii)\n\nThe Codicil\n\n259.The Respondent and Mr LHY relied on the events surrounding the\nCodicil, as evidence that Mr Lee regarded Ms KKL, and not the\n\nRespondent,\n\nas his lawyer for the Last Will'%*. Their Affidavits\n\nvariously stated that:\n\n(a)\n\nOn 3 January 2014, Mr Lee, (through Ms WLH), “informed his\nlawyer_KKL, his children, and his 2 daughters-in-law about the\n\nCodicil”.\n(b)\n\nMrLee also ‘insfructed...that a copy fof the Codicil] be sent to\nhis lawyer, KKL, for her records. He did not direct any copy to\nbe sent to Stamford”.\n\n{c)\n\n“This makes it apparent that even until January 2014, Papa\ncontinued to view KKL as his lawyer in respect of his wills”.\n\n138 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 30 and 31; Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras\n\n57 and 58.\n\n82\n\n\f[Emphasis added.]\n260.The suggestion that Mr Lee wanted Ms WLH to inform “his lawyer,\n\nKKL...about the Codicil” is not borne out by the evidence. Ms WLH’s\nemail was expressly addressed specifically to the Respondent\"°. Ms\nKKL was copied as a recipient, just as Mr Lee and the rest of his\nfamily\n\nwere.\n\nMr\n\nLee\n\ndecided\n\nthat\n\nMs\n\nWLH\n\nshould\n\nupdate\n\nthe\n\nRespondent on the Codicil. This is consistent with the evidence that\nhe believed that the Respondent was his lawyer, for the Last Will.\n\n261.Mr LHY said that Mr Lee “aid not direct any copy [of the Codicilj to be\nsent to Stamford’\"*'. [Emphasis added.] However, as stated above,\nMs WLH's email was personally addressed to the Respondent, and\nattached a copy of the Codicil.\n\n262.As regards the Codicil, the Respondent and Mr LHY accepted\"? that\nMr Lee’s Codicil gave effect to his earlier discussions with Ms KKL,\nto bequeath two carpets to Mr LHY (see paragraph 29 above).\n263.We\n\nhave dealt with the three points, in respect of the question\n\nof\n\nwhether Mr Lee and the Respondent proceeded on the basis that the\nRespondent was his lawyer (see paragraph 198 above). That\nquestion,\n\nin turn,\n\nis the first of three\n\nquestions,\n\nwe\n\nconsider,\n\nin\n\ndeciding whether there was an Implied Retainer (see paragraph 176\nabove).\n\n14 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 230, email from Ms WLH to the Respondent, Mr Lee, Mr LHL, Mr LHY, Dr LWL,\nMs Ho Ching and Ms KKL dated 3 January 2014, 10.30am.\n144 Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 58,\n\n142 Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2049) at para 57; Transcript (4 July 2019), 65:22-27, 66:14-16.\n\n83\n\n\f264. We now turn to consider the second question to be considered on\nthe issue of Implied Retainer (see paragraph 176 above), namely, the\n\nRespondent's involvement in the Last Will.\n(2)__\n\nThe actual nature and extent of the Respondent's involvement\n\nin the Last Will\n\n265.The Respondent and Mr LHY’s evidence was that the Respondent\nplayed only a peripheral role in the preparation and execution of the\nLast Will. They gave evidence, inter alia, as follows:\n\n(a)\n\nMr Lee was a brilliant lawyer who\n\nknew “exactly what he\n\nwantfed]\"*.

Mr LHY also\nremoved Ms KKL, from the emails, shortly thereafter (see paragraph\n39 above).\n\n275.One example from Mr LHY’s cross-examination is as follows’:\n“Mr Tan CM:\n\nSo my question is: if you had ~~ could forward a draft to\nyour wife,\n\nwhy don’t you directly forward the draft or\n\nmessage\n\nto Kwa\n\nKim\n\nLi with instructions for her to\n\nengross?\n\nmy\n\nwife\n\nhelps\n\nme\n\nwith\n\nthese\n\nMr LHY:\n\nBecause sometimes\nadministrative tasks.\n\nMr Tan CM:\n\nAgain, that doesn’t seem to answer my question.

This was especially so if, as he said, he\nwas the one who found the draft. It would have been much faster,\neasier, and the best way for Mr LHY to execute Mr Lee’s instructions.\n(As to whether it was Mr LHY who found the draft and sent if to the\nRespondent, see paragraphs 303 - 322 below.)\n167 On the Respondent and Mr LHY's evidence that he had forwarded the draft Last Will to her, see\nparagraphs 303 — 322 of this Decision.\n168 Mir LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 40 and 41; The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras\n14 and 18; Transcript (4 July 2019), 135:12-14; Transcript (5 July 2019), 51:28-29, 54;16-17.\n\n91\n\n\f279.Mr LHY admitted, several times, that he could have gone straight to\n\nMs KKL, instead of involving the Respondent'®.

In addition, the\nRespondent had stated that she was in the midst of a bad “pretravel departure work crisis’, because it was her last day in the\noffice for the year”, There was no credible explanation as to\nwhy she was given this additional task.\n(b)\n\nEven after Mr LHY says he asked the Respondent to help\nsend the draft to Mr Lee and Ms KKL, the Respondent and Mr\n\nLHY continued to send emails and make phone calls about\n\nthe Last Will‘,\n\nthroughout the day, and early the next\n\nmorning‘’5 (see facts set out in Section II(G) above).\n188 Transcript (4 July 2019), 130:11-22, 134:10-21, 138:15-22.\n170 Transcript (5 July 2019), 58: 19-23, see also Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 36.\n47 Transcript (4 July 2019), 130:15.\n\n172 Mir LHY's AEIC (114 June 2019) at para 40; the Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 21; See\nalso Transcript (4 July 2019), 138:15-22.\n\n173 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 14; Transcript (3 July 2019), 72:20-22; Transcript\n(4 July 2019), 86:6-7.\n174 Mir LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 36-45; LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to Mr\nLee, Ms WLH and the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 4.53am; LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 189; email\nfrom Mr LHY to Dr LWL, the Respondent, Ms WLH dated 17 December 2013, 4.54am; LSS BOD, Vol\n1, p 197, email from Mr LHY to is WLH, the Respondent and Mr BL dated 17 December 2013, 11.25am.\nSee paragraphs 39 - 44 of this Decision where the different email correspondence is referred to.\n175 During cross-examination, the Respondent said that Mr LHY had only \"passed the buck’ to her\n“during the day when he was at work’, whereas his exchanges with Mr BL took place in the evening.\n\n(See Transcript (3 July 2019), 110:22-25.) This was inherently incredible — that Mr LHY would have\n\n92\n\n\f(c}\n\nIn\n\nparticular,\n\nMr\n\nLHY\n\nmade\n\nvarious\n\ncalls\n\nand\n\nemailed\n\na\n\nnumber of parties that evening, before he flew off (see Section\nlU(G) above).

But he specifically required\nthe Respondent's\n\nassistance to send the one email, enclosing the\n\ndraft Last Will, to Mr Lee. This must have been to involve the\nRespondent as a lawyer. This is on the assumption that Mr LHY’s\nevidence that it was he who found the draft and sent it to the\nRespondent is true. However, we do not believe that to be the case\n(see paragraphs 303 - 322 below). We have concluded that Mr LHY’s\nevidence is untrue, and that it was the Respondent who found the\ndraft and sent it to Mr Lee. in any event, it does not matter whether it\nwas the Respondent or Mr LHY who found the draft, for the purposes\nof deciding whether there is an Implied Retainer (see paragraph 304\nbelow).\n\ndelegated tasks to her during the day, but stepped up his involvement in the hours and minutes just\n\nbefore he flew off.\n\n176 Mir LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 41.\n\n177 Mr LHY's AEIC (14 June 2019) at para 42.\n178LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 177, email from Mr LHY to Mr Lee, Ms WLH\n\nand the Respondent dated 17\n\nDecember 2013, 4.53am.\n\n93\n\n\f281.Mr LHY also suggested that he had not wanted to contact Ms KKL,\n\nbecause he thought very poorly of Ms KKL, and disliked her'”®. But\nMr LHY had no issues dealing with Ms KKL on Mr Lee’s previous\n\nWills 2°, He was also prepared to call Ms KKL on that day (16\nDecember 2013), to try to speak with her\"®’. It is unclear why an email\nwould have been any more unpleasant.\n282. In addition, if the Respondent and Mr LHY’s intention was to have Ms\nKKL follow-up with the execution, why was the draft Last Will attached?\n\nMs KKL would have the final version of all Mr Lee’s Wills.\n\n283.Mr LHY’s explanation on this shifted in the course of his evidence.\n284. Initially, during cross-examination, Mr LHY accepted that there was\nno need to have attached the draft; he agreed that he could have sent\n\na simple email, and left Ms KKL to follow-up directly with Mr Lee’?\nMr LHY said, at that point, that he had forwarded the draft not for\nKKL's benefit, but for Mr Lee, so that Mr Lee could see the\n\ndocument*®*.\n285.However, during re-examination, Mr LHY changed his position quite\nsubstantially. He said that he had also wanted Ms KKL to see the\ndraft, because he thought very poorly of her, and was afraid she might\n\nuse the wrong will from 201 1184,\n\n179 Transcript (4 July 2019), 127:14; Transcript (5 July 2019), 61:22-26, §5:14-21.\n180 ir LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 19 and 21.\n181 (ar LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at para 35.\n182 Transcript (4 July 2019), 131:1-9.\n183 Transcript (4 July 2019), 130:27-32; Transcript (5 July 2019), 55:3-13.\n\n184 Transcript (5 July 2019), 57:21-58:14.\n\n94\n\n\f286.We do not find this explanation by Mr LHY to be credible either. If this\nwas true, there is no reason why he could not have said so, when first\n\nasked. Further, Mr LHY knew that there had been different drafts of\n\nthe First Will “ffoating back and forth” in 2011'®°, and he had never\nseen the executed version of the First Will'*°. That militates against\nbelieving that he would have known better than Ms KKL, which was\nthe correct draft.\n\n287.The Respondent's email of 7.08pm must also be seen together with\nthe other events that took place that evening.\n288.On\n\nMr LHY\n\nand the Respondent's evidence, they knew before the\n\nRespondent sent her email, that Ms KKL could not be reached and\n\nwas possibly out of town'®?. They sent the email to see if she “might\nbe contactable on emaif’'®. They were therefore alive to the\npossibility that Ms KKL might remain uncontactable, or be unable to\nassist with the Last Will. In Mr LHY’s own words, “if Kim Li responded\n\nand was able fo, she could. If she can’t, she can't.”\"®\n289. They also took other steps, shortly after the Respondent sent Mr Lee\nthe draft Last Will, to arrange for the Last Will to be engrossed and\n\nwitnessed by another lawyer (Mr BL), without Ms KKL (see paragraph\n\n328 below)'®. All this happened without any further attempts to\ncontact Ms KKL'®\", and without waiting for Mr Lee's agreement to\nproceed without her.\n485 Transcript (4 July 2019), 121:11-14.\n168 Mr LHY's AEIC (14 June 2049) at para 22.\n187 Transcript (4 July 2019), 129: 8-23, 132:30-134:5; Transcript (5 July 2019), 1:22-32.\n\n188 Transcript (4 July 2019), 130:25-26, 131:12-13,\n189 Transcript (4 July 2019), 134:8-9.\n19 Transcript (3 July 2019), 33:32-34:24, 40:4-22, 41:22-25; Transcript (4 July 2019), 135:21-30.\n\n181 Transcript (4 July 2019), 63:30 — 64:1, 86:3-7, 132:1-4.\n\n95\n\n\f290.

Itis clear that the Respondent\nintended to send the draft Last Will to Mr Lee, as a lawyer, to advise\nhim that it was as he had wanted, and to assure Mr Lee that it was in\n\norder. Even if it was Mr LHY who found the draft, and sent to the\nRespondent'®, it is her sending it to Mr Lee with her advice, which is\nimportant. It is clear that the Respondent and Mr LHY contemplated\nthe need for a lawyer, other than Ms KKL, to advise Mr Lee on the\ncontents of the draft Last Will. The Respondent’s email gave that\nadvice.\n\n(ii)\n\nDid the Respondent give Mr Lee “advice”?\n\n291. The Respondent also argued that her conduct could not, as a matter\nof law, amount to “advice” because she had only described the draft\nto Mr Lee.\n\n292.Her Counsel relied an the High Court decision in C/FG Special Assets\nCapital | Ltd v Polimet Pte Ltd and others [2016] 1 SLR 1382 (“C/FG\"),\nat [138] as authority for the proposition that: (a) explaining the legal\neffect of a document, does not amount to “advice”, for the purposes\nof an implied retainer, and (b) an implied retainer should oniy be\n\nfound, when a solicitor has gone to the extent of providing advice, for\nthe purposes of safeguarding or advancing the interests of the\nputative client.\n\n293.Having reviewed the judgment in C/FG,\nsupported the Respondent's position.\n\nwe\n\ndid not find that\n\nit\n\n182 See paragraphs 305 — 322 of this Decision, where this question is dealt with.\n\n96\n\n\f294.In CIFG, an implied retainer was alleged to arise between: (a) the\nlawyer acting for the plaintiff, who was party to a proposed agreement,\nand (b) the unrepresented counterparty to the transaction, who was\nthe defendant. The Court found that no implied retainer arose. In\narriving at its decision, the Court took into account the specific duties\nthat arise when a solicitor acts for a client, in a transaction with an\nunrepresented counterparty. In such cases, a solicitor must strike a\nbalance between two competing duties:\n(i)\n\nOn the one hand, the solicitor is under an obligation not to take\n\nunfair advantage of the opposing party: see Rule 53A of the\nPGR (see C/FG at [100]). He therefore owes a duty io the\nunrepresented counterparty to (see C/FG at [101]):\n\n(A)\n\nexplain the terms and conditions of the contract and\nlegal consequences thereof, fully and frankly, to the\n\nunrepresented counterparty; and\n(B)\n\nensure that the unrepresented party understands these\nterms\n\nand\n\nconditions,\n\nand\n\nlegal consequences,\n\nfully\n\n(see CIFG at [126] ~ [128)]).\n\n(ii) | On the other hand, the solicitor also owes a concurrent duty to\nhis own client,\n\nnot to act against the client's interests,\n\n(see\n\nat [132] — [137]). In particular, the solicitor is not\npermitted to act against his client, by giving “advice” to another\nparty, with opposing interests: Rule 30 of the PCR.\nCIFG\n\n295.The Court observed that a solicitor in this situation is placed in “an\ninvidious position’; he owes duties, both his client, and the\nunrepresented\n\nparty\n\nwho\n\nhas\n\ninterests,\n\nthat\n\nare\n\nopposed\n\nto his\n\nclient's (see C/FG at [100] and [101].\n\n97\n\n\f(a)\n\nIf he\n\noverreaches\n\nby\n\nproviding\n\nmore\n\nassistance\n\nto the\n\ncounterparty that he ought to, he could find himself:\n\n(i)\n\nwith a new putative client, if an implied retainer is found;\nand/or\n\n(i)\n\nin breach of his duty, not to act against his (original)\nclient.\n\n(b)\n\nHowever, if he provides less assistance to the unrepresented\n\ncounterparty than he ought to have, he could be blamed for\nhaving taken unfair advantage of third parties.\n296. In view of the balance that has to be struck, between these competing\nduties, the court agreed that the word “advice” in Rule 30 of the PCR\n(and, by extension, for the purposes of an implied retainer) cannot be\n\ngiven its natural and ordinary meaning (see C/FG at [134}). In\nparticular, a solicitors conduct, in explaining the meaning of a\ndocument to an unrepresented counterparty (as his duties under Rule\n53A of the PCR require), should not, in itself, constitute “advice”, for\nthe purposes of Rule 30 of the PCR, and/or an implied retainer (see\nCIFG at [137] and [138]).\n297.The Court’s approach in C/FG is understandable, in the context of\ndealings between a solicitor, and an unrepresented counterparty toa\ntransaction. The ordinary meaning of “advice” is untenable, in such\ncases, because of the solicitor’s concurrent duty to the counterparty,\n\nif the meaning of “advice” is not narrowed. A solicitor will then run the\nrisk of an implied retainer, and/or of being found in breach of Rule 30\nof the PCR whenever he tries to discharge his duty under Rule 53A\nPCR, by explaining the document to the counterparty.\nf the PUR,\norithe\n\n98\n\n\f298.There are clear differences between the facts before us, and those in\nCIFG.\n\nIn\n\nCIFG,\n\nthe\n\nlawyer\n\nin\n\nquestion\n\ntook\n\ncare\n\nto\n\ntell the\n\nunrepresented counterparty that: (a) he was not their lawyer and did\nnot act for them, (b) he could not advise them, and (c) they should\nseek independent legal advice. in addition, the lawyer never took\ninstructions directly from the counterparty. He anly explained the\nterms of the document to them, as he believed it was his duty to do\n\nso, to avoid any unfair advantage to his client. (See C/FG at [125],\n[142], and [150).)\n299. The\n\nfacts before us are quite different. First, the Respondent\n\nnever\n\ntold Mr Lee that she was not his lawyer. To the contrary, she allowed\nhim to believe that she was the lawyer who had drafted the Last Will\n(see paragraph 209 above).\n300. Second, the Respondent never told Mr Lee to seek independent legal\nadvice. This is undisputed. Instead, the Respondent took active steps\nto allow the execution to proceed, without Mr Lee's usual lawyer, Ms\n\nKKL (see paragraphs 327 - 331 below).\n301.Third, as set out hereafter, the Respondent’s involvement in the Last\n\nWill went beyond sending Mr Lee the draft Last Will, and explaining\nits contents to him. She additionally assumed the responsibility of\nmaking all the preparations for Mr Lee’s Last Will, which Ms KKL\nwould ordinarily have handled.\n302. Between\n\nthe evening of 16 December 2013, when Mr Lee received\n\nthe draft from the Respondent, and the morning of 17 December 2013,\nwhen Mr Lee signed the Last Will, no other lawyer advised Mr Lee on\nits contents.\n\n99\n\n\f(iii) Did Mr LHY send the Respondent the draft Last Will for her\nto send to Mr Lee?\n\n303. The Respondent and Mr LHY said that it was Mr LHY who had found,\namongst his emails, what he believed to be the final draft of the First\n\nWill, and that he had then forwarded this on to the Respondent, so\nthat she could follow up with Mr Lee and Ms KKL. Thus, they say, the\nRespondent's role was merely administrative.\n304. The\n\nissue is not, strictly speaking,\n\nmaterial to the question\n\nof the\n\nImplied Retainer. For the reasons explained above, the Respondent\n\nadopted and assumed responsibility for the contents of the draft Last\nWill, vis-a-vis Mr Lee. Thus, even if it was Mr LHY who found the draft,\n\nand sent it to the Respondent,\nRespondent's legal responsibility.\n\nthat does\n\nnot detract from\n\nthe\n\n305.The claim that Mr LHY sent the Respondent the draft Last Will, is\nhowever, not borne out by the evidence. Neither the Respondent nor\n\nMr LHY produced any emails to support their account.\n308.We\n\nfound\n\nthis surprising.\n\nMr LHY\n\nhad\n\nno difficulty locating\n\nother\n\nemails from this period’®®, and even emails pre-dating this period,\n\nfrom 2011 and 20121%4, However, he was unable to produce an email,\nshowing that he had forwarded the draft Last Will to the Respondent\n\n(or Mr BL, as he also claimed (see paragraph 333 below))'®.\n307.Mr LHY attributed this to his policy of deleting emails with\nattachments’; he said that “where documents have been executed\n183 See for example Mr LHY's AEIC (11 June 2019) — Exhibit “LHY~8\", “LHY-10\", \"LHY-11\", “LHY-12”.\n1 See for example Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) — Exhibit “LHY—1” (Email exchange from August\n2044), *LHY-3\" (Email exchange from Sep 2012), “LHY-4” (Email from Oct 2013).\n\n198 Mr LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 37 and 42.\n498 Mr LHY'’s AEIC (41 June 2019) at para 37; Transcript (4 July 2019), 125:13-31.\n100\n\n\fthe hardcopy\n\nand there’s a hardcopy,\n\nbecomes\n\nthe determining\n\none”\"®?, However, if what Mr LHY said is accurate, then it is difficult\nto see why, in 2013, Mr LHY would have kept a draft of the First Will\nfrom 2011, when that First Will had long been executed and itself\nsuperseded by other Wills.\n308. The Defence that the Respondent filed also made no mention of the\n\nfact that it was\n\nMr LHY who\n\nRespondent'®*.\n\nThese\n\nsurfaced the draft Last Will to the\n\nclaims were made,\n\nfor the first time,\n\nin the\n\nafter\n\nthese\n\nRespondent's and Mr LHY’s Affidavits.\n309.These\n\nAffidavits\n\nwere\n\nfiled\n\nin\n\nJune\n\n2019,\n\nmonths\n\nproceedings were started, and years after the questions about the\nLast Will first arose.\n310.In\n\nparticular,\n\nMr LHY's\n\nrole in sending\n\nthe draft Last Will to the\n\nRespondent was not referred to in Mr LHY’s responses to the MC, in\n\n2016 and 2017, despite these documents having been drafted with\n\nthe assistance of lawyers from Rajah & Tan LLP’.\n311.Mr LHY’s explanation for not raising this earlier was inconsistent and\n\nevasive?©.\n312.Mr LHY initially said that his new account was reconstructed evidence,\nrather than based on his actual recollection (as his earlier\nrepresentations to the MC had been). He suggested that these facts\nwere omitted from his letters to the MC because at the time, he had\n\n187 Transcript (4 July 2019}, 126:29-30.\n198 Transcript (3 July 2019), 46:11-17, 75:29 — 76:8.\n\n199 Transcript (4 July 2019), 107:23-30.\n200 Transcript (4 July 2019), 118:20-31.\n\n101\n\n\frelied solely on his recollection. In contrast, he said that after the\nTribunal was convened, he and the Respondent's legal team had put\n\nin “an enormous amount of effort’, to do a “very careful review of\nmany documents, emails” and “based on that... to put together what\n\nwas a complete picture”\".\n313.In other words, based on Mr LHY’s explanation:\n\n(a)\n\nWhat he told the MC was based on his recollection and was\ntherefore not correct; and\n\n(b)\n\nWhat\n\nhe\n\nsaid\n\nto\n\nus,\n\ntwo\n\nyears\n\nlater,\n\nwas\n\nbased\n\non\n\nreconstruction, not his recollection, and was therefore correct.\n\n314. The High Court had cautioned in Lim Ah Leh v Heng Fock Lin [2018]\n\nSGHC 156 at [80]:\n“Reconstructed evidence is of limited value. It is self-serving and is\nparticularly susceptible to the influence of hindsight, It is therefore a\n\nsignificantly weaker form of evidence than evidence from actual\nrecollection.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n315.Mr LHY spoke about his extensive efforts with the Respondent's\nlawyers to reconstruct what happened in order to prepare the\nRespondent's case. He was asked why the Defence was still silent\non his role in sending the draft Last Will to the Respondent. He said\n\nhe had no responsibility for the document”.\n\nBut that does not\n\nanswer the question as to why he did not point out to the Respondent,\n\nthat her Defence should set out this fact (if he had thought it relevant):\n201 Transcript (4 July 201 9), 116:8-19, 118:20-31.\n202 Transcript (4 July 2019), 117:15 — 118:15.\n102\n\n\f“Tan CM:\n\ndid you think it unnecessary to include in this\ndefence [that was filed by Mrs Lee Suet Fern for this\nTribunal] the fact that you were the one who forwarded\na draft to Mrs Lee Suet Fern?\n\nMr LHY:\n\n{ wasn't responsible for preparing this defence.\n\nTan CM:\n\nDid you not think that this was an important [fact] when\nyou assist Mrs Lee Suet Fern in the defence?\n\nMc LHY:\n\nShe’s assisted by a team of lawyers.\n\nTan CM:\n\nSo if this is an important fact, why was this not put in her\n\nWhy\n\ndefence if you had some involvement in helping her with\n\nthe defence?\nMr LHY:\n\nI'm not her lawyer.\n\nTan CM:\n\nAlright.\n\nMr. LHY:\n\n| mean,\n\nthis is not my document.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n316.In addition, when\n\nasked to provide the evidential basis for his new\n\nassertion (i.e. reconstruction (see paragraphs 312 and 313 above)),\nthat he sent the draft to the Respondent,\n\nMr LHY\n\nwas\n\nunable to\n\nprovide an answer.

The latest recollection, however, fits in with the line\n\nof defence put to us during the hearing. Having observed him on the\nwitness stand, it was clear to us that he was not telling the truth. Mr\n\nLHY came up with this untrue explanation, for the purposes of the\nHearing.\n318. The Respondent also said that she did not recall opening or reading\n\nthe draft before sending it to Mr Lee?™.\n319. Even\n\nif this is true, for reasons that have been stated earlier (see\n\nparagraphs 290, and 299 — 302 above), the fact that the Respondent\n\n206 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 16; Transcript (3 July 2019), 73:11 — 74:8, 75.1044.\n\n105\n\n\fdid not read the document, before sending it to Mr Lee, does not\ndetract from her legal responsibility for the document.\n\n320.In addition, we do not find the Respondent's evidence credible. The\n\nRespondent testified that she was “terrified” of Mr Lee”. In particular,\nshe said that “! wouldn't have dared send [the draft Last Will] if | didn’t\nthink that it was what he wanted’, because “if I've got it wrong... I'd\n\nbe shot’. |f that was so, it is difficult to believe that she would have\ngiven\n\nMr\n\nLee\n\nassurance,\n\non\n\nwhat\n\nthe document\n\nwas,\n\nand\n\nthen\n\nforwarded the document on, without first reading it, to make sure that\n\nits contents were in order?°”,\n321. The objective evidence points against the Respondent and Mr LHY’s\nnew account of events. There was no evidence that Mr LHY received\nany draft of the First Will in 2011 (which he claimed that he then sent\non to the Respondent,\n\nin December\n\n2013).\n\nThe\n\nassertion\n\nin his\n\nAffidavit, that he was “privy fo some drafts” of the First Will?8, was\nunsupported,\n\n322.The\n\ndocumentary\n\nevidence\n\navailable showed\n\nthe contrary — that it\n\nwas the Respondent, and not Mr LHY, who had received drafts of the\n\nFirst Will in August 20112°°. The Respondent's email, which sent the\ndraft Last Will to Mr Lee, also made no reference to Mr LHY having\nsent her the draft.\n\n205 Transcript (3 July 2019), 53:9; See also Transcript (3 July 2019), 34:19-20, 36:32 — 37:2, 57:26-27,\n62:26-28.\n\n208 Transcript (3 July 2019), 89: 6; Transcript (4 July 2019), 85:16-19, 86:10-20.\n207 Transcript (3 July 2019), 75:24-26.\n\n208 Mir LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) ai para 19.\n208 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 101, email from the Respondent to Mr Lee and Ms KKL dated 19 August 2011,\n11.08pm.\n\n106\n\n\f323.We now turn to the second point, (b), referred to at paragraph 266\nabove, on the question of the role played by the Respondent in the\nLast Will, by reference to the exclusion of Ms KKL.\n(b)\n\nMs KKL was excluded from being involved in the Last Will\n\n324.The documentary evidence shows that 23 minutes after the\nRespondent sent her email (of 16 December, 7.08pm), Mr LHY sent\na further email to Mr Lee, asking Mr Lee to proceed without Ms KKL\n(see paragraph 39 above). He also removed Ms KKL from the email\nexchange,\n\neven though\n\nMr Lee had\n\nnot decided,\n\nat that point, to\n\nproceed without Ms KKL. This was done with the Respondent's\nknowledge as she was on the emails.\n325.In his email, Mr LHY told Mr Lee?\"°:\n(a)\n\n“I couldn't get in touch with Kim Li. | believe she is away.”\n\n(b)\n\n“i. don’t think it is wise to wait till she is back.”\n\n(c)\n\n“L think all you need is a witness to sign the will.”\n\n(d)\n\n“Fern can get one of her partners to come\n\nround with_an\n\nengrossed copy of the will to execute and witness. They can\ncoordinate it with Lin Hoe for a convenient time.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n326. Thereafter, Ms KKL was not a party to any other correspandence\nbefore the Last Will was signed. On the evidence before us, Ms KKL\nwas not aware of any of the arrangements that the Respondent and\n2101$S BOD, Vol 4, p 177, email from Mr LHY to the Respondent,\nDecember 2013, 7.31pm.\n\nMr Lee and Ms WLH\n\ndated 16\n\n107\n\n\fMr LHY made, for Mr Lee to sign the Last Will.

She found out that Mr Lee had signed\nthe Last Will after the fact, when the Respondent informed her (see\nparagraph 403 below).\n327. The Respondent was copied on Mr LHY’s email of 7.31pm. She also\nexcluded Ms KKL from all further correspondence relating to the Last\nWill, until after it was signed the next day.\n\n328.In addition, the Respondent took immediate steps to arrange for\nanother lawyer to engross and witness the Last Will, without waiting\nfor Mr Lee to decide whether to proceed without Mrs KKL. This\nshowed considerable haste.\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent approached her colleague, Mr BL, to seek\nhis assistance with the execution of the Last Will, and briefed\nhim.

The Respondent and Mr LHY's account is also contradicted by the\n,\nDefence.\n338. Mr LHY said that he called Mr BL, and sent Mr BL the draft before Mr\n\nLHY sent his email of 7.31pm to Mr Lee”? (see paragraph 39 above).\nHowever, this is contrary to the Respondent's pleaded case, that she\nhad “introduced BL to...

Our view is that the Respondent and Mr LHY’s latest accounts of how\nMr BL received the draft Last Will are contrived, and are not honest.\nthe\nwith\ncontradictions\nof\npoints\nnumerous\nare\nThere\ncontemporaneous\n\ndocuments\n\nand the Respondent's\n\nown\n\npleaded\n\ncase.\n341.We now turn to the third point, (c), at paragraph 266 above, relating\n\nto the basis on which Mr Lee decided to execute the Last Will.\n(c)\n\nThe basis on which Mr Lee decided to execute the Last Will\n\n342.Mr Lee acted on the Respondent's advice to him (see paragraphs 32,\n\n273, 289 - 290, and 299 - 301 above), in deciding to proceed to\nexecute the Last Will. There was no other solicitor who gave him\nadvice.\n\n343. Mr LHY then advised Mr Lee to proceed with the execution of the Last\nWill (see paragraph 39 above). Mr Lee agreed with what Mr LHY had\nproposed (see paragraph 41 above) and said:\n\n“Engross and | will sign it before a solicitor in Fer’s office, or from\n\nany other office.” 22\n344. The Last Will was signed the next morning on 17 Decernber 2013, at\n11.10am.\n\n345.We now tum to the fourth point, (d), at paragraph 266 above.\n\n228LS§ BOD, Vol 1, p 182, email from Mr Lee to Mr LHY directing him to proceed without Ms KKL,\ndated 16 Dec 2013 at 9.42 pm.\n\n112\n\n\f(d) The Respondent's role in expediting the execution of the Last Will\n\n346. The Respondent and Mr LHY testified that the Last Will was signed\nin arush, because Mr Lee was anxious and impatient. They said that\nthey became involved, because Ms KKL had failed to get back to Mr\nLee as she had promised, and he wanted the Last Will signed\nurgently.\n347.The considerations which the Respondent and Mr LHY cited did not\nshow any anxiety, on Mr Lee's part.\n348. First, the Respondent and Mr LHY claimed that Mr Lee was\nconcerned about his own mortality, because he had been in poor\nhealth.\n349. It is not disputed that Mr Lee was hospitalised for several weeks, from\n\nSeptember to October 201374.\n350.After\n\nhis discharge,\n\nMr\n\nLee\n\nhad\n\ndiscussed\n\nthe\n\nchanges\n\nto\n\nhis\n\nPenultimate Will with Ms KKL over the course of several weeks (see\nparagraphs 28 and 29 above). The last exchange between them was\non 13 December 2013, just three days before the Respondent and\n\nMr LHY entered the picture. There was no reasonable explanation\ngiven as to why Mr Lee would have suddenly decided, on 16\nDecember 2013, that he wanted the Penultimate Will changed in\nmaterial ways, immediately, on an urgent basis. The Respondent and\n\nMr LHY say that Mr Lee had decided that he wanted to revert to his\n\nFirst Will, made in 2011725.\n\nNo account has been given of any\n\ndiscussions which led Mr Lee to this decision. The Respondent and\nMr LHY do not say that they asked Mr Lee for his reasons for this\ndecision.\n224 Transcript (4 July 2019), 147:1-5.\n225 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 13; Mr LHY's AEIC (14 June 2019) at para 34,\n113\n\n\f351. The way the Last Will was executed is quite different from the way Mr\nLee had handled the First Will and the way he handled discussions\non making\n\nchanges to the Penultimate Will. Mr Lee discussed the\n\nFirst Will with his family and worked with a lawyer (Ms KKL) (see\nparagraphs 16 - 18, 28, and 29 above). He also discussed changes\n\nto his Penultimate Will with Ms KKL over a period of time. The Last\nWill (which superseded the Penultimate Will) was however executed\n\nvery quickly. The evidence shows that it was the Respondent and Mr\n\nLHY who were anxious for the Last Will to be executed quickly and\nrushed it.\n352. These circumstances raise several serious questions.\n353.Why did Mr Lee decide to go back to his First Will of 20117; Did he\nhave the First Will with him?; Did he remember the terms of the First\n\nWill? (The Respondent admitted that Mr Lee cannot be expected to\nremember the terms of his First Will (see paragraph 558 below); Did\nhe know that the Last Will made several significant changes to the\nPenultimate Will (see paragraph 35 above)?; Did he remember that\nonly three days earlier, on 13 December 2013, the position he had\narrived at with Ms KKL was that he would make only two changes to\nthe Penultimate Will and by way of codicil (one of which was to\nequalise the shareholding of the children) (see paragraphs 28 and 29\nabove)? Why did he suddenly change his position and decide to\ncompletely revoke the Penultimate Will?\n\n354.0n the Respondent's and Mr LHY’s evidence, none\nquestions were discussed between Mr Lee and them.\n\nof these\n\n355.The relevance of some of these points are considered\nSection IX(B), when we consider a solicitor's duties.\n\nlater,\n\nin\n\n114\n\n\f356.Leaving aside these questions, for the time being, we did not find\nanything in the evidence to support the Respondent and Mr LHY’s\nstatements that Ms KKL had failed to respond to Mr Lee in a timely\nfashion.\n357.The\n\nRespondent and Mr LHY claimed,\n\nin this regard, that Ms KKL\n\nhad “promised” Mr Lee to have something ready by 15 December\n2013, but had failed to do so.\n\n358. The email exchange between Ms KKL and Mr Lee shows that Ms\nKKL had offered, in her last email to Mr Lee on 12 December 2013,\nto arrange for him to sign a codicil to the Penultimate Will “this week,\n\nor when you are ready’. Mr Lee did not respond to indicate that he\nwanted it done urgently. Nor is there any evidence of Mr Lee having\nattempted to make an appointment with Ms KKL (to sign either a\ncodicil to the Penultimate Will, or a new will) between 12 December\n2013 (when Ms KKL’s email was sent) and 16 December 2013, when\n\nthe Respondent sent her email to Mr Lee, enclosing the draft Last\nWill. If there were such attempts, or if Mr Lee had shown any urgency,\nsuch evidence should have been available to the Estate. The Estate,\nwith Mr LHY as an Executor, has, where it thought necessary, made\navailable evidence for the Respondent, in this matter.\n\n359.Second, Mr LHY said that the timing for the execution was set by Ms\nWLH, who was also anxious to get the Last Will executed. In support\nof this, he referred to Ms WLH’s use of the word “asap” when she\nreplied\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nRespondent's\n\nemail,\n\ninstructing\n\nher\n\nto\n\nmake\n\narrangements with Mr BL to execute the Last Will (see paragraph 48\nabove)**’, Mr LHY’s interpretation was that Ms WLH had herself “the\n\n228 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 167, email from Ms KKL to Mr Lee dated 12 December 2013, 12.48pm.\n\n227 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 194, email from Ms WLH to Mr LHY, the Respondent and Mr BL dated 17 Dec\n2013, 9.23am; Transcript (5 July 2019), 8:20-21.\n\n115\n\n\fsame\n\nsense\n\nof urgency’,\n\n“independent\n\nof us [himself and\n\nthe\n\nRespondentf??8,\n360. The suggestion that Ms WLH had acquired this sense of urgency from\nMr Lee is speculative, and unsupported by any evidence. There is no\nevidence that Ms WLH spoke or otherwise communicated with Mr\nLee on this matter, before she had sent the email at 9.23am on 17\nDecember 2013.\n361.Ms WLH received multiple emails from the Respondent and Mr LHY\nthrough the night. The Respondent had herself used the same term,\n\n“asap”, in her correspondence with Mr BL, just minutes before Ms\nWLH sent her email.\n\n362.When\n\nMs KKL could not be contacted,\n\nit was Mr LHY who told Mr\n\nLee: “/ don’t think it is wise to wait...” (see paragraph 39 above).\n\n363. The Respondent also took steps to arrange for Mr BL to help with the\nexecution, even before Mr LHY approached Mr Lee to suggest\n\nproceeding without Ms KKL?*°, and before Mr Lee agreed to proceed\nwithout Ms KKL (see paragraphs 38 — 42 above).\n364. In addition, both the Respondent and Mr LHY repeatedly emphasised\nthe need to execute the Last Will as quickly as possible, in their\ncorrespondence with Mr BL, the morning that the Last Will was signed\n(see paragraphs 46 - 49 above):\n\n(a)\n\nIn Mr LHY’s email of 5.32am, he told Mr BL to “get it engrossed\n\ntoday’.\n\n228 Transcript (6 July 2019), 6:26 — 7:5, 8:19-22,\n228 Mir LHY’s AEIC (11 June 2019) at paras 41 - 43; Transcript (5 July 2019), 53:3-11.\n116\n\n\f(b)\n\nIn the Respondent's email of 9.22am, she told Mr BL to “be\n\nready and accessible at short notice...lmpt that we get this\ndone asap please’.\n(c)\n\nShe repeated a minute later, at 9.23am, that Mr BL should \"be\ngood to run”.\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n365.Based on the evidence, it was the Respondent and Mr LHY who\nproceeded with the execution of the Last Will quickly, while knowing\nthat Mr Lee would not be advised by any lawyer except the\nRespondent. The Respondent worked with Mr LHY to expedite the\nsigning of the Last Will, with extreme haste, without any other lawyer\nadvising Mr Lee. The Last Will was signed within 16 hours of the\nRespondent's first email to Mr Lee enclosing the draft Last Will.\n366. We now turn to the fifth point, (e), in paragraph 266 above.\n\n(e) The Respondent’s involvement in the lead-up to the execution of\nthe Last Will\n\n367.The\n\nsaid\n\nRespondent\n\nin her Affidavit that\n\nshe\n\n“no further\n\nhad\n\ninvolvement’ in the Last Will after she sent her email of 8.12pm to Mr\n\nBL, Ms WLH and Mr LHY~*? (see paragraph 40 above). Her evidence\nwas\n\nshown\n\nto\n\nbe\n\nuntrue\n\nwhen\n\nMr\n\nBL's\n\nevidence\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nBL\n\nDocuments were put before us by the Law Society (see paragraphs\n184 - 190 above).\n368.The\n\nBL\n\nDocuments,\n\nRespondent's\n\nand\n\ninvolvement\n\nMr\n\nwent\n\nAffidavit,\n\nshowed\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nsignificantly\n\nbeyond\n\nthe\n\ntwo\n\nBL's\n\n280 Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 20 and 27..\n\n117\n\n\f“administrative tasks”, of forwarding the Last Will, and introducing Mr\n\nBL.\n\n369. After the Respondent introduced Mr BL to Ms WLH and Mr LHY at\n8.12pm (see paragraph 40 above), various emails were exchanged\nbetween the Respondent,\n\nMr LHY, Ms WLH\n\nand/or Mr BL, until the\n\nnext morning, before the Last Will was signed. Many of these emails\nwere also sent to, or by, the Respondent. They have been referred to\nat Section IlI(G) above.\n\n370.Even after the Respondent had boarded her flight to Paris®*', she\ncontinued to monitor the progress of arrangements for execution, and\nremained in close contact with Mr BL, who sent her regular updates.\n\n(a)\n\nAt 9.22am on 17 December 2013, the Respondent told Mr BL\n\nto be “ready and accessible at short notice’; to be “ready to\ngo”. She told him that it was “/mpt that we get this done asap”\n232\n\n(b)\n\nA minute later, Mr BL replied to the Respondent, to note her\n\ninstructions?°>.\nAt the same time, Ms WLH also replied to the Respondent's\nemail of 8.12pm the previous night, thanking the Respondent\n\nfor Mr BL’s contact information, and informing the Respondent\nthat she would arrange for Mr BL to see Mr Lee, as soon as\n\npossible?**,\n\n231 Transcript (1 July 2019), 22:4-12; Transcript (3 July 2019), 59:1-3.\n282 LSS SBOD, p 10, email from the Respondent to Mr BL dated 17 December 2013, 9.22am.\n283 LSS SBOD, p 9, email from Mr BL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 9.23am.\n\n24 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 194, email from Ms WLH to the Respondent, Mr LHY and Mr BL dated 17\nDecember 2013, 9.23am.\n\n118\n\n\f(d)\n\nThe\n\nvery\n\nnext\n\nminute,\n\n(at 9.24am),\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nsent\n\nanother email to Mr BL, emphasising again that he must “be\ngood fo run”.

She maintained her position\nthat she had “handed over’ the arrangements for execution after she\n\nintroduced BL to WLH?°8. She gave a number of explanations for her\nemail exchanges with Mr BL:\n(a)\n\nFirst,\n\nshe\n\nsaid\n\n“merely...seeing\n\nher\n\nexchanges\n\nwith\n\nthrough\n\na favour\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nthat\n\nBL\n\nwere\n\nit’s properly\n\n235 (SS SBOD, p 9, email from the Respondent to Mr BL dated 17 December 2013, 9.24am.\n238 |SS SBOD, p 9, email from Mr BL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 10.13am.\n237 LSS SBOD, p 8, email from Mr BL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 10.35am.\n238 Transcript (3 July 2019), 52:30 - 53:9, 66:26 - 67:9.\n\n119\n\n\fdone”*9; they just reflected “some anxiety’ that Mr BL be\n\nready, and did not constitute making arrangements”.\n(b)\n\nSecond, she claimed that she was “just a conduit’, and that Mr\nBL was “communicating to Yang through [herf’™\".\n\n373.The BL Documents,\n\nand the facts set out in Section II(G) above,\n\nshow that contrary to her evidence, that she had “no involvemen?\n\nafter her email of 8.12pm, the Respondent remained closely involved\nin preparing the Last Will for execution. She made the arrangements\nthat a lawyer would normally make.\n374.In addition, the BL Documents show that the Respondent continued\nthis engagement even after the Last Will was signed (see paragraphs\n380 - 384, and 389 - 394 betow). She did so with Mr BL, and also with\nMs EK, and her other colleagues in Stamford Law, who helped with\n\nthe Last Will.\n375.In total, the Respondent exchanged more than 15 emails with Mr BL\nand\n\nher other colleagues at Stamford\n\nLaw.\n\nHer Affidavit made\n\nno\n\nmention that any of this had taken place.\n376. We now turn to the sixth point, (f), in paragraph 266 above.\n(f) The Respondent's involvement after the execution of the Last Will\n\n377.After the Last Will was executed, the Respondent assumed\nresponsibility to coordinate the follow-up, and remained closely\ninvolved in all the arrangements.

She asked the Respondent: “does\nthis mean that he has signed a new will yesterday fie. On 16\nDecember 2013]...?” Ms KKL indicated that if that were the case, “fhe\nformer will which is on my record, is revoked”, and “I will update my\nfile record’.\nRespondent replied, informing Ms KKL: “Yes, he has signed\nalready. In fact this is just going back to his 2011 will so it supercedes\nall. He read it extremely carefully before signing.” (see paragraph 63\n\n405. The\n\nabove).\n406. In this regard:\n\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent's initial update to Ms KKL was perfunctory—\n\nshe only told Ms KKL that the Last Will had been “dealt with”.\nAfter Ms KKL asked further questions,\nprovided some additional information.\n(6)\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nThe Respondent did not provide Ms KKL with a copy of the\nexecuted Last Will, nor did she share with Ms KKL the details\n\n280 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 208, email from the Respondent to Ms KKL dated 17 December, 1.16pm,\n\n127\n\n\fon what transpired during the signing, which\nupdated her on (see paragraph 59 above).\n(c)\n\nMs\n\nhad\n\nEK\n\nThe Respondent also did not correct Ms KKL, and explain that\nthe Last Will was signed on 17 December\n\n2013,\n\nnot on 16\n\nDecember 2013 (as Ms KKL had thought).\n\n407. The Respondent obviously regarded herself (and not Ms KKL) as the\nlawyer for the Last Will, and tock all the steps for the execution of the\nLast Will, including getting a draft, and advising Mr Lee on it. She took\ncharge at every stage of the process, and directed the arrangements\nleading up to, and after the signing, of the Last Will.\n408.We now consider the third point, on the issue of Implied Retainer,\nreferred to at paragraph 176 above, relating to the nature and extent\n\nof Ms KKL’s involvement in the Last Will.\n(3) What was\n\nthe nature and\n\nextent of Ms\n\nKKL’s\n\ninvolvement\n\n(Mr\n\nLee’s usual lawyer) in the Last Will?\n\n409. The Respondent and Mr LHY said that Ms KKL was Mr Lee’s lawyer\n\nfor the Last Will, as she had been for all his Wills\". They said that\nsince Ms KKL was copied in the Respondent's initial email to Mr Lee,\nMs KKL could have interjected at any time, if she thought that the\n\ndraft from the Respondent was not in order?®.\n410.Having considered the evidence, we are unable to accept these\nassertions.

The evidence set out earlier (see paragraphs 323 - 328 above)\nshows that Ms KKL had no involvement in the preparation, or\nexecution, of the Last Will.\n413. The Respondent and Mr LHY’s assertions (see paragraph 409 above)\nare also contradicted by their own conduct at the material time.\n414,The\n\nRespondent\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nLHY\n\nexcluded\n\nMs\n\nKKL\n\nfrom\n\nall the\n\ncorrespondence”®*.

That\n\nis plainly\n\nincorrect. These were matters-that Ms KKL would have handled if she\n\nwas Mr Lee's lawyer, just as she had done for all his other Wills.

The Respondent was the one who started\nsome of the ensuing email chains in connection with. the\n\nexecution of the Last Will?®,\n(b)\n\nShe did no “active removal’ Ms KKL by withdrawing her initial\n\nemail, or by asking Ms KKL to “stand down\"?®”.\nHowever,\n\nMr\n\nLHY\n\nexcluded\n\nMs\n\nKKL’s\n\ninvolvement\n\nand\n\nproceeded quickly with the execution of the Last Will, without\ngiving Ms KKL a reasonable opportunity to respond. The\nRespondent and Mr LHY knew that Ms KKL might be out of\nSingapore, and proceeded on that basis.\n\n417.For completeness, we should also mention that the Law Society\nsuggested that Ms KKL had not received the Respondent's email of\n7.08pm (see paragraph 32 above)*®®. The Law Society relied on Ms\nKKL's email to the Respondent, saying: “! don’t seem fo have\n\nreceived your first mail of 16 dec 7.08pm asking me to engross”**.\nWe do not need to, and do not make a finding on this, beyond noting\nthat Ms KKL has said that she did not receive the email.\n\n285 Transcript (3 July 2019), 77:3-4, 78:18-17, 79:8-11.\n\n288 See for example LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 179, email from the Respondent to Ms WLH, Mr LHY and Mr\nBL dated 16 December 2013 at 8.12pm, LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 200, email from the Respondent to Mr LHY\ndated 17 December 2013 at 12.13pm, and LSS SBOD p 14, email from the Respondent to Mr BL, Ms\nJoyce Han, Ms Clara Ng and Ms EK dated 17 December 2013 at 12.26pm,\n267 Transcript (3 July 2019), 33: 27-30, 41:10-11, 80:7-8, 86:27, 88:1-3; Transcript (4 July 2019), 63:26 & 26-28,\n268 Transcript (3 July 2019), 87:27 ~ 88:4; Transcript (4 July 2019), 83:14,\n\n269 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 208, email from Ms KKL to the Respondent dated 17 December 2013, 2.59pm.\n\n130\n\n\f(b) Mr _Lee’s discussion\nPenultimate Will\n\nwith\n\nMs\n\nKKL_on\n\nthe\n\nCodicil\n\nto\n\nthe\n\n418. The Respondent also referred to some earlier emails between Mr Lee\nand Ms KKL (see paragraphs 28 and 29 above), as evidence that Ms\nKKL had, priorto 16 December 2013, already advised Mr Lee on the\nchanges that he wanted to make to the Penultimate Will.\n\n419.Mr Lee’s prior discussions with Ms KKL,\n\nas evidenced\n\nby these\n\nemails, were unrelated to the Last Will, and did not touch on all of the\nchanges that the Last Will effected, either to the Penultimate Will or\n\nthe First Will. The Respondent offered no other evidence on this point.\n420. The documents presented to us prima facie show that Mr Lee and Ms\nKKL discussed an entirely different (and more limited) approach: a\ncodicil to the Penultimate Will, that would make two specific changes\n(see paragraphs 28, 29 and 37 above).\n\n421.The Last Will also omitted changes which Mr Lee had discussed with\nMs KKL (see paragraph 36 above).\n422.To the Respondent and Mr LHY's knowledge, the Respondent was\nthe only lawyer who had advised Mr Lee on the Last Will before it was\nsigned.

In April 2019, the Law Society's lawyers wrote to Ms KKL, to request\na meeting with her, inter alia, to discuss?”*.\n(a)\n\nA public statement which Ms KKL had issued in June 2017,\n\nstating that she did not prepare the Last Will?”;\n(b)\n\nHer email to the Respondent on 17 December 2013, asking if\n\nMr Lee had signed a new will (see paragraph 404 above), and\n(c)\n\n425.Ms\n\nMs WLH's email on 3 January 2014 (see paragraph 72 above),\nregarding the Codicil.\nKKL\n\nresponded\n\nto inform the Law\n\nSociety's\n\nlawyers\n\nthat the\n\nExecutors had objected to her participation in any discussion with\n\nthem “regarding the documents referred to...and any information or\ndocuments pertaining to my engagement as Mr Lee’s solicitor?”\n426. The effect of these restrictions was to prohibit Ms KKL from giving her\naccount (to the Law Society) of what transpired, vis-a-vis the Last Will.\nShe was barred from even explaining why she had no role in the Last\nWill (see paragraph 424(a) above).\n\n271 Transcript (5 July 2019}, 60:1-21, 63:2-3.\n\n272 Transcript (5 July 2019), 60:27-62:22.\n273 Ms KKL issued her statement to the media in response to a Facebook post put up by Mr LHY\n\n(Transcript (5 July 2019), 62:15-16; LSS Closing Submissions (20 September 2019) at para 152 and fn\n161). Mr LHY’s Facebook post stated that “/ifhe will was drafted by Kwa Kim Li of Lee & Lee” (sea\n\nfurther paragraphs 486 — 496 of this Decision),\n274 Transcript (5 July 2019), 60:27-61:7.\n\n132\n\n\f427.We found it difficult to see how this could be founded on a valid claim\nof privilege,\n\nparticularly\n\non\n\nMs\n\nKKL’s\n\nposition\n\nthat she\n\nwas\n\nnot\n\ninvolved in the Last Will. The Law Society said that it did not call Ms\nKKL, because of the arguments relating to privilege, and because her\nevidence on the contents of Mr Lee's First to Sixth Wills was no longer\nnecessary after the Estate’s attempts (in OS 639) to preclude the Law\nSociety's production of these Wills had failed”.\n428.We\n\nnote that it was\n\nopen\n\nto the\n\nLaw\n\nSociety to have\n\nissued\n\na\n\nsubpoena to Ms KKL and tested the argument on privilege. But the\nLaw Society did not do so.\n428.The\n\nRespondent\n\ndishonesty\n\nand Mr LHY also levelled serious allegations of\n\nand misconduct against Ms KKL\n\nbefore us?’*. They\n\nalleged that Ms KKL had lied, by saying that she had no involvement\nin the Last Will, and concealed her discussions with Mr Lee, regarding\n\nthe Codicil to the Penultimate Will?””. The Respondent also disclosed\ncommunications between Mr Lee and Ms KKL, regarding the Codicil,\n\nwhich were prima facie privileged (the Estate was of course entitled\nto waive that privilege and appears to have so waived). However, the\nEstate objected to Ms KKL giving evidence on these matters based\non assertion of privilege.\n430. During cross-examination, Mr LHY said that the Law Society could\n\nhave subpoenaed Ms KKL?’®. if it disagreed with the claim of privilege.\n275 Transcripts (1 July 2019), 5:28 ~ 6:18.\n\n278 Mir LHY also repeated this allegation against Ms KKL publicly, whilst these proceedings were\npending (see paragraph 493 of this Decision).\n\n27 Transcript (3 July 2019), 93:6-7, 95:25-27; Transcript (4 July 2019), 94:27 — 95:6; Transcript (5 July\n2018), 30:18-20, 60:7-8.\n278 The Respondent and Mr LHY referred, a number of times, to the Law Society's eventual decision\nnot to subpoena Ms KKL as a witness.

Her Counsel submitted that Ms KKL’s response to the Law\nSociety had only conveyed the Estate’s objection “to her participation\nin any meeting or discussion with Law Society’; the Estate did not\n\nobject to her “testifving in these proceedings\" *”®. [Emphasis added.]\n432. This contradicted what Mr LHY had told this Tribunal?®°.\n\"Tan CM:\n\nCan\n\n| just ask,\n\ndid the estate\n\nobject to Kwa\n\nKim\n\nLi\n\ntestifying before this Tribunal?\nMr LHY:\n\n| think we were asked whether she could testify and /\nbelieve we were concerned about privilege, | suppose,\n\ngiven\n\nhow\n\nWei\n\nand\n\nLing\n\n| see\n\nthat\n\nshe’s\n\nbeen\n\neconomical with the truth, she is free to testify on issues\n\nwhich don’t regard privilege but to the extent that there\nare_issues which shows privilege to the estate, she\nneeds to clear it with the estate but Kim Li has been, |\nsuppose,\n\non\n\ninstructions and\n\nseveral\n\nthen\n\noccasions\n\nacknowledged\n\ndidn’t do and carry out those\n\ninstructions...and my sister...and | are concerned about\n\nthat.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, it is not in dispute that Ms KKL had no involvement in the events of 16\nand 17 December 2013, and never advised Mr Lee on the specific contents of the Last Will. Nor is it\nthe Respondent's case that Mr Lee had spoken with Ms KKL, beyond what the email set out. {Had that\nbeen the case, it would have been for the Respondent to call Ms KKL.) As such, it is for the tribunal to\ndraw the appropriate interferences on the issue of retainer based on the unchallenged facts and\n\nobjective evidence,\n\n278 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 99.\n\n280 Transcript (5 July 2019), 60:4-21. See also Transcript (3 July 2019), 92:21-23, where the\nRespondent said she was aware that the Estate had written to Ms KKL to “object to her [Ms KKL's)\nparticipation in these proceedings\".\n\n134\n\n\fTan CM:\n\nMy question is very simple. Did the estate object to Kwa\nKim Li appearing before this Tribunal?\n\nMr LHY:\n\n| can’t remember the exact answer that R&T gave but |\nthink we will have asserted privilege.\"\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n433.1n this regard, Ms KKL's response to the Law Society was also read\nfo Mr LHY, whilst he was on the stand. His response (which the\n\nRespondent cited in her Closing Submissions) was as follows”**:\n(a)\n\nMs KKL “could be subject to subpoena, she could appear here\nand she would be giving evidence”. These was nothing that\n“prevented her from appearing at this Tribunal’.\n\n(b)\n\nIf Ms KKL was subpoenaed, she was “free to testify on any\nissues which are not privileged. And if there are issues which\nare privileged then, you know, they are subject to privilege.”\n\n(c)\n\n“TIF you ask me whether the estate should assert privilege, |\nthink that’s safeguarding the interests of the estate.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n434.The Respondent's statements are at odds with what Mr LHY had said.\n\nHis position before the Tribunal confirmed his intention to continue to\nassert privilege, in the same terms as Ms KKL had set out to the Law\nSociety, if she was called as a witness (see paragraphs 424 — 425\nabove). Mr LHY had even objected to Ms KKL explaining why she\nhad no role in the Last Will (see paragraph 426 above).

Itis clear that Mr LHY and the Respondent\nMs KKL to give any evidence on what role she played in the Last Will.\n435. Having considered the three questions at paragraph 176, we will now\nset out our conclusions on the question of Implied Retainer.\n(C)\n\nConclusion on question of Implied Retainer\n\n436. The Respondent (inter alia):\n\n(a)\n\nTook instructions from Mr Lee on the Last Will;\n\n(b)\n\nAdvised Mr Lee on the Last Will;\n\n(c)\n\nSent Mr Lee a draft of the Last Will, and assured him that: (i)\nit equalised the shares to be received by the three children,\nfrom the Estate (and was therefore in accordance with what\n\nMr Lee wanted); and (ti) that it was in the same terms as the\n\nFirst Will;\n\n(d)\n\nGave\n\ninstructions\n\nto\n\ncolleagues\n\nin\n\nher\n\nlaw firm,\n\non\n\nthe\n\nexecution of the Last Will;\nExcluded Mr Lee's usual lawyer, Ms KKL, from the process;\n\nff)\n\nKept the original of the Last Will in her office safe, after it had\nbeen executed;\n\n(g)\n\nKnew\n\nthat Mr\n\nLee\n\nhad\n\nbeen\n\ntold that she was\n\nprimarily\n\nresponsible for drafting the Last Will; and\n\n136\n\n\f(i)\n\nSubsequently conveyed to AGC that Mr Lee had instructed\nher, on the drafting of the Last Will, a position which had also\n\nearlier been confirmed by Mr LHY, to the MC.\n437.As far as the Respondent knew:\n(a)\n\nNo one, other than she, had advised Mr Lee on the Last Will;\n\n(b)\n\nof the First Will (as\nopposed to the inaccurate version that the Respondent had\nNo one showed\n\nMr Lee a\n\ntrue copy\n\nsent him);\n\n(c)\n\nNo one advised Mr Lee of the differences between the First\nWill, and the draft Last Will that the Respondent sent to him;\n\n(d)\n\nNo one advised Mr Lee on the differences between the draft\nLast Will, and the Penultimate Will; and\n\n(e)\n\nNo one advised\n\nMr Lee that the draft Last Will was very\n\ndifferent from what he had agreed with Ms KKL, on how his\nPenultimate Will should be amended.\n438.On\n\nthese\n\nfacts,\n\nit is clear,\n\nbeyond\n\nreasonable\n\ndoubt,\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nRespondent acted as Mr Lee's fawyer on the Last Will. There was an\nImplied Retainer.\n\n(D)\n\nThe positions that the parties had taken previously, in respect\nof some of the questions that arose before us\n\n439.For completeness, we should also deal with one additional matter.\nThis is in respect of what was said to the MC, to AGC,\n\nand to the\n\npublic, in relation to the Respondent’s involvement in the Last Will.\n\n137\n\n\f440.These issues were raised in both parties’ pleadings, and were\ncovered in some detail when the Respondent and Mr LHY took the\nstand, Substantial submissions were also made to us on these points\nby both parties. While they do not affect our conclusions, they relate\n\nto positions taken by the Respondent and Mr LHY, at an earlier point\nin time, on some of the key issues before us. In particular, they relate\n\nto the Respondent's role in the Last Will. We will therefore set out our\nviews on these points.\n\n(1) The MC\n441,The MC raised a number of questions to the Executors concerning\n\nthe preparation of the Last Will?**. In a letter from the MC to the\nExecutors on 25 April 201778, the MC raised, inter alia, the following\nqueries:\n(a)\n\nWhether a lawyer advised Mr Lee on the Last Will and, if so,\nwho this lawyer was;\n\n(b) | Thenature of the Respondent's involvement in the preparation\nof the Last Will; and\n(c)\n\nFor a copy of the contemporaneous attendance notes for the\nexecution of the Last Will, which the Executors had referred to\n\nin their earlier letter of 28 Feb 2017 (see also paragraph 185(c)\nabove).\n\n282 MC report on 38 Oxley Road (2 April 2018), Annex C, at para 9 (httes:/Awww.pmo.gov.sq/imedia/PMO/Newsroom/Files/Media-Release/MC Report 38 Oxley Road Annex C.odij.\n283 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 443 ~ 446 at paras 6 — 8, Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for Nationa!\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n\n138\n\n\fThe MC sent this letter, as a follow up, in response to certain points\nthat had been made by the Executors to the MC764.\n442.The MC's letter also invited the Respondent to set out her position on\nthe questions raised.\n\ninitially responded to indicate that they would be\ntravelling, and that the earliest they would be able to reply (if at all)\nwas end June2®, However, on 14 June 2017, two weeks before the\nend-June deadline, they released a public statement, taking issue\nwith the MC and its work. They also wrote to the MC later that day,\n\n443.The\n\nExecutors\n\ninforming the MC that they had decided to “disengage”.\n444, As such, the questions raised in the MC’s letter of 25 April 2017 were\nnever\n\nanswered.\n\nThe\n\nRespondent\n\nalso\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\nrespond\n\nto the\n\nCommittee directly to set out her position.\n445. In the present proceedings, the Law Society pleaded in its Statement\nof Case that “the Respondent was invited to set out her\nposition...There was no response from the Respondent to the\n\nCommittee's invitation’®”.\n446. The Respondent denied this assertion in her Defence. She pleaded\nthat “tJhe Ministerial Committee had never written to the Respondent\n\nfor any clarification’”**. She also took a similar position in her Affidavit,\nand suggested that she had never been involved in the MC work,\n284 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 408, Letter from Mr LHY and Dr LWL to the MC dated 28 February 2017.\n285 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 479 at para 11, Letter from Mr LHY and Dr LWL to Mr Lewrence Wong, Minister\nfor National Development, dated 12 May 2017.\n286 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 506 at para 6, Letter from Mr LHY and Dr LWL to Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister\nfor National Development, dated 14 June 2017.\n\n287 Statement of Case at para 34.\n288 Defence at para 56.\n\n139\n\n\feither directly, or through Mr LHY and\n\nDr LWL.\n\nShe said in her\n\nAffidavit that?8°:\n(a)\n\n“The Ministerial Committee never wrote to me to seek my\nviews or responses”.\n\n(b)\n\n“Yang and Ling...did not seek any input from me...”°°.\n\n447.The Respondent's assertions are contrary to the contemporaneous\ndocumentary evidence. They were also contradicted by her testimony\non the stand.\n(a) Did the MC seek the Respondent's views?\n\n448. The Respondent’s assertion that the MC “never wrote” to her “to seek\n[her] views or responses’, conveys the untrue impression that the MC\nhad not sought the Respondent's views.\n\n449. The language of the MC’s letter to the Executors on 25 April 2017\nwas as follows:\n\n“In view of the questions which have been raised regarding Mrs [Lee\nSuet Fern’s] involvement in the Last Will, the Committee would like\nto invite her to set out her position,\n\nand would also ask if she is\n\nprepared to do so by way of a statutory declaration’?*\".\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n288 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 35.\n289 Mr LHY took a similar position during cross-examination: see Transcript (4 July 2019), 105:27-31;\n106:22-26; 113:19 - 114:4.\n281 LSS BOD, Vol 4, p 452 at para 7, Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development,\nto Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 25 April 2017.\n\n140\n\n\f450. During cross-examination, the Respondent admitted that she was\nindeed told, around the time of the letter, that the MC had sought her\n\nviews?®? (see also paragraph 453 below).\n451.The\n\nRespondent\n\nmade\n\nsimilar\n\nuntrue\n\nstatements,\n\nin\n\nher\n\ncorrespondence with AGC:\n(a)\n\n| The Respondent’s letter to AGC on 19 November 2018? said\nthat “your assertion... that the Committee wrote to_me is\nplainly wrong...Please let me have a copy of this letter of 25\nApril 2017 written to me by the Committee that you cite.”\n\n(b)\n\nHer letter to AGC on 3 December 2018\n\nreiterated that “ft/he\n\nMinisterial\n\n_through_its\n\nCommittee...\n\nhad\n\nnever\n\nlengthy\n\ndeliberations written to me to enquire about Mr Lee’s Will...”\n{Emphasis added.]\n\n452.The\n\nRespondent's\n\nevidence\n\non the stand was\n\nevasive,\n\nand\n\nnot\n\ncoherent. Her positions shifted repeatedly, and were not credible.\n\n453. Initially, the Respondent refused to admit that she had even seen the\n\nMC’s letter of 25 April 2017295. After Counsel for the Law Society\npointed her to the Committee’s express\n\ninvitation “fo set out her\nposition” (see paragraph 449 above), she admitted that she was told\nabout this request.\n\n2% Transcript (4 July 2019), 28:26-31, 30:16-22.\n28 1 SS BOD, Vol 1, p 788, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 19 November 2048.\n294 1 SS BOD, Vol 1, p 795 at para 2, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 3 December 2018.\n285 Transcript (4 July 2018), 26:19 — 27:12.\n\n141\n\n\f454.

These reasons contradict each other. If the Respondent believed that\nthe MC was a “witch hunt’, as she claimed, why would she consider\nresponding, even if the MC wrote to her personally? In addition, the\nMC had raised serious questions about the propriety of the\nRespondent’s involvement in the Last Will (see paragraph 441\nabove). Even if a reply was “voluntary”, as a senior lawyer with more\nthan 30 years’ experience, why would the Respondent leave these\nserious allegations unanswered as a matter of record, if they were\n\nindeed untrue, and without merit?\n458. There are inherent difficulties with the Respondent's evidence. Our\nconclusion is that she had not wanted to answer the MC’s questions,\nabout her role in the Last Will.\n\n(b) Did Mr LHY and Dr LWL seek views from the Respondent on\ntheir representations to the MC?\n459.The\n\ncontemporaneous\n\ncorrespondence\n\nalso\n\nshows\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nRespondent’s assertion, that Mr LHY and Dr LWL “did not seek any\ninput’ from her on their representations to the MC, is also untrue.\n\n460.0On 16 December 2016°2, the MC wrote to Mr LHY and Dr LWL,\nattaching a summary of Mr LHL’s responses to them. The summary,\nwhich was attached, stated that there were “serious questions’\nregarding “The circumstances leading to the execution of the Last\nwiir?3,\n\n302 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 359, Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister for National Development, to Mr\n\nLHY and Dr LWL dated 16 Dec 2016.\n\n208 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 364 — 362 at para 10, Letter from Mr Lawrence Wong,\nDevelopment, to Mr LHY and Dr LWL dated 16 Dec 2016, Annex.\n\nMinister for National\n\n143\n\n\f461.Two days later, on 18 December 2016°+, the Respondent emailed\nMr BL and Ms EK, to check if a doctor had been present, when Mr\nLee signed the Last Will.

These emails were\namongst the BL Documents, which the Respondent did not produce\n(see paragraphs 182 - 193 above).

In particular, they had asked her to\ncheck with Mr BL if a doctor was present, when Mr Lee signed\n\nthe Last Will.\n(b) | The Respondent thus emailed Mr BL and Ms EK, on Mr LHY\n\nand Dr LWL's behalves, to check. As part of the resulting email\nexchange, Ms EK had sent the Respondent a copy of her\ncontemporaneous EK Attendance Note from 17 December\n\n2013.\n(c)\n\nThe Respondent then passed the EK Attendance Note on to\n\nMr LHY and Dr LWL, which they then used for their response\nto the MC.\n466. These statements contradicted what the Respondent had said in her\nAffidavit. Further, Mr LHY had said to the MC that Mr Lee instructed\nthe Respondent (see paragraphs 224 - 225 above). The Respondent\n\nwas obviously involved and knew about the responses being given\nby the Executors.\n467.The Respondent attempted to reconcile the material contradictions.\nHer explanations were not credible. She prevaricated, and changed\nher evidence on the issue, several times. She eventually suggested\n\nthat there had been “a smal! misunderstanding” because she had a\ndifferent concept of what giving ‘input’ entailed®°®. According to the\nRespondent, she had said that the Executors did not seek “input”\nfrom her, because they did not come to her “in any formal way”, and\n\nshe “didn’t have contro! over the process.\n\nWe found this to be\n\n308 Transcript (4 July 2019), 52:11-16.\n309 Transcript (4 July 2019), 46:24-30.\n\n145\n\n\fcontrived. The Respondent said this to avoid admitting that she had\n\nlied on Affidavit.\n468. Taken as a whole, her evidence on this point, (as with several other\n\npoints), was quite unsatisfactory.2\"°\n469.Mr LHY's evidence on this issue was equally unsatisfactory, and also\ncontained various falsehoods.\n\n470.During\n\ncross-examination,\n\nMr\n\nLHY\n\nmaintained\n\nthat\n\nhe\n\nhad\n\nnot\n\ndiscussed with the Respondent how to respond to the MC’s letter of\n\n16 December 20167'', This is inconsistent with the chronology of\nevents apparent from the BL Documents, and the Respondent's own\ntestimony, on cross-examination (see paragraph 465 above).\n471.It is clear that both their evidence was largely untrue, and an attempt\nto: (a) distance the Respondent from the version of events that Mr\nLHY had put forward to the MC (see paragraphs 224 - 225 above),\n\nresponding to the MC’s questions (see\nparagraphs 441 - 444 above). The Respondent was obviously\nunwilling to answer questions that the MC had asked, on her\ninvolvement with the Last Will.\nand\n\n(b) justify\n\nher\n\nnot\n\n(2) AGC\n472.The Respondent exhibited a similar pattern of conduct, vis-a-vis\nquestions from AGC, about her involvement in the Last Will.

It averred\nthat “fffhe Respondent did not provide a substantive response” to\nthese queries.\n\n474.The\n\nDefence\n\nexplained why the Respondent\n\na\n\nhad not provided\n\nsubstantive response, as follows®\"?:\n“The\n\nRespondent\n\nhad\n\nrepeatedly\n\nindicated\n\nthat\n\nshe\n\nwould\n\nprovide substantive responses to the AG’s questions in due\ncourse... The AG instead opted to refer the complaint against\nthe Respondent to the Law Society on 4 December 2018, before\n\nreceiving her substantive responses.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n475.The\n\nimplication,\n\nfrom\n\nher\n\nDefence,\n\nis that\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nhad\n\nrepeatedly confirmed her intention to provide substantive responses,\nbut that AGC referred the matter to Law Society nevertheless.\n\n476. She took a similar position in her Affidavit, and claimed that AGC had\nunilaterally referred the matter to the Law Society, even though she\nhad “unequivocally stated”, and even “reiterated” her “commitment to\n\nproviding a substantive response’*'s.\n477.The evidence before us, however, shows that AGC\n\nhad proceeded\n\nwith the referral, because the Respondent refused to confirm that she\nwould respond substantively, to AGC’s questions.\n\n312 Defence at para 62,\n313 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at paras 38 - 40.\n\n147\n\n\f478.On 30 October 2018, AGC wrote to the Respondent, inviting her to\n\nrespond to some questions about her involvement in the Last Will\n“fhJetore [AGC] decides on the appropriate course of action to be\n\ntaken (if any)\"*\"*. AGC initially requested a written response by 13\nNovember 20183\"5, This was subsequently extended to 20 November\n201898.\n\n479.The\n\nRespondent then replied to AGC\n\nindicating, inter alia. “/ am\n\ntravelling and ...expect to let you have my response by 14 December\n\n2018,\"3'7,\n480.On\n\n28 November 2018, AGC\n\ninformed the Respondent that if she\n\nintended to respond substantively to their questions, they were\n“prepared to consider [her] request for an extension of time’. As such,\nAGC asked her to confirm that she would respond substantively to\ntheir questions by 14 December 2018 (the date which the\nRespondent had requested)*\"®. The Respondent was asked to\nprovide her confirmation by 30 November 2018.\n481. On 3 December 2018, three days after the 30 November deadline,\nthe Respondent wrote to AGC, questioning the basis for AGC’s\n\ndecision to review her involvement in preparing the Last Will5!*, She\ncontended that the evidence cited by AGC “does not show any prima\nfacie case at all’. Her letter made\n\nno mention of AGC’s offer of an\n\n34 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 775 at para 8, Letter from the AGC to the Respondent dated 30 Oct 2018.\n315 LSS BOD, Val 1, p 775 at para 8, Letter from the AGC to the Respondent dated 30 Oct 2018.\n316 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 785 at para 5, Letter from the AGC to the Respondent dated 13 Nov 2018.\n\n317 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 788, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 19 Nov 2078; LSS BOD, Vol\n1, p 792 at para 6, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 26 Nov 2018.\n318 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 793 — 794 at para 4 and §, Letter from the AGC to the Respondent dated 28 Nov\n\n2018.\n318 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 795 — 796, Letter from the Respondent to the AGC dated 3 Dec 2018.\n\n148\n\n\fextension,\n\nand\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\nconfirm\n\nthat\n\nshe\n\nintended\n\nto\n\nrespond\n\nsubsequently, either by 14 December 2018, or at all.\n\n482. It was in these circumstances that AGC wrote to the Respondent on\n4 December 2018, informing her of their intention to proceed. AGC\nreiterated that they had been prepared to agree to the Respondeni’s\nrequest for an extension of time, had she required the time to respond\n\nto their queries. However, given the Respondent's refusal to provide\nthe confirmation sought, AGC would proceed accordingly*°. AGC\nreferred the matter to the Law Society that same day.\n483.Given the above facts, it is untrue for the Respondent to have said\nthat AGC\n\nproceeded,\n\ndespite her indicating “repeatedly” that she\n\nwould provide a substantive response.\n484.The Respondeni’s statement that she intended to substantively\nrespond (See paragraphs 474 - 476 above), was contradicted by her\ntestimony on the stand. During cross-examination, she admitted that\n\nshe “hadn't decided at that time’, whether or not to respond to AGC’s\nqueries, and had simply been “asking for more time to think about\nif'32),\n\n485. In our view, the Respondent's claims in her Defence and Affidavit are\nuntrue.\n\n(3)__\n\nPublic Statements\n\n486.In her Defence, the Respondent suggested that she need not have\nresponded\n\nto these\n\nqueries\n\nabout\n\nher\n\ninvolvement,\n\nbecause\n\nher\n\nhusband, Mr LHY, had already “made public statements as early as\n320 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 797 at para 2 — 4, Letter from the AGC to the Respondent dated 4 Dec 2018.\n321 Transcript (3 July 2019), 11:5-22, 12:20-27, 13:1-14.\n\n143\n\n\fJune 2017 to the effect that the Respondent had not drafted [the Last\n\nWill] and was not Mr Lee’s lawyer’?\n487.

These posts gave the impression that Ms KKL had prepared the Last\n\nWill for Mr Lee, and that the Respondent had played no role in it.\n489. None of these posts mentioned the Respondent's involvement in the\nLast Will. There was no reference, inter alia, to the Respondent\nhaving sent Mr Lee the draft Last Will, of her role in briefing Mr BL, of\n\nher retaining the original of the executed Last Will, of Ms KKL being\noverseas, or of Ms KKL having been excluded from the preparation\nof the Last Will.\n490. Instead, Mr LHY said, in the Facebook posts, that Ms KKL was the\n\nlawyer of the Last Will. The assertions that he made included the\nfollowing:\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n“The will was drafted by Kwa Kim Li of Lee & Lee.”*\n| “[Ms KKL] has been lying\" because she “denied involvement\n\nin the events that led to [the Last Willf’.=24\n\n822 Defence at para §7.\n32 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 515, Mr LH'Y’s Facebook post dated 16 June 2017, 1.05am.\n\n324 L§S BOD, Vol 2, p 1340, Mr LHY’s Facebook post dated 30 April 2019 sharing Dr LWL’s Facebook\npost dated 30 April 2019.\n\n150\n\n\f(c)\n\n“The final will was subsequently given to Lee Kuan\n\nYew's\n\nlawyer, Kwa Kim Li, for safe-keeping.”>*\n(d)\n\n“Lee Kuan Yew’s final will was simply Lee Kuan Yew’s first will\n\nof 20 August 2011 re-executed on his instructions.\"\n(e)\n\n17 December 2013\n\n“The will my father signed on Tuesday\n\nreflected [his] prior discussions with his lawyer KKL.” 327\n\n(f)\n\n“if was exactly what he wanted.”*26\n\n491.Mr LHY admitted in cross-examination that aspects of these posts\n\n“could be misleading’ and “inaccurate’®®.

He said that Ms KKL had drafted the Last Will,\nand that the Respondent had not drafted it; and he said that Ms KKL\n\nwas lying. When he said this, he knew that Ms KKL had not drafted\nthe Last Will, and it was the Respondent who had prepared it (see\nparagraphs 324 — 328 above).\n\n494. The letters which Mr LHY and Dr LWL wrote to the MC**\", (which\nwere also in evidence before us), referred to how Mr Lee read the\nLast Will carefully, and was lucid. Again, nothing was said about Mr\nLee having asked who drafted the Last Will, or the answers that he\nwas given. Thus, to the MC and to the public, Mr LHY made selective\nreference to the documents, which were misleading.\n\n495.The MC made a request®*? for the EK Attendance Note, after the\nin their\nNote\nEK Attendance\nto the\nreferred\nExecutors\ncorrespondence with the MC. This request was not acceded to.\nDuring cross-examination, Mr LHY said that the EK Attendance Note\nwas not “relevant” to the MC's work.**3 This was surprising, since he\nhad drawn the MC's attention to the EK Attendance Note to begin\nwith, referring to parts which he wanted to refer to.\n\n496. Mr LHY’s explanations for the untruths in his posts were not credible.\nHe gave the same\n\nreason\n\nthat he had cited in the context of his\n\ncorrespondence with the MC (see paragraph 232 - 233 above) —\nnamely, that he had not written these posts “with the level of care\n\nwhich a legal affidavit requires”***.

We will now deal with the question of whether\nthe Respondent was in breach of her professional duties.\nIX.\n\nBreach of Duties / Misconduct\n\n498. We\n\nwill consider the Charges against the Respondent in the following\n\norder:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, the primary and alternative first Charges (Charges 1 and\n1A), which charge the Respondent with breaches of Rule 25\namounting\n\nof the PCR,\n\nto grossly improper,\n\nor alternatively\n\nimproper, conduct under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n(b)\n\nSecond,\n\nthe\n\nprimary\n\nand\n\nalternative\n\nsecond\n\nCharges\n\n2 and 2A), which charge the Respondent with\nbreaches of Rule 46 of the PCR, amounting to grossly\nimproper, or alternatively improper, conduct under section\n83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n(Charges\n\nFinally, the further alternative first and second Charges\n(Charges 1B and 2B), which charge the Respondent with\nmisconduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor, under\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA.\n\nAs mentioned\n\nabove (see paragraph\n\n7 above), the further\n\nalternative Charges®* are based on the same conduct, but\npremised\n\non\n\nsection\n\n83(2)(h)\n\nof the\n\nLPA,\n\n(“misconduct\n\n335 Statement of Case at paras 47 (further alternative first Charge) and 50 (further altemative second\nCharge).\n153\n\n\fan advocate\n\nunbefitting\n\nand\n\nsolicitor’), and\n\ndo not require\n\nproof of a retainer between the Respondent and Mr Lee.\n499.\n\nRules 25 and 46 of the PCR respectively state as follows:\n“Conflict of Interest\n25.\n\nDuring the course of a retainer, an advocate and solicitor shall\n\nadvance the client's interest unaffected by —\n(a)\n\nany interest of the advocate and solicitor;\n\n(b) _ any\n\ninterest of any other person; or\n\nGift by will or inter vivos from client\n\n46.\n\nWhere aclient intends to make a significant gift by will or inter\n\nvivos, or in any other manner, to —\n\n(d)\n\nany member of the family of the advocate and solicitor;\n\nthe advocate and solicitor shail not act for the client and shall\nadvise the client to be independently advised in respect of the\ngift.”\n\n500.For the reasons set out below, we find that the primary first and\nsecond Charges against the Respondent (Charges 1 and 2) have\nbeen made out beyond a reasonable doubt. We also find that the\nalternative, and/or further alternative first and second Charges\n\n154\n\n\f(Charges 1A and 2A and/or 1B and 2B) are also made out beyond\nreasonable doubt.\n\n(A)\n\nPreliminary point\n\n501.Before turning to consider each of these groups of Charges, we first\ndeal with a preliminary issue that the Respondent raised, in respect\nof all the Charges.\n\n502. The Respondent submitted in her Closing Submissions, that all the\nCharges should fail, because there was no “conflict of interest’. She\ncited two reasons:\n\n(a)\n\nFirst, she was unaware of the circumstances giving rise to the\nconflict, because she did not know that the Last Will increased\n\nMr LHY’s share (from the Penultimate Will)**, and\n(b)\n\nSecond,\n\nMr Lee was fully aware of, and had accepted the\n\nRespondent's involvement, in the Last Will*”.\n503.We will deal with each of these points in turn.\n\n(1) Was the Respondent aware of the conflict of interest?\n504. The Respondent contended that a conflict of interest could only arise\nif: (a) the Last Will conferred a further advantage on Mr LHY (beyond\nwhat Mr Lee had bequeathed to Mr LHY previously under the\nPenultimate Will), and (b) she, as the putative fiduciary, knew that the\n\nLast Will had this effect.\n\n388 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 185.\n337 Respondent's Closing Submissions (16 August 2019) at para 206.\n\n455\n\n\f505.The Respondent said that the latter requirement\nSpecifically, she said that at the material time:\n\n(a)\n\nwas\n\nnot\n\nmet.\n\nShe was not aware that the Last Will increased Mr LHY’s\nshare, in Mr Lee’s estate; and\n\n(by\n\nInstead,\n\nshe thought that the\n\nLast Will reduced\n\nMr\n\nLHY's\n\nshare, in Mr Lee’s estate.\n\n506.As such, she said that no conflict of interest arose on the facts.\n507.We are unable to agree with this. There was a clear conflict of interest,\nregardless of whether the Respondent knew that the Last Will\nincreased, decreased, or maintained, Mr LHY’s share. (As to whether\n\nthe Respondent knew about the Penultimate Will, see paragraphs\n513 - 515 below).\n508.Mr Lee's Last Will gave a significant (one-third) share of the Estate to\nthe Respondent's husband, Mr LHY. The Respondent put herself in\na position of conflict, by assuming the role of Mr Lee’s lawyer, in\nrespect of this substantia! gift to her husband. As Mr Lee's lawyer, the\nRespondent owed him a duty of singular loyalty; she was required to ,\nput Mr Lee’s interests, above those of anyone else. Her concurrent\npersonal interests, as Mr LHY’s wife, were in conflict with that duty.\n\n509. The Court of Three Judges has said in Tan Phuay Khiang?**:\n“It is established law that an advocate and solicitor owes a duty of\nunflinching loyalty to his client... This obligation is derived from the\nfiduciary nature of the solicitor-client relationship, which requires a\n\nsolicitor to place his client’s interests above those of his own as\nwell as those of third parties. In fact, the obligations of a fiduciary\n338 Law Society of Singapore v Tan Phuay Khiang [2007] 3 SLR (R) 477 at [62].\n\n156\n\n\fgo beyond the avoidance of actual conflicts of interest, and extend\nto proscribe perceived or ostensible conflicts as well. While\n\nonerous in its requirements, the duty of unflinching loyalty is an\nessential cornerstone of the solicitor-client relationship as it\nensures that a client may confidently expect to receive impartial\nand frank advice and in turn repose complete trust in a solicitor to\nsafeguard his interests.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n510. Instead of avoiding the conflict, the Respondent actively precipitated\nits occurrence. Mr LHY cut out Mr Lee's usual lawyer, Ms KKL, and\n\nthe Respondent\n\nthen\n\nassumed\n\nMs\n\nKKL’s\n\nrole, in making\n\nall the\n\narrangements regarding the Last Will (see Section VIII(B)(2) above).\n\n511.This conflict was aggravated by Mr LHY’s close involvement in the\npreparation and execution of the Last Will. He acted together with the\nRespondent, to ensure that the Last Will was executed urgently,\novernight, within a matter of 16 hours, from the time the draft Last Will\n\nwas sent to Mr Lee by the Respondent®**. Together, they rushed the\nexecution of the Last Will through. Mr Lee was not advised on any of\nthe implications of the Last Will (see paragraphs 353 — 354 and 437\nabove).\n\n512.We will also address the underlying question which arose from the\nRespondent's submission: Did the Respondent and Mr LHY know\nabout the Penultimate Will, when the Last Will was signed?\n\n513. The Respondent and Mr LHY's position was that they only learnt that\nMr Lee had given Dr LWL\n\nafter he passed away.\n\nan extra share, in the Penultimate Will,\n\n,\n\n338 See paragraph 607 of this Decision.\n\n157\n\n\f514.The Law Society challenged this position, and argued that the\nRespondent and Mr LHY had actually been aware of the contents of\nMr Lee’s Penultimate Will, and knew,\n\ninter alia, that the Last Will\n\nwould give Mr LHY a /arger share.\n\nCounsel for the Law Society\n\nreferred us to a number of documents, which suggest that by 16\nDecember\n\n2013,\n\nthe\n\nRespondent\n\nand\n\nMr\n\nLHY\n\nknew\n\nabout the\n\nPenultimate Will:\n\n(a)\n\nMs KKL’s correspondence with Mr Lee's children suggests\nthat Mr Lee had spoken to them, about his intention to divide\nhis Estate unequally, through the Penultimate Will.\n\nIn an email from Ms KKL to Dr LWL on 3 June 2015\", Ms\nKKL told Dr LWL that each time Mr Lee instructed her to divide\nthe estate unequally,\n\nMr Lee said that he would “ta/k fo the\n\nchildren”. Ms KKL said that she recalled Dr LWL telling her\nthat Mr Lee had spoken to her (Dr LWL).\n[Emphasis added.]\n\nIn a note from Ms KKL to Mr LHL, Dr LWL and Mr LHY on 4\n\nJune 20152,\n\nMs KKL said that Mr Lee had asked her to\n\nprepare the Third and Penultimate Wilis which divided the\nEstate\n\nunequally,\n\nand\n\ntold\n\nher that “he\n\nwould\n\ntalk fo the\n\nchildren to inform them why he wanted to divide the Estate\n\nunequally’.\n[Emphasis added.]\n340 Transcript (4 July 2019), 67:18-28; LSS Skeletal Submissions (5 October 2019} at para 43,\n341 RBOD, p 51, email from Ms KKL to Dr LWL dated 3 June 2015, 8.39am.\n342 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 257, note fram Ms KKL to Mr LHL, Dr LWL and Mr LHY dated 4 June 2015.\n\n158\n\n\f(b)\n\nMr BL’s Affidavit also said that the Respondent had told him,\non 16 December 2013, that the Last Will was “going back fo\n\n[Mr Lee’s] previous will with the Demolition Clause”. This\nshows that the Respondent knew that the Penultimate Will\nhad removed the Demofition Clause, and the significance of\n\nthe\n\nLast Will\n\nchallenged\n\nin reinstating\nthis\n\naspect\n\nof\n\nit. The\n\nRespondent's\n\nMr\n\naccount\n\nBL’s\n\nCounsel\nin\n\ncross-\n\nexamination.\n(ce)\n\nIn an email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching on 28 July 2014, Dr\nLWL shared her view about what transpired on the evening of\n\n16 December 2013. She told Ms Ho Ching that®**:\n(i)\n\n“So one day, | called Kim Li. She said Papa had\ndiscussed w her giving me more than Loong n Yang and\ngave her the reasons Pa told me and she had amended\nthe will as instructed...Kim Li said Pa had thought\nthrough carefully and called her fo his office several\ntimes to discuss it. Nor do | remember doing anything\nthat would make Pa so angry w me.”\n\n(ii}\n\n“I said to kim Li, “papa did not tell me he changed the\n\nwill back to 3 equal parts.” Kim Li was surprised, and we\nboth wondered whether Yang pulled a fast one.”\n(iii)\n\n“By now, Pa was already v forgetful.”\n\n343 Mr BL's AEIC (1 July 2018) at para 10. It is undisputed that Mr Lee never mentioned reinstating the\nDemolition Clause in any of his discussions with the Respondent and/or Mr LHY (see paragraph 538 of\nthis Decision).\n34 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 238, Email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching dated 28 July 2014 at 11.06am.\n\n159\n\n\f(iv)\n\n“fit is Pa’s decision, | am ok with it. But! hv a sense that\nYang played me out...! was very upset that Yang did it\nto me.”\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n(Dr LWL has subsequently changed her position)*®.\n\n515. There are facts which seem fo suggest that the Respondent, and Mr\nLHY, knew about the contents of the Penultimate Will, including the\nfact that Mr LHY would get a smaller share under the Penultimate\nWill, as compared with the Last Will. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has\ndecided to refrain from making a finding on this issue, because while\nthe evidence is suggestive (that the Respondent and Mr LHY knew\nthe above about the Penultimate Will), it is nevertheless not\nconclusive.\n\n(2) Did Mr Lee waive the conflict of interest?\n516. The Respondent also said that there was no conflict, because Mr Lee\nwas fully aware that the Respondent was Mr LHY’s wife, and had\n\nnevertheless accepted the Respondent's involvement in the Last Will.\n517.1n our view, this argument is based on a misapprehension of Rules\n25 and 46 of the PCR. The alleged breaches under Rules 25 and 46\nof the PCR do not stem from the Respondent's failure to disclose her\npotential conflict of interest, as Mr LHY’s wife. That is the subject of\na different rule, Rule 26 of the PCR, which provides:\n“Disclosure of Interest\n\nMB RBOD, p 53, Facebook post by Dr LWL dated 15 June 2017, 9.16am.\n160\n\n\fin any case where the advocate and solicifor or any member\n\n26.\n\nof his family... has an interest in any matter entrusted to him by a\nclient, the advocate and solicitor shall (a)\n\n— make a full and frank disclosure of such interest fo the client;\n\nor\n(b}\n\nif, on the grounds of confidentiality or for any other reason, the\nadvocate\n\nand solicitor is unable\n\nto make\n\nsuch\n\ndisclosure,\n\ndecline to represent or withdraw from representing thaf client.”\n518. Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR stipulate additional duties that a solicitor\nmust comply with, over and above the duty of disclosure mentioned\nin Rule 26 of the PCR. In situations where the Rules 25 and 46 of the\nPCR apply, the solicitor cannot argue that the client was aware of the\nconflict of interest.\n\n,\n\n519. Rule 46 of the PCR is clear: It states that a solicitor: (1) cannot act in\n\nrespect of a gift that his client intends to make to him, or his family\nmembers; and (2) must advise his client to get independent advice in\nrespect of the gift.\nis confirmed in case law, which explains that the foundation of\nRule 46 of the PGR is based on a solicitors presumed influence over\n\n520. This\n\nhis client. See Law Society of Singapore v Wan Hui Hong James\n[2013] 3 SLR 221 (“James Wan”) at [9]:\n“When\n\na client intends to make\n\na gift to an advocate and solicitor,\n\nthere is an ethical duty on him to remove,\n\nas far as he can, any\n\nvestiges of influence (or the appearance thereof) he might have over\n\nhis client by virtue of their relationship. In the words of Dixon J in the\nHigh Court of Australia in Johnson v Buttress (1936) 56 CLR 113 at\n135:\n\n161\n\n\f* .when [a solicitor] takes [from his client] a substantial gift of\nproperty, it is incumbent upon him to show that it cannot be\n\nascribed to the inequality between them which must arise from\nhis special position...\nThe removal of any vestiges of influence is, in essence, what r 46 of\nthe Rules mandates...When an advocate and solicitor fails to comply\nwith r 46 of the Rules, disciplinary action is taken against him because\nhe is taken to have misused his influence over his client, and thus to\nhave put himself in a position where his personal interests conflict\nwith his duty to act in the interests of his client.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n521. In such cases, a client's purported waiver is irrelevant, precisely\nbecause of the influence that a solicitor is presumed to exercise, over\nhis client. The solicitor can only remove these vestiges of influence,\n\nby complying with both aspects of Rule 46 of the POR.\n\n522.In our view, the correct position is that set out in the Law Society’s\nGuidance Note (see paragraph 575 below) — the prohibition in Rule\n46 of the PCR against acting in respect of the gift is an absolute\nprohibition.\n\n523. The\n\nobligations under Rules 25 and 46 of the PCR clearly applied to\n\nthe Respondent, and the facts before us.\n\n(8)\n\nThe Primary and Alternative First Charges — Rule 25, PCR\n\n524. The key elements of the primary and alternative first Charges*“*\n(Charges 1 and 1A) are as follows —\n348 Statement of Case at paras 46 (primary first Charge) and 46 (altemative first Charge).\n162\n\n\f(a)\n\nThe Respondent prepared and arranged for the execution of\n\nthe Last Will, for her client, Mr Lee®47;\n(b)\n\n| The Respondent breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule 25(b) of the\nPCR\n\nbecause\n\nshe\n\nfailed\n\nto\n\nadvance\n\nMr\n\nLee's\n\ninterests,\n\nunaffected by her own, and/or Mr LHY's interests*8,\n\n(c)\n\nIn doing the above, the Respondent’s conduct amounted to\ngrossly improper conduct, (or improper conduct/practice),\n\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA™®.\n525.For the reasons set out above (see Section VIII(C) above), we find\n\nthat the first of these elements is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\nOur findings on the second element are set out below. As regards the\nthird element, as both the primary and alternative first and second\nCharges require determination of this issue*°, we will consider them\ntogether, at paragraphs 5871 - 592 below.\n\n247 Statement of Case at para 45 and 46 — primary and alternative first Charges: “That you, Mrs Lee\nSuet Fern... during the course of your retainer for your client, Mr Lee Kuan Yew...preparfed] and\n\narrangfed] for the execution of your client's will where a one-third share in your client's estate was to be\ngiven to your husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang\". [Emphasis added,}\n\n348 Statement of Case at para 45 and 46 — primary and alternative first Charge: “That you, Mrs Lee Suet\nFern... breached Rule 25(a) and/or Rule 25(b) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules...\nin that you failed fo advance your client's interests unaffected by your interest and/or the interests of\nyour husband, Mr Lee Hsien Yang’. [Emphasis added.)\n348 Statement of Case at para 45 — primary first Charge: \"...such act amounting to grossly improper\nconduct in the discharge of your professional duty within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal\n\nProfession Act’. [Emphasis added.]\n\n.\n\n360 Statement of Case at para 48 -— primary second Charge: “...such act amounting to grossly improper\nconduct in the discharge of your professional duty within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the Legal\nProfession Act’. [Emphasis added.]\nStatement of Case at paras 46 and 49 — alternative first and second Charges: \"...such act amounting\n\nfo improper conduct or practice as an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the\n\nLegal Profession Act’. [Emphasis added.]\n\n163\n\n\f(1) Did the Respondent compromise Mr Lee’s interests?\n\n526. Rule 25 of the PCR encapsulates a lawyer's paramount duty of loyalty\nto his client. As the Court of Three Judges stated in Law Society of\nSingapore v Uthayasurian Sidambaram [2009] 4 SLR(R) 674 at [53]:\n“Most importantly, a solicitor must remember that his\nunwaveringly and\nparamount duty is to conscientiously,\nfaithfully advance the interests of his clients and avoid all actual\nand/or potential conflict of interests.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n527.As Mr Lee's lawyer, the Respondent owed him a duty of singular\nloyalty. As a fiduciary, she was required to place Mr Lee’s interests\nabove anyone else’s — be it her own interests, or those of third parties\n(including Mr LHY).\n528.The\n\nspecific\n\nduties\n\nwhich\n\na solicitor\n\nowes\n\nhis/her\n\nclient,\n\nwhen\n\npreparing a will are well-established. These were set out by the Court\nin Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 (“Low Ah\nCheow’) , as follows (see [72] — [74]):\n(a)\n\nThe preparation of a\nresponsibilities, which\n\nwill involves serious professional\nsolicitors must uncompromisingly\n\nobserve and discharge. It is wrong to regard the preparation\n\nof a will as “no more than a routine exercise in form filling’.\n(b)\n\nA.will is one of the most important legal documents which an\nindividual can execute. There ought to be no reom for even\nthe slightest doubt (or the slightest possibility of a mistake) on\nthe part of a solicitor in both understanding the testator's\n\n164\n\n\fintention and expressing that intention in the will to be drawn\nup.\n(i) | Understanding the testator’s intention and wishes —\nBefore\n\npreparing\n\na will, the solicitor ought to have a\n\nthorough discussion with the testator on all the possible\n\nlegal issues and potential complications that might arise\nin the implementation of the terms of the will. The\nsolicitor ought to painstakingly and accurately document\nhis discussions with and his instructions from the testator.\n\n(ii)\n\nEnsuring\n\nthe will accurately\n\nexpresses\n\nthe testator's\n\nwishes—\nThe solicitor should also confirm with the testator, prior\nto the execution of the will, that the contents of the will\n\nas drafted accurately express the testator’s intention.\nHalf measures or the cutting of corners in the discharge\n\nof these serious professional responsibilities will not do.\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n529. The Court of Appeal also said in Low Ah Cheow*®\":\n‘T]he solicitor concerned [in the preparation of a will] should\n\nalso conscientiously\n\nseek to avoid\n\nbeing\n\nin any situation\n\nwhere a potential conflict of interest may appear to exist.\n\n351 Low Ah Cheow v Ng Hock Guan [2009] 3 SLR(R) 1079 at [74].\n\n165\n\n\fIn particular, exceptional restraint and care are called for if the\nsolicitor concerned has a pre-existing relationship and/or past\ndealings with the sole beneficiary under a will, and all the more\n\nso if the will has been prepared urgently and executed in\nunusual circumstances with that sole beneficiary's active\ninvolvement. When such a case occurs, the solicitor involved\n\nmust\n\nbe\n\nscrutinised\n\nprepared\nand,\n\nto\n\nhis\n\nhave\n\nperhaps,\n\neven\n\nconduct_microscopically\nhis\n\nmotives\n\ncalled_into\n\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n530. Similarly in Chee Mu Lin Muriel v Chee Ka Lin Caroline (Chee Ping\n-Chian Alexander) [2010] 4 SLR 373 (“Muriel Chee’), the Court of\nAppeal said at [60] that “[iJn every case, the solicitor should be\ncautious about taking instructions from any person who is to be\nnamed as a beneficiary in the will’.\n531. The evidence shows that the Respondent acted quite contrary to the\nduties set out above. She abused\n\nher position to further Mr LHY’s\n\nwishes that the Last Will be executed hurriedly (see paragraphs 30 —\n52 and 346 - 365 above). The Respondent's conduct in taking\ninstructions from Mr LHY on the arrangements relating to and arising\nfrom the execution of the Last Will is, in the Tribunals view, an\naggravating factor which increases the egregiousness of her conduct.\nThe Courts have stressed that solicitors should be wary of taking\ninstructions solely from a beneficiary to a will. The Respondent\ntestified\n\nthat\n\nshe\n\nfollowed\n\nMr\n\nLHY’s\n\ndirections\n\nas\n\nshe\n\nwas\n\nan\n\n“obedient wife’. But her statement, that she was an “obedient wife”\n\nshows her mindset on 16 and 17 December 2013: that she focused\nprimarily on what her husband wanted dene, though her duties were\n\nowed to Mr Lee. She worked together with Mr LHY, with a singular\npurpose, of getting Mr Lee to execute the Last Will quickly. The\n\n166\n\n\ffollowing\n\nan\n\nis\n\nfrom\n\nexcerpt\n\nthe\n\ncross-examination\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nRespondent®:\n“Tan CM:\n\nThe first communication you had with Bemard Lui\nwas at eight---before 8.11.

Understanding Mr Lee’s intention and wishes\n\n533, Based on our findings above, the Respondent only spoke once to Mr\nLee about the Last Will (see paragraph 225 above). Mr Lee had told\nher “to revert to his first wil from 2017”. Thereafter, aside from one\nemail from Mr Lee (see paragraph 41 above), all the other instructions\n\nwhich she received, on the Last Will, came from Mr LHY.\n\n283 See paragraph 531 of this Decision.\n\n168\n\n\f534.On her evidence, there was no discussion between the Respondent\nand Mr Lee, about his intentions or reasons for wanting to reinstate\nthe First Will, or the wider legal implications of doing so. This fell far\nshort of the professional duties that the law imposed on her. As the\nlawyer preparing Mr Lee's Last Will, the Respondent should have had\n“a thorough discussion” with Mr Lee, “on al the possible legal issues\nand potential complications” that could arise, if he reverted to the First\n\nWill.\n535.Such thorough discussions would have to be handled with utmost\ncare. In this matter, that would entail the Respondent checking about\nprevious Wills. The Respondent should have found out about the\nPenultimate Will (if, as she says, she did not know about it), and Mr\nLee’s intentions,\n\non what changes\n\nhe had wanted to make\n\nto the\n\nPenultimate Will. Mr Lee had discussed that with Ms KKL, just a few\ndays earlier the changes he had wanted. Even if she did not know\nspecifically the terms of the Penultimate Will, she knew that Mr Lee\n\nhad made other Wills, superseding the First Will\". It was her duty to\nhave them checked, and to see what was Mr Lee's latest valid will.\n\nShe also had a duty to advise him carefully on the differences\nbetween the First Will (which she says he wanted to revert to), and\nwhatever was his last valid Will.\n\n536.For example, Mr Lee had discussed the Demolition Clause, and the\nterms on which Dr LWL was allowed to stay in 38 Oxley, on various\n\noccasions, with Ms KKL, when preparing his earlier Wills**°. He had\nultimately landed in favour of the positions articulated in his Fifth and\nPenultimate Wills. According to Ms KKL, Mr Lee did so because he\nwanted to leave it to Mr LHL to handle the “hit and the heat”, and\n38 Transcript (3 July 2019), 81:32 — 82:1.\n368 Mr Lee never mentioned reinstating the Demolition Clause in any of his discussions with the\nRespondent and/or Mr LHY (see paragraph 538 of this Decision). On the Respondent and Mr LHY’s\nevidence, Mr Lee’s instructions had been confined to going back to the First Will.\n\n169\n\n\fremoved\n\nthe\n\nDemolition\n\nClause,\n\naltogether,\n\nfrom\n\nhis\n\nFifth\n\nand\n\nPenultimate Wills?°°,\n537.There were also two versions of the Demolition Clause (see\nparagraph 19(b) above and Annex A). In the first version (from Mr\nLee's First Will), demolition of 38 Oxley was subject to Dr LWL’s right\nto stay there. This was the version in the draft that the Respondent\nsent to Mr Lee. However, this version of the Demolition Clause had\n\nbeen superseded by a second version (from Mr Lee’s Second Will).\nThis later version of the Demolition Clause was also used in Mr Lee's\n\nThird and Fourth Will. In the Fifth and Sixth (or Penultimate) Wills, the\nDemolition Clause was removed completely. Thus, the Respondent\nshould have checked with Mr Lee: did he want the Demolition Clause\nreinserted, when he had removed them from his immediately\npreceding two Wills?\n538.The Respondent did not do this. She did not tell Mr Lee that the\nDemolition Clause (which had been removed in the Penultimate Will)\nhad been reinserted in the draft Last Will that she sent to Mr Lee. The\n\nRespondent's testimony*®’ was as follows:\n“Advocate:\n\n..[S]o on 16th December 2013, you never had a chance\nto speak to or advise Mr Lee Kuan Yew, right, about this\n\ndecision to include any demolition clause in the final will\nRespondent:\n\n—/ think Papa was his own best lawyer. He knew what he\nwanted.\n\nAdvocate:\n\nOkay.

The question of Dr LWL's rights (if any) to stay at 38 Oxley was an\nissue on which Mr Lee seems to have focussed considerable thought\n\nand attention in deciding on his Wills*°*. Apart from Mr Lee's First Will,\nnone of his five subsequent wills give Dr LWL an unfettered right to\nstay at 38 Oxley, the Second, Third, and Fourth Wills did not give Dr\nLWL any right to stay at 38 Oxley, whilst the Fifth and Penuitimate\nWills subjected this right to Mr LHL’s consent.\n\n541.Mr Lee had also emphasised to Ms KKL the importance of requiring\nMr LHL’s consent in this respect. When Mr Lee reinstated Dr LWL’s\nright to stay at 38 Oxley in the Fifth Will, he instructed Ms KKL, more\nthan once, to ensure that this should be made subject to Mr LHL’s\n\nconsent®®,\n542. The Penultimate Will also contained a gift-over clause (as did all Mr\n\nLee’s wills, apart from the Last Will (see paragraph 21 above))*®.\n543. The Last Will departed from the considered positions that Mr Lee had\nsettled on with Ms KKL on the changes to be made to his Penultimate\n358 RBOD, p 51, email from Ms KKL to Dr LWL dated 3 June 2015, 8.39am; LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 257 at\npara 1, note from Ms KKL to Mr LHL, Dr LWL, Mr LHY dated 4 June 2015.\n359 1SS BOD, Vol 1, p 145, email from Mr Lee to Ms KKL dated 1 Oct 2072, 4.12pm; LSS BOD, Vol 1,\n2 144, email from Mr Lee to Ms KKL dated 1 Oct 2012, 11.32pm.\n\n38 LSS BOD, Vol 1, p 289, Penultimate Will executed by Mr Lee dated 2 November 2012,\n\n171\n\n\fWill. As Mr Lee's lawyer, the Respondent owed him a duty to find out\nwhat Mr Lee's true wishes were, take him through the Penultimate\nWill, and remind him of his discussions with Ms KKL a few days\nearlier. It was only with the benefit of such a discussion that Mr Lee\n(and the Respondent) could have been certain that the best (or even\nan accurate) way of giving effect to his wishes was to rescind the\nPenultimate Will, and reinstate the First Will (with all its attendant\nchanges).\n544. The\n\nRespondent\n\nmade\n\nno effort to ascertain, discuss, or draw Mr\n\nLee's attention to the changes between the Penultimate Will and the\nFirst Will. She did not try to obtain a copy of the Penultimate Will from\n\nMs KKL, either for Mr Lee’s or her own reference®*\". Any solicitor who\nproceeded thus would have acted contrary to the requirements set\nout by the Court of Appeal in Low Ah Cheow (see paragraph 528\nabove). The Respondent, being in conflict, fell foul of the additional\nobservations made by the Court of Appeal in Low Ah Cheow and\nMuriel Chee (paragraphs 529 — 530 above). As the Court of Appeal\nsaid in Low Ah Cheow, the Respondent's motives, in sending a draft\nto Mr Lee which completely superseded the Penultimate Will and in\nrushing the execution of the Last Will, are in serious question.\n\n545. Had Mr Lee’s wish been solely to ensure an equal division of shares,\nthere were various other options he could have used, rather than\nreinstating the First Will — he could have executed a codicil to the\nPenultimate Will (which is what he had agreed with Ms KKL), or\n\nreinstated one of his other previous Wills, which similarly divided his\nEstate into equal shares.\n\n36 Transcriptpt (3 July 2019), 29:25 — 30:29.\n172\n\n\fb,\n\nEnsuring\n\nMr\n\nLee’s\n\nwishes\n\nwere\n\nfully\n\nand\n\naccurately\n\ndoubt\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nwere\n\n(see\n\nexpressed in the Last Will\n\n546.We found it established beyond reasonable\nRespondent failed in this duty as well.\n547.She did not fully ascertain\nparagraphs 533 - 545 above).\n\nwhat\n\nMr\n\nLee’s\n\n:\nwishes\n\n548.Even if Mr Lee's intention was to go back to the First Will, that was\nalso not done.\n\n549.She told Mr Lee that the draft Last Will that she sent to him was the\nFirst Will, when it was not (see paragraphs 34 — 35 above). She did\nnot draw his attention to the differences between the draft Last Will\n\nand the First Will.\n550. In particular, two substantive parts of the First Will were missing from\nthe draft that the Respondent gave Mr Lee — (a) the gift-over clause,\nand (b) provision for Mr LHL to pay for the upkeep of 38 Oxley, whilst\nDr LWL occupied the property.\n\n551.On her evidence, she simply forwarded to Mr Lee, what Mr LHY sent\nto her, assuming\n\nit to be the First Will, as Mr LHY\n\ntold her, and\n\nrepresenting it to Mr Lee as such*®2. The Respondent contended that\nshe did not open the draft, before she sent it on to Mr Lee. For the\n\nreasons set out above (see paragraphs 318 — 321 above), we did not\nfind these statements credibie.\n\n552. However, had this indeed been the case (as the Respondent stated),\nit would have compounded her misconduct even further. Itis a breach\nof the most basic duties for a lawyer to have:\n362 The Respondent's AEIC (17 June 2019) at para 16.\n173\n\n\f(a)\n\nUsed a draft will sent to her by a beneficiary, whom she was\nclosely related to; and\n\n(b)\n\nSent\n\non\n\nthe\n\ndraft,\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nbeneficiary,\n\nto\n\nher\n\nclient,\n\nrepresenting its contents to be in order, without even having\nopened the document to read it.\n553.As Mr Lee’s lawyer, it was a serious breach of the Respondent's\nduties to have misrepresented the Last Will as being identical to the\n\nFirst Will.\n554. The Last Will also omitted changes which Mr Lee wanted to make. It\nfailed to include the provision on the two carpets that Mr Lee had\ninstructed Ms KKL to make, just a few days earlier (see paragraphs\n28 and 29 above).The Respondent’s omission to include this in the\nLast Will underscored her failure to discuss the Last Will with Mr Lee\nand ensure that its contents reflected Mr Lee’s wishes.\n\n555. The Respondent's disregard for Mr Lee’s interests is also apparent\nfrom her conduct after sending him the draft Last Will. She made no\neffort to discuss the draft Last Will with Mr Lee, or at least confirm\n\nthat the draft Last Will accurately and comprehensively reflected his\nwishes (see paragraph 544 above). On her own evidence, she did\nnot know if Mr Lee even read the draft Last Will which she sent,\n\nbecause she did not speak with him after that®®?.\n556.All of this was a gross breach of the Respondent's duties. As the\nCourt of Three Judges\n\nhas stated in Law Society of Singapore\n\nv\n\nVardan Vasantha Lakshmi [2007] 1 SLR(R) 240 at [47]:\n\n363 Transcript (3 July 2019), 89:7-9.\n\n174\n\n\f“Lawyers\n\nhave\n\na\n\nduty\n\ngenerally\n\n(and\n\nalways)\n\nto\n\ngive\n\ntheir\n\nrespective clients a thorough explanation of all relevant documents\n\nset in their appropriate contexts.

They contended that the Last Will must therefore have\nreflected Mr Lee’s wishes.\n\n558. This reasoning is contradicted, by the Respondent's own testimony.\nThe Respondent’s evidence is that even though she had worked on\n\nthe First Will in 2011, she herself would not have realised, from a\nplain reading of the draft Last Will in’2013, that it was the wrong\n\nversion*,\n‘Tan CM:\n\nWould it be fair to say that if you did open, you will know\nthat this is not the correct draft because you were\ninvolved in a wee bit of tidying, resulting in version 3 that\nresulted in the fast will?\n\nRespondent:\n\nNo. | wouldn't have known.\n\nTan CM:\n\nYou wouldn't have known?\n\nRespondent:\n\n{ wouldn't have known,\n\nTan CM:\n\nSo would it be fair to say that when\n\nMr Lee\n\nreads\n\nwhatever draft of will it would be for him, he, foo, would\n\n364 Transcript (3 July 2019), 74:9 — 75:9.\n\n475\n\n\fnot have known of the differences with the first will if it\nhad not been placed before him?\nRespondent:\n\n{ don’t know.

And, yes, | don’t have perfect memory\nto remember a document | may have _go---looked at\nbriefly 2 years ago.\n\nTan CM:\n\nBy the same token, it would not be fair to expect that Mr\n\nLee would remember _or_would have noticed the\ndifferences between the first and the last will because it\nwas_something\n\nthat he signed some\n\n2 years\n\nand\n\n4\n\nmonths ago. Would that be a fair statement?\n\nRespondent:\n\n| think that that’s probably the case, although you have\nto recognise, Papa can be a very perspicacious man and\nthat he may well have the wills with him. And | did not.\n\nTan CM:\n\nYou don’t know that fora fact, am | correct?\n176\n\n\fRespondent:\n\nNo, | don’.\n\nTan CM:\n\nYes.\n\nRespondent:\n\nNeither do you.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n559.The Respondent's comments that she would not have known the\ndifferences between the different variations of the First Will based on\nmemory alone, apply with more force to Mr Lee. By December 2013,\nMr Lee had signed five other Wills since the First Will. Mr Lee was 90\n\nyears old at the time, was very frail and had been in poor health®®. It\nis not possible to assume that Mr Lee would have identified and\nappreciated the specific changes that the Last Will made to either the\nFirst Will,\n\nor the\n\nPenultimate\n\nWill,\n\nbased\n\non\n\nmemory\n\nalone,\n\nand\n\nwithout a lawyer explaining the differences and implications to him.\n560. The problems are compounded by the fact that the Respondent had\nmade false representations to Mr Lee about the contents of the Last\nWill. It is grossly remiss for her to have allowed Mr Lee to sign the\nLast Will, based on her false representations to him.\n561. Thus, it is no answer to say that Mr Lee read through the Last Will.\n\nHe was given a document and given false assurances about it. He\n365 See paragraphs 27 and 59 of this Decision above.\n\nSee also email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching dated 16 Dec 2013, 5.21pm, sent the day before the Last\nWill was signed — Dr LWL said that Mr Lee had “been doing very well’ because he had “no admission\n\nto SGH for more than a month\", but that she thought that “aging has caught up w his brain alsa’. (LSS\n\nBOD, Vol 1, p 172)\n\nDr LWL also subsequently recounted Mr Lee's health at the time, in the following terms: \"By now, Pa\nwas already v forgetful’ (see email from Dr LWL to Ms Ho Ching dated 28 July 2014, 11.08am (LSS\n\nBOD, Vol 1, p 238).\n\n177\n\n\fHe read it, and signed it. But was he\n\ntrusted the Respondent®*,\n\naware that this Will was very different from what he had discussed\n\nwith Ms KKL just four days earlier®®”? Did he remember, for example,\nthat four days earlier, he had not wanted to include the Demolition\nClause? Did he, for example, remember that the Penultimate Will did\nnot have the Demolition Clause?\n\n562. The Respondent also said that Mr Lee’s interests were not adversely\naffected, because the Last Will simply effected his undisputed wish\n\nto divide the Estate equally amongst his three children®®®, She also\nsaid that the only basis on which the first Charge (Charges 1, 1A, and\n1B) could be sustained was if Mr LHY “got some advantage that he\nwas not entitled to because of [the Respondent's] intervention’.\n563. This submission overlooks the several ways in which the Respondent\nfailed to protect Mr Lee’s interests, set out above.\n\n564.Mr LHY's contentions in his Affidavit were also to similar effect®°. He\nreferred to the differences between the First and Last Will as being\n\n“minor discrepancies”\n\nand “some occasional differences in legal\n\nwords’. There were in fact substantive differences between the two\n\nWills (see paragraphs 34, 548 - 550 and Annex B).\n565.This\n\nwas\n\na\n\ndismissive\n\ncomplete disregard\n\napproach.\n\nMr LHY\n\nIt shows,\n\nand the Respondent\n\nunfortunately,\n\nthe\n\nhad for Mr Lee's\n\nwishes, and the Respondent's disregard for discharging her duties\nhonestly and faithfully.

The objective facts show\nthat she fell grossly short of her professional duties as Mr Lee’s\nlawyer.\n567.As a fiduciary, who was beholden to protect Mr Lee’s interests above\n\nall else, it was unacceptable for the Respondent to have abused her\nposition as Mr Lee’s lawyer and prioritised her husband’s wishes.\n(C)\n\nThe Primary and Alternative\n\nSecond\n\nCharges:\n\nRule 46 of the\n\nPCR\n568.The key elements of the primary and alternative second Charges\n(Charges 2 and 2A) are as follows:\n(a)\n\nThe Respondent breached Rule 46 of the PCR by:\n(i)\n\nActing in respect of a significant gift that her client, Mr\nLee, intended to give to Mr LHY, the Respondent's\n\nhusband?”°: and/or\n370 Statement of Case at paras 48 and 49 — primary and alternative second Charges: “That you, Mrs\nLee Suet Fem... during the course of your retainer for your client, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, breached Rule\n179\n\n\f(b)\n\nlegal\n\nFailed to advise Mr Lee to seek independent\nadvice®”’; and\n\n(ii)\n\nIn doing the above, the Respondent’s conduct amounted to\ngrossly improper conduct (or improper conduct/practice)\n\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA®”.\n569. Rule 46 of the PCR expressly provides, inter alfa, that “where a client\nintends to make a significant gift by wilf’ to “any member of the family\nof the advocate and solicitor’, the advocate and solicitor “shail not act\n\nfor the client and shall advise the client to be independently advised\nin respect of the gift’.

This was a gift that was both significant in absolute terms,\nand also significant in proportion (one-third) of Mr Lee’s estate (see\n\nJames Wan, at [10)).\n\n573. The Respondent's decision to act for Mr Lee, despite knowing of the\nsignificant gift that her husband Mr LHY stood to receive, is in breach\nof Rule 46. As the Court of Appeal pointed out in James Wan at [20],\na \"clear instance of so acting is when the advocate and solicitor draws\n\nup an instrument by which a disposal of the client’s property is\neffected, such as a will”. [Emphasis added.]\n574. The Court in James Wan has noted that in England and in New South\nWales, the equivalent provisions to Rule 46 of the PCR do not apply\nwhen the client is closely related to the solicitor. However, the Court\npoints out that Rule 46 of the PCR in Singapore does not have any\nexception. The obligations imposed by Rule 46 of the PCR apply\nregardless of any familial relationship between the solicitor and his\nclient. The Court also made reference to the Law Society’s Ethics\nCommittee’s Guidance Note of 4 December 2007, where the Ethics\n\nCommittee made clear that the obligations apply even in relation to a\n\n182\n\n\fsolicitor’s own parents. The Respondent was in breach of Rule 46 of\nthe PCR.\n\n575. The Guidance Note from the Law Society’s Ethics Committee (which\nwas cited by the Court in James Wan) states that®”:\n“A solicitor is absolutely prohibited under rule 46 PCR from acting for\nhis parents in preparing any instrument (including a will) under which\nhe (or his family members or colleagues) would receive a significant\ngift, whether as a beneficiary of his parents’ will or estate or otherwise.\nIn light of potential issues of conflict of interest and sensitivities\ninvolved, the solicitor should avoid acting for his parents even when\nthey have not intimated any intention to make a gift. Naturally, once\n\nsuch intention was intimated, the solicitor must advise his parents to\nseek independent advice concerning the gift and cannot act for them.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n(2)Failing to advise Mr Lee to get independent legal advice\n\n576. The Respondent also breached the second requirement in Rule 46\nof the PCR — to advise Mr Lee to seek independent advice.\n\n577.The nature of this duty has been set out by the Court of Three Judges\n\nin James Wan*?>.\n(a)\n\nAsolicitor's obligation to advise his client to seek independent\nadvice arises even if the intended gift is wholly unrelated to\nthe matter in which the advocate and solicitor is acting for the\n\nclient - a fortiori where he is acting for the client in respect of\nthe gift itself.

In fact, the Respondent did the opposite of what Rule 46 of the PCR\nrequired her to do.\n580. The Respondent acquiesced in cutting out Mr Lee from getting advice\nfrom his usual lawyer, Ms KKL.\n(D)\n\nSection 83(2)(b) of the LPA: Grossly improper conduct\n\n581.The final question is whether her conduct was “grossly improper’\nunder section 83(2)(b) of the LPA.\n\n582. The test for what amounts to “grossly improper’ conduct, within the\nmeaning of section 83(2) of the LPA was also discussed by Menon\nCJ in Law Society of Singapore v Ezekiel Peter Latimer [2019] SGHC\n92 (“Peter Ezekiel’):\n\n\"37 The principles relating to s 83(2)(b) of the LPA can be briefly\nstated. Whether a particular conduct is “grossly improper’ within\nthe meaning of s 83(2)(b) of the LPA depends on whether the\nconduct is dishonourable to the solicitor concerned as a man and\n\ndishonourable in his profession (Re Marshall David; Law Society\nof Singapore v Marshall David Saul [1971-1973] SLR(R) 554 at\n[23]; Law Society of Singapore v Rasif David [2008] 2 SLR(R)\n955 at [23]). Itis well established that deceit is not necessary for\n\n184\n\n\fa finding of grossly improper conduct. Indeed, s 83(2)(b) of the\nLPA makes it clear that the requirement is for either\nfraudulent or grossly improper conduct to be shown (Re Han\nNgiap Juan[1993] 1SLR(R)135; Re Lim Kiap Khee; Law\nSociety of Singapore v Lim Kiap Khee [2001] 2 SLR(R)\n398 (\"Lim Kiap Khee”) at [19]). Whilst simple negligence or want\nof skill would not necessarily constitute grossly improper conduct,\nit has also been noted that there are degrees of negligence, and\nthat the gravity of a negligent act must be viewed in the context\nof the matter, taking into account all the circumstances of the\ncase (Lim Kiap Khee at (19]). Grossly improper conduct will also\nbe found where a solicitor prefers his own interests to that of his\nclient (Law Society of Singapore v Khushvinder Singh\nChopra [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490 (“Khushvinder Singh Chopra’) at\n[49]; Law Society of Singapore v Ng Chee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R)\n\n466 (“Ng Chee Sing”) at [36]).”\n583. It would be “grossly improper’, for an advocate and solicitor to act in\na manner opposed to a client’s interests: Law Society v Heng Guan\nHong Geoffrey [1999] 3 SLR(R) 966 (“Geoffrey Heng’) at [24].\n“Grossly improper conduct”, is also likely to arise, where a solicitor\n\nputs his interest, above his clients’ interests®”*: Khushvinder Singh\nChopra at [49]; and Ng Chee Sing at [36].\n\n584.Conduct may be “gross/y improper’ even without any dishonesty,\nfraud or deceit: Re Han Ngiap Juan at [27] and [34]; and Law Society\nof Singapore v Wong Sin Yee [2018] 5 SLR 1261 (\"Wong Sin Yee\")\nat [23].\n\n585. In Peter Ezekiel, the Court of Three Judges characterised the type of\nconflict of interest which has arisen in these proceedings as cases\nwhere ‘it would be impossible, save possibly in exceptional\ncircumstances, to avoid the conclusion that the client had operated\n378 Law Society v Khushvinder Singh Chopra [1998] 3 SLR(R) 490; Law Society of Singapore v Ng\nChee Sing [2000] 1 SLR(R) 466.\n185\n\n\funder the undue influence of the solicitor in ... making the substantial\ngift’.\n586.Based on these principles, we find the Respondent was guilty of\ngrossly improper conduct, beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n587. This is not a case of sheer incompetence, inadvertent negligence, or\neven reckless indifference. The Respondent, as Mr Lee’s lawyer,\ndeliberately failed to discharge the duties that she was supposed to\nperform. Her breaches are egregious.\nin totality, the Respondent’s conduct was quite dishonest.\nMr LHY’s and her conduct, demonstrated a calculated attempt to:\n\n588. Considered\n\n(a)\n\nEnsure that Mr Lee executed the Last Will as quickly as\npossible, without due regard for Mr Lee’s wishes, and\n\n(b) — Hide their wrongdoing in having done so.\n589. The Respondent and Mr LHY knew that it was important to Mr Lee to\nhave a lawyer prepare and arrange for the execution of the Last Will.\nDespite this: (a) they cut out Mr Lee’s usual lawyer, Ms KKL, and\nreplaced her with the Respondent, who was in a serious conflict of\ninterest; and (b) instead of advising Mr Lee to seek independent\ncounsel, as she was required to, the Respondent acquiesced in Mr\nLHY’s representation to Mr Lee, that it was best to proceed without\nMs\n\nKKL;\n\nand\n\nactively\n\nensured\n\nthat the\n\nexecution\n\ncould\n\nproceed\n\nwithout Ms KKL.\n\n590.Having removed Ms KKL from the picture, the Respondent\ncompounded her wrongdoing by misleading Mr Lee on the contents\nof the Last Will. She and Mr LHY also rushed the signing of the Last\nWill by Mr Lee. It contained terms which had not been discussed with\n\n186\n\n\fMr Lee (see paragraphs 536 — 538 above). Mr Lee signed the Last\nWill under false assurances.\n591.The Respondent's conduct clearly lacked the integrity, probity and\ntrustworthiness required of an advocate and solicitor. What she did\nwas\n\ndishonourable,\n\nboth to herself, as a person,\n\nand to the legal\n\nprofession. It was “grossly improper conduct’ under section 83(2)(b)\nof the LPA.\n\n592.Having procured the Last Will through these improper means,\n\nshe\n\nand Mr LHY then fabricated a series of lies and inaccuracies, to\nperpetuate the falsehood that Ms KKL had been involved in the Last\nWill, and hide their own role in getting Mr Lee to sign the Last Will\nand their wrongdoings (see paragraphs 439 - 496 above).\n(E)\n\nThe Further Alternative First & Second Charges\n\n593. The further alternative Charges (Charges 1B and 2B) brought under\n\nsection 83(2)(h) of the LPA, are also established beyond reasonable\ndoubt.\n594. Section 83(2)(h) of the LPA is broader than section 83(2)(b)\n\nof the\n\nLPA. It applies when a solicitor's conduct does not fall within any of\nthe other subsections of section 83(2) of the LPA,\nconsidered unacceptable”:\n\nbut is “nonetheless\n\nWong Sin Yee, [24]; Ng Chee Sing, [40].\n\nUnlike “grossly improper conduct’ under section 83(2)(b) of the LPA,\n“conduct unbefitting an advocate and solicitor under section 83(2)(h)\nof the LPA, is not confined to misconduct in a solicitor's professional\n\ncapacity;\n\nit also\n\nincludes\n\nmisconduct\n\nin\n\nhis\n\npersonal\n\ncapacity:\n\nGeoffrey Heng, at [25]; Khushvinder Singh Chopra, at [36].\n595.Menon\n\nCJ\n\nhas summarised,\n\nin Peter Ezekie/ at [38], the test for\n\nunbefitting conduct under section 83(2)(h) of the LPA as follows:\n\n187\n\n\fAs for s 83(2)(h) of the LPA, this provision is broader\n38\nthan s 83(2)(b). The standard of unbefitting conduct will be met\nif a solicitor is shown to have been guilty of such conduct as\nwould render him unfit to remain as a member of an honourable\n\nprofession (Law Society of Singapore v Wong Sin Yee [2018] 5\nSLR 1261 (“Wong Sin Yee\") at [24]). The relevant test is to\nconsider_whether_reasonable people, on_hearing what the\nsolicitor had done, would have said without hesitation that as a\n\nsolicitor he should not have done it (Ng Chee Sing at [41]; Wong\nSin Yee at [24]).”\n{Emphasis added.]\n\n596. It is sufficient if the solicitor’s conduct brings him into discredit as a\nlawyer, or brings the legal profession as a whole into disrepute: Wong\nSin Yee, at [24].\n\n597.Even if the Respondent had not been Mr Lee's lawyer, what she did\nto Mr Lee was dishonest and dishonourable. She:\n\n(a)\n\nMisled him, and procured his execution of the Last Will on the\nbasis of misrepresentations;\n\n(b)\n\nDenied him the benefit of proper legal advice, on the contents\nof his Last Will; and\n\n(c)\n\nParticipated in ensuring that the Last Will was signed quickly,\nwithout Mr Lee getting proper legal advice.\n\n598.This\n\nconduct\n\nunquestionably\n\nfalis within\n\nthe\n\nrubric\n\nof “conduct\n\nunbefitting an advocate and solicitor’.\n\n188\n\n\fxX,\n\nCause of sufficient gravity under section 93 of the LPA\n\n599.Having\n\nfound\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nfirst\n\nand\n\nsecond\n\nCharges\n\nagainst\n\nthe\n\nRespondent were established beyond reasonable doubt, the final\nquestion to address is whether there is “cause of sufficient gravity’\nunder section 93 of the LPA.\n600. The\n\nexistence of misconduct under section 83(2) of the LPA, does\n\nnot ipso facto constitute “cause of sufficient gravity’. The function of\na Disciplinary Tribunal uncer section 93 of the LPA, is to serve as a\n\n“filter': Law Society of Singapore v Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel\n[2010] 3 SLR 390 (“Jasmine Gowriman/’) at [28]. It is open to the\nTribunal to find that the conduct, technically, falls within one or more\n\nlimbs of section 83(2) of the LPA, but take the view that the case is\nnevertheless not of “sufficient gravity’, to merit a reference to the\nCourt of Three Judges in Jasmine Gowrimani, at [39].\n601. Cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action arises if, (and only\nif), the Tribunal is of the view that “there is (potential or prima facie)\nmerit in the complaint”, which would result in a finding of “due cause’,\nby the Court of Three Judges (see Jasmine Gowrimani, at [34] and\n[37]). In other words, the misconduct must be \"sufficiently serious to\nwarrant the imposition of sanctions under s 83(1) of the LPA” (see\nLaw Society of Singapore v Udeh Kumar s/o Sethuraju [2017] SGHC\n\n1471 at [30]).\n602.The sentencing principles set out in Law Society of Singapore v\nNor’ain bte Abu Bakar [2008] 1 SLR(R) 753 at [92] are instructive —\n(a)\n\n\"Where a solicitor has acted dishonestly,\nthat he be struck off the roll of solicitors.\n\nthe court will order\n\n189\n\n\f(b)\n\nIf a solicitor is not shown to have acted dishonestly, but is\nshown to have fallen below the required standards of integrity,\nprobity and trustworthiness, he will nonetheless be struck off\nthe roll of solicitors, as opposed to merely being suspended, if\n\nhis lapse is such as to indicate that he lacks the qualities of\n_character and trustworthiness which are necessary attributes\nof a person\n\nentrusted\n\nthe\n\nwith\n\nresponsibilities\n\nof a legal\n\npractitioner.\nA further consideration to be borne in mind when deciding on\nthe appropriate penalty is the public dimension of disciplinary\nsentencing, which is the equivalent of public denunciation by\nthe court in the process of punishing an offender for the\noffence he has committed. This process serves to preserve\n\npublic confidence in the legal profession as an integral part of\nthe legal system.”\n[Emphasis added.]\n\n603. The misconduct that the Respondent is guilty of represents a serious\n\ndeparture from the most basic and fundamental standards expected\nof an advocate and solicitor — complete honesty and fidelity to his/her\nclient.\n\nRespondent\n\nThe\n\nacted\n\nwith\n\ndishonesty,\n\ndeceit,\n\nand\n\nin\n\nleave such egregious and\ndishonest conduct unsanctioned would bring disrepute upon the\nprofession. We accordingly determine, pursuant to section 93(1)(c)\nof the LPA, that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action exists\ndisregard\n\nof her legal obligations.\n\nTo\n\nunder section 83 of the LPA.\n\nXl.\n\nConclusion\n\n604. The main facts in this matter are not in much dispute.\n\n190\n\n\f605.In summary:\n\n(a)\n\nMs KKL was responsible for drafting Mr Lee’s First to Sixth\nWills, from 2011 to 201297\", She was his lawyer.

The Will that Mr Lee signed was\nvery different from both the Penultimate Will, and the proposed\nCodicil (that Mr Lee had discussed and agreed with Ms KKL, on 13\nDecember 2013, four days before he signed the Last Will prepared\nby the Respondent). The Respondent gave the briefest of advice to\nMr Lee, and did not alert Mr Lee to all the differences between what\n\nMr Lee had earlier wanted and what the Last Will actually provided\nfor.\n\n438 See paragraphs 324-331, 412-416, 510-511, 531 and 578-680 of this Decision.\n437 See paragraphs 544, 551-556, 560-567, 586-592, 597 and 603 of this Decision.\n\n198\n\n\f608.As\n\nstated\n\nearlier, the Last Will increased\n\nMr\n\nLHY’s\n\nshare\n\nin the\n\nEstate*®®, The Respondent, in explaining aspects of her conduct (with\nregards to the haste with which the Last Will was done), said that she\nwas acting as an “obedient wife\" (see paragraph 531).\n609.

The\nAffidavits were contrived to present a false picture.

He pleaded guilty to two charges and the remaining two charges were taken into account and sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment and ordered to pay penalty of $118,341.78, being three times the amount of tax evaded.

director.”</p>\n<h3><strong>The Law Society’s Case</strong></h3>\n<p>The complainant was a client of Frontier Law Corporation (“FLC”) and the Respondent, the sole director of FLC. In effect, the Respondent was not the proprietor of FLC, but actually employed by one Mohd Sadique bin Ibrahim Marican (“Sadique”) and one Anand Kumar s/o Toofani Beldar (“Anand”) to manage FLC in 2009. The Respondent was paid a sum of $7,500 per month by them. The manager of FLC was Ebrahim Marican Batcha Sahib (‘Ebrahim’), who was not an advocate and solicitor. Both Sadique and Anand subsequently left FLC and the Respondent left the control and management of FLC entirely to Ebrahim.</p>\n<p>In February 2013, the complainant instructed FLC to act in the purchase of a property and signed a Warrant to Act. On the face of it, the Respondent was the signatory to the Warrant to Act. However, the complainant never met the Respondent at all although the Respondent appeared in court for the complainant to successfully obtain specific performance against the vendor. In fact, by this time, the Respondent had ceased to practice at FLC and was acting as “instructed counsel’ in another law practice. The Respondent very much left matters at FLC under Ebrahim’s care.</p>\n<p>On 19 April 2013, the complainant paid the sum of $108,000 to FLC ostensibly to “facilitate completion of the property”. FLC acknowledged receipt of the moneys but failed to complete the purchase. Subsequently investigations revealed that the monies had been withdrawn from FLC through a series of ATM and cheque withdrawals. These withdrawals were traced to Ebrahim.</p>\n<h3><strong>Findings of the Disciplinary Tribunal (“DT”)</strong></h3>\n<p>Before dealing with each specific charge, the DT made a general observation regarding the duty of an Advocate and Solicitor in relation to his duty to supervise his practice.</p>\n<p>Rule 8(1) of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (2010 Ed) (the “PCR”) provides:</p>\n<p><em>“8(1) An advocate and solicitor shall exercise proper supervision over his employees and other staff.”</em></p>\n<p>The Tribunal accepted the cases of <em>Law Society of Singapore v Tan Chwee Wan Allan </em>[2007] 4 SLR(R) 669 and <em>Law Society of Singapore v Zulkifli Bin Mohd Amin &amp; Anor [</em>2011] 2 SLR 620 in which the court stated that the responsibility to supervise is “unyielding” (<em>Allan Tan</em> at page 430) “and in the court stated that a solicitor is<em> “not to abdicate such responsibility … by delegating … without any adequate system or periodic checks”. (Zulkifli </em>at page 38)</p>\n<p>A solicitor can delegate his work to his employee and mere delegation is not, ipso facto, breach of Rule 8(1) of the PCR. However, that does not absolve the solicitor from his overall responsibility to ensure there is proper supervision of what goes on in the practice. A particular act performed by an employee in a law firm must be viewed in the totality of the circumstances for one to decide if the solicitor in allowing that act has been negligent in allowing it. In most instances the test lies not in the act itself (unless the act is obviously illegal, improper or in breach of the rules), but in whether or not there is in place a system to ensure that the solicitor knows about it.</p>\n<h3><strong>DT’s Findings on the Charges</strong></h3>\n<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> charge accused the Respondent of surrendering the management and control of FLC to Sadique and Anand from July 2008 to November 2010. The DT found the 3<sup>rd</sup> Charge proved. The DT found that the two Letters amounted to a confession by the Respondent that he had surrendered the management and control of the practice to Sadique and Anand during this period. It was wrong for the Respondent not to have any control at all over the files brought into the firm, including those brought in by Sadique and Anand. The Respondent owed an obligation to all clients of FLC.</p>\n<p>The 4<sup>th</sup> Charge accused the Respondent of not exercising control and management of FLC by allowing Ebrahim from November 2010 to have full rein of the management of FLC. The DT found this charged proved. Despite knowing that Sadique and Anand were disbarred, he took no steps to acquaint himself with the running of FLC, and to take over the reins of management. In cross-examination the he admitted that he did not supervise Ebrahim and was in breach of the Rules. The Tribunal found that the failure of the Respondent to supervise the Ebrahim was complete. The lack of control enable Ebrahim to embezzle money deposited by the complainant. The lack of management of the practice was egregious and systematic and such complete failure started in July 2008 and continued right up to 2010.</p>\n<p>The 5<sup>th</sup> Charge accused the Respondent of not ensuring that the complainant’s $108,000 would not be deposited into the office account. This payment into the office account is a breach of Rule 3(1) of Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and Rule 5(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011. These are strict liability offences and the DT found the charge proved. The Respondent’s failure to ensure that the $108,000 was not paid into FLC’s office account took place in the context of a complete lack of supervision by the Respondent and resulted in its theft of the money by Ebrahim.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the DT determined under section 93(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act (the “Act’) that cause for sufficient gravity exists for disciplinary action against Krishna Morthy S V under section 83 of the Act.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Council’s Decision </strong></h3>\n<p>Council adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and accordingly proceeded to apply for leave under section 98 of the Act for the Respondent to show cause as to why he should not suffer sanctions set out in section 83 of the Act.</p>\n<h3><strong>The Court of Three Judges</strong></h3>\n<p>The Respondent was subsequently ordered to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors by the Court of Three Judges.</p>\n","content":"In the Matter of Krishna Morthy S

In most instances the test lies not in the act itself (unless the act is obviously illegal, improper or in breach of the rules), but in whether or not there is in place a system to ensure that the solicitor knows about it.\n\nDT’s Findings on the Charges\n\nThe 3rd charge accused the Respondent of surrendering the management and control of FLC to Sadique and Anand from July 2008 to November 2010. The DT found the 3rd Charge proved. The DT found that the two Letters amounted to a confession by the Respondent that he had surrendered the management and control of the practice to Sadique and Anand during this period. It was wrong for the Respondent not to have any control at all over the files brought into the firm, including those brought in by Sadique and Anand. The Respondent owed an obligation to all clients of FLC.\n\nThe 4th Charge accused the Respondent of not exercising control and management of FLC by allowing Ebrahim from November 2010 to have full rein of the management of FLC. The DT found this charged proved. Despite knowing that Sadique and Anand were disbarred, he took no steps to acquaint himself with the running of FLC, and to take over the reins of management. In cross-examination the he admitted that he did not supervise Ebrahim and was in breach of the Rules. The Tribunal found that the failure of the Respondent to supervise the Ebrahim was complete. The lack of control enable Ebrahim to embezzle money deposited by the complainant. The lack of management of the practice was egregious and systematic and such complete failure started in July 2008 and continued right up to 2010.\n\nThe 5th Charge accused the Respondent of not ensuring that the complainant’s $108,000 would not be deposited into the office account. This payment into the office account is a breach of Rule 3(1) of Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules and Rule 5(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011. These are strict liability offences and the DT found the charge proved. The Respondent’s failure to ensure that the $108,000 was not paid into FLC’s office account took place in the context of a complete lack of supervision by the Respondent and resulted in its theft of the money by Ebrahim.\n\nAccordingly, the DT determined under section 93(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act (the “Act’) that cause for sufficient gravity exists for disciplinary action against Krishna Morthy S V under section 83 of the Act.\n\nThe Council’s Decision\n\nCouncil adopted the findings and recommendations of the DT and accordingly proceeded to apply for leave under section 98 of the Act for the Respondent to show cause as to why he should not suffer sanctions set out in section 83 of the Act.\n\nThe Court of Three Judges\n\nThe Respondent was subsequently ordered to be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors by the Court of Three Judges.\n","timestamp":"2018-01-07T04:00:19+00:00","url":"https://lawgazette.com.sg/notices/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/disciplinary-tribunal-reports/"}]
