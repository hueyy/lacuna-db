The Mother was represented by Mr Mark Cheng. The Son was self-represented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial and reserved judgment. My decision was delivered on 10 October 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The essence of this dispute was that the Mother could no longer tolerate living together with her Son given his living habits and bad temper. She thus brought the present application in SSP 316 of 2025 (“SSP 316”). She sought a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”), as well as a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was plain to me that the real objective of the Mother’s application in SSP 316 was to obtain the DEO so as to exclude the Son entirely from the flat. The architecture of the provisions relating to family violence in the Women’s Charter make it clear that the court only has the power to grant a DEO in the event a PPO has been granted: s 60B(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found that a PPO should be granted in the present case. For one, it was, in my judgment, likely that the Son would commit family violence on the Mother. Specifically, I found that he would, in all likelihood, lash out at the Mother if she were to do things in the house that were not to his liking. Indeed, on the Son’s own evidence, he would get angry when the Mother would not shut the windows when second-hand cigarette smoke wafted over from the neighbouring unit. He also said his temper flared up when his Mother had forgotten to close a bottle of expensive vitamins he had bought for her on a few occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Anger alone, in the ordinary course of things, would be insufficient to establish the likelihood of family violence. It is human, all too human, to feel anger when our boundaries have been crossed. The evidence in the present case, however, does show that the Son would act on his anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       First, it was quite clear that the Son would go to extreme lengths to minimise or avoid the risks posed by second-hand smoke. This was evident, not only from the work he had done around the house to keep out second-hand smoke, the complaint he had filed to National Environment Agency about the neighbours smoking, but also in his testimony where he described how he would continually try to explain to the Mother, the perils of second and third hand smoke.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Second, the evidence also showed that the Son had indeed lashed out at the Mother. The Mother had, in her affidavit, recounted an incident on 19<sup>th</sup> October 2024. She had left the window open. The Son was enraged. He entered her room, grabbed her arm and pulled her into the kitchen, claiming that she was letting in cigarette smoke and that in so doing, she would increase the risk of cancer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       When confronted by Mr Cheng in cross-examination, about whether he had grabbed the Mother’s arm and brought her to the kitchen, the Son’s response is telling: he first claimed he was “not sure” if he had grabbed her arm, then said he definitely held her hand, before attempting to clarify with Mr Cheng what he had meant by his question. The Son, however, did admit that he was angry and that he had asked the Mother to “come and smell this”. Given the Son’s testimony, I accept the Mother’s account of what had happened in this incident on 19<sup>th</sup> October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In addition to this incident, the Son had also admitted that he would, in a fit of anger, “vent out”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He explained that he would shout as an “outward expression” because he had the “habit of doing that to [his] family members” since he was growing up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It was thus clear to me that the Son was likely to inflict family violence on the Mother, namely, that he would likely either verbally abuse or physically confront her in the event that she had done something in the house that was not to his liking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Having found that the Son was likely to inflict family violence on the Mother, I also found it necessary to order a PPO for the Mother’s personal safety or protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is well-established that in assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court assesses the risk of future family violence being committed on the person sought to be protected under the order. There was, in my judgment, a heightened risk of this happening – that is because both the Mother and the Son still continue to live together in the same flat. While the both of them had given evidence of their intention and efforts to find separate housing arrangements, the reality was that none of their plans had been firmed up and cast in stone. Their present living arrangement will thus go on, and with it, only create further opportunities for conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having concluded that a PPO should be granted, I turn now to consider the necessity of ordering a DEO. Given that a DEO may only be ordered in the event a PPO is granted, this implies that the purpose of a DEO is to deal with situations where a PPO alone does not go far enough to ensure the protection or personal safety of the person protected under the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In this vein, there was the question of whether a DEO was necessary given that the Mother was the legal owner of the flat, and would therefore be able to exclude the Son from the flat by simply exercising her property rights.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Mr Cheng alluded to the fact that the Mother had neither the presence or the authority to persuade the Son to move out, and that she had already tried, and failed. Mr Cheng also highlighted that sending the Son an eviction notice might be an exercise in futility as the Son would be resistant to moving out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     This question of whether a DEO should be ordered in cases where the person sought to be protected by the DEO is able to, <em>qua</em> legal owner, effectively achieve the same outcome was not a point that I had to decide in the present case. That is because I did not find that the Mother had demonstrated the necessity of a DEO. The Mother stated, in her own affidavit, that her Son’s actions had somewhat toned down with the issuance of an Expedited Order (“EO”) (which is, for all intents and purposes, a temporary PPO issued until the application can be heard by the court – see s 61 of the Women’s Charter 1961). It thus appears that a PPO would be sufficient to ensure her personal safety and protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I would also add that the evidence before me only went so far as to show that there were clashes between her and the Son over their daily living arrangements in the flat. It did not demonstrate that the Mother was in danger of real bodily harm should the Son continue to live in the flat with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To sum up, I allowed the Mother’s application for a PPO. In addition to that, I also ordered both the Mother and the Son to attend counselling. The Mother’s application for a DEO was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Finally, I made no order as to costs given that the Mother did not obtain all the orders that she sought in SSP 316.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript, 19 September 2025 at p 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, 19 September 2025 at p 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, 19 September 2025, p 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript, 19 September 2025, p 31.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-12-16","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 2266 and 2272 of 2024","title":"XWG v XWF","citation":"[2025] SGFC 137","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34239-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Father in person and unrepresented","The Mother in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-12-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XWG v XWF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XWG <em>v</em> XWF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34239-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 137</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 2266 and 2272 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">16 December 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Father in person and unrepresented; The Mother in person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XWG — XWF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">16 December 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       There were two applications before me:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 2266/2024 was the Father’s application against the Mother. He sought a PPO to protect both himself and the two sons (“A” and “B”) against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 2272/2024 was the Mother’s application against the Father. She too sought a PPO to protect herself and the two sons against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Judgment was delivered on 20 August 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both applications were filed prior to the 2nd of January 2025. There can therefore be no quarrel that the provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 relating to family violence which were in force prior to that date apply to the present applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       To succeed in their respective applications for a PPO, the Father and the Mother had to establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, that the respondent had either committed family violence, or was likely to commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, that it was necessary for the court to grant the PPO for the protection of the persons for whom the order was sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It also goes without saying, and this is well-established in our case law, that the point of such orders is to protect, and not to punish respondents for any acts of family violence that they may have committed: <em>XQW v XQV and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33780-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 91</a> at [1] citing <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a>; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [19(b)(i)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Both the Father and the Mother mainly rely on an incident that had taken place on 19 November 2024 to support their respective applications. The both of them, however, presented slightly accounts of what had transpired that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This was the Father’s account. He said that he had caught the Mother red-handed having an affair with her ex-boyfriend. He confronted the Mother. He threatened to divorce her. This provoked the Mother. She became agitated. As a result, the quarrel escalated. The Mother had, allegedly, taken B, and tried to throw him off the balcony. The Father stepped in to restrain her. The Father gained control of B. It was then that the Mother tried to attack A. The Father called in his father-in-law and had a word with him about the Mother’s psychiatric issues. According to the Father, he thought that the reason the Wife was acting up was due to her mental condition. The police were eventually called in, but no action was taken as it was a family issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother, on the other hand, did not deny meeting her ex-boyfriend on that day. What she did deny, was that she was having an affair with him, or that she slept with him on that day. She said they talked. After they finished their conversation, her ex-boyfriend drove her home. When she returned home, she got into an argument with the Father who was badgering her for the baby bonus money. During their discussion, the Father discovered that the Mother had met up with her ex-boyfriend. He was enraged. The argument escalated. The Father alleged that the Mother had gone to a hotel with her ex-boyfriend. He began to beat her. The Mother alleges that it was the Father who had threatened to throw their son from the balcony, and not her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Based on the evidence put before me, the most that can be said was that there was a quarrel between the Father and the Mother. In this regard, I find the Mother’s recounting of events, specifically, that the reason for their heated quarrel was because the Father had discovered that the Mother had met up with her ex-boyfriend, to be more plausible as opposed to the Father’s account. That was because the Father did not strike me as a man who would let such a thing slide. Insofar as both the Father and the Mother accused each other of trying to throw B off the balcony, there was nothing to support or corroborate their respective accounts. The most that can be said, therefore, is that both their sons were likely caught up amidst their domestic quarrel, and unfortunately, had to witness both their parents fighting. This, however, did not mean that family violence had been inflicted on both sons by either parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Apart from this incident, the Father also raised the issue of the Mother’s psychiatric condition. To support his assertion that the Mother had a psychiatric condition, he pointed me to a referral letter from Hospital R. That letter states that the Mother had been admitted for “new onset psychosis” and that she was following up with Hospital R’s psychiatric department. The letter, however, does not state the severity of the Mother’s condition, nor does it detail how her condition would affect those around her, namely, the Father as well as their two sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In short, the evidence before me does not go so far as to establish that the Mother’s alleged psychiatric condition was so severe such that it could be concluded that she was likely to commit family violence on either her two sons, or the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Finally, the last major point which the Father had raised was in relation to an incident where the Mother had allegedly pushed A down the stairs. The Father had attached a report from A’s playschool. That report states that A had been observed limping. The teacher asked A what had happened. A said that the Mother had pushed him down the stairs. The teacher was taken aback. She shared it with the school principal. The Mother stated that A was fine and did not have any fall at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition to the report, a series of screenshots were also produced. Those screenshots contained text messages which corroborated the report from the school. These screenshots were sent in a group chat which included both the Father, the Mother and the school teachers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I note that the Mother had indeed texted the group chat to state that A was fine and did not have any fall at home. This was, however, quite different from what she had stated in her testimony. She recounted, when asked why A would accuse her of pushing him down the stairs, that A had tripped over a small bicycle. She was adamant that she remembered this incident. But if this was indeed the case, and the Mother knew that A was limping because he had tripped over a bicycle, why did she not simply communicate this on the group chat? Instead – she said, on the group chat, that A was fine and that he did not have any fall at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     While this discrepancy between the Mother’s testimony and what the contemporaneous evidence shows, may suggest that the Mother was, in some way, responsible for A’s limp, the Father’s account is based entirely on what the teachers had told him, which was in turn, entirely based on what A had told them. In other words, the Father’s case that A had indeed been pushed by the Mother is based on hearsay: see <em>XOD v XOC and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33474-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 73</a> at [72]; <em>XJZ v XJY and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33006-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 30</a> at [32]. The teachers had not been called as witnesses, and there was therefore no opportunity for the Wife to quiz them on what had actually happened that day and what A had told them. Given this, I did not find that the Father had indeed made out his case that the Mother had pushed A down a flight of stairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For completeness, I would also state that I do not find that either the Mother, or the Father, were likely to commit family violence on their children. The evidence showed that while their relationship was a dysfunctional one, their children were not the main targets of their fury, but rather, unfortunate bystanders to their quarrels and fights. For instance, the Mother herself told me that the Father would not hit the children – rather, she had taken out a PPO for her children because she did not want them to keep seeing her being beaten up by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In this connection, I also found that it was not necessary to order a PPO for the protection of the children. As I have mentioned, the evidence did not show that either the Father, or the Mother, posed a threat to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Rather, I found that both the Father and the Mother did, in their own way, care for their sons. For instance, the Mother had shared, in her testimony, the sort of life she envisioned for the both of them, and how she wanted to raise them. The Father had also shared how he would do anything to ensure that both his sons were safe – and that included taking matters into his own hands. In addition, the Father’s witness, who was his sister-in-law,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> also gave evidence that the Father had been good towards his children, and that he loved them – I saw no evidence or reason to doubt her testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In short, I did not find that a PPO should be ordered for both children against either parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     That being said, I found that a PPO should be ordered for the Mother, against the Father. I found it likely that the Father would commit family violence on the Mother – as I have explained, the Father had told me that he was willing to take matters into his own hands if he thought that his children were in danger. The Mother is currently having custody of the children. I therefore considered it likely that the Father would go to confront the Mother if he thought that his sons were in danger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I would also add that notwithstanding the fact that the Father was currently in prison pursuant to a detention order for secret society activity,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that in no way diminished the necessity of a PPO. In fact, this increased the need for the PPO. For one, while the Father was incarcerated, he had not been able to see the children. It was clear to me that this only served to amplify his existing concerns over their safety which were borne out of the strained relations which he had with the Mother. This, coupled with what the Father had told me, that he was willing to take matters into his own hands, made it clear that a PPO was indeed necessary for the Mother’s personal protection so as to avoid a situation where the Father would make trouble for her upon his release.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As for the Father’s application for a PPO for himself, I did not see a basis to grant such an order. For one, and in the Father’s own words – he had brought the application mainly because he was concerned for the children’s safety and he did not really see a need for a PPO for himself. In that vein, the incidents that he complained of mainly centered on what he says were acts of family violence that the Mother had committed on the children – I thought it clear from the testimony that I had heard, as well as the evidence put before me, that the Mother had not committed family violence on the Father. In any event, I also did not find it likely that the Mother would commit family violence on him – I gathered from her testimony that she wished to give the Father a wide berth, given the state of her relationship with him. That much was also evident from the access arrangements to the children which are being facilitated by a third party, thereby removing the need for the Mother to come into contact with the Father. In this vein, and for the same reasons, I also did not find it necessary to order a PPO for the Father’s protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To sum up, I granted the Mother a PPO for herself against the Father.

My reasons follow.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       To obtain a PPO, A must show that R has, on a balance of probabilities, committed FV against the person to be protected, and the PPO is necessary for that person’s protection or personal safety. This is provided for under s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“WC”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Protection order</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>65.</b>—(1)    The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       FV is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       To be clear, I proceeded on the basis of the family violence regime before the amendments came into force on 2 January 2025, given that the conduct concerned took place prior to the amendments coming into force, that the complaint was filed prior to the amendments coming into force, and that neither party has asserted that the post-amendment FV regime applies to this case. In any event, I do not consider that it will turn the result of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether R committed FV on S</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In analysing whether R committed FV on S, I have somewhat rearranged the order in which I will address the issues raised:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Confining S to his bedroom (Part of Incident 1)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SIB, in particular, being caused by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Confining S to his bedroom (Part of Incident 1)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bringing S to noisy, enclosed spaces (Incident 4)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Appearing in front of S (Incident 2)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Making S wear a protective helmet for prolonged periods (Incident 3)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Feeding cetirizine and melatonin (Incidents 5–6)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Confining S to his bedroom</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The first complaint is that R confined S to the bedroom on 7 September 2024. According to A, at about 9.00am, R instructed S to enter her bedroom and subsequently closed the door. Thereafter, in the domestic helper’s testimony, screaming and sounds of distress could be heard emanating from the room. S remained in the room with S until about 2.00pm, at which point he exited, exhibiting fresh, visible injuries—a bruised face, and a swollen foot and a limp. According to R, S had stubbed his foot on the wheel of a chair while moving around the room in his agitated state. R says that, as S began engaging in self-injurious behaviour by hitting his own face, R handed S his protective helmet to prevent further injury, and kept S in her bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In my view, the allegation of confinement is not established on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A points out that R’s evidence was inconsistent, as R, on the stand, testified that R entered S’s bedroom. However, this in my view does not turn the case. The crucial point is that there was no direct evidence that R had confined S in any room, <em>ie</em>, that R had prevented S from leaving against S’s will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     A argues that R, when S was in a state of agitation, had decided to handle the situation alone and not involve the domestic helper, and had “isolated” S behind a closed door. However, I do not consider that the cross-examination allows the situation to be fairly characterised as one of “isolation”. In my view, there is no requirement that R enlist the assistance of someone else when S is in a state of agitation, or that R refrain from “isolating” S. These, in my view, are parenting decisions that are improper for the court to interfere with. A also points out that R failed to call as an independent witness the individual whom R says she was having a phone conversation with. While R’s account of events are uncorroborated, A is in no better a position: to begin with, A was not at the scene, and what he relies on is essentially the testimony of his domestic helper, which itself is circumstantial evidence in some ways. Ultimately, A must prove his contentions on the strength of his own case, not on the weakness of R’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Self-injurious behaviour</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I next address the major contention in A’s case—that R acted so as to cause S to engage in self-injurious behaviour. This, A says, amounts to FV. This contention deserves closer examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, it cannot be reasonably argued that conduct which impacts the family member’s self-injurious tendency amounts to wrongful confinement or restraint (<em>ie</em>, para (<em>c</em>) of the definition). I also do not think it normally amounts to wilfully or knowingly placing (or attempting to place) the family member in fear of hurt (<em>ie</em>, para (<em>a</em>) of the definition). This is because the family member is the individual who inflicts the hurt on himself or herself. It would seem somewhat contradictory to claim that the family member at the same time <em>inflicts</em> the hurt on himself/herself, and <em>fears</em> that very hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In principle, it seems possible that such conduct satisfies para (<em>d</em>) of the definition, <em>ie</em>, causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the alleged victim. However, two caveats are in order: first, the conduct must amount to continual harassment; and second, it must be established that the respondent either intended to cause or knew that such continual harassment was likely to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It might also be that such conduct satisfies para (<em>b</em>) of the definition, <em>ie</em>, causing hurt by an act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt. However, it is in my view too simplistic to say that FV is committed (or, at least, a PPO should be granted), as long as the respondent knows or ought to know that his conduct would <em>ultimately</em> result in hurt being inflicted on the alleged victim via SIB.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The riposte to the logic that the conduct satisfies para (<em>b</em>) of the definition (and perhaps even para (<em>d</em>)) is that such hurt amounts to a <em>novus actus interveniens</em>—an intervening act by a third party, in this case the alleged victim himself/herself. Otherwise, the legal burden on the respondent would be unbearably onerous. Take, for example, a case where S starts to injure himself. R, instead of restraining S, shouts “Stop it!” at S, hoping or wishing that would stop his SIB, but knowing that S might very well become agitated and continue/escalate his SIB. If that SIB continues or escalates, this logic would mean that the respondent might be taken have committed FV, simply because she <em>knew</em> that S was likely to engage in SIB. But, it also ought not be the case that as a universal rule a respondent can <em>never</em> be held liable just because the act of hurt is consummated by the alleged victim hurting himself/herself. In my view, to obtain a PPO on the basis of para (<em>b</em>) of the definition, the balance is struck by requiring the complainant to establish something more concrete—specifically:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     that there was some <em>loss of control</em> on the part of the alleged victim (in which case it might be said that the SIB was not an intervening act for which the respondent ought not to be held responsible); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the respondent was acting in a way that was <em>calculated</em> to elicit the SIB (in which case it does not lie in the respondent’s mouth to deny that he/she ought to know that the conduct would result in hurt, or at least that that the protection is not necessary).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, these two requirements are necessary to establish FV and the necessity for a PPO. If the requirement as to R’s mental state were any lower, it would mean that the victim’s family members become constrained in the way they attempt to manage the SIB, for fear of the spectre of a PPO looming over them. That, in my view, cannot be correct. Ultimately, a finding of FV can eventually sound in criminal sanctions, and the issuance of a PPO must be based on acts of sufficient gravity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I turn to the facts of the case at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The central failing in A’s case, in my judgment, is the fact that A has not established that R was acting in a way to <em>elicit</em> the SIB (or, for that matter, that R acted knowing that <em>in all likelihood</em> (<em>ie</em>, not merely that it is likely) that SIB would occur). Ultimately, A’s contentions about R’s character and proclivities were, on the evidence, largely bare assertions. Considering that these accusations are grave, because in substance they accuse R of conducting herself with a view to causing her own son to exhibit SIB, I do not consider them to be proven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Next, insofar as A alleges that there were “regular occurrences”, I do not consider that there are sufficient particulars for R to respond to it. In the event, I proceed only on incidents which A alleged happened on specific dates. I turn to the specific allegations for which a specific date was provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   Appearing in front of S</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     A says that S began to exhibit distress since March 2023, when R vetoed S’s wishes to pursue his academic and research interests in France. Despite this, R continued to position herself in S’s immediate presence, knowingly exacerbating his condition (rather than removing herself to alleviate S’s distress). The most recent instance of this was at a staycation on 6 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In my view, R cannot have committed FV by placing herself in S’s immediate presence, even if this is indeed a trigger for S’s SIB. To hold otherwise is tantamount to saying that the law requires R to alienate herself from her own son at her son’s wishes. That, in my view, cannot be correct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To the extent that A says that R had deliberately timed her appearance to inflict maximum distress and to trigger S’s SIB, A has not sufficiently explained this point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Confining S to his bedroom</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As I explained above, I do not find that R confined S to any bedroom against S’s will on 7 September 2024. Accordingly, the further allegation that such confinement led to S engaging in SIB must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Bringing S to noisy, enclosed spaces</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     A’s case is that R had brought S to restaurants with loud background sounds to deliberately frustrate S and overwhelm S with external stimuli. However, there is no evidence that R’s conduct was calculated to elicit SIB from S, apart from S’s say-so. This is especially given R’s clarification that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     S is habituated to using noise-cancelling headphones in such situations; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     R has developed a routine to help S cope with such situations (where, according to her, the primary source of frustration is the wait for the food rather than the noise).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     There is no specific evidence, for example, that R had rejected quieter locations in favour of louder locations for no reason other than her own whim and fancy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     A argues that R was professionally advised to minimise sensory overload, and she had therefore intentionally subjected S to avoidable distress and self-injury by choosing noisy environments. However, as A notes, R has explained that although S experiences occasional distress, the episodes were short, and easily managed with the helper’s assistance, and calming strategies. Also, R’s position is that regular outings were beneficial for S’s social adaptation. It appears to me that this is simply a clash in parenting styles. In some sense, the analogy to be drawn here is to the management of a mild allergy—in one parent’s opinion, the correct management involves abstinence to avoid an allergic reaction, while in the other parent’s opinion, the correct management involves exposure to build tolerance. I do not think that the fact of professional advice invalidates my analysis. It could very well be—in fact, it appears to be the case—that R sincerely thinks that her management is no less inferior a method than what was professionally advised. It may turn out to be the ill-advised course of action, but, in my view, just because some hurt results from R not observing professional advice does not in and of itself turn the situation into one of FV. In my view, A has far from established in cross-examination that R did not sincerely believe in the logic and efficacy of the way she manages S’s SIB and sensory overloads.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Making S wear a protective helmet for prolonged periods</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     According to A, a therapist hired by R had prescribed a protective helmet for S to wear, to protect himself from the impact of his SIB. He had later specified that the helmet ought to be removed every hour to prevent discomfort. However, R, A says, ignored the guidelines, and instead forced S to wear the helmet for prolonged periods, resulting in an ear infection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my judgment, the evidence fails to disclose FV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     There is insufficient evidence to show on the balance of probabilities that R forced S to don the helmet or to continue wearing it against his will (<em>ie</em>, when he did not want to put it on or when he wanted to take it off). R’s testimony, which was broadly unchallenged, was that S was capable of wearing and taking the helmet off by himself. Given that the helmet both serves a protective function and has a side effect, it seems to me that the proportion of time which S spends with the helmet on or off can be the subject of reasonable disagreement. In fact, the therapist had revised his own recommendation at some point in time. In this regard, even if R did not give express instructions for S to take off the helmet periodically, S could have taken it off if he was uncomfortable. I therefore conclude that R cannot be held to have committed FV against S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Feeding S cetirizine</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     A claims that it would be harmful to S to feed him cetirizine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     However, there is no reliable medical evidence for A’s contention. Specifically, there was no letter (or, for that matter, testimony) from any of S’s attending physicians that cetirizine was to be avoided, despite A’s claims that S’s neurologist had cautioned against it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In cross-examination, A also conceded that cetirizine and melatonin do not cause direct harm, but instead that it can be—in other words, it runs the risk of—exacerbating any seizures that may happen. A also accepted, at least, that cetirizine may on balance be administered in the case of a serious cold. This must mean that cetirizine has the effect of treating symptoms of cold. The point to be gleaned is that cetirizine is not, as A attempts to persuade upon me, all evil and no good. Instead, cetirizine, like several medications, has its intended therapeutic effects and carries side effects, in this case an increased conditional risk of an adverse event. Its administration can be seen as a risk-reward trade-off, on which there may be reasonable disagreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In this case, S had been recently prescribed cetirizine about 1 month prior to the instance in issue where he was given cetirizine. In other words, a registered medical practitioner has already come to the view that S may consume cetirizine. A claims that the prescribing doctor is a general practitioner who is unaware of S’s history of epilepsy. However, there is little reliable basis for A’s contention, since A was not present at the consultation and is unable to testify as to the doctor’s history-taking and assessment. There is, in the first place, no reliable medical evidence that cetirizine cannot be prescribed for patients susceptible to epilepsy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The documentary evidence shows an exchange between R and her helper indicating that the helper reporting that S had a runny nose and was sneezing, and had a blocked nose, and that R instructed the helper to feed cetirizine only if the sneezing did not clear after 5–10 minutes. Ultimately, it was also not alleged that S suffered any seizures as a result of cetirizine being administered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     A’s contention that R should not be fed cetirizine therefore is really a disagreement with R on how S’s situation should be managed. This is, in my view, clearly not FV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Feeding S melatonin </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     R tendered a prescription for melatonin dated 25 Apr 2022 from KKH, which was less than 1 year before the alleged administration of melatonin. It indicated that it was to be taken pro re nata for sleep disturbance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     A argues that it would be harmful to S to feed him melatonin, based on a memo from Dr Phuah Huan Kee dated 14 August 2024, which opined that in S’s case melatonin may cause exacerbation of seizures. A says that R would have known about this because Dr Phuah had verbally cautioned both A and R in 2016 against giving melatonin to S, after having done an EEG in February 2016 which showed a peak. A also says that R had promised just shortly before giving melatonin that she would no longer give melatonin to S. Against this, R pointed out that Dr Phuah had himself administered melatonin to S. A also says that R deliberately withheld these test results from KKH to procure the melatonin prescription. R, however, said that she did not recall that melatonin was not to be administered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In my view, the fact that Dr Phuah had himself administered melatonin to S counts for little. It is common ground that Dr Phuah administered melatonin only once, during the EEG. The point is that it was done under supervision, and that it led to the test results which led Dr Phuah to caution against the use of melatonin. Nonetheless, it is very tenuous to say that R has therefore committed FV. I observe that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Dr Phuah was not here to give evidence. There was nothing in his report that stated that he had advised in 2016 not to feed S melatonin, even though one would assume that he keeps his medical records or notes. In other words, it is possible that Dr Phuah never cautioned against melatonin, or that the EEG findings may no longer be valid after a long passage of time. Although R did not give the EEG findings to the KKH doctors, I do not consider this to be a problem because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There is insufficient evidence to satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that R deliberately withheld the EEG with a view to procuring a prescription for melatonin. Much less can it be said that R procured the prescription for melatonin by fraud.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The doctors in KKH are also qualified to practice medicine, and they could have ordered the EEG if they considered it necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If R wanted to feed melatonin, it seems to me that she would have done so on more occasions. Especially if A’s case was that R is prone to feeding medicine without an indication for it, it seems unlikely that R would wait until a seeming reason presented itself to feed R melatonin.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Likewise, it was also not alleged that S suffered any seizures as a result of melatonin being administered. In the circumstances, I take the view that it is clearly not FV to have administered melatonin to S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In the context of managing a child who tends to exhibit SIB, or who has medical susceptibilities, parenting disagreements are only to be expected. However, a court, least of all one seised of the duty to determine whether FV has been committed, is patently the wrong forum to argue over whether family or parenting decisions have been optimised to manage the SIB, or to lay blame for sub-optimal decisions. That is a matter for A and R to sort out between themselves. In the final analysis, this summons really is, and really ought to be, about whether A has established on a balance of probabilities that R has committed FV and, thereafter, whether it is necessary to issue a PPO to protect the putative victim. And, in my judgment, the answer is a clear “no”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the circumstances, the summons is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I order that A pay R costs of the proceedings fixed at $6,000 inclusive of disbursements, in view of the length of the trial, the nature of the allegations, R’s need to react to significant volumes of new material introduced by A on the first day of the trial, and the fact that time was wasted by A calling witnesses who added virtually nothing to the evidence because they lacked personal knowledge on most matters in issue.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Ancillary Matters – Division of Matrimonial Assets – Maintenance for ex-spouse/children"],"date":"2025-12-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1150 of 2024","title":"XTM v XTN","citation":"[2025] SGFC 114","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34225-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in person","Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant"],"timestamp":"2025-12-24T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XTM v XTN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XTM <em>v</em> XTN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34225-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 114</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1150 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 December 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in person; Stephanie Looi Min Yi (Constellation Law Chambers LLC) for the Defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XTM — XTN </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary Matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance for ex-spouse/children</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 December 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff (wife) and the defendant (husband) were married in Argentina in October of 2009 and have 2 sons. Interim Judgment (IJ) dissolving the marriage was entered on 3 April 2024, making this a marriage of a little over 14 years in length. Parties had entered into an agreement on the custody, care and control as well as access to the children. Both sought to vary the consent order (via summons 1139 and 1447/2025). I dismissed the variation applications and issued the following orders on the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The matrimonial assets of a net value of S$1,060,013.34 is to be divided 60:40 in favour of the plaintiff/wife. The defendant/husband is to effect payment of the sum the plaintiff/wife is entitled to within 6 months of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The defendant is to pay maintenance of S$8 000 per month (S$4 000 for each child) with effect from 30 September 2025 and on the last day of each subsequent month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The defendant shall be responsible for the children’s school fees which shall be paid directly by the defendant to the school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The defendant shall be responsible for any hospitalisation costs for the children that is not covered by insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The defendant shall pay to the plaintiff, maintenance of S$1 000 per month for a period of two (2) years from the date of this order or until the plaintiff is in full-time employment, whichever is earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The husband appeals against the orders above. No appeal has been lodged with respect to the orders made on summons 1139 and 1447/2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The wife is 50 years old. She is an Italian citizen who was until January 2025, an Executive Director, Global Head (Skills Based Organisation) at a bank in Singapore. She was unfortunately retrenched and was unemployed at the time of the hearing. She declared her last drawn gross monthly income to be S$26 000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The husband is 45 years of age and is an Australian citizen. He works as an Operations Program Manager at the Singapore office of a multinational technology company (Company X). He earns a gross monthly income of S$19 474.67.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       After their marriage, both parties were working in Australia. The wife worked at a business management consultancy and the husband, at a utilities asset company. The husband was earning more than the wife at the time. Their first son was born in 2010, making him 15 years of age at the time of the hearing. The wife’s mother assisted in his care for a few months before the child was cared for at a childcare facility. In August 2011, the husband secured a job at Company X. While the work brought in a healthy income, it took him away from home for almost half of every month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The wife left her job at the business management consultancy in December 2012 and started her own business. The parties soon started to plan their move to Singapore. They believed that the move would afford them a better balance between their commitments at work and home. The husband managed to secure a transfer to Singapore and the family arrived in January 2015. At the time, she was expecting their second child. As the wife had considerable difficulty with previous pregnancies and had suffered miscarriages, it was thought prudent that she did not work during the pregnancy. After the child was born in August 2015, she secured work with a local bank, as Vice-President of Human Resources (HR) and then as Senior Vice-President of People Transformation until September 2021. The couple was assisted by a domestic helper from the time the second child was born. In September 2021, she assumed a new role as Executive Director at another bank. This job provided a significant increase in salary. Unfortunately, her services were terminated from January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       While parties started to face challenges to their marriage from 2018, it was from about 2021 that significant cracks in the relationship began to surface. While the husband was in Australia visiting his family in 2023, the wife asked that he leave their rented premises on his return. He left in May 2023. He continued to contribute to the family expenses until December 2023 by depositing a monthly sum of S$12 500 into the parties’ joint account with DBS. He claims to have stopped providing further as the wife was utilising it to pay towards expenses they had not agreed on, including her credit card bills. Regardless, he continued to pay for the children’s school fees and expenses when they were with him. Finding it difficult to sustain expenses without the husband’s contribution, the wife took out an interim application for maintenance. This was heard and dismissed on 2 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As the rental of the premises the wife and children were staying at was S$13 000 per month and unsustainable, she had at the time of the hearing before me moved to cheaper accommodation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The wife was acting in person but had sought the attendance of a solicitor to assist her during the proceedings. This was permitted with strict parameters drawn on the role of the solicitor during the proceedings. The husband had legal representation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 112 (1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev. Ed.) (Charter) provides that a court has the power subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce to order the division between parties of any matrimonial asset in such proportions as the court thinks <em>just and equitable</em>. Section 112 (2) provides a list of non-exhaustive factors to assist a court in determining what would be just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Section 112 (10) provides the definition of a matrimonial asset. In <b><em>USB</em></b> v <b><em>USA and another appeal</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> the court expressed that <em>“…..when a marriage is dissolved, in general all the parties’ assets will be treated as matrimonial assets unless a party is able to prove that any particular asset was either not acquired during the marriage or was acquired through a gift or inheritance and is therefore not a matrimonial asset. The party who asserts that an asset is not a matrimonial asset or that only a part of its value should be included in the pool bears the burden of proving this on the balance of probabilities…</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Sums withdrawn from the DBS joint account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       It is trite law that substantial sums expended when divorce is imminent must be returned to the pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff called for the court to make a finding that S$80 828.34 was improperly withdrawn by her husband from their joint DBS account without her knowledge and that this sum be returned by the husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The husband made a similar allegation against his wife and said that he stopped contributing a monthly sum of S$12 500 to prevent her from using the monies on expenses they did not agree on.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I did not place the sum indicated by the wife to have been spent by the husband (nor suggested by the husband to be unreasonable expenses of the wife) back into the pool for division. From the evidence, both parties contributed to this account with the understanding that the monies were to be utilised for various expenses of the family. Even though they earned healthy incomes, their expenses were disproportionately high and the substantial spending from this account was by both parties and largely to meet those expenses which snowballed once parties started to live separately and divorce proceedings commenced. The wife alleged that the husband did not explain every withdrawal and appeared to be “cherry-picking”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> items he could explain. I did not agree. It is impossible for every expense to be accounted for in a marriage. In this case, a lot of what appears to be large payments relate to credit card bills which in turn relate to unmanaged family expenses and expensive school fees. The husband was able to show that he met many of the family expenses from the joint account and there was no credible suggestion that he was removing or utilising it to avoid a fair division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Joint accounts held with children not drawn into the pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The husband was of the view that the accounts held in the joint names of the children and the wife formed part of the wife’s assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I did not place it into the pool of assets to be divided, not on account of it being a modest collective sum but largely because the intention behind the setting up of these accounts was to provide the children with a resource to meet expenses, if needed. In any event, the husband eventually took the position that these need not be brought into the pool for division.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Date of determination of asset value</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties presented 2 different computations of the value of the matrimonial assets, arising significantly from the difference in the date each party proposed as the relevant date for the determination of asset value. In <b><em>ARY</em></b> v <b><em>ARX</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> the court articulated that the default position to determine the pool of matrimonial assets is the date the interim judgment was issued, in this case, 3 April 2024. The court opined that “<em>unless the particular circumstances of justice of the case warrant it, the starting point or default position should be the date that interim judgment is granted</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> In the case before me, the husband left the home in May 2023 but had a continuous relationship with the family after this and before the divorce. He contributed financially into the joint account for the children’s expenses after moving out and once that ceased, their school fees and other expenses. Parties even continued to travel as a family. It would be prudent to apply the date of IJ as the effective date of determination of the matrimonial assets. I accepted to a large extent the computation of the husband as provided at Annex C of his final submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The net value of the matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this case, there was no matrimonial home which was purchased by the parties as they had lived together in rented premises throughout their marriage, and separately in rented premises since May 2023. There was no dispute as to the relevance of any pre-marital asset or inheritance which the husband had received. Having determined the issues relating to the disputed assets and the date at which the assets ought to be computed, the value of assets and liabilities closest to the date of IJ is provided at <b>Table 1</b>. While I agree that the values of unvested shares provided by the husband is subject to variables such as the performance of the company and that it may therefore only represent ballpark values on vesting, any loss of value would be borne by both, as would any gain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Table 1:</b> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"

id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As this was a marriage of 14 years during which time the parties were in full time employment save for brief periods, the structured approach advanced by the Court in <b><em>ANJ</em></b> v <b><em>ANK<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></em></b> was applied. First, a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to the other party was ascribed, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party had made towards the acquisition and improvement of the matrimonial assets. Then, their indirect contributions relative to each other was ascribed a ratio before arriving at an average ratio.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having found that the direct contributions of the parties were approximately in the proportion 38% (wife): 62% (husband),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> I turned to their indirect contributions. The husband was of the view that the indirect contributions of the parties were equal. I was of the view that a fairer division ought to be 65:35 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Even as the parties managed their work and household chores without helpers till the birth of their second child in 2015, the wife appears in my view to be the one who was more consistent in providing for the family and whose contribution was of a nature that connoted a larger responsibility when it came to the care of the children. They were both good providers of financial support. The wife’s income relative to the husband’s was larger only from 2021 but it allowed for greater contribution to the family expenses from that time. Her lower pay before 2021 (relative to her husband’s) would also need to be understood in the context of the manner in which the husband dealt with his salary. Deductions from his salary was made to pay for the OCBC SRS account as well as the Superannuation Fund in Australia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This lowered his available salary for family expenses. Notwithstanding, I am of the view that this was less of a concern given that it was accounted for in the pool of assets. The deductions to his salary for the purchase of shares which amounted to almost S$2 000 a month however was of greater relevance as it reduced available income to meet family expenses. The wife’s salary on the other hand was fully applied to meet the family expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Apart from the time the wife was on maternity leave for 4 months and what appears to be a 2-month paternity leave the husband was on after the birth of their first son in 2010, the husband was away substantially every month for work related matters when he was working for Company X in Australia. This was between 2011 and the end of 2014. During these years, the care of the first son would have fallen on the wife, assisted for a brief time by her mother. When the couple arrived in Singapore in 2015 the wife did not work during her pregnancy. During this time, the husband was the sole provider and she would have been with her older child, assisted this time by a domestic helper. However, in 2020 the husband stopped work for a period of about a year which placed the economic responsibility on the wife. The husband claimed that he wanted to homeschool the children during the Covid-19 pandemic which they feared would impact the health of their second son in particular. The wife disagreed with the husband’s reason for ceasing employment and attributed it to the stress that he felt during that time. Regardless of the reason, the family lost income during this period in addition to share entitlements/benefits. The relationship came under intense pressure from 2021 and the husband chose to travel to Australia to be with his brothers. In May 2023 he was asked to leave the home making his contributions to daily care of the children rather more limited for the year prior to April 2024. In essence, approximately 4 of their 14-year marriage saw the husband either travelling for significant periods each month for work or living separately from the children (on account of being told to do so), thus limiting his caregiving. I could not ignore the fact that the wife must have shouldered the responsibility more, at least for those 4 years. As for the remaining years, clearly it can be said, as it can for almost every marriage, that contributions were made by both parents to the care of their children. The husband spoke of having shared equally in the discharge of responsibilities towards the children. The wife did not agree and suggested that he was in fact an absent father. The husband understandably rejected such a position and shared examples of his contribution. He spoke of feeding and putting his first son to sleep after night feeds, taking the children on “scooter rides”, bringing them to parties and to the doctor when his wife could not. These amongst others, were contributions that were taken into consideration. From the affidavits however, it appears that the wife was the one who largely liaised with school, tutors and doctors. The husband stepped in, without any hesitation, but usually when she could not. The husband also appears to prefer the children deciding what was good for them. An example would be drum lessons which the second son had taken. This was to assist in the management of ADHD. It was stopped when the son indicated a lack of interest.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Similarly when the child indicated that he was bored with therapy sessions with a psychologist, the husband was of the view that the child need not attend.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The wife enrolled the child for a sleep study to better address his challenges which the husband did not agree with. Additionally, and more recently, he appears to be more comfortable contributing to the needs of the children if such needs or events occurred during his time with the children. When an appointment the wife made with a Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist for the second child did not fall on his time with the children, he was of the view that the wife should then take him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> While the husband need not take the child each time he is asked to, the position he takes on when he has an obligation to do so, i.e., when he has the child with him, paints a larger picture of compartmentalising duties and how the onus to meet the needs of the children continuously resides with the mother. Insofar as his explanation on why he agreed to cancelling classes the children were not interested in, this could be viewed simply as differing parenting styles. The wife’s view that the children should take on or commit to programmes that would help them manage their ADHD in particular and her commitment to following through with them shows a parent that was willing to do more to address these issues. It would have been easier to allow the children to drop activities they found uninteresting. It may not however be in their best interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The husband spoke rather more broadly on the money he had provided to meet the children’s expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> While this is certainly important, both seem to have contributed well with the last 4 years seeing a larger contribution by the wife. The larger disparity between the parties appear to be in their respective contributions to the care and well-being of the children. I was of the view that the wife catered towards this more substantially and greater weight for her indirect contributions was accordingly given. Where both parents work, the amount of time available for their children may not differ materially but the nature of care may well be divergent. Other forms of indirect contribution such as that relating to the wife having assisted the husband to secure work at Company X or planning the logistics of the family’s move to Singapore, were not taken into account in the decision to award her a higher percentage for her indirect contributions. There was little by way of credible evidence to suggest that either did more than the other in these areas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjustments to the average ratio</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Guided by the court in <em>ANJ</em>, I looked at 3 broad categories relating to the length of marriage, the size of the assets and its constituents and the nature of the indirect contributions of the parties<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> in addition to several other relevant factors provided under s 112(2) of the Charter in making adjustments to the average ratio and arriving at an appropriate division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Apart from the relevant factors stated in preceding paragraphs, I considered the needs of the children further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The wife suspected that both boys may have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). Assessments indicate that they have the disorder. The second son’s condition appears to be one which requires more attention. The road ahead for the wife who will be caring for their day-to-day needs will require a greater and more involved presence and closer care and engagement with the school and support providers. Additionally, the children were until the time they had to move into their current rented premises, used to a lifestyle more luxurious on account of the fact that both parents were earning healthy incomes. With the loss of employment on the wife’s part, more than half of the family income is no longer available, bringing with it substantial uncertainty. It is very likely as the wife herself had acknowledged, that their continued stay in Singapore is contingent on her finding suitable work. The wife is 50 years of age and regardless of her skills, her ability to obtain employment at the salary level the family was used to, is unlikely. Providing a buffer to the wife who has the care and control of the children was felt to be needed hence an adjustment was made. Given the relatively modest net value of assets, a 3.5% adjustment was made (which translates to a real value of about $37 000).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The husband’s remuneration package – a lack of full and frank disclosure</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The wife asserted that “<em>No one at [Company X] works for the cash they are paid</em>.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>As part of his company’s compensation structure, employees at Company X, earn shares as restricted stock units (RSU). 25% of the shares could be encashed after 1 year of being granted and 75% was similarly cashable every quarter or bi-annually over 4 years after it is granted. Shares were also granted through an employee salary sacrifice scheme (ESPP) and other equity-based instruments. It was the wife’s position that the husband dissipated and concealed his share portfolio and associated cash proceeds from the sale of shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     While initially the husband appeared to be saying that rewards for personal work was not a matrimonial asset, submissions by his counsel accepted that vested shares and shares granted but unvested as at the time of the IJ should be retained in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided. With regards to the vested shares, he provided statements from an E-trade Morgan Stanley Account, the account through which shares are traded, to show its value as at April 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> and highlighted also that he had given a sum of $43 000 to his wife, which he said represented half of the amount he received from the sale of vested shares.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Dissatisfied, the wife applied for discovery. One of the orders related to the need to produce documents to state the number of shares he owns whether provided by his company or purchased between April 2022 and March 2023. The judge who heard the application also noted that apart from the shares granted as part of the remuneration package, there was a need to disclose information on the additional shares purchased through the salary sacrifice scheme for the same period. In his affidavit attempting to comply with the orders, the husband produced instead the E-Trade Morgan Stanley accounts from 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> He said<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> “<em>Although the plaintiff requested for information/documents from April 2022, the disclosure sought for by the plaintiff is too extensive and onerous upon me. Further, I fail to see how the old statements would be relevant. I have therefore disclosed the information only from April 2023 onwards (i.e. the period when I moved out) and verily believe such extent disclosure</em> (sic) <em>is sufficient for the court to adequately determine my financial resources”.</em> This was a position unilaterally taken despite the court order. This threw up many questions with respect to the period before he left the matrimonial home and how those shares were dealt with, including the nature of expenditure from the shares if sold. With respect to the ESPP, a sum of $1 947 is deducted from his salary every month for its purchase. Information was not forthcoming on the number of shares he had between April 2022 and March 2023, disabling any submission on the prudence of how the sale proceeds, if any, was applied. Even for the period March 2023 to April 2024, he failed to identify the ESPP in the statements exhibited in his compliance affidavit. In his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit for the ancillary matters,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> he claimed that the E-Trade Morgan Stanley Statements provides details of it while saying at the same time that he sold the shares as soon as he purchased them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> He made no attempt to show the number of shares he held under the ESPP and how the figures aligned with his position that he utilised the proceeds for credit card loans immediately upon sale. Parties indeed “…<em>bear a duty to approach the division process with candour, diligence and a genuine commitment to resolution</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> An inference was made that the husband failed to fully account for the number of shares he had, in particular that which he purchased through deductions from his salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Adverse inferences should only be drawn if “<em>there is a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn and that person had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> There are 2 approaches that will allow an adverse inference arising out of non-disclosure to be effected. One would be for a court to make a finding on the estimated value of undisclosed assets and include that value in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided. This however would be effective typically, if there is available evidence. It can however be utilised even in the absence of it as seen in <em>BPC</em>. The other approach would be for the court to order a higher proportion of the assets to the other party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The lack of candour with respect to the true extent of his shares between April 2022 and April 2024 and if they were sold, where that value was deposited and how it was applied required in my view an uplift of 5% to be ascribed to the wife’s share.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Looking at the facts in totality and bearing in mind the continued relevance of the broad-brush approach, the following were the ratios for direct and indirect contributions, adjustments made to the average ratio and the 5% uplift for failure on the part of the husband to disclose his share portfolio fully in compliance with orders made pursuant to the discovery application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Table 3</b>: Final Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <table

reflects a balance between the means of the party paying and the needs of those receiving. S 68 of the Charter makes it clear that the duty to maintain children is placed on both parents. S 127 of the Charter provides for an order of maintenance to be made where a couple divorces or is in the process of doing so. The provisions within Parts 8 and 9 of the Charter apply. Insofar as the maintenance of former wives are concerned, the power to make an order is found in s 113 of the Charter. S 114 goes on to spell out various factors that may be taken into consideration in the determination of what may be reasonable. An important factor would be the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseable future, the ages of parties, the standard of living enjoyed by the family prior to the breakdown of the marriage and the responsiblilies and needs each party has or is likely to have in the forseable future.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Given that the wife was no longer drawing an income from January 2025, the husband’s responsibilities became significantly larger. I was mindful that the lack of contribution by the wife at this time should not translate to the husband then providing for the same lifestyle the children were accustomed to as this would cripple him financially. I understand that with divorce and the creation of a new norm including setting up 2 households, has signficant impact on the financial situation of families. Clearly adjustments would have to be made. However, it did mean that for this time and until such time the wife finds suitable employment or if the children are compelled to relocate given that the wife’s residency in Singapore is linked to her employment here, the husband had to stretch his dollar to meet the needs of the family.

husband’s income as declared in his affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> is $19 474.67. He declared his net monthly income to be between $17 000 to $18 000 as almost S$2 000 would be deducted for the ESPP scheme<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> and contributions to his SRS. From a quick glance of the expenses of both parties, it is clear that even with the wife working, they were not able to meet expenses. With the wife not working, they need to relook their living expenses and school expenses of the children which are taking up the bulk of the available income. In <b><em>VBR</em></b> v <b><em>VBS</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> the court was of the view that a reasonable parent who is paying maintenance should live within his means and not take on unnecessary financial obligations which would reduce his ability to provide. The husband says that he had taken on accomodation at a relatively high rent of $6 000 per month to allow the children more space during access. While his wife denies having suggested this need, this is an expense that could be reduced if it is causing an inability to meet other expenses including maintenance. To be clear, I did not think that he was intentionally taking on such an expense to reduce his obligations. Insofar as school expenses are concerned which is taking up a substantial amount, it was a joint decision that the children be placed in an international school in Singapore. It would not be possible to place them in local schools at this time, even if the option were available. The reality is that they need to be kept in school until such time the wife obtains employment which will then allow her to resume her responsibility to maintain the children with their father. In <b><em>XPG</em></b> v <b><em>XPH</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> the court similarly found it to be in the best interests of the child to continue his education at an international school, having already completed 1.5 years there. The court opined that any disruption to the current school arrangement may adversely affect the child’s academic progress and emotional well-being. In the case before me, the order enabling the husband to deal directly with the school was to allow for some flexibitlity in the short-term, (i.e., pending greater certainty in the wife’s professional life), in drawing up a payment plan. This is of course subject to the school’s agreement. The payment of school fees is not realistically to come from his net salary every month and would need to be drawn from his assets, bonuses and share returns. Documents showing his past annual income is able to meet this if he manages it carefully. Given that the elder child will be sitting for the international GCSE soon, it would be vital that this period of time pass without interruption. Additionally, the school the children are at provide support for students with ADHD.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> Conversations as to the long term plans for schooling however would inevitably need to take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The order of monthly maintenance of $4 000 per child ($8 000 per month in total) was ordered on a computation of reasonable expenses as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>Table 4</b>:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"61.44%\"><col width=\"38.56%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Accomodation (2/3 of rent of $6 600)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$4 400 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">All extra activities (basketball, rock climbing etc) and payments for mobile phones etc currently paid for by the father to be subsumed within the maintenance order</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Approximately $1 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Food (including meals outside)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Approximtely $2 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Clothing/Shoes/Nutritional Supplements/haircuts/books/toiletries/medical and dental not covered by insurance</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$700</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Transportation</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$500</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total:</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$8 600</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Even if only the most basic of expenses are taken into account, the figure stands at $8 600. I did not take into account many other items which the children were used to having. I also did not include expenditure that a parent with care and control would in any case incur even if she did not have care and control.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>The maintenance amount would also need to be utilised to pay for services which the husband is currently paying for. Insofar as medical and dental expenses are concerned, insurance coverage can be activated when needed. For all medical expenses which are not so covered, the maintenance amount would need to be used to meet those. Therefore if the children are to consult a general practitioner and the cost is not covered by insurance, this is to be paid from the maintenance amount. The only exception when the maintenance amount need not be used for medical expenses (which are not covered by insurance) is in the event of hospitalisation as the charges are likely to be high.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I allowed a sum of $1 000 per month as maintenance for the ex-wife for a period of 2 years or until she secures employment, whichever is earlier, so as to provide some assistance with rent and food at this time. I am in agreement with the husband that she had always been financially independent and that they had jointly contributed resources for the maintenance of the family. She did not in the past depend on the provision of spousal maintenance which would typically be of some relevance in deciding if she should be entitled to any, post-divorce. I was of the view however that some support for a limited period against the backdrop of a rather more affluent lifestyle in the past, would be fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     With the unfortunate termination of the wife’s employment, a significant source of family income was no longer available, making it important to determine the division of matrimonial assets with the larger interests of the children in mind. This is so especially because parties do not own property and the net value of assets is relatively modest. The maintenance obligation on the husband is not a light one but it is likely to be temporary. The maintenance orders are, in my view, necessary given the need to provide stability to the children both in terms of their living arrangements and their education. The husband would need, as would the wife and children, make rather dramatic changes to lifestyle to meet their long term needs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 19 of wife’s affidavit of 20/11/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 75 of husband’s affidavit of 23/5/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Page 11 at paragraph (e) of the husband’s affidavit of 8/11/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Summons 254/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>At paragraph 20</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup><b><em>XRM</em></b> v <b><em>XXR</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33835-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 55</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Paragraph 64 of wife’s submissions dated 20/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of husband’s affidavit of 23/5/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Paragraph 65 of wife’s submissions dated 20/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Annex C of husband’s submissions dated 18/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Page 16A of NE dated 22/8/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18603-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 13</a>.

id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These are the grounds of my decision on the ancillary matters in FC/D 1867/2023, and on FC/SUM 3674/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This matter involves a plaintiff wife (“W”) and defendant husband (“H”), who have a son (“S”) who turns 5 years old this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       This claim was filed in April 2023. Interim judgment (“IJ”) was granted on an uncontested basis on both claim and counterclaim in December 2023, and the ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing was fixed for its first hearing in January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Pursuant to a consent order in October 2024, both parties have resolved the issue of division of assets and spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As for the children’s issues, W had applied in July 2023 (in FC/SUM 2184/2023) for interim joint custody, sole care and control (“C&amp;C”) with access to H, permission to move out of the matrimonial home. H in September 2023 then applied (in FC/SUM 2755/2023) to have joint custody of S, (sole) interim C&amp;C with access to W. The Court therefore ordered joint custody of S. In September 2023, the Court ordered that, pending the disposal of the applications, W would have interim C&amp;C of S from Sunday 10am to Thursday sending him to school; and H would have C&amp;C of S from Thursday after school to Sunday 10am (“the interim interim orders”). In December 2023, the Court ordered interim shared C&amp;C of S, broadly in the same terms as the interim interim orders. The orders were that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    Pending the resolution of the ancillary matters,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    [W] and [H] shall have interim joint custody of [S]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   [W] shall have interim care and control of [S] from Sunday 10am to Thursday sending him to school; and [H] shall have care and control of [S] from Thursday after school to Sunday 10am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   Neither party is to show up at [S]’s school during the other party’s interim care and control time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   During each party’s care and control time with [S], the other party may have reasonable phone/video access of up to 15 minutes a day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(v)    Parties are to have access to [S] on alternate public holidays and school-declared holidays, starting with Christmas Day 2023 which will be spent with [H].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(vi)   The order dated 7 Sept 2023 that neither party is to take any audio or video recordings or to take photographs of the other party with or without [S] is to stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Each party is to bear their own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    Liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       What remains for my decision is the issue of S’s care and control (and access), and maintenance. Fixed along with the AM hearing was H’s summons for an injunction to restrain W from changing S’s current preschool arrangement pending the resolution of the AMs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 3674/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       This application, it appears, was founded on the concern that W had made inquiries and taken some preparatory steps to withdraw S from his current preschool, which is near the matrimonial home where S resides with H from Thursday after school to Sunday, and to enrol him in another preschool, which is nearer W’s current residence. The filing of the application on 5 December 2024, was, according to counsel, motivated by the fact that W did not reply to H’s letter on Sunday, 1 December 2024 seeking confirmation by Wednesday, 4 December 2024 as to W’s intended course of action.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       At the case conference, W confirmed that S would not be transferred until the AMs were resolved. This rendered the substantive prayers in SUM 3674/2024 moot, leaving the issue of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I made no order as to the costs of this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Even if I agreed with W that the particular choice of a preschool is a decision properly of C&amp;C rather than custody (on the authority of the learned district judge in <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a>, whose decision was upheld by the High Court), this would not necessarily have entitled W to unilaterally switch S’s preschool, because C&amp;C in this case—unlike in <em>WUG v WUH</em>—was shared. It therefore stands to reason that H ought to be part of the decision to switch preschools.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     More to the point, H’s argument was that there was urgency to the application because he had discovered in the last week of November 2024 that W was intending to withdraw S from the preschool. Although the preschool teacher had scheduled a meeting with both parents on 5 November 2024, H says that he did not receive a response to his letter, and he did not wish to attend the meeting only to be informed that the change in school was confirmed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     However, I am not persuaded that there was an urgency in the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, it was already made known in W’s affidavit, filed on 7 September 2024, that W had found another childcare centre and secured a vacancy for Kindergarten 1 intake in January 2025, and intended to switch preschools in December 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> H’s supposed discovery in November 2024 that W was preparing to go ahead with the change of preschool in December 2024 therefore should not come as a surprise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, H had already made known to S’s preschool on 29 November 2024 (through the messaging function on the preschool’s mobile application) that he had joint custody and shared C&amp;C over S, and that he wished to be informed if W requested to withdraw S from the preschool. W then interjected to say that she would inform H when she makes the request, and that she “[would] confirm next week” (<em>ie</em>, the week of 2 December 2024). This alone might not have fully quelled H’s concern that the withdrawal might be crystallised by the time he was made aware of it, but the teacher in response informed H and W that the director wished to meet both parents on 5 December at 1pm. In my view, this ought to have been treated as an indication that matters were fluid rather than finalised; it would in my judgment have been unusual for the director to call a meeting if it were only to inform H of an irrevocable withdrawal from the preschool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the above reasons, I make no order on the application, and no order on costs of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">AMs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the outset of my decision on the AMs, I record my disappointment and disapproval of the parties on two matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Parties were essentially reprimanded in the District Judge’s judgment on interim C&amp;C in December 2023 for filing affidavits in excess of a hundred pages each, rehashing grievances with each other in detail. That hardly changed in the next three rounds of affidavits filed for the AMs; the text of the parties’ affidavits alone totalled over 360 pages; this was very nearly the same length as the text of the affidavits in the first three rounds of affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Additionally, even though the District Judge had tried to impress on both parties that the need to spend quality time with S ought to trump the need to outshine the other parent, both parties continued to use the language of a “primary caregiver”. From my reading of the affidavits, it appears to me that both parties played important roles in bringing S up. Neither parent has been anywhere near perfect, and neither could have done it without the other. It would be unfair to call either parent the primary caregiver to the exclusion of the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     There is no dispute that custody is to be joint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">C&amp;C</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Each parent sought sole C&amp;C of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The parents’ prayers for sole C&amp;C is understandable, considering that W takes the view that shared C&amp;C is not working out as ideally as was hoped, and that S will start formal primary school education in 2027. It has been recognised that a shared C&amp;C arrangement may not be practical once a child commences formal education (<em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [107]). Among other concerns, it would be impractical to require S to keep duplicate sets of school materials, or to require S to have to carry extra materials from one residence to the other so that he can keep up with a shared C&amp;C arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     There is, of course, no dispute that the appropriate order depends on what is in the best interest of S. The non-exhaustive factors to be considered include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my judgment, the considerations in this case were rather finely balanced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Bond with S</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In cases involving young children, the Court generally favours awarding C&amp;C to the mother. The factors in this case generally tend to reinforce rather than displace this position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     H argues that S shares a close bond with him, on the basis of several messages from W to H expressing various levels of disappointment or frustration that S was trying to look for H rather than W, or that S was uncooperative with W because S wanted to be with H. I do not make very much of these arguments, because, generally speaking, the most recent of such messages date back to 2022. This pre-dates even the divorce proceedings by nearly a year. Between the last of such messages and now, the dynamics of S’s relationships with H and W could have—and, in fact, would have, in view of the interim C&amp;C order—changed a lot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     To be clear, I do not regard W as attempting to repair her relationship with S at the eleventh hour for the purpose of “winning H at the C&amp;C battle”. The fact that W has been expressing this kind of disappointment and frustration suggests to me that W exhibits cares about her relationship with S, and desires for it to improve.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Maintenance of status quo</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Presently, there is shared C&amp;C with 4 weekdays to W and essentially 1 weekday and the weekends to H.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I acknowledge the principle that preserving the status quo for stability is in the welfare of the child (<em>ALJ v ALK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0255.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 255</a>). It is true that the status quo has essentially arisen from the interim C&amp;C order (as opposed to having arisen organically). Nonetheless, I do not think that this precludes the court from considering that one desideratum of this exercise is the maintenance of status quo.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The more pressing problem is that, short of ordering shared C&amp;C—which neither party seriously disputes is not functioning well in their case—the status quo will be upset, since it would appear that the remaining options are sole C&amp;C to one of the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the circumstances, the eventual arrangement which in my judgment best preserves (or at least approximates) the status quo, on the premise that sole C&amp;C is given to one parent, would be to allow W to have C&amp;C with reasonable access to H (as opposed to leaving C&amp;C with H with reasonable access to W).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, in my judgment, W is the parent exercising more rigour and discipline over routine (I elaborate more on this later). This discipline and routine will in my view be increasingly important as S prepares to enter formal education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, W is the parent who has had the clear bulk of the weekdays with S in this interim period. Undoubtedly, she would have had a larger hand in shaping S’s daily routines where the routine matters most, and she would also have the experience in managing S’s routine. It would seem to me less disruptive to S (and therefore be in S’s best interests) to allow W to have C&amp;C of S and manage S’s weekday routines, than to allow H to have C&amp;C of S. Considering that the relationship between W and H is especially acrimonious, and W and H have clearly different parenting styles, awarding C&amp;C to S would mean a reversal of schooling routines with which S would have been accustomed. I consider that this would be distressing for S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parents’ capacity to provide for S’s needs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In general, it is apparent that both parents’ parenting styles differ significantly. W has come across as the more organised parent, and the routine-setter and the disciplinarian. W has, in her affidavit, has set out the routines which she observes or intends for S. I find these to be generally sensible. H, on the other hand, comes across as the more laissez-faire parent, and more willing to depart from routine. In my view, as time wears on, S will need to observe an increasingly rigorous and structured schedule, as he emerges from kindergarten and enters formal primary school education. In the circumstances, it seems to me to be in S’s best interests to have W, as the more regimental parent, to manage S’s day-to-day care on the weekdays generally, and H to enjoy time with H on the weekends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Even if I give allowance for the fact that W, having interim C&amp;C for the most part of the weekdays, would be in a better position than H to describe S’s routine, I do not think that entirely accounts for the fact that H’s proposals for access (flowing from his submission that he receive sole C&amp;C) are, as W submits, less feasible in comparison. H had proposed that he have C&amp;C of S from Tuesday after school to Sunday 11am, while W has access from Sunday 11am to Tuesday sending him to school. This appears to give H the benefit of more time with S, but it retains the difficulties that shared C&amp;C entails, in terms of handing-over during school days. In my judgment, this arrangement is not in the interest of W insofar as preserving the bond between W and S is concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In terms of meals, I also note that W is in a better position to make home-cooked meals for S. H, despite working from home, relies on meal delivery services. In my view, this factor favours W slightly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In terms of the time and attention that each parent has for S, the considerations are finely balanced. It appears to me that W has a more demanding daily schedule and may come home from work later on some days. H is able to work from home, but the benefits that he gains from that are somewhat negated by the fact that he has to travel overseas on occasion for work and will have to enlist the help of extended family. H’s work arrangement may be coordinated well with a shared C&amp;C arrangement, but it will come under strain if H has sole C&amp;C. Although there is nothing wrong <em>per se</em> with enlisting the help of family members for child-minding, the parent’s personal involvement would be slightly more beneficial to the child insofar as supervising homework is concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Acrimony and gatekeeping</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     H makes several arguments that W is the less appropriate C&amp;C parent, because of various instances of gatekeeping, inflammatory, and litigation-oriented conduct. These allegations include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     W seeking to unilaterally withdraw S from his current preschool and enrol him in another;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     W being uncooperative during video-call access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     W expressing her animosity towards H by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Calling H a monster in front of S;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Rebuffing H with harsh messages;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     W ceasing her attendance at counselling; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_e\"></a>(e)     W subjecting S to photo-taking for the purpose of amassing photographic evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     On the whole, I was not entirely impressed by H’s factual allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     It is true that W’s conduct has not been exemplary. For example, there was no need for W to insist that H is a monster, or to say that the matrimonial home is a scary place. There was no need to castigate H for season’s greetings or pleasantries, as W has done on some occasions. However, these appear to be better characterised as occasional outbursts at H, rather than a ceaseless campaign of vilifying H. It is somewhat ironic that H has now capitalised on these to argue that W is the source of the acrimony, when H’s detailed, almost blow-by-blow account of W’s conduct—which I found to be characterised in a critical manner—would itself have contributed to the acrimony. If H’s affidavit and submissions are any guide, H is relatively likely to influence S’s views of W, just as W is likely to influence S’s views of H.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     H has also argued that W has subjected S to a barrage of photo-taking. For example, H says that, when S had a runny nose, W would take a photo of S with his mucus running down to his chin, rather than wipe him up. However, these photographs were contemporaneously sent to H to keep him apprised of S’s condition, rather than preserved as evidence to be presented in Court for the first time. Again, it seems somewhat ironic that these photographs surfaced in H’s affidavit (to argue that W was gathering evidence) rather than W’s affidavit (to argue that H did not take sufficient care of S’s health).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I am also not prepared to say that the steps taken by W to withdraw S from his current preschool is a clear instance of gatekeeping conduct. W has offered a perfectly reasonable and plausible explanation for wanting to change S’s preschool. It is true that W has passed comments that gives the impression that she does not quite welcome H’s involvement in the decision on whether to change S’s preschool, but it is also true that W has held her hands pending the outcome of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As for video-call access, I am not overly troubled if video-call access has not been progressing smoothly, as I am satisfied that the final orders for physical access will suffice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     On the whole, I do not consider that there is any gatekeeping, inflammatory, and litigation-oriented conduct of sufficient severity that leads me to think that W will interfere with H’s access to S, or materially compromise H’s relationship with S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Personal idiosyncrasies</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn to consider the personal idiosyncrasies of H and W, which I consider favour W slightly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     It appears to me that W is less inhibited in her outbursts and use of intemperate language or behaviour around S. However, this appears to be improving. Although H has listed a number of examples in which W was intemperate, they appear to be decreasing slightly in frequency as time goes on, and more importantly, they appear to be increasingly directed at H (<em>ie</em>, away from S). Although H pointed out that W defaulted on court-ordered counselling sessions, W clarified that while she stopped attending the <em>joint</em> counselling sessions as she found it unproductive, she continued with <em>personal</em> counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     A factor that weighs slightly in favour of sole C&amp;C to W is that H has, over the course of divorce proceedings, picked up smoking. This is, in contrast to W’s conduct, a downward trajectory in my view. H’s counsel has said that H smokes only when the child is not around, and he was sure that H would be willing to give an undertaking that H will not smoke going forward. However, on the record, all that H has said—and he has had the opportunity to do so—was that he would not “expose [S] to such smoke”. Unless H kicks the habit completely, S will still be exposed to second-hand smoke, which is deleterious to S’s health. In my view, this slightly tilts the balance in favour of awarding C&amp;C to W.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Taking the above considerations into account—in particular each parent’s capacity and ability to provide for S’s needs and to observe routines with S, I consider that S would be slightly better off under circumstances where C&amp;C is awarded to W. Accordingly, I consider it in the best interests of S for W to have C&amp;C of him, and order accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It follows from the above that H is to have reasonable access to S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     H sought highly detailed access orders. I am generally not in favour of making detailed access orders, but in this case I will go into some detail, considering that the acrimony between parties is such that a broadly-worded order is far too likely to result in further disagreements between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     That said, I was not inclined to make orders along the lines of what H sought. H, for example, sought to divide each long school holiday exactly into half, and to divide Chinese New Year (“CNY”) into a series of trade-offs where each parent would take turns to have access to S for the entire of the first day of CNY in one year, and in the other for the eve of CNY and the second day of CNY. In my view, this is undesirable considering that S will have to undergo up to four handovers in three days, and it appears to stem from H’s deep-seated aim to split access right down the middle—again, something which the learned DJ tried to persuade parties against desiring in her judgment on the interim orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Location of the handover</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Parties also disagreed as to the location of the handover. H wished for the handover to be at the lobby of his residence, while W wished for the handover to be at a “neutral” public place. However, I do not consider Paya Lebar MRT station to be as neutral as W makes it out to be, considering that it is far nearer to W’s residence than it is to H’s residence. In the circumstances, I consider it fairer for each parent to be picking S up from the other parent’s residence (or from school, if S is schooling).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Terms of access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In my view, if school holidays or public holidays fall within a long school holiday period (<em>e.g.</em>, Christmas falling within the December holiday period), it would not make very much sense to exchange access for a single day. This, it seems to me, is disruptive to S’s schedule. The exception is Chinese New Year, being the culturally significant holiday that parties wished to have a specific provision for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Parties had also sought a clarification on the judgment of the learned DJ who gave the interim orders in relation to holidays longer than a day. In my view, the DJ’s premises and conclusions were clear, and there was in my view no ambiguity that required a clarification with the DJ who issued the order. As the DJ said, longer holidays need not be split exactly down the middle, because it is impractical, because moving between homes every day is disruptive, and because it simply furthers the parties’ calculative behaviour. For these reasons, with which I agree, where there are consecutive days which are either gazetted a public holiday or declared a school holiday, I will treat them as a single holiday. I expect that, in the long run, any inequality in the amount of holiday time that S will get to spend with each parent will even out</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Barring any agreement which the parties might reach, I will order that access be on the following terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     H is to have access to S every Friday (after school, or if S is not attending school on Friday, at 10.30am), to Sunday 10.30am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Long school holidays</b>. For school holidays which are at least 1 week in duration, parties shall have access to S on alternate weeks. Parties shall take turns to have access to S on the first week of long school holidays, beginning with W.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       If H has access on the first week of a long school holiday, H is to have access to S from the Friday preceding the long school holiday, to the following Sunday 10.30am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       If H has access on any other week, H is to have access to S from Sunday 10.30am, to the following Sunday 10.30am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       During each party’s care/access period, the parent may bring S overseas for holiday, on the condition that he/she informs the other parent at least 14 days in advance of the intended itinerary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>School holidays/public holidays outside the long school holiday period</b>. Parties are to have access to S on alternate holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       For this purpose, where school holidays and/or public holidays fall on consecutive days, they will be considered a single holiday. Chinese New Year (including the eve thereof) is <b>not</b> considered a holiday (or a part thereof) for the purpose of this order. Handovers are to take place at Paya Lebar MRT station.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       If H has access on a holiday which begins on a weekday, then parties are to hand S over at 10.30am that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       If H has holiday access which ends on a Sunday to Wednesday, parties are to hand S over at 8.30pm that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       If H has holiday access which ends on a Thursday, then, despite my orders above, H is to have access for Thursday evening to Friday as well (<em>i.e.</em>, H is to drop S off at school on Friday morning, and pick S up after school for weekend access).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_v\"></a>(v)       If S has access on a holiday which begins on a Saturday or Sunday, then parties are to hand S over at 10.30am that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       If S has holiday access which ends on a Friday or Saturday, parties are to hand S over at 8.30pm that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c-p3_vii\"></a>(vii)       If W has holiday access which ends on a Sunday, then, despite my orders above, W is to have access for Sunday evening as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>Chinese New Year</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Time during the Chinese New Year holidays shall be split into two periods: the <b>first</b> beginning from after school on Chinese New Year eve (or 10.30am that day, if it is not a school day) to 4.30pm of the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year; and the <b>second</b> beginning immediately thereafter, to 8.30pm of the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of Chinese New Year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       W shall have access to S for the first period in odd-numbered years, and the second period in even-numbered years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       H shall have access to S for the first period in even-numbered years, and the second period in odd-numbered years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The parent exercising right of access is to pick S up from school (if S is schooling), or from the main entrance of the residence of the parent ceding access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Considering that video call access has been an additional source of acrimony for parties with limited benefit for S in terms of building and maintaining his relationship with the parent who is not having physical access, I will not make specific orders for video call access. However, it remains part of each parent’s duty to facilitate and not to disrupt S’s communications with the other parent, should S wish to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     W, on the basis that she has C&amp;C of S, sought reasonable maintenance of S to be paid by D, until S either turns 21 years of age or obtains his first university degree, whichever is later.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Proportion of contribution</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     W, in her submissions, estimates S’s monthly expenses at $2,383.50. W says that, on the basis that the monthly salaries of W and H are about $15,000.00 and $13,000.00 per month, respectively, H should be responsible for 46.4% of S’s monthly expenses, which would be $1,105.94 per month. H disputes his means, and claims that his annual income, for the purpose of Year of Assessment 2024, is $126,306, and that therefore he should contribute only 35% to the maintenance of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Although H’s notice of assessment is not in evidence, I accept that his income for calendar year 2023 is approximately $126,306, on the basis of the year-to-date salary figure on his December 2023 payslip.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> As for W’s income, given that her employment commenced in February 2024, it is understandable that she did not submit a notice of assessment. Her employment contract indicated that, apart from 15 months’ guaranteed salary plus bonus (at $12,000 per month), she would be entitled to 5% of the treatment value of medical fees which she charges, and 10% of the product value of herbal medicines prescribed, plus bonuses at the discretion of the company. In all likelihood, this would put her income slightly in excess of the round figure of $180,000 that she submitted in Court. Had W’s salary been a flat sum of $180,000, then H ought to contribute about 41.2% towards the maintenance of S, assuming that each party contributes in proportion to his or her income relative to their aggregate income. Given that W’s salary is likely to be higher, but approaching this conservatively, I would notionally order that H contribute a round proportion of 40% towards the maintenance of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Line items</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Essentially, both parties accept a budget of $100.00 per month on clothes, and $1,008.00 per month on preschool fees. I turn to the individual line items which were disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In terms of eating out, H takes issue with W’s estimate of $200.00 per month on the basis that W, by her own claim, makes home-cooked food for S at least 3 of the 4 nights that he is with her, and that they will go to her parents’ place twice a week for dinner. H says that a figure of $100.00 is fair. On the other hand, as W points out, H has budgeted $1,000.00 per month on his own eating out (although this includes buying food for parents). In this light, $100.00 appears to me to be unnecessarily restrictive. Considering the frequency with which W plans to eat at home, and her planned expenditure on groceries, I will allocate a budget of $150.00 for eating out, being the midpoint of W’s and H’s estimates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In terms of transport costs, I agree with W’s estimate of $200.00 per month, considering that W sends S to preschool by private hire 16 times per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In terms of medical costs, I will accept H’s estimate of $100.00 per month. Although W submitted that medical and dental costs for children are slightly higher when they fall sick, there appears to be nothing in the record that supports this proposition. In fact, it might be thought that children’s medical and dental fees are lower considering that they are more heavily subsidised. In this light, W’s estimate of $300.00 per month—or $3,600.00 per year—is in my judgment excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In terms of toys, I accept H’s estimate of $50.00 per month. In my view, the point is not so much whether H or W is characterised as the “fun parent”. $50.00 a month means $600.00 a year, and in my judgment, that is an adequate amount to be spending on toys. Likewise, I would consider W’s estimate of $200.00 per month—or $2,400.00 per year— to be excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In terms of diapers and milk powder, I accept H’s estimate of $40.00 per month. As H points out, P’s own evidence is that S is essentially toilet-trained, and generally is not allowed diapers anymore. Going forward, S is starting Kindergarten 2 in a few months, and his expenses in this regard will decrease in the coming months. I leave the $40.00 there as S will incur more of other costs (<em>eg</em>, the expenses for S’s food will increase as he grows).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In terms of household expenses, H disputed W’s claim of $275.50 as S’s share of household expenses, and was prepared to concede only $100.00 per month. The household expenses, in this regard, would include groceries, utilities and phone charges. In my view, $275.50 is not an unreasonable sum to represent S’s share of household expenses in a two-person household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Based on the above, the total expenses for S would be $1,923.50 per month. At 40%, it would be $769.40. In the circumstances, I order that H pay W a monthly maintenance of a round sum of $770.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     To avoid doubt, this sum takes into account S’s preschool fees at $1,008.00. In the event that S changes preschools, or when S enrols into primary school, maintenance may be varied accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Duration of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I decline to order maintenance to be paid until S obtains his first university degree. S is currently five years old, and it is speculative whether he can or will eventually enter university. In the event that he does, nothing I say forecloses the possibility of bringing a further application either to very child maintenance or for fresh maintenance in favour of S.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In summary, my orders are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><u>SUM 3674/2024</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    No order on the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    No order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><u>D 1867/2023</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Care and control</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    The plaintiff is to have care and control of the child of the marriage (“S”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Access</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    The defendant is to have access to S every Friday (after school, or if S is not attending school on Friday, at 10.30am), to Sunday 10.30am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Long school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    For school holidays which are at least 1 week in duration, parties shall have access to S on alternate weeks.

In SSP 623/2025, she applied for a Personal Protection Order (PPO) against the Father for herself and the older child of the marriage (&quot;C&quot;), along with a Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO) limited to the master bedroom and C's bedroom. In SSP 722/2025, she applied for additional orders, specifically a stay away order of five metres around the matrimonial home, no contact orders for herself and C, and counselling orders for the Father. The Mother was represented by counsel while the Father appeared in person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       After hearing both parties, I dismissed the Mother’s PPO applications for both C and the Mother. Dissatisfied, the Mother appealed against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The family</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The family comprised of the Father, Mother, and two children, with a live-in domestic helper (V). At the time of the incidents, C was 14 years old and the second child was 11. There were no applications for the second child and the Father. Concurrently, the parties were undergoing divorce proceedings. At the time of the PPO trial, Interim Judgment had been granted on an uncontested basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Claims </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence against herself and C through a sustained pattern of emotional and psychological abuse. No physical violence was alleged. The Father vehemently denied these allegations and maintained that no family violence had occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       A list of the parties’ affidavits and evidence is found in <u>Annex A</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The issues </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The central issue is the interpretation of &quot;emotional and psychological abuse&quot; within Part 7 of the Women’s Charter (the “Charter”) which sets out the law on protection against family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 58B(1) of the Charter defines &quot;family violence&quot; to include &quot;emotional or psychological abuse&quot;. Section 58B(4) defines &quot;emotional or psychological abuse&quot; as &quot;conduct or behaviour that torments, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person; or causes or may reasonably be expected to cause mental harm to a person.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Despite this statutory definition, determining what constitutes &quot;emotional or psychological abuse&quot; remains subjective and open to various interpretation. Given the broad definition, an overly liberal interpretation of Section 58B(4) may lead to outcomes inconsistent with the legislative intent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The illustrations in Section 58B and parliamentary readings provide crucial insights into the conduct the law seeks to address. During the Second Reading of the Bill<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, the Minister of State highlighted examples of emotional or psychological abuse which included</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     a perpetrator threatening to withhold monthly allowances,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     a perpetrator constantly monitoring the victim's whereabouts,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     a perpetrator isolating the victim from friends and family,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     a perpetrator preventing the victim from leaving the house, and threatening the victim with negative consequences to compel the victim’s compliance,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     a perpetrator threatening to evict the victim without financial or physical resources and refusing to renew the victim’s long-term visit pass,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     a perpetrator creating fear in the victim of eviction and separation from children, which prevents victims from seeking protection<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The common thread in these examples and illustrations is the perpetrator's controlling behaviour over the victim through fear (whether for personal safety or likely consequences), resulting in mental or emotional harm to the victim. Such behaviour is referred to as &quot;coercive control&quot; in the Second Reading.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Therefore, despite the expansive definition in Section 58B, not every action causing distress will constitute emotional abuse. Significantly, the statute uses &quot;emotional abuse&quot; rather than &quot;emotional distress&quot;, suggesting the victim must suffer some level of emotional harm beyond mere unhappiness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Ultimately, the purpose of a PPO is to protect victims from harmful behaviour by establishing clear boundaries of conduct that a reasonable person would consider unacceptable. A PPO is not intended to punish the aggressor or pass judgment on their social interactions or parenting style. A finding of family violence has serious ramifications for the relationship between the aggressor and the victim and could accelerate the breakdown of familial ties. While the Court will not hesitate to grant PPOs in deserving cases, we should be cautious about granting applications where the facts fall short of demonstrating emotional or psychological harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Returning to the facts of this case, the issues to be determined were: (a) whether the alleged acts, if committed, constituted emotional or psychological abuse against the Mother or C; and (b) assuming the answer to (a) was in the affirmative, whether a protection order was necessary for their protection or safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Family violence committed against C</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Mother contended that the Father engaged in a sustained pattern of emotional and psychological abuse towards C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother relied on four key incidents on 29 January 2025, 6 February 2025, 24 March 2025, and 15 April 2025 and 3 relatively minor incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. C was not called as a witness. The Mother was also not an eyewitness to these incidents and relied solely on CCTV footage. Given the inherent limitations of CCTV evidence, there was limited video evidence for most incidents, with examination heavily dependent on audio recordings, which were themselves incomplete.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Before turning to the evidence, I addressed the Mother’s argument that the Father had breached the Browne v Dunn<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> rule in that he did not cross examine the Mother on C’s emotional state during the incidents. As a result, it was the Mother’s position that the Father did not challenge the fact that C was distressed by the Father’s actions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The rule of Browne v Dunn was explained in the case of Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> in this manner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“… where a submission was going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness, which was of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it had not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I found that the Father had not breached the Browne v Dunn rule in relation to the incidents involving C. C was not called as a witness and was not cross-examined. Therefore, the Father could not have put his case to C regarding her emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I would now deal with the evidence in the key incidents. The timestamps for the key incidents were included in the analysis below for easy reference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">29/1/25 incident “Pink lead” incident<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother alleged that the Father was violent in the following manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Told C to “stop being violent” [Timestamp: 14:18:23], which suggested that the Father would take the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s side against C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Told C that he could wield his power presumably to hit. [14:21:40]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Insinuated that the 2<sup>nd</sup> child could hit C and he (the Father) would such behaviour. [14:22:12]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Challenged C to hit him (the Father). [14:22:12]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Wrongly accused C of “threatening violence to [the Father]”. [14:29:51]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Refused to respect C’s requests to stop talking to her. [14:29:50, 14:30:00, 02]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Told C to “shut up” multiple times. [14:30:32]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Told C to “learn [her] limits and [stay] in [her] limits”. [14:30:32]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Reminded C that “[she] is still in [the Father’s] house”. [14:30:43]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The M claimed that these actions distressed C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father disagreed that he was aggressive and pointed out that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident happened in the context of an argument between C and 2<sup>nd</sup> child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     His statements in 14:21:40 and 14:22:12 were misconstrued. At the material time, C had pulled the 2<sup>nd</sup> child. He (the Father) was trying to keep the children apart and told the 2<sup>nd</sup> child to move back. He had said that hitting was not allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     C herself was verbally abusive by using inappropriate words. [14:18:57]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother did not provide the complete video footage of the incident, particularly: (i) the video was muted and there was a gap in the footage between 14:22:12 – 14:25:8 (ii) the Mother had other footages which would show what happened immediately before the Father stepped into the fray.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     At the onset, it was necessary to highlight that the evidence for this incident contained only audio recordings without video footages. The Mother did not seem to dispute that the incident occurred during an argument between the children and that the Father intervened to de-escalate the dispute. However, the Mother took issue with the Father telling C to “stop being violent”. On the stand, when asked to explain why she found the Father’s actions aggressive, she said “he goes into the room and blames [C] … did not give her time to explain … he takes the side of the 2<sup>nd</sup> child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It was clear from the exchange immediately after the Father’s statement “[C] first of all stop being violent” that the Father had entered when the argument between the children was already heated. The 2<sup>nd</sup> child suggested that C had thrown a book earlier [14:18:23]. The Father also asked C if she had pulled the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s hair earlier [14:18:53] which C did not seem to deny. It was reasonable to assume that the Father had overheard the argument before he intervened which explained his initial statement to C to “stop being violent” [14:18:23].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother claimed that the Father had made a veiled threat that he would allow the 2<sup>nd</sup> child to hit C. She was of the view that the threat was implied when the Father said [at 14:21:40] “try that, try that, where are you learning this from, you know the last person who tried hitting me, after 7 times of forgiving them, I gave one and that calmed down the whole family. The whole family that had started to be violent with me. I gave just one. .. Power is not hitting, power is in the other person knowing that you can. The whole family had to touch my feet.” This was followed by [at 14:22:12] “… no [2<sup>nd</sup> child] can hit you. [2<sup>nd</sup> child’] doesn’t because he knows the moment he raised his hand I will be the first one …”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I was of the view that the Mother had not proven on a balance of probability that the Father had threatened C indirectly. The statement in 14:21:40 was ambiguous and context-dependent. From the evidence, there was a gap of 2 minutes in the evidence prior to the Father making that statement. When the Father asked the Mother to provide the full evidence, the Mother did not explain why the complete evidence could not be provided. Without knowing what happened immediately prior to the Father’s statement, it was not possible to ascribe the meaning suggested by the Mother. As for the Father’s later statement in [14:22:12], I preferred the Father's interpretation, which was objectively consistent with his earlier statements. The Father had explained during cross-examination that he was, at the material time, trying to keep the children apart and had told the 2<sup>nd</sup> child to move away. He had intended to say &quot;although the second child can hit C, he doesn't because he knows the moment he raises his hand, I will be the first to stop him.&quot; Given the context, the meaning ascribed by the Father was not reasonable. The Mother had not proven on a balance of probability that the Father intended to threaten C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father’s other remarks, such as telling C to “shut up”, showed the Father’s increasing frustration. His lack of parental insight was also evident in his disregard of C’s expressed wishes to be left alone. However, none of statements even if considered collectively amounted to family violence. Throughout the exchange, C did not display signs of emotional or mental distress. For the most part, C put up a spirited defence. At times, she was even defiant and sarcastic in her retorts, eg when she suggested that “[2<sup>nd</sup> child] is so great.” While C was clearly unhappy and believed that the Father was biased, her reaction as a whole did not suggest that she was in anyway frightened or intimidated by the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">6/2/25 incident “Bedroom light” incident<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></u></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother made the following allegations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father called the C “vicious” and “shameless”. [22:51:40, 22:53:18]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father insinuated that C had picked up her vicious behaviour from the Mother. [22:51:48]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father attempted to exert control by claiming that it was his house. [22:51:17]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father eavesdropped on C’s subsequent phone conversation with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In response, the Father’s position was as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident happened while he was trying to resolve the children’s argument and had lost his temper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He did not call C vicious. Instead it was a general observation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Similar to the 29/1/25 incident, both parties agreed that the 6/2/25 incident involved the Father intervening in the children’s argument. On the stand, the Mother explained that the Father “gets entrenched in the children’s argument and the argument starts escalating”, “positions himself on the side of [the second child]”. The Mother went on to say “It is clear from the narrative that [the Father] is on the [second child’s] team.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father’s conduct must be understood in the broader context of the ongoing argument between the children which concerned sleeping arrangements. C wanted to continue her activities in the room while the second child wanted to sleep in the same room. Neither child was prepared to give in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In relation to the Father’s use of the word “vicious”, the Father’s position was that he did not call C vicious but meant the statement to be a general observation. The Mother maintained on the stand that C understood the Father to be calling her vicious.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The exact statement with the exchange immediately prior to

In fact, when challenged by C, the Father also clarified [at 22:51:48] “No it is about manners”. I agreed that the Father’s statement was about his expectations of how children should behave and was intended to establish equal standards for both children's conduct, prohibiting hitting and vicious behaviour generally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I found that the Father had intended to refer to C when he said [at 22:51:18] &quot;you are becoming shameless&quot;. He had also used the fact that he owned the house [at 22:51:17] to imply that C should not continue to be difficult. However, the mention of “It is my room. This is my house. This is my house” in the context of a parent-child argument would not satisfy the concept of “coercive control”. Coercive control required both the aggressor's intention to wield control and the victim's lack of viable alternatives. Here, C retained options such as returning to her own room or using another available room in the house. Additionally, throughout the incident, C did not display any hint of emotional or mental dysregulation. At no point during the incident did she back down or withdraw. While it could not be denied that C was upset by the entire exchange, her conduct did not suggest that she had suffered emotional harm. Therefore, I found that the Father’s conduct did not cross the threshold into “emotional or mental abuse”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">24/3/25: Calling 911 incident<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and 15/4/25 incident: Letter to school counsellor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence against C by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Telling C to get out. [22:40;35]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Telling C that she had always been one of those children and that C had become a problem in life.

[22:58:53]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     As a result, C believed that she will be evicted from the house and be sent to an asylum. The Mother claimed that the 24/3/25 incident reflected a continuing and escalating pattern of the Father singling C out by threatening and intimidating C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the Father’s letter to school on 15/4/25, the Mother claimed that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     F’s counselling request was meant as punitive</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     F’s letter portrayed himself a victim of C’s behaviour</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As a result of the Father’s actions, C feels distressed and suffered from emotional harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father’s position on the stand and from cross-examining the Mother was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father was trying to contain the situation and manage the children during their argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father denied that he was referring to C when he said “lost the mental plot”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father had not intended to say 911 (ie. call the police) but rather to refer C to counselling. He had also corrected himself within a reasonable time after he misspoke. [23:00:28]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father believed that C required counselling to address her behaviour and denied that he had used counselling as a threat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Similar to the incidents of 29/1/25 and 6/2/25, the 24/3/25 incident began with the Father attempting to contain the conflict between the children. Father's choice of words regarding C, such as &quot;you have always been one of those children&quot; and &quot;that's why you have become a problem in life,&quot; “convict blood” was thoughtless even if he had made those comments in the context of an escalating argument. I had also found that the Father had intended to refer to C when he said &quot;somebody has lost their mental plot.&quot; Nonetheless, as with the earlier incidents, C remained spirited throughout. Her retorts were sharp in response to the Father and to the 2<sup>nd</sup> child. She openly challenged the Father when she disagreed with his remarks. She did not shy away from the argument and in fact returned to the same room despite the Father’s presence. She displayed no signs of emotional distress beyond the expected unhappiness arising from the underlying argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Regarding Father's alleged 'threat' to call 911, there was no direct evidence as to how the ‘threat’ was supposedly made. However, Mother's own transcript showed the Father clarifying his intention to refer C to counselling rather than call 911 [at 22:55:45 – 22:56:16, 23:00:28]. The Mother argued that despite Father's subsequent clarification, C had perceived the threat at the time and was distressed and fearful that Father might evict her from the house. In other words, the damage was already done. However, C's subsequent actions contradicted Mother's position. If C genuinely feared Father would act on his threat, it was unlikely that she would have openly challenged him about his “threat”. Indeed, C herself mentioned Father's 'threat' in response to his claim that he would always love her. C's behaviour was inconsistent with that of a child who was fearful or distraught. In any event, I agreed that the Father had corrected C's misunderstanding within a reasonable timeframe, which should have assuaged any fears of forceful removal from the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Concerning Father's letter to C's school, nothing in the correspondence suggested that the Father intended counselling as a punitive measure against C. Mother argued that Father included irrelevant information (such as financial provision) to support his own narrative. Even if true, I failed to see how this could be construed as a threat against C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other minor incidents </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Mother also relied on other incidents to support her case that Father has displayed a pattern of abusive behaviour towards C. The complained actions included (a) the Father ignoring C (7 April), and (b) the Father favouring the second child over C by purchasing food only for the second child (13 April). Separately, these incidents were unremarkable. There was no evidence to show that such incidents were common occurrences. Even if the minor incidents were considered alongside with the key incidents above, I was not persuaded by the Mother’s submission that the Father’s actions displayed a targeted and sustained agenda to exclude, discriminate or demean C which caused C emotional distress. All key incidents happened in the context of sibling disagreements and the Father’s attempts to de-escalate the situation. None of the interactions which the Mother complained of were initiated by the Father. The Father’s parenting methods and his choice of words were lacking but those factors themselves would not satisfy the criteria of family violence even under the expanded definition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Mother also relied on the 7 April 2025 incident involving the Father’s installation of his CCTVs. The Father had installed his CCTVs in the living room and kitchen of the matrimonial home. In response, C wrote the Father a message indicating that she disagreed with the CCTV installation and covered the CCTV with the same message. The Mother claimed that the Father's refusal to remove the CCTV despite C's request caused C distress. The Father explained that he had installed his CCTV after he received the Mother’s first PPO application to protect himself from further accusations. He had also explained his reasons to C via a Whatsapp message which he exhibited. He also claimed that the Mother herself had her CCTVs in the common areas as well. The Mother did not dispute that the Father installed the CCTV after the first PPO application. However, she took the position that C had agreed to the Mother’s CCTVs but not the Father’s. I had a hard time understanding C’s objection to the Father’s CCTV, which was placed in the same area as the Mother’s CCTV. If C’s objection was due to privacy considerations, C would object to both the Mother’s and the Father’s CCTV, not just the Father’s. The Mother could not explain why C consented to her CCTV but not the Father’s. As mentioned earlier, C was not called as a witness and her evidence could not be tested. Even if C had legitimate reasons not to consent to the Father’s CCTV, the Father’s disregard of C’s wishes, did not, in itself, amount to family violence even if C was upset by Father's decision. The Mother also did not submit evidence of the emotional harm which C suffered as a result of the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In conclusion, I found that Mother's claims of family violence against C were not satisfied. The various incidents, whether considered separately or as part of a series, did not exhibit a pattern of behaviour causing emotional abuse to C. Accordingly, the PPO application in relation to C was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Family violence committed against the Mother </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Mother claimed that the Father had committed family violence against her by:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     sharing private information about the Mother in the Father’s phone conversation with his brother (incident of 28/3/25)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     threatening to disallow the Mother from using the bed, electricity and gas which the Father paid for (incidents on 29/3/25 and 31/3/25)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother’s position was that she was distressed and suffered emotional and mental harm as a result of the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Mother made similar submissions on the Browne v Dunne rule regarding the Mother’s emotional state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I had briefly explained the effect of the Browne v Dunn rule above. After consideration, I took the view that the Father was not in breach of the rule. The Father’s defence was that he did not commit the alleged acts which the Mother claimed had caused her emotional harm. Therefore, the Mother was not taken by surprise by the Father’s position in his closing submissions even if the Father failed to put his case to the Mother. In the case of Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>, the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck cautioned against applying the rule in a rigid manner given that parties were required to exchange their affidavits of evidence-in-chief prior to trial, thereby ameliorating the mischief which the rule had originally sought to address. Nonetheless, Justice Choo accepted that the rule would still apply, albeit in limited situations, where the point in question was an undisclosed fact which was critical to that party’s case. Justice Choo in the case of Chan Emily declined to apply the Browne v Dunn rule and instead preferred to consider the submissions in totality instead of disregarding part of the submissions which a party had failed to put to the other party. The principles in Chan Emily were endorsed in the subsequent case of Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd in which the Honourable Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon (as he then was) agreed that the court must consider the totality of the evidence and determine if the point which was not “put” to the other party was “at the heart of the matter”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. I found this common-sense approach particularly important in family proceedings, which often encompassed a wide spectrum of evidence across various incidents over extended periods. Additionally, it was unclear if the rule applied to self-represented parties in the same way as legal practitioners given that unrepresented parties may be unaware of its effect. As far as I was aware, there was no case law on this issue. Even if the rule applied equally to the Father, it would be unjust to consider the alleged deficiencies in his cross-examination against him given that the Father’s submissions did not seek to rely on crucial facts which were undisclosed whether through the parties’ affidavits or on the stand. Accordingly, I rejected the Mother's submission in paragraph 20.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident of 28/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></u>: The “Phone call” incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Mother alleged that the Father had committed family violence when he made “deeply distressing and hurtful remarks” about the Mother in his phone conversation with his brother. It was the Mother’s case that the conversation could be overheard by her, the children and V (the domestic helper).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In relation to the contents of the conversation, the Mother made two points. First, the Father was referring to the Mother when he spoke about an individual who was promiscuous. Second, that Father was referring to the Mother's father when he spoke about a family member who had to be bailed out of jail. Mother tendered evidence of Father's conversation from her own CCTVs, which captured only the Father's part of the conversation. The Father's recorded conversation was also incomplete, with various points in the transcript showing &quot;mumbling.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Father denied that he was referring to Mother in either account. Instead, he claimed he was speaking with his brother on unrelated persons. Specifically, regarding insinuations of promiscuity, he mentioned (a) a case in which a student was maliciously accused of rape and (b) the irresponsibility of men when faced with unplanned pregnancies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     It was undisputed that the Father did not mention the Mother's name at any point during the conversation. Even if the Mother was correct in that the Father was gossiping about her, only an individual personally aware of the Mother's history would suspect that Father was referring to her. In other words, only the Mother would have felt offended. Mother argued that her distress was heightened because the conversation could be overheard by the children. However, this would only be the case if the children themselves were aware of Mother's history. It was not the Mother’s case that the children was aware of her history. The Father further contended that the children did not understand the conversation as the majority of the discussion occurred in Hindi. I found that the Mother did not prove on a balance of probability that the children understood the conversation. On the stand, when questioned, the Mother maintained that the children “had picked up some words in Hindi” and understood enough of the language to be able to “put two and two together”. However, she could not explain the basis for her belief. Given that the majority of the conversation was in Hindi, I agreed with the Father that the children would not have understood the conversation. The children would also not suspect that the Father was referring to the Mother as they had no knowledge of the Mother’s past experience. In this regard, I did not find that the Mother's distress was aggravated by the possibility of the children overhearing the conversation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Next I considered the Mother’s first claim that the Father had referred to her when he commented on a promiscuous individual. The Mother contended that Father was referring to her indirectly when he mentioned &quot;slept with someone<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> [21:37-21:41],&quot; &quot;slept with the office manager,&quot; &quot;these people's character is such that they get pregnant right in college... isn't it? [21:37-21:41]&quot; &quot;even he borrowed money and got an abortion done for her,&quot; and the account of a man accused of &quot;trying to do something to her [21:45-21:49].&quot; A review of the transcript did not suggest that Father had referred to Mother, even by implication. Based on the transcript, the Father's various allegedly offensive references were disjointed and did not suggest a coherent account of a single individual's story. There were also no similarities between Father's account and Mother's story that would make the connection with the Mother more than speculative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father had referred to someone &quot;begged from someone else&quot; alongside &quot;slept with someone&quot; before mentioning &quot;slept with the office manager.&quot; [21:37 – 21:41] There was no evidence that the Mother's previous relationship was with an office manager. Immediately after, the Father referred to someone who became pregnant in college alongside purportedly the same individual &quot;borrowing money and got an abortion done for her.&quot; [21:37 – 21:41] Again, it was not the Mother's case that her prior indiscretion involved the lack of financial means for an abortion. In fact, the context of Father's discussion suggested that he was disparaging the character of the man who got the woman pregnant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The next mention of promiscuity occurred approximately four minutes later [21:45-49] about a man falsely accused of &quot;trying to do something.&quot; The discussion pertained to the exposure of a lie and the resulting embarrassment: &quot;how can anyone go back to college after?&quot; There was no evidence that Mother suffered a similar encounter in college in which she made such accusations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Father then mentioned &quot;people who don't even know who the father of their unborn child is.&quot; [21:49-21:53] However, this was prefaced by a reference to a specific individual: &quot;remember that case from the 90s... the officer... for promotion... he was involved with her cousin... yes yes everyone used to say how beautiful she was... No... the Chandigarh case...&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     From the above, I was not convinced that Father was referring to Mother's sexual history in his conversation with his brother. Accordingly, it was not necessary to determine whether Mother had suffered emotional harm as a result.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I next considered if the Father had referred to Mother’s father’s misdeed with the law (second point in the Mother’s claim).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother claimed that the Father had insulted the Mother’s brother and father by referring to the past incident in which the Father had to bail the Mother’s father out of jail. According to the Mother, this was implied in the Father’s recount<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> “She didn’t have anything and came here … what happened was .. the father called … I had to go and get him out … the brother has no guts … what kind of people don’t go to get their father released from jail?” [21:37-21:41] . The Father went on to say “later it came out – the father had a mistress, he took it for her. … he steals lipstick and still acts like wealthy …. [21:41-21:45]”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Father’s position was that he was referring to 2 separate incidents, involving completely different individuals. He also pointed out that unlike the individual in his conversation who father was imprisoned, his father-in-law was not imprisoned. He further stated that he was unaware of the details of his father-in-law’s case other than he had dementia. However, he conceded that that he was referring to the Mother when he spoke about an individual who tried to lecture him [the Father] on morality and on whom he had spent money for the last 15 years [21:41-21:45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Unlike the Father’s comments on the “promiscuous individual”, I accepted that the Father was referring to the Mother’s father in this part of his conversation. The conversation had a logical flow which suggested a single incident involving the same set of actors throughout. In the same flow, the Father also criticised the Mother for trying to lecture him (the Father) about morality, implying that the Mother had no moral standing to criticise him given the lack of morals in her own family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Additionally, there were crucial similarities in the Father’s account and the incident involving the Mother’s father. It was undisputed that the Father had to bail his father-in-law out because his brother-in-law did not do so. These same facts were also in the Father’s conversation. I was not persuaded by the subtle difference between the father-in-law being released on bail as opposed to the actor in Father’s story being “released from jail”. The transcript showed that the Father said “I had to go and get him out.” In the next sentence, the Father had likely used the “jail” loosely to mean police custody, rather than imprisonment. Therefore, I accepted the Mother’s claim that the Father had spoken to his brother about his father-in-law’s run-in with the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I next considered if the Mother had proven on a balance of probability that Father’s actions amounted to emotional abuse. I did not find that the Father’s actions amounted to family violence. The Father’s conversation took place in a private setting with only the family and the domestic helper present. It was not the Mother’s case that the Father had maligned or spread falsehoods about her family. Crucially, nothing in the conversation identified the Mother unless a listener had prior knowledge of the Mother’s personal history. This was unlike illustration (a) of section 58B of the Charter in which the perpetrator <em>spread false</em> rumours about the victim’s promiscuity, causing distress. Although the Mother was understandably upset by the Father’s gossip, there was no evidence that the Mother had suffered emotional distress beyond mere unhappiness with the Father’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Threat or insinuation that the Father could prevent use of bed, electricity and gas: 1/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></u>, 29/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></u>, 31/3/25<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></u></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Mother’s position was that the Father had intimidated the Mother by threatening to disallow the use of basic necessities in the house. According to the Mother, the threats were made on the following occasions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     01/3/25: when the Father pointed to the bed in the master bedroom and said “I think its time to change the bed that I got.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     29/3/25: The offending statements were made throughout the day:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       9am: to the 2<sup>nd</sup> child: “You like the bed? I wonder who bought it.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>9am: to V (domestic helper): “who paid for the fridge” and “who owns the fridge?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       5pm: to the 2<sup>nd</sup> child: “our $2000 carpet was sold, and she got something cheap.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       9pm: to no one in particular: “must have bought this gas, cooking on it right, has no shame.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c\"></a>(c)     31/3/25:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       “electricity because I pay for it, no.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “if people do not want me to eat then they have to stop using what I have bought in this house. You will not use that gas I bought that gas. Ok. this gas will only be used when I allow it ok?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “gas will only be used when I allow it”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Additionally, during the 9pm incident of 29/3/25, the Mother claimed that the Father followed her closely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father conceded that he made the statements but refuted that he had threatened to deprive the family of basic necessities. In his defence, he claimed that his actions were in response to the parties’ disagreement on the use of kitchen utensils, which the Father perceived as the Mother’s attempts to stop the Father from cooking in the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In my view, the Mother did not prove that the Father’s conduct amounted to emotional abuse. Although the Father’s comments were uncalled for and retaliatory in nature, these could not be perceived as threats given that the Father did not, at any point in time, take action to cut off or make attempts to stop the Mother or V (domestic helper) from using gas, the fridge, electricity, or the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     It was also not the Mother’s case that she was financially dependent on the Father and such ‘threats’ even if not carried out would carry the element of 'coercive control'. For the above reasons, I found that the Father's conduct, although disagreeable and difficult, fell short of causing emotional harm to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As part of her submissions, the Mother claimed that the above incidents along with other episodes exhibited a consistent pattern of conduct by the Father to cause her emotional distress. She cited 2 examples. The first incident involved the Father harassing her through multiple emails on 2/11/24<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, 1/3/25<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and 31/3/25<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> which reflected his controlling and gaslighting behaviour. The second incident on 8/4/25<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> involved the Father asking V for his personal items which did not exist and retaining the Mother’s personal items. Although the Mother was not present during the second incident, it was her case that V was distressed by the Father’s actions which resulted in the Mother feeling distressed. She further claimed that the Father was aware that his actions would “impact the Mother and V”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I found that the incidents, even if considered together, did not establish a pattern of conduct to harass or torment the Mother as she claimed. The emails related to family finances (31/3/25) and the Father’s instructions to V to maintain separate kitchen utensils (2/11/24 and 1/3/25), all of which were legitimate issues pertaining to the running of the household. The parties exchanged less than 10 emails in each instance. Both parties were involved in the exchange, not just the Father. The email exchanges were not prolonged and concluded within the same day. I did not find any of the exchanges to be excessive. Accordingly, I disagreed with the Mother that the Father’s actions amounted to harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As for the second incident, the Mother was herself not present during the incident and relied solely on the CCTV recording. Although she claimed that she suffered distress from V’s messages regarding the Father’s conduct, there was no evidence of the Whatsapp messages. V was also not called as a witness. Given the lack of evidence, I found that the Mother had failed to prove that the Father’s conduct had caused her distress indirectly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In conclusion, the Mother had failed to prove that the Father had committed family violence against the Mother and C. Accordingly, both applications were dismissed, with costs of $450 awarded in the Father's favour in addition to disbursements calculated at 50% of the costs of the transcripts. Notwithstanding these findings, I reminded both parties that they should consider the impact of their actions on the family as a whole. Provocative behaviour and veiled hostility in verbal exchanges would only lead to retaliatory conduct and increased animosity. It was evident that both children had been affected by the stressful and negative home environment. Both parents, as the adults in the family, should make all reasonable efforts to maintain peace within the household in order to protect the children's wellbeing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Annex

I ordered both parents to have joint custody of the child, and that they have shared care and control of the child for half of every week each. I also made orders on access for Hari Raya. The Mother has appealed against my decision. I furnish my grounds below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The child was born of the parents in December 2024. At the time of hearing in April 2025, the child was 5 months old, and at the time of my order in September 2025, the child was 10 months old. The child is the only child of the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I shall refer to the parents as “the Mother” and as “the Father” accordingly herein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parents married each other in Singapore in January 2023 under provisions of the Muslim law. The Mother is now 33 years old and is a marketing strategy/planning professional. The Father is now 32 years old and is a head of brand experience. After their marriage, the parents lived in their matrimonial home at Normanton Park.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The child was born in December 2024. The Mother breastfed the child. The parents had frequent quarrels. They had differences over religious practices.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother claimed that the Father forbade her family members from visiting her or the child at the matrimonial home. Later, the Father brought her and the child to his parents’ home. The Mother claimed that she was subjected to harassment and pressure by the Father and his parents to accept their religious practices. She claimed that she was forced to make a choice immediately. The Father pronounced a talak purporting to end the marriage. She signed a document which the Father had prepared that stated that she had no more feelings for him and for the child, and that she agreed for him to have full custody of the child upon divorce. The Mother left the Father’s parents’ home. She claimed that she was not allowed to take the child with her. She filed a police report a day later. She claimed that she was forbidden from taking the child away with her. The Mother also claimed that she had not seen the child even by the date of the first hearing on 2 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Mother’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother filed her application in February 2025. Apart from joint custody of the child to both parents, the Mother sought an order that she is to have care and control of the child, and for there to be no order as to access to the Father. She also sought an order that the Father deliver and hand over the child to her immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Father counter-applied in April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Father’s case was essentially that it was the Mother who left after a dispute. He alleged that during the “altercation”, the Mother abruptly shoved the child into the Father’s arms, nearly causing him to lose his balance. He claimed that since that incident, the Mother had not actively sought to care for the child, save for her demands to remove the child from the present arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father argued that the child’s best interest would be best served if the child remained in his care and control because of continuity and stability, as the child had been in his care since the Mother left, and also because the Mother’s living environment at her parents’ home was unsuitable due to overcrowding, exposure to vaping activities, and to the presence of multiple pets which posed health hazards to the child. The Father also claimed that he had been the child’s primary caregiver, and was therefore best positioned to provide for the child’s emotional, physical and financial well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I first heard the parties on 2 April 2025. The hearing could not proceed, because the Father had just before that filed his application, and the Mother’s counsel was not yet in the position to respond. I adjourned the hearing to a week later, on 9 April 2025. Given that the Mother had not seen the child for almost 4 months at that time, I directed that the Mother was to have access supervised by a DSSA in the interim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     At the subsequent hearing, I heard the parents’ counsel further. At the end of the hearing, I adjourned the issue of the child’s care and control pending an evaluation to be conducted on the issue and a report be submitted to me. In the interim, I ordered that the child was to be in the care and control of the Mother, and that the Father was to deliver the child to the Mother at 6pm the following day at the Father’s parents’ residence. I further ordered that the Mother was to give the Father access to the child once a week on Saturdays 10am to Sundays 10am. I further ordered for two-way supervised exchange to take place at the DSSA for 8 sessions, and that a review was be fixed by the Court after a report is submitted by the DSSA to the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody Evaluation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Custody evaluators from Community Psychology Hub interviewed both parents of the child, as well as both sets of grandparents and a paternal aunt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The evaluators observed that the child was responsive and smiling the presence of the Mother. They also observed the child to be responsive to her maternal grandmother, and to be comfortable with her maternal grandfather. The child was also observed to be comfortable at the maternal grandparents’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The evaluators also observed that there was no resistance nor anxiety by the child to being handed over to the Father. The evaluators also observed the child in the Father’s care. They observed that the return of the child to the Mother was non-eventful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The evaluators found no evidence to indicate that either parent was unfit. Both parents were assessed to have adequate caregiving resources, including stable employment and support for the child’s psychosocial and emotional development. However, their contentious relationship caused them to lose focus on the child’s best interests, leading to disagreements on parenting styles, missed opportunities for breastfeeding, and ineffective communication regarding the child's eczema management, all of which have adversely affected the child's well-being. Taking into consideration the child’s developmental needs, the evaluators recommended that both parents play a consistent role in the child’s life to provide a stable routine and secure attachment. Considering the parents’ tendency for gatekeeping behaviours, they recommended that the parenting arrangements be prescriptive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The evaluators recommended for the parents to be supported by FAM@FSC professional in their coparenting relationship and be given therapy on the developmental needs and milestones of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In consideration of the parents’ and other significant caregivers’ parenting capacities, child’s attachment and developmental needs, as well as the perceptions and relationships of all parties involved, the evaluators recommended that joint custody of the child be granted to both parents, and that shared care and control of the child be granted to granted to both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable laws</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The starting point of my inquiry was to consider section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant …, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I took the term “welfare” in its widest sense, for it is not “possible or desirable to define it” – <em>[IW v IX <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/49128-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 48</a> at (26)]</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In <em>Tan Siew Kee v Chua Ah Boey [1987] SLR (R) 725</em>, Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was), in reference to the term “welfare”, said (at 551, [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It means the general well-being of the child and all aspects of his upbringing, religious, moral as well as physical. His happiness, comfort and security also go to make up his well-being. A loving parent with a stable home is conducive to the attainment of such well-being. It is not to be measured in monetary terms.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[27] What would be in the interests of the child must necessarily depend on all the circumstances of the case. The court, where appropriate, will have regard to the factors the wife had mentioned, i.e. maintaining status quo, preservation of mother-child bond and that siblings should not be separated. Other factors will include the home environment and care arrangements made for the child, the conduct of the parties, and the wishes of the child. We must reiterate that this enumeration is not meant to be exhaustive. The court will have to carry out a balancing exercise to determine, as between the two parents, to whom custody should be given in the best interests of the child. A factor which may be determinant in one case may not necessarily be so in another. So the weight to be given to each factor may vary from case to case. No precise formulation is possible. This is not a scientific exercise but one of judgment.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the issue of joint or sole custody, I referred to the case of <em>CX v CY <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a></em>, which is the landmark Court of Appeal decision where the principle of joint parenting was endorsed, and which stated that acrimony alone is not considered to be sufficient to justify a sole custody order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[26] The idea of joint parental responsibility is deeply rooted in our family law jurisprudence. Section 46(1) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed) (‘the Charter’) exhorts both parents to make equal cooperative efforts to care and provide for their children. Article 18 of the United Nations Convention of the Rights of the child 1989, to which Singapore is a signatory, also endorses the view that both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of their child. Similarly, jurisdictions like England and Australia have adopted approaches that impose on both parents the concept of life-long parental responsibility. With parliamentary intervention in these jurisdictions, the very concept of custody orders was abolished as it was acknowledged that it was in the interests of the child to have both parents involved in his life. There can be no doubt that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus in any custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I was also aware that sole custody orders may in some situations be justified, again based on <em>CX v CY <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a></em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[38] … the exceptional circumstances where sole custody orders are made may be where one parent physically, sexually or emotionally abuses the child …. or where the relationship of parties is such that cooperation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of cooperation is harmful to the child.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On the issue of shared care and control, I referred to the case of <em>AQL v AQM <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a></em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[8]  …. In my opinion, an order for shared care and control means that the child spends time living with each parent, who then becomes the child’s primary caregiver for the duration that the child lives with him (or her). The right to make the day-to-day decisions on the upbringing of the child therefore rests with the parent the child is presently living with. In the context of shared care and control, it becomes meaningless to speak of ‘access’. This is because the child effectively has two homes and two primary caregivers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[9]    The practical effect of an order of shared care and control means that the child will spend roughly equal amounts of time (including overnight) with each parent. An order of shared care and control can take different forms depending on the circumstances. This is illustrated by two High Court decisions where shared care and control was ordered: in <em>AHJ v AHK <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0148.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 148</a></em> the child would spend Saturdays 8.00pm to Wednesday 11.30am with the mother, and the rest of the week with the father; in <em>AKF v AKG <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0225.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 225</a></em> the same learned judge held that the children would spend alternate fortnights with each parent.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I also noted the High Court’s view <em>in TAU v TAT <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a></em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[17] The court should also be concerned with whether both parents can support a two-home arrangement with sufficient co-operation so that there is minimal conflict over issues that ordinarily arise from daily living. While each parent will separately be responsible for day-to-day decision-making for the child when the child is spending time with that parent, there still remains the potential for harmful conflict. For instance, if the child has left his or her homework at the mother’s residence, will the father be antagonistic to the mother and blame her for failing to attend to this, or will he deal with the matter calmly and supportively? What if this happens often? Thus, while it is true, as the Father submitted, that acrimony between parents does not automatically rule out the possibility of an order of shared care and control, it is a relevant factor in the overall analysis of whether such an order would be in the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[18]  Research also indicates that high, on-going parental conflict can make shared care and control “hard for children”, such that “the stress and burden outweighs the benefits for them” in some cases: Caring for Children after Parental Separation at p 8. Of note is an Australian study which found that in high conflict families, “[c]hildren’s experience of living in shared care over 3–4 years was associated with greater difficulties in attention, concentration and task completion by the fourth year of the study”. Similar conclusions were reached in another Australian study: see Jennifer McIntosh &amp; Richard Chisholm, “Cautionary Notes on the Shared Care of Children in Conflicted Parental Separation” (2008) 14 Journal of Family Studies 37 at pp 41–42. As the authors in the latter article eloquently put it at pp 43–44:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… when children of any age make frequent transitions between warring parents who are unable to conceal their feelings in the presence of the child, children then begin to use considerable energy to ensure their own comfort and emotional safety in each environment, actively and constantly monitoring the ‘emotional weather’ they encounter in each parent’s home.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     With the above in mind, I arrived at my findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Both parents requested for joint custody of the child. Nevertheless, in the interest of the welfare of the child, I examined the issue of whether an order of joint custody was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I acknowledged that the relationship between the parents was in difficulties. They were leading separate lives in separate households.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, I also took into account the fact that the parents were not divorced. Since the parents were still married, there remained at least a theoretical possibility of reconciliation. It remained to be seen if the parents’ separation was a temporary difficulty or would become a permanent state.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I found that the acrimony between the parents was not of such a nature that called for the child to be in the sole custody of either parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I also found that both parents exhibited love, care and affection for the child. I had no doubt that the welfare of the child would be best served by letting the child enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of the child had not changed simply because the parents no longer lived together. Therefore, it was crucial that I recognised and promoted joint parenting so that both parents could continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I found there to be no exceptional circumstances such that joint custody ought not to be ordered. Therefore, I ordered that both parents shall have joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Mother sought an order of care and control of the child solely to her. The Father sought for an order of shared care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The child was less than a year old. During these proceedings, the child had been in the Father’s sole care, and later in the Mother’s care. I took into consideration the evidence before me that was found in the parents’ affidavits, as well as the external inputs of the custody evaluators.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I found that both parents were capable of caring for the child during the periods when the child was with them. I did not find their allegations against each other regarding their home environments to be convincing to the extent that either parent ought not care for the child. Therefore, I ordered both parents to share care and control of the child. They shall each have half of each week to care for the child. I provided for access on Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji in addition to the weekly arrangement. I also ordered that the parents were free to modify, whether temporarily or permanently (such as in the event of childcare closures, vacations, or illnesses) any of the care and control arrangements, as long as such modifications were arrived at with agreement of both parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I found it appropriate to approach the case through the lens of therapeutic justice, as explained in <em>TEN v TEO <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24108-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 20</a>:</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[46] … The overarching aspiration of the family justice system is to assist families to move forward positively. Therapeutic justice delivered through a problem-solving court process seeks to allow healing, restoration and recasting of a positive future... It is with these principles in mind, and the welfare of the Children as my utmost concern, that I approached the legal issues in these appeals.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I was conscious that the parents have an acrimonious relationship. At the same time, I was confident that they both want the best for the child. I believed that with professional counselling and therapy, they would be able to parent the child in future, even if their relationship remained estranged. I therefore agreed with the recommendation of the custody evaluator, and I ordered that the parents attend counselling at FAM@FSC. This was to work on their parenting and child development skills, and co-parenting behaviours, with a view to awareness of the impact of their continued conflicts on their child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To encourage compliance and cooperation, I ordered that a penal notice be attached to the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I was also aware that the parents are both Muslims and that they were married under the provisions of the Muslim Law. If their relationship does not improve and they decide to they undergo a dissolution of their marriage, it would take place at the Syariah Court, which will then deal with the issues of custody care and control of the child. I therefore ordered that this order remained in force until such a time if and when the parties divorce and the Syariah Court issues orders on the parties regarding the custody care control and access of the child.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Mental Capacity Act – Statutory Wills"],"date":"2025-12-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OAM 246/2025","title":"In re XVW","citation":"[2025] SGFC 129","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34198-SSP.xml","counsel":["Andrew Wong Wei Kiat (I.R.B.

Ed.) (MCA) provides a legal framework for wide-ranging issues relating broadly to how individuals can protect their interests should they lose mental capacity or how individuals who have lost capacity, may continue to be protected and cared for by others. S 23(1)(k) of the MCA enables a court to direct the execution of a will on behalf of a person who has lost capacity (P) if this advances his best interests<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as defined under s 6 of the Act. The present application was for such a “statutory will” to be executed. The position that Parliament made clear when enacting the provision was for this power to be exercised very carefully and stringently.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The present application was not contested. Having heard from the applicant’s counsel, I dismissed it and provide my reasons for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The applicant is the deputy for his brother, P, an appointment made by me pursuant to his application in FC/OSM 465/2021. They have 4 other siblings. P lived with his late mother in her 3-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat prior to their late mother’s passing. Upon her passing and in accordance with her will, this flat was given to one of her other sons, who I shall refer to as John.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       According to the applicant, John wanted P to stay on at the flat after their mother’s passing and decided to transfer his title and rights to P. The applicant by way of the present application is seeking that a statutory will be executed on behalf of P to allow John to be the sole beneficiary of the flat when P passes away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reasons for the dismissal of the application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">P’s best interests are not served by a “statutory will”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       All the siblings save for one, had consented to the application. The applicant was of the view that the best interests of P would be served by the execution of the statutory will. Counsel for the applicant referred to the court’s decision in <b><em>BHR and Anor.</em></b> v <b><em>BHS<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></em></b> which, drawing on positions expressed by English Courts interpreting similar provisions, spoke of how best interests can be served even after one’s passing in the way one is remembered with affection and for having done the right thing by their will. Given that John had given up his right to the property willed to him by his late mother, the applicant was of the view that the right thing would be for P to “return” the property to John when P passes away. In the case of <em>BHR</em>, P had made a will in 1996 which benefitted her 6 children equally. In 2010, a new will was allegedly executed. The defendant in that case had possession of the will but did not produce it, conveying to the other siblings however, that it was largely of benefit to the defendant. The Court executed a statutory will for P which was substantially in line with the 1996 will in that it provided for the 6 siblings and the issue of a deceased child, equally. The Court stated that “<em>while P’s best interersts would be served by giving effect to P’s wishes, best interests do not cease at the moment of death</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I did not disagree with this. There are other situations where the court might also step in. Clearly where a will was executed that would lead to unjust outcomes or where there are changes in circumstances which make certain provisions in an existing will challenging to execute, the court may intervene. In <b><em>TCZ</em></b> v <b><em>TDA, TDB and TDC</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> a statutory will was directed to be executed for an 88 year old lady who had dementia, on findings of undue pressure by a male caregiver that influenced her into executing a will which provided much of her wealth to him. The statutory will mirrored a will that the lady had executed previously when she was in better health and which left most of her wealth to charity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In the case before me, no will was ever executed by P. It is a situation where P played no part in any exercise involving the HDB flat. To hinge the application on the best interests of P would not be correct. This appears to be a case where the best interests of the family are being advanced. That is not the design behind s 23((1)(k).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reason(s) for having transferred the property to P </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I had asked the applicant’s counsel what the reason for the intial transfer of the property was. I asked if John had other property. Counsel answered in the affirmative but was not able to speak more on this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> FC/OSM 465/2021 which was a matter before me and the supporting affidavit filed in that matter reveals that the applicant had informed the court then that John had paid for the flat to allow his mother and P to stay. When their mother passed away, everyone, save for one brother, felt it is best to let P stay on at the property given that no one could take him in to live with them. John could not keep the flat in his name as he had a HDB property of his own.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Given that the family did not want to disrupt P’s living arrangement, it appears that John decided to transfer his rights. While I agree that it would be in the best interests of P to keep his living arrangements comfortable, familiar and stable, if possible, the law cannot endorse a position where family members decide what to do at a given point in time to ostensibly advance the interests of P but in effect, preserve their own. It was their late mother’s wish for the property to go to John. She must have had her reasons which I assume to be her belief that John cares and will provide for P. Had she known that John could not hold on to the property in his name, it is not known how she would have dealt with the property given her obvious and understandable concerns about P’s care after her death. However, what we do know is that no one could take P in after their mother’s passing. The family did not want to sell the property and John could not hold on to title to 2 HDB flats. The family did not in 2021 believe that the property ought to continue in P’s name although the representation to the court in 2021 was to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legitimate ways to achieve the same result without compromising the interests of other family members</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The flat could still go to John if that is what the siblings desire. If P predeceases all his siblings, his estate would be distributed in accordance with the laws of intestacy. Given that P’s parents have passed on, he is not married and does not have children, the estate would be divided amongst the very siblings who have come forward for this matter. They are entitled to give their shares up to John if they so wish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There is one sibling who had in the first application in FC/OSM 465/2021 remained silent to the applicant’s request to be appointed as a deputy for P. The reason given by the applicant at that time was that this sibling was abroad and could not get to a Notary to provide written consent on account of the challenging COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> He has however chosen to remain silent for this matter too. The applicant had in written submissions to court indicated that he was willing to have 20% of the estate given to the brother who has remained and that the statutory will need only address the 80% share that would belong to the remaining siblings collectively if the laws of intestacy govern the distribution of P’s estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I found this to be an odd position and one that was perhaps addressing the court’s concern that not all the siblings were in agreement. There is nothing stopping the siblings from giving up their shares if they wish to ensure that John ultimately benefits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The position of John’s family was not sought when he chose to transfer his rights to P. Now that it is in P’s name, the entitlements of the families of John and the other siblings may need to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     A court should not have to enable a family to navigate through legal challenges unless what is being sought is clearly in the best interests of P. The intention of the mother was different from the intention of the children. They are concerned for P but at the same time, they want a result that appears to honour their mother’s initial wishes. The purpose of a statutory will is to advance the interests of P and there is little in evidence to show this. Counsel suggested in submissions that the siblings may want to prevent a position where their individual families may raise objections if the siblings attempted to give up their rights to John when P passes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There are ways to address such difficulties but it cannot be through an application which does not meet the best interests of P. The siblings may also want to consider executing their own wills which spell out their intentions in different factual scenarios to ensure that their shares benefit John or his estate. I will leave that discussion to be had between counsel and his client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Granting this application even if uncontested, would be to set bad precedent. The makers of the law call for the courts to be slow in directing statutory wills. In all past cases, there was typically the existence of a will which expressed the autonomy of an individual but could not be carried out or one that was revoked by a later will that was discordant with past expressed intentions of an individual.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     When the applicant sought to be a deputy for P, he asked that he act for P to enable the transfer of John’s rights in the flat to P. This was enabled on the reasons given in that application which included that John could not retain the HDB flat in his name. It appears that there was no intention to retain P’s name as evidenced by the present application which seeks to undo the position at a time P passes away. However, on account of the lack of consent of one brother, the potential silencing of other members of the siblings’ families should intestacy laws no longer govern the distribution of P’s estate when P passes away and most importantly that this statutory will does not advance P’s interests in any way, the application was not allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The siblings are able to provide John with what they think should rightfully belong to John. If the applicant and other siblings wish to address concerns relating to how their families would react should they provide their entitlements to John at the time of P’s passing, there are other ways to manage that. It is not in my view, through a peremptory application under s 23(1)(k) of the MCA.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>S 3(5) of the MCA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Parliamentary Debates, Official Report dated 15/9/2008, Vol 85, Col 151</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0149.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 149</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 56 of the Judgment</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17821-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 63</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE of 4/11/2025 at Page 8B</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 11 (a) (ii) of affidavit of 10/12/2021</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Page 7 of the supporting affidavit filed in FC/OSM 465/2021</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 21 of the submissions dated 24/10/2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>NE of 4/11/2025 at page 8D</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Stay of proceedings"],"date":"2025-12-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"OAD 454 of 2024 (FC/SUM 1875/2025), District Court Appeals No RAS 30/2025","title":"XSG v XSF","citation":"[2025] SGFC 131","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34179-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Eunice Ong Ying Ting (Netto & Margin LLC) for the Husband","Ms Lim Lay See (LS Lim Law Practice) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-12-09T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chia Wee Kiat","html":"<root><head><title>XSG v XSF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSG <em>v</em> XSF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34179-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 131</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Under stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore (<em>Eng Liat Kiang</em> at [19], <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [28]). This requires more than merely showing Singapore is not the natural forum; there must be a clearly or distinctly more appropriate alternative forum. The court’s task is to examine the connecting factors to ascertain which forum has the most real and substantial connection with the action (<em>Spiliada</em> at 478 and <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> (“<em>CIMB Bank Bhd</em>”) at [26]). The weight accorded to each factor varies according to its relevance to, and associations with, the particular dispute. A factor that proves to be the tipping point in one case might be less significant in another, depending on the factual matrix (<em>BDA v BDB</em> at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">36    If the court concludes at stage one of the <em>Spiliada</em> test that there is no clearly or distinctly more appropriate forum, the court will ordinarily refuse a stay. If, however, the court concludes that there is some other available forum which prima facie is clearly or distinctly more appropriate, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused (“stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test”). At stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the court will consider all the circumstances of the case, and the legal burden is on the plaintiff to establish the existence of those special circumstances to warrant the exercise of the court’s discretion to refuse a stay (<em>Eng Liat Kiang</em> at [19], <em>CIMB Bank Bhd</em> at [26], <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [22]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     With these broad principles in mind, I turn now to explain my analysis of the connecting factors that were relevant to this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ bankruptcy status</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband pointed out that both parties were recently adjudged bankrupt in Singapore. It was not in the best interests of the children to have both parents bankrupt and have their finances limited in Singapore when they had the extended family’s support in Malaysia. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     However, I did not see how the parties’ bankruptcy could, in any principled way, be a factor in favour of a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. Although framed in the language of the children’s welfare, the underlying tenor of the Husband’s argument suggested an intention to evade the obligations that flow from his bankruptcy in Singapore. This is not a legitimate forum-convenience consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In my judgment, the fact of bankruptcy did not justify a stay; if anything, it strengthened the connection to Singapore. As parties were bankrupts and subject to the supervision of the Official Assignee, their legal obligations, financial disclosures, and movement restrictions were all anchored in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Pertinently, the division of matrimonial assets could not be divorced from the bankruptcy regime, which necessitated ascertaining the extent of the bankrupt’s estate and ensuring proper supervision by the Official Assignee. As noted in <em>AVM v AWH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17698-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 194</a> (at [115]), only assets which have not vested in the Official Assignee can be divided. There are also statutory restrictions on the disposition of property by a bankrupt: see s 328 of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018; <em>Cheo Sharon Andriesz v Official Assignee of the estate of Andriesz Paul Matthew, a bankrupt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 2 SLR 0297.xml')\">[2013] 2 SLR 297</a>. The parties’ bankruptcy also had a direct bearing on the issue of maintenance since their financial capacity, the extent of their liabilities, and the constraints imposed by the bankruptcy regime were all matters that had to be considered. These were interlocking inquiries that the Singapore court was uniquely positioned to determine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Far from supporting a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the parties’ bankruptcy entrenched Singapore as the more appropriate forum and weighed against any stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Personal connection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband submitted that Malaysia was the more appropriate forum due to parties’ roots to Malaysia. They were originally Malaysians, and all their extended families remain living in Malaysia. The parties had moved to Singapore in search of better opportunities for business and stayed for some time in Singapore due to the Husband’s successful business at that time. Even when parties were living in Singapore, they travelled between Malaysia and Singapore regularly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband said that when the parties wanted to relocate to Australia but could not do so due to the change in immigration policy in Australia, the parties’ first step was to move back to Malaysia rather than Singapore. The parties then lived in HF’s house. During this period, [A] and [Z] attended international school and [N] attended a local pre-school.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband submitted that this would have been the <em>status quo</em> if not for the fact that the parties got into a dispute with respect to the flat in Singapore. The Husband wanted to sell the flat as he needed liquidity for his business, but the Wife wanted to retain the flat. This dispute over the flat led to a series of quarrels and arguments which eventually led to the breakdown of their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband said that the Wife had only moved to Singapore so that she could reside in the Singapore flat to stop him from trying to sell or surrender the flat back to the HDB.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> While he had some business interests in Singapore, he remained domiciled in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> He explained that his business had failed in Singapore and his recourse was to head back to Malaysia to try to build up his business again with the support of his father,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> so that he could eventually repay his debt and discharge his bankruptcy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife said that the parties had always intended Singapore as their permanent home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> Prior to purchasing the matrimonial flat, they stayed in rented private properties in Singapore and had several cars, either bought or rented in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> They did not rent out their matrimonial flat even when they left for Perth.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife pointed out that all the Husband’s businesses were in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> He incorporated four companies in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> and travelled frequently between Malaysia and Singapore for his businesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> [HC1] was active for 10 years from 2015 to 2025 before it went into liquidation on 7 February 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife also pointed out that as a bankrupt, the Husband was not allowed to leave Singapore without the permission of the Official Assignee. The Husband did not explain why he was still in Malaysia having renounced his Malaysian citizenship nor did he explain how he had managed to leave Singapore as a bankrupt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As the facts in <em>XLV v XLW</em> bore some similarity to the present case, Justice Teh’s analysis of the parties’ personal connection in that case provided useful guidance. Noting that nationality alone should not determine forum choice and greater focus should be placed on domicile or habitual residence, the learned judge reasoned as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37    I deal first with the personal connection of the parties to the competing forums. I agree with the DJ’s conclusion that the parties’ domicile and personal connections to Singapore are factors that lean in favour of Singapore as the more appropriate forum. While the parties’ early history shows ties to China, after relocating from China to Singapore in 2002 and solemnising their marriage at the Singapore Chinese Embassy in 2007, the life choices that they made demonstrate a clear commitment to settle down as a family in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">38    The Husband renounced his Chinese citizenship in 2014 and became a Singapore citizen. As for the Wife, her maintenance of her Singapore PR status since 2009 indicates her own connection to Singapore. More pertinently, the depth of the parties’ connection to Singapore is evinced by their continuous residence here since 2002 until recent years, their acquisition of a matrimonial flat, and their decision to raise and educate both of the Children in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Likewise, the parties’ domicile and personal relocation history in the present case also pointed towards Singapore as the more appropriate forum. The Wife’s account that the Husband had proposed relocating to Singapore and making Singapore their permanent home was corroborated by the undisputed fact they did indeed move to Singapore, obtain Singapore citizenship, and renounce their Malaysian citizenship. Their subsequent move to Australia for about a year did not, on the evidence, suggest any intention to abandon their Singapore domicile in favour of an Australian one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While the family later returned to Malaysia, there was no clear indication that they intended to re-establish domicile or settle permanently in Malaysia. At all material times, they remained Singapore citizens; the Husband continued to have business interests in Singapore; and both parties were bankrupt, which meant that they were not permitted to leave Singapore without the consent of the Official Assignee. The Husband’s decision to remain in Malaysia appeared, on balance, to have been driven by a desire to evade his bankruptcy obligations than by any genuine or settled intention to re-establish his domicile in Malaysia. The Wife, on the other hand, had returned to Singapore with the two older children to live in the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Taken together, the evidence pointed to Singapore as the jurisdiction with the closest and most real connection to the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband further argued that the Wife ought to have taken out a relocation application but this had not been done to date. Hence, he argued that the Wife’s move to Singapore was not meant to be permanent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I did not find this submission persuasive. Given that both parties are Singapore citizens and that the children themselves hold dual citizenship, it was unclear why a relocation order would be required in the first place. The Wife and the children, being Singapore citizens with their established home in Singapore, were simply returning home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Proceedings in Malaysia</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As noted <em>XLV v XLW</em> (at [54]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is well established that the existence of parallel proceedings is a relevant factor in the forum non conveniens analysis (<em>MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo SE and another v IM Skaugen SE and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24357-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 327</a> (“<em>MAN Diesel</em>”) at [154], citing <em>Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1097.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1097</a> (“<em>Virsagi</em>”) at [38]; <em>TDX v TDY</em> at [18]). The existence of parallel proceedings gives rise to concerns of duplication of resources and the risk of conflicting judgments (<em>MAN</em> Diesel at [154]). However, the weight to be given to the existence of parallel proceedings depends on the circumstances, including the degree to which the respective proceedings have advanced, and the degree of overlap of issues and parties (<em>Virsagi</em> at [39], referring to commentary of Professor Yeo Tiong Min in <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore</em> vol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2009) at para 75.094).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband submitted that there were already ongoing children and matrimonial proceedings in Malaysia. Both parties had filed applications in the Malaysian courts and thereby submitted to the Malaysian jurisdiction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     However, I noted that the Malaysian divorce proceedings were commenced several months after the Singapore divorce proceedings were initiated. Significantly, the Husband was not only aware of the Singapore divorce proceedings but had actively participated in them – he had even filed a cross-application for divorce in Singapore, which he now oddly sought to stay. As his decision to commence parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia was entirely elective, any concern about duplication of resources or perceived risk of conflicting decisions was a situation entirely of his own making.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is trite law that little, or no weight will be given to the fact that there are foreign proceedings if they are commenced for strategic reasons to bolster the case of a clearly more appropriate forum elsewhere: see <em>Harlsbury’s Law of Singapore – Conflict of Laws</em> (Volume 6(2)) (LexisNexis) at [75.109].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my view, it would not be correct to allow the Husband to rely on the risk that he himself had created to stay the Singapore divorce proceedings. This could not be a legitimate basis to support a stay. To borrow the words of Choo Han Teck J in <em>AQN v AQO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17116-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 523</a> (at [11]), “it lies not in the mouth of the husband to rely on the rule against duplicitous proceedings having commenced the action in [Indonesia] himself”. Accordingly, I gave no weight to the parallel divorce proceedings in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Aside from the divorce proceedings, there were also ongoing proceedings relating to the children in Malaysia. Although the Husband’s stay application was directed at the Singapore divorce proceedings, I accepted that there was some overlap of issues between the Singapore divorce proceedings and the Malaysian proceedings relating to the children, as the ancillary matters in the Singapore divorce proceedings included custody and maintenance issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband submitted that the Wife had clearly taken steps in Malaysia by filing JB-[X2] on 12 November 2024 and an <em>ex-parte</em> application on 13 January 2025 for interim custody of the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> The Malaysian proceedings were filed first and were currently at a more advanced stage where parties were proceeding towards a contested hearing fixed on 12 December 2025. Given that there could potentially be conflicting orders made to the custody, care and control of the children, the Husband submitted that the Singapore proceedings ought to be stayed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Citing the case authority of <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a>, a seminal decision of the Family Division which sets out the principles applicable to stay applications specific to custody proceedings, the Husband contended that Malaysia would be the more effective forum to determine the best interests of the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     However, given that the core issue before me was the dissolution of the marriage, I did not consider that the overlapping children-related issues materially advanced the Husband’s stay application. The mere existence of custody proceedings abroad did not, without more, justify staying the Singapore divorce proceedings, particularly when the Husband had already participated in the Singapore action and had himself filed an application for access to [A] and [Z] <em>vide</em> SUM 888.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Furthermore, the paramount consideration in any custody proceedings is the welfare of the child. As noted in Debbie Ong, <em>International Issues in Family Law in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at page 244:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Custody disputes are unique because the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. It is not surprising that despite a prior foreign custody order, the court, guided by the welfare principle, may be willing to re-open a custody dispute and determine the case on its merits. The Privy Council, in <em>Mark T Mckee V Evelyn McKee</em>, a case on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada, had held years ago that it is the negation of the welfare principle not to enter into the merits of the question afresh, even where there is a foreign order in existence. Lord Simonds held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">But it is the negation of the proposition, from which every judgment in this case has proceeded, namely, that the infant’s welfare is the paramount consideration, to say that where the trial judge has in his discretion thought fit … to examine all the circumstances and form an independent judgment, his decision ought for that reason to be overruled. Once it is conceded that the court of Ontario had jurisdiction to entertain the question of custody and that it need not blindly follow an order made by a foreign court, the consequence cannot be escaped that it must form an independent judgment on the question, though in dong so it will give proper weight to the foreign judgment. What is the proper weight will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Given that a Singapore court is not bound by a prior foreign custody order and is obliged under the welfare principle to examine child-related issues afresh in accordance with the welfare principle, the existence of the children proceedings in Malaysia did not justify staying the Singapore divorce proceedings. In any event, the Singapore court may accord appropriate weight to a foreign custody order in the analysis of what would be in the best interests of a child. As noted in <em>XLK v XLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34031-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHC(A) 22</a> (at [40]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The second question, regarding the weight to be accorded to foreign court orders in the analysis of what would be in the best interests of a child, is not a question of law: see <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 1 SLR(R) 0135.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 135</a> at [25]–[28]; see also <em>TUC v TUD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20947-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 1360</a> at [20]–[21]. At its highest, this argument contends that the court should not have given significant weight to the foreign court orders in applying the welfare principle to the facts of the present case. However, it is well-established that the welfare principle requires the court to consider a multitude of factors, and the weight to be given to any one factor involves a fact-sensitive value judgment: see <em>BNS v BNT</em> at [20] and <em>TSF v TSE</em> at [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     For the above reasons, I did not find the existence of the parallel proceedings in Malaysia to favour a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Location of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     It is trite that the location of the matrimonial assets is a relevant consideration in a stay application. The following observations of the court in <em>AZS v AZR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0102.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 102</a> (“<em>AZS v AZR</em>”) (at [21]) bear this out clearly:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Although the district judge was also correct in stating that the Singapore courts could deal with the division of worldwide assets in ancillary hearings, some emphasis should also be placed on the fact that the matrimonial properties are located in foreign jurisdictions. For instance, in <em>Mala Shukla</em>, the fact that the parties there had immovable property in India but not Singapore was a pertinent factor in favour of a stay (<em>Mala Shukla</em> at [54]). Similarly here, the fact that the parties have immovable property in France but not Singapore should be a supporting factor for a stay of the Singapore proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Husband submitted that the only matrimonial asset was the HDB flat in Singapore and that the Wife could commence separate proceedings under s 121B of the Women’s Charter 1961 to deal with the HDB flat after the Malaysian divorce had been adjudicated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I did not think that this was a persuasive argument. Splitting the resolution of the parties’ matrimonial issues across two jurisdictions would fragment the proceedings and multiply costs. Moreover, the division of matrimonial assets is ordinarily addressed as part of the ancillary matters flowing from the divorce. There was no sensible basis for compelling the Wife to pursue a piecemeal approach when the Singapore court was already properly seized of the entire dispute. In this regard, the following observations of the court in <em>Mala Shukla v Janyant Amritanda Shukla</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0920.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</a> (at [57]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As Lee Seiu Kin JC said in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0993.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 993</a> at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">it is more important that the same court consider and decide these matters [meaning the divorce and ancillary matters such as custody and access] than to divide the issues to be decided in separate courts simply because the assets are in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Furthermore, the matrimonial flat was not the only asset in Singapore. As contended by the Wife, the matrimonial assets included CPF monies and various companies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Although the Wife had asserted that all the assets were in Singapore<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> and that the parties never bought or owned any property in Malaysia during the marriage,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> the Husband claimed that they had two condominiums in Malaysia<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> and his primary business was in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Accepting the Husband’s claim was it was, the location of these assets in Malaysia was at best a neutral factor given that there were also matrimonial assets located in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Availability of witnesses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Husband claimed that all the witnesses pertaining to the divorce were located in Malaysia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_88\" id=\"Ftn_88_1\"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> This was disputed by the Wife as a bare allegation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_89\" id=\"Ftn_89_1\"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span> The Wife pointed out that the Husband did not establish what the dispute was, if any, that warranted the calling of witnesses or did his pleadings for divorce involved any witnesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_90\" id=\"Ftn_90_1\"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span> Even if there were any, they could always travel to Singapore to testify or provide evidence <em>via</em> video-link.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_91\" id=\"Ftn_91_1\"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span> The Wife said that her witnesses and documents were in Singapore. Travelling to Malaysia for the Wife would be difficult due to her bankruptcy, travel restrictions, and sole caregiving responsibilities for [A] and [Z]. The children would be left alone at home and she would require leave from work as she had been working since the Husband had refused to maintain the family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_92\" id=\"Ftn_92_1\"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     While the availability of witnesses is a relevant connecting factor (for example, see <em>AZS v AZR</em> (at [11(a)])), it has also been observed that “the place of residence of witnesses may not be a significant issue in the light of the easy availability of video conferencing”: see <em>Sanjeev Sharma s/o Shri Sarvjeet Sharma v Surbhi Ahuja d/o Sh Virendra Kumar Ahuja</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17594-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 1056</a> (at [24]), citing the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> (at [69]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In the present case, the Husband’s assertion was vague and unparticularised. He did not identify the witnesses or explain why those witnesses could not travel to Singapore, or why their evidence could not be taken by video-link. In contrast, the Wife had clearly articulated her difficulties in travelling to Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The availability of witnesses was, at best, neutral – and at worst, it leaned against the grant of a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     For the reasons set out above, I found that the Husband had not discharged his burden of establishing that Malaysia was clearly or distinctly the more appropriate forum. Indeed, none of the connecting factors favoured a stay. Given that Stage 1 had not been satisfied, there was no necessity to proceed to Stage 2 of the <em>Spiliada test</em>: see <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> (at [34]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The application was therefore dismissed.</p> <hr

id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff and defendant are sisters. The plaintiff lives in the United Kingdom (UK) while the defendant lives in Singapore. The parties’ eldest sister (P) lived in the UK with her husband for many decades. She now lives in Singapore. The couple do not have children. In 2019, the defendant went to the UK to visit P as P was not in the best of health. During that visit, P’s health concerns appeared to pose challenges for her continued stay and care in the UK. It was decided that P was to move to Singapore and be in the care of the defendant. On 10 January 2022, a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) was executed by P naming the defendant as her donee of power in the event P were to lose mental capacity to manage her personal welfare, property and affairs. Prior to the issuance of this LPA, P had executed another on 2 August 2021. This was rejected by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) due to what the OPG felt was an irregularity with the signature of P found on the LPA. The plaintiff challenged the validity of the creation/execution of the LPA on several grounds. Having heard the evidence, I dismissed the application and the plaintiff appeals against this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Factual Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       P lived largely in the UK from the 1970s. She left for the UK to pursue her interest in hairdressing after completing her ‘O’ level examinations in Singapore. A short period was spent in the US to undertake theological studies before returning to Singapore to be with her parents, during which time she set up a hairdressing salon. With the plaintiff’s own move to the UK for further studies, P decided to return to be of help to her sister. P was married in 1987 to a man who was the landlord of a property P stayed in when she first moved to the UK and who provided accommodation to the plaintiff too when she arrived in the UK. With P’s marriage, she continued to live in the UK until her return to Singapore in June 2019. Her husband remained in the UK till his passing in March 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       P has significant assets in the UK and Singapore. Her Singapore assets included an apartment in the Queenstown area (Queenstown apartment) which she resided at upon her return and continues to do so. P had a property in Jurong which was sold to purchase the Queenstown property. She was able to do so as she retained her Singapore citizenship. This apartment was purchased with the intention of providing a home to her parents. For both purchases, the defendant was given a Power of Attorney (POA) to act for P given that P was living in the UK at the time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Additionally, the defendant had a licence to practice as an estate agent in Singapore and appears to have knowledge necessary to navigate the real estate arena.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that the parties had a very good relationship prior to difficulties which led to this litigation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> P was similarly on good terms with both her sisters. It was the plaintiff’s position that P began to show signs of impaired motor control as early as 2008 and appeared to have some cognitive difficulties which progressed over the decade since. In 2019, with concerns over her continued care in the UK mounting, P moved to Singapore and lived in her Queenstown apartment. It was not disputed that P’s relationship with her husband was disharmonious and there were allegations that P was fearful of him. P’s husband had initiated divorce proceedings prior to his death. In any event, her husband was some 20 years older than P and was not in a position to provide continued care for her. The plaintiff and defendant agreed to move P to Singapore, without the express approval of P’s husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       A LPA had been executed by P in September 2016<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> in the UK (UK LPA) appointing the plaintiff and defendant as joint donees to manage P's personal welfare and property and affairs in the UK. With P’s move to Singapore in June 2019, it was agreed that the plaintiff would assist in the management P’s assets in the UK<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> while the defendant would assist P in Singapore. On 12 November 2019, P executed a will appointing both the plaintiff and the defendant as joint executrices. The UK will provide for all of P’s UK properties to be divided by the parties equally. Two of the properties in the UK however were held by P and the defendant as tenants-in-common (UK joint properties).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       P had also executed a will on 19 July 2016 for the administration of her estate in Singapore (first Singapore Will). In this will, only the defendant was named the executrix while both the plaintiff and defendant were named the beneficiaries of the Queenstown apartment. Apart from the Queenstown apartment, P had bank accounts in Singapore, some jointly held with the defendant. On 8 March 2021 however, P executed a will in Singapore, thereby revoking the first Singapore Will, and in this later will, the defendant was named the sole beneficiary of the Queenstown property as well as to P’s assets outside of Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The defendant expressed surprise at what this meant as she was under the impression that the UK assets were to be dealt with under the UK Will<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The plaintiff alleged that difficulties arose when she was blocked from access to P by the defendant around June 2021 and that the defendant impeded the plaintiff’s ability to manage P’s assets in the UK. It was the defendant’s position that the plaintiff was attempting to sever what she believed were joint tenancies to the 2 UK properties, which the defendant in fact held with P as tenants-in-common. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff was unilaterally dealing with solicitors in the UK to effect the severance, and to do so, was attempting to activate the UK LPA to deal with matters relating to the UK assets when P was not mentally incapacitated at the time. It was the defendant’s further position that P wanted to sell all her properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       When P’s husband had passed away, the defendant flew to the UK to settle matters arising from his passing on behalf of P. A POA was executed by P on 4 August 2021 to enable this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff questioned the ability of P to execute the POA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The focus of this matter was the LPA that was executed by P on 2 August 2021 and reissued on 10 January 2022 to rectify concerns about P’s signature found on the 2 August 2021 LPA. The irregularity was rectified by having P affix her thumbprint to the LPA on 10 January 2022. It was the plaintiff’s position that P did not have the mental capacity to execute the LPA in Singapore and that it should accordingly be revoked. In this regard, various medical doctors were asked to provide their position on the state of P’s mental health at or around the time of the LPA execution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It was also the plaintiff’s position that the defendant had fraudulently and/or by exercise of undue pressure, induced P into creating/executing the Singapore LPA. A further contention was that the defendant had acted in various ways that showed the interests of P having been compromised and that the LPA ought to be accordingly revoked. The defendant disagreed with all positions taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Did P have mental capacity to create/execute a LPA? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The plaintiff sought to address the issue of fraud/undue pressure in the creation and execution of the LPA first. I was of the view that the core issue would be the mental capacity of P at time of the execution before exploration of the facts that parties relied on to show fraud/undue pressure, or the lack of it. Even as fraud and/or undue pressure are independent factors to consider in an application for a revocation of a LPA, the state of mind of P is inextricably linked to such determination as a poor cognitive state places P in a much more vulnerable position, potentially therefore leading to affirmative responses to requests or quick execution of documents to avoid prolonged conversations, questions or confusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The expression of rational will is rooted in the idea of human dignity. The execution of a LPA, at a time when an individual has the capacity to choose someone to act for him should capacity be lost, is an important expression of that human autonomy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is a challenge to determine if an individual was in fact asserting his choice of a donee of power if that individual was suffering from a neurodegenerative illness at the time. There is a presumption of capacity<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and many neurodegenerative conditions do not signal an inability to execute documents. Indeed the law speaks of the need to avoid treating a person “<em>as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help the person to do so have been taken without success</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> Determining whether an individual had the capacity to execute a particular document at the particular time it was executed, must turn on examination of the evidence from medical doctors, relevant observations of those who have been with P, and an assessment of P’s own actions, both past and present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Section 19 of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (2020 Rev Ed.) (MCA) allows for the court to “<em>make declarations as to whether a person has or lacks capacity</em>.” S 4 (1) of the MCA provides the statutory definition of a lack of capacity. The law speaks of an impairment of or disturbance in the functioning of the mind or brain, regardless of its permanent or temporary nature [s 4(2)]. S 5 of the MCA goes on to provide that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>1</em>)     <em>For the purpose of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself if he is unable –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>To understand the information relevant to the decision;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>To retain that information;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)     <em>To use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)     <em>To communicate this decision.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     It is well established that the test for mental capacity as defined under s 4(1) of the MCA has both a functional and clinical component.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     While there was some conflict with respect to the time P started experiencing symptoms associated with Parkinson’s Disease (PD), the fact that she did suffer from the condition was not disputed. A fair estimation of the relevant time would be around 2010.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Often conditions such as PD, Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are referred to interchangeably. PD is, however, a disease which results in movement disorders and an individual may develop cognitive problems in later stages which includes cognitive impairment and dementia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Dementia is a broad term which refers to conditions which give rise to memory loss, confusion at times and behavioural changes. It embraces Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and Lewy body dementia.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Dr X, a principal consultant (neurologist) gave evidence that she saw P from 19 June 2019 to 12 August 2024. As at June 2019, P was not exhibiting any cognitive impairment. Around December 2019, P was experiencing high levels of anxiety and was referred to the department of psychiatry at a public hospital where she came under the care of Dr C. Dr X continued to see P. On 22 February 2021 and again on 8 August 2022, mental assessment tests were conducted. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) conducted at Dr X’s clinic showed P receiving lower scores (17/30 and 12/30 in 2021 and 2022, respectively) than when she took a mental assessment test in 2020. Dr X stated that the test score in 2021 already indicated that P had moderate cognitive impairment (dementia).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She was of the view that P had no mental capacity in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Dr C, saw P between 17 February 2020 and 23 July 2024. She was as stated in the preceding paragraph, a consultant psychiatrist at a public hospital and the LPA certificate issuer. She had similarly issued a memorandum to support P making the UK LPA previously. She is also the doctor who issued a memorandum for the activation of the LPA on 23 July 2024. Her opinion, on assessment of P for mental capacity prior to the issuance of the LPA, was that P had the required capacity to execute the Singapore LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     A geriatrician, Dr M, had also seen P but her evidence pertained largely to P’s physical health (osteoporosis and hypothyroidism) when she saw P first on 21 February 2022 (after the execution of the LPA). Despite the limited relevance of Dr M’s evidence, I had the benefit of evidence from 3 integrated disciplines, namely neurology, psychiatry and geriatrics to come to the conclusion I did on the frame of mind of P when she executed the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I did not find the evidence of the doctors to be conflicting in any material way. While Dr X took the position that P did not have mental capacity in 2023, she was not able to say that P’s capacity to make the LPA in August 2021 (and reaffirmed on 10 January 2022) was absent. The only doctor who could provide the court with a relevant clinical assessment of P’s state of mental health at the time of the execution of the LPA was Dr C. In fact, when questioned, Dr X informed that she did not perform mental capacity assessments in her practice and more specifically, she did not conduct any for P. She stated that while mental capacity was not present in 2023, she was not able to speak to P’s capacity in 2022 when the LPA was executed and as a neurologist, she would “<em>usually defer to the psychiatrist</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> in this case, Dr C. The question then was whether Dr C had conducted her examination with sufficient rigour. I found that the answer had to be in the affirmative for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Dr C has some 22 years of clinical experience and is currently a senior consultant psychiatrist at a public hospital. P had consulted Dr C over a sufficiently long period of time prior to the assessment conducted for purposes of issuing a LPA, thus enabling a good rapport to be established.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     P was seen 6 times<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> prior to her assessment by Dr C on 2 August 2021.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> It was Dr C’s evidence that the purpose of the meeting on 2 August 2021 was understood by both P and Dr C to be for the purposes of executing a LPA, although she could not remember whether it was P who told her that she was there for that purpose before the assessment commenced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> While the defendant was present, Dr C explained that as a matter of practice, family members and helpers who accompany patients would sit behind the patient and the answers to questions were given directly to Dr C by P. Dr C had reviewed P’s clinical history and background and was privy to the MMSE and MoCA test scores documented by Dr X during visits by P to Dr X’s clinic. Dr C was of the view that there was no need to repeat the tests as these were simplistic tools and would not have changed much from 22 February 2021 when the MoCA score was 17/30. Dr C was of the view, and rightly so in my view, that clinical assessment was of greater significance in determining whether P was in a position to appoint a donee of power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When questioned by the plaintiff’s counsel on why Dr X was of the view that as at 22 February 2021 and based on the MoCA score, P was said to be suffering from “cognitive impairment (dementia)”, Dr C explained that the terms are defined differently:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“Cognitive impairment and dementia are defined differently….so cognitive impairment just means that there are some ---uh, there was a demonstration of ---uh, deficits when somebody is objectively tested as compared to a normal population. However, dementia is defined differently. Dementia is defined as the presence of cognitive impairment that is severe enough to cause difficulties in a person’s activities of daily living. So, the scores would in---on their own, would indicate cognitive impairment. As a doctor, we would need more information that just the cognitive scores in order to determine the presence of dementia and the severity of the dementia”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 2 August 2021, Dr C observed that P was well oriented, articulate and clear in her intentions as it related to appointing the defendant as her donee to manage her affairs in Singapore. Dr C informed that while P could not tell what the date was, she knew the day and had no signs of psychosis or suicidal ideation. More importantly, P could articulate the difference between a LPA, a POA and a will and when these documents would come into effect. She was also able to give an accurate account of her assets in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> There was no suggestion that P, fluent in English and with sound mental capacity, did not read and understand the LPA before signing it and any challenge to this aspect of the process was not supported by the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Given the refusal of the OPG to register the LPA on account of irregularities with the signature of P which Dr C explained as being likely due to “<em>physical decline from progression of Parkinson’s Disease affecting handwriting</em>,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Dr C had met with P on 3 January 2022 and conducted a review again on 10 January 2022 with the same steps taken as before. During the visit on 3 January 2022, Dr C was informed that P had experienced hallucinations sometime in October 2021 and was admitted to a hospital in November 2021 to address the concerns. Equipped with this awareness, Dr C was mindful of the need to check on P’s state during the clinical assessment for purposes of reissuing the LPA certificate. The steps she had taken in her assessment were similar to those undertaken in the July 2021 session<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> and the responses of P as to who she wanted to be her donee and the purpose of a donee were the same. Dr C’s report states that P was “<em>cognitively largely the same as on 2 August 2021</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_f\"></a>(f)     There was no one else who had assessed P at the time the LPA was executed. Dr X who appeared to have suggested that P “likely” did not the mental capacity to manage her affairs as at 22 February 2021, said “<em>I’ll be happy to revise my view. Because I did not do a Mental Capacity Assessment at any point. I was not required to.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Evidence other than that from the medical professionals, support the presence of functional capacity, in particular. There is considerable evidence even as late as December 2021 (after the Singapore LPA of August 2021 was signed by P) pointing to the plaintiff’s desire to activate the UK LPA so that she could deal with the UK properties even though she appears to know that P had not lost her capacity as of that date. The plaintiff wanted bank statements from HSBC in relation to an account P had with the defendant as there were suggestions that money was being withdrawn without P’s authority. In the affidavit of the defendant’s son who in refuting allegations by the plaintiff that he had tampered with P’s mobile phone to prevent communication with the plaintiff, produced a transcript of a conversation the plaintiff had with P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> From the transcript it appears that the plaintiff wanted P to allow for the activation of the UK LPA so that the plaintiff could make necessary enquiries even though she was cognisant of the fact that P had not lost capacity to act for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     A UK based solicitor also provided evidence that all her dealings with P in relation to commercial properties P held in the UK was with P directly. The solicitor made a trip to Singapore on 1 December 2022 and observed that while P was slow in speech, she was alert, could recognise the solicitor, had a healthy appetite and appeared to be well cared for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The plaintiff visited P in Singapore for a brief period between 24 September and 23 October 2019. She shared that P informed her that the defendant was making demands and using monies for her living expenses. Yet the plaintiff felt at that time that they “…<em>would eventually be settled amicably</em>” between P and the defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Neither was any real concern about P’s capacity expressed. Once the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant became tense however, the plaintiff chose to produce messages which she claimed showed that P did not have mental capacity after her return to Singapore. These messages relate to how P felt isolated and at times fearful of the defendant and her son. The plaintiff held on to a belief that P was without mental capacity even though the plaintiff was making such an observation without consistent physical contact with P. Indeed, the ability of P to call the plaintiff and to type coherent messages to the plaintiff complaining of her relationship with the defendant does not signify a lack of functional capacity. It was not disputed that P was in a state of stress and anxiety for which she was referred to Dr C as early as February 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Was fraud/undue pressure exerted by the defendant in the creation/execution of the LPA?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Where there is fraud or undue pressure placed on a donor to induce her to create or execute a LPA, the court may direct that the instrument purporting to create the lasting power of attorney, not be registered or that the LPA be revoked.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> In dealing with the allegation by the plaintiff that fraud and/or undue pressure was exerted by the defendant to execute the Singapore LPA, the plaintiff sought to show that there was intense acrimony between the parties, that the defendant intentionally concealed the relevant family dynamics from the certificate issuer, that the defendant was in sufficient proximity to P during the capacity assessment to exert pressure and that the defendant’s own state of mind at the time showed that P’s execution of the LPA had an ulterior motive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Relying largely on <b><em>ULP</em></b> v <b><em>ULS</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> it was the plaintiff’s position that fraud or undue pressure could be exercised even if P had the mental capacity to execute the LPA. This is not in dispute. The facts of <em>ULP</em> however were, in my view, materially different from the instant case. So too were the facts of <b><em>VKX</em></b> v <b><em>VKW</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> which the plaintiff relies on to stand for the proposition that if Dr C was not aware of the family acrimony and dynamics, or if the mental capacity assessment was done in the presence of the defendant, these individually or collectively, should result in a revocation of the LPA. In <em>ULP</em>, the nature and state of P’s dementia, diagnosed to be “<em>moderate stage dementia of the Alzheimer’s type</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> the exceptionally high level of animosity by the son who secured a LPA, towards his father (P’s spouse) and sisters (P’s daughters), the rage displayed by the son towards his father in particular for the latter’s insistence on his son pursuing medicine at a local university instead of chasing his dream of attending an Ivy League US liberal arts college, several acts of the son done secretly including removing P from her home and his absolute refusal to allow any access to P by other family members, led the court to call for greater scrutiny of the LPA.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> Indeed the acts of the son if viewed collectively, represented conduct so egregious which made the retention of the LPA unsafe and a consideration of plans for the care of P through a deputyship application was considered a more prudent approach. Similarly, in <em>VKX</em>, P’s mental health was not the same as P in the present case. In <em>VKZ</em> there were 2 feuding camps of siblings. A few of the siblings brought an action against one of their brothers who managed to secure a LPA from his mother. Just as was the case in <em>ULP</em> the feud amongst siblings was a long standing one, dating back decades and its roots entrenched. The defendant went “doctor shopping” to secure a report to validate his appointment as a donee. He removed his mother from her own home, sought a LPA to sell her home and created bank accounts in his son’s name to retain monies belonging to P. He intentionally withheld information on medical reports he was privy to from other doctors concerning the mental state of his mother and he reigned personal attacks on anyone who disagreed with him. The effect he had over his mother when present during medical assessments or even in bringing her to the assessment was of concern in the larger context of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In the present case, the plaintiff and defendant were united in their decision for P to return to Singapore and be under the care of the defendant. P and the defendant held properties and bank accounts jointly signifying that not all things had to be done together with the plaintiff. There was clarity in direction and freedom of communication with a <em>WhatsApp</em> group chat to facilitate interaction. There was a unity of purpose and a reliance by P on the defendant, with no initial resistance by the plaintiff. The fact that P wanted to have harmony amongst them was also evident. The relationship soured only more recently over disagreements with the manner in which properties and financial matters of P were dealt with after P’s move to Singapore. There was no historical hatred or animosity as seen in the cases relied on by the plaintiff. Nor was there deep pressure placed on P as was the case by the sons on their mothers in the 2 cases cited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It is certainly important to inform doctors of the fact that there are other family members that may be interested in whether a LPA is issued in favour of another family member. This may likely lead the doctor to exercise even greater care to ensure that no fraud or undue pressure was being placed on P to make a choice. The question remains however as to whether the facts support fraud or undue pressure being placed on P. I was of the view that there was little to support the plaintiff’s view. P was headstrong in her dealings with the UK estate agent on the price she was prepared to sell one of the properties she held jointly with the defendant. She lived in her own apartment in Singapore and was not at the mercy of the defendant for her daily care. Her ability to communicate with the plaintiff allowed her an avenue to signal real distress and pressure if she felt that way. Dr C did not notice any such feelings when she was being assessed. In fact, P who had been seeing Dr C as far back as February 2020 never saw it fit to share about that she had a sister in the UK and the session in February 2020 was one where the defendant was not present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Individuals in any close relationship are at times influenced or even pressured by each other into acting in certain ways. This is why the law calls for evidence of fraud or <em>undue</em> pressure before a LPA can be revoked. The term “fraud” is not defined in the MCA but it is safe to draw from criminal law to look for elements of intentional deception to gain an advantage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The evidence did not support the position that the defendant concealed or represented facts dishonestly so as to compel P to execute the LPA. While fraud was alleged, the plaintiff appeared in fact to be relying largely on the allegation of undue pressure instead. In this regard, the evidence did not point to any excessive or unwarranted pressure. The fact that the defendant was present at the assessment conducted by Dr C can give rise to a suggestion of pressure on P. The evidence of Dr C however was that for mental capacity assessments, it was her practice to seat accompanying family members and caregivers “<em>behind the patient to allow the patient to speak directly to her, without interference</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Dr C was mindful of the need for P to speak freely. At the time P was assessed by Dr C for the purpose of the LPA execution, it was not their first meeting. It bears repeating that previous meetings where P’s family history was taken down and during which time the defendant was not present, would have afforded P the opportunity to share important information which Dr C would likely have addressed, if necessary, when she met P again on 2 August 2021 and 10 January 2022. It also bears repeating that P chose not to reveal the existence of the plaintiff in the UK when she spoke to Dr C as early as 2020. In August 2021 and January 2022, I had no doubt that P was not held back by the defendant in informing about the plaintiff to Dr C, if she had wanted to. The historical evidence shows that she did not think it necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I did not doubt that P would have spoken her mind on things which concerned her when she met Dr C in 2021 and 2022 for purposes of the LPA. In her medical report, Dr C stated that P was calm and coherent during her visit on 2 August 2021 and did not show signs of anxiety or stress.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> To come to a different conclusion would be to reject the clinical assessment and observations of Dr C who appeared to have followed all reasonable steps to ensure that P knew what she was doing in appointing the defendant as her donee. While her physical vulnerabilities and age-related feelings of stress and isolation at times, must be acknowledged, she was not in my view, a victim of fraud nor was she labouring under any excessive force by the defendant to execute the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The interplay between mental impairment and undue pressure which was articulated by the Court in <em>Re BKR</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> would require a look at whether P was susceptible to undue pressure given the frailty of her mind. Given that I had accepted the evidence of Dr C who is the certificate issuer and the only doctor who assessed P at the time the LPA was executed, more specifically, that P was “<em>able to express independent thought without seeking reassurance from her caregiver</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> I was of the view that the degree of mental vulnerability did not occasion any feelings of pressure to the extent that the appointment of the donee ought to be invalidated. It must be borne in mind that the specific query before me was the ability of P to execute a LPA freely at the time it was done and not every document that was executed by P. The exercise of determining whether a will or a POA were properly executed may involve different considerations. The defendant’s counsel had asked the court to make findings with respect to the validity of various other documents and transactions. I made no findings as these issues were not before me and indeed a will is a far more complex document which would necessitate further evaluation of the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Has the defendant failed to act/will she fail to act in the best interests of P?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Any donee of power under a LPA or a deputy appointed by a court, must always act in the best interests of the person that is to be assisted. S 6 of the MCA provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)     <em>In determining for the purposes of this Act what is in a person’s best interest, the person making the determination must not make it merely on the basis of –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>The person’s age or appearance; or</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>A condition of the person, or an aspect of the person’s behaviour which might lead others to make unjustified assumptions about what might be in the person’s best interests.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)     <em>The person making the determination must consider all the relevant circumstances and, in particular, take the steps specified in subsections (3) to (9).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Subsections 7 – 9 are of particular relevance and reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(7)     <em>Where the determination relates to the disposition or settlement of the person’s property, he or she must be motivated by a desire to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the person’s property is preserved for application towards the costs of the person’s maintenance during the person’s life.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(8)     <em>He or she must consider, as far as is reasonably ascertainable –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(a)     <em>the person’s past and present wishes and feelings (and, in particular, any relevant written statement made by the person when the person had capacity;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(b)     <em>the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his or her decision if the person had capacity; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(c)     <em>the other factors that the person would be likely to consider if the person were able to do so.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(9)     <em>He or she must take into account, if it is practicable and appropriate to consult them, the views of –</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(a)     <em>anyone named by the person as someone to be consulted on the matter in question or on matters of that kind;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(b)     <em>anyone engaged in caring for the person or interested in the person’s welfare;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(c)     <em>any one of a lasting power of attorney granted by the person; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(d)     <em>any deputy appointed for the person by the court</em>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>as to what would be in the person’s best interests and in particular as to the matters mentioned in subsection (8).</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The well-cemented relationship between the parties started to show cracks only in early 2021 when the defendant discovered an email thread between the plaintiff and a UK solicitor regarding the 2 UK properties that the defendant held jointly with P. The discussion related to the need to sever what she thought were joint tenancies (as opposed to tenancies in common) so that it was in line with the intentions of P in her UK will. The defendant was alleged to have then restricted the plaintiff’s communication and access to P and acted in a way that compromised the interests of P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In seeking to show that the defendant was not acting or will not act in the best interests of P, the plaintiff pointed to various bank transactions in relation to joint accounts P held with the defendant. She alleged that the defendant was either removing P’s monies away from P’s reach into her own account or utilising P’s monies without proper accounting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> She also sought to show that the sale of various residential properties owned by P solely or commercial properties jointly with the defendant was without P’s agreement and not in P’s best interests. The plaintiff further pointed to the defendant’s failure to pay P’s bills in relation to her properties in the UK. She also pointed to statements made by the defendant to show that the latter threatened to withhold medical treatment for P and that P had not seen Dr C for 2 years after the LPA was executed. She attempted also to show that the defendant’s attempt to restrict the plaintiff’s access to P compromised P’s interests and so too did the execution of the Singapore will of March 2021 which she referred to as a “sham” will and one that was discordant with P’s wishes and interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The various allegations by the plaintiff relating to the mismanagement of P’s assets led the defendant to engage a forensics accountant to look specifically into the management of the 2 joint bank accounts held by P and the defendant (one with HSBC and the other with OCBC), a fixed deposit account held by the defendant (at UOB) and the management of income and expenses relating to the 2 UK properties in the name of P and the defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The accountant’s detailed report did not show any material concerns with respect to the management of P’s assets by the defendant such that it warrants a conclusion that the defendant failed to act in the best interests of P or that she will not act in the best interests of P moving forward as it relates to the administration of P’s affairs in Singapore. This does not mean that each and every transaction cannot be further questioned in an appropriate forum. Simply that for purposes of determining if the defendant had P’s interests at heart, the accountant’s report showed a pattern of the defendant acting to protect her equal share in various assets and one that ensured P’s assets are kept for her needs, consistent with the need to maintain her continued stay in Singapore. The accountant essentially took the position that the monies in the joint accounts used to receive rental incomes from the jointly held UK properties could be attributable equally to P and the defendant. Following from that, payments or transfers from that account into a Singapore account could be treated as equally owned. A significant exception being the property jointly owned by P and her late husband, the sale proceeds of which was recognised by the defendant to be P’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The report drew criticism by the plaintiff who stated that the accountant worked on the information provided by the defendant alone and there was a paucity of documentary evidence to show that certain expenses could be safely said to be P’s expenses. In response, the accountant confirmed that he worked only with the information and documents provided by the defendant and that he was open to providing a supplementary report if the plaintiff wanted to provide him with more information. None was forthcoming. Neither did the plaintiff engage her own expert to scrutinise the report. Much of the information would also be available from the UK where the plaintiff resides. While the burden of accounting for monies belonging to P was rightfully placed on the defendant, the burden cannot be an onerous one calling for perfect responses to quick allegations of mismanagement. The plaintiff had gone so far as to suggest that the accountant himself did not explicitly confirm that he relied on professional and ethical standards in drawing up his report. He had confirmed his professional standing as a chartered accountant licensed to practice in Singapore and by this fact, compelled to abide by professional and ethical standards.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The plaintiff also lodged a rather abrupt request for the court to make an order for the appointment of an “independent expert” when this was not a specific prayer in the originating summons. While s 18 of the MCA allows a court to direct a donee of power to render reports and accounts, it was unclear as to the basis for the plaintiff’s call for an “independent expert”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Several allegations of the plaintiff appears to be made so as to press the defendant to respond to her suspicions as opposed to any evidence that she may have. This was seen for example in her insistence that the defendant had kept P’s HSBC bank tokens from P so as to perform unauthorised transfers. This was so even when P herself had indicated that she misplaced them. The defendant had during her visit to the UK in August 2021 approached the bank to apply for a new one which could only be done with P’s authorisation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The defendant exhibited communication with a bank officer showing that she had tried to obtain a new token to replace the one that was lost and that there was a need for for P to provide the mandate for the issuance, which was later obtained.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In relation to the sale of P’s properties, there is little to support the position that P’s interests were not being served. The process involving the sale of one of the UK properties held jointly with the defendant, saw P actively engaged with estate agent and insisting that it be sold at GBP 1.6 million and not anything less even as the agent pushed for a lower price which was against his own interest insofar as it related to his commission.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> P appeared to be acting independently of the defendant in entering into such a sale. The sale of a property P held with her late husband similarly saw P speaking directly to the estate agent and insisting that it be put up for sale at no less than GBP 1.35 million based on a 2022 valuation. Conversations between the plaintiff and P about discussions that P had with the defendant over the sale of these properties point to the fact that the defendant was not secretly compelling P to enter into property transactions to the detriment of P. There was a desire for all 3 sisters to discuss the plans of P to sell off her properties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The change of the contents of the first Singapore Will in March 2021 and the mental state of P when this was executed were not the subject matters for determination. Regardless, there is evidence that a month prior to the execution of this will, Dr C had seen P and noted that there were no psychiatric issues that P was experiencing. Additionally, P was noted as being able to correct herself when she made mistakes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Notwithstanding, the execution of the will and P’s testamentary capacity remain an open issue. The defendant’s counsel was of the view that I should make a finding on this. I disagree on account of the fact that the matter before me involved the need to look at the nature of a LPA and the situation P was in at the time it was executed, in addressing the plaintiff’s request to revoke the LPA. Documents executed before and after may lend towards this determination but a finding on P’s capacity in the execution of each and every document was not what was sought by the plaintiff. It is an exercise far more involved, requiring an assessment of what P understood to be her assets at the time of the execution of the Singapore will in March 2021 and why she had changed her mind on who her beneficiaries were, including the import of Clause 4. The solicitor who drafted that will would also be someone whose evidence may be helpful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It was well in line with the need to care for P in Singapore that an appointment of a suitable donee based in Singapore be made. The rising tensions between the plaintiff and defendant at a time when P’s cognitive ability was on a downward trajectory made this an understandable need. There was little in evidence to show that P must have wanted to appoint the plaintiff jointly with the defendant to care for her needs and affairs in Singapore simply because there was a joint appointment for the UK LPAs. P had in the past dealt with the defendant to the exclusion of the plaintiff as evidenced by the 2016 First Singapore Will which named the defendant as the sole executor. She also held properties jointly with the defendant and not with the plaintiff. There were also numerous POAs authorising the defendant to deal with the sale and purchase of properties in Singapore for P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The plaintiff’s position that the defendant had in the past threatened to withdraw medical treatment for P and her restricting the plaintiff’s access to P was more in my view, a reflection of the tensions between the parties rather than a desire to prevent the advancement of P’s interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Even though Dr C had not been consulted for the last 2 years after the issuance of the LPA, consultations continued with the neurologist Dr X and the geriatrician Dr M, in 2023 and 2024. There is a consistent position taken by all doctors who were managing her care. By early 2024, P’s condition had progressed such that palliative services were required and no further follow up was necessary with the 3 doctors. Dr C in particular had indicated that as at 2024, no treatments were necessary to treat any psychiatric symptoms or behavioural disturbances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The plaintiff’s position that the defendant and her son were restricting access to P even going to the extent of removing P’s old phone and tampering with other technological devices was not supported by the evidence. There is on the other hand, evidence showing that P managed to contact the plaintiff using P’s new phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> Having said that, the tensions between the parties would make it entirely conceivable that the defendant was not making it easy for the plaintiff to have access to P. I could not conclude that this, if intentional, was targeted at compromising P’s interests even if it would be an ancillary effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The central question for determination was whether P had properly executed an LPA appointing her sister, the defendant, as the sole donee of power to handle her matters in Singapore should P lose her mental capacity to do so. If so, should she be permitted to continue with such appointment given what the plaintiff saw as acts which breached or is likely to breach the defendant’s duty to advance the interests of P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The medical evidence points to P having had the capacity to make the appointment of a donee and she did so freely. The doctor who assessed P at the time the LPA was created/executed had taken all reasonable steps to accurately ascertain the capacity of P. She was aware of mental state tests done by Dr X previously, these tests being tools that provide practitioners with an idea of whether further investigations are necessary. Even as Dr X was doubtful of the capacity of P to execute the LPA, she agreed that she did not conduct a mental state assessment at any point in time and that she can only categorically state that P had no capacity in 2023. Clinical observation and assessment were only done by Dr C and was sufficiently robust for this court to rely on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Even as the plaintiff took the position that P was suffering from cognitive impairment that must have prevented P from executing an LPA that met the requirements of s 5 of the MCA, her own conversations with P even after August 2021 and the words and acts of P especially in dealing with solicitors and estate agents show not just an ability to make an appointment, but the absence of any fraud or undue pressure from the defendant in the creation of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The holding of properties jointly with the defendant, the appointment of the defendant as the sole executor of the 2016 first Singapore Will (which the plaintiff herself acknowledged was understandable given that the defendant was the only one residing in Singapore),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> the execution of POAs for the defendant to deal with the sale and purchase of the Jurong and Queenstown properties, respectively, the united understanding of the plaintiff and defendant in better times, for the defendant to care for P while she was in Singapore point collectively to the need to preserve the autonomy of P in her choice of the defendant as the donee of power. As s 3(4) of the MCA provides, respect must be had for choices made even if it is felt that P made an unwise decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The larger question was whether P’s best interests were compromised by the defendant necessitating a revocation of the LPA. The accountant’s report showed that P’s interests were not compromised such that the LPA would need to be revoked. Clearly proper accounts would need to be maintained by the defendant and she remains accountable for P’s monies, the proceeds from the sale of P’s properties and for the personal welfare of P - an obligation that has been activated and which will continue unless revoked or upon P’s passing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     A fear of losing financial entitlements is often found behind arguments that appear to be advancing the interests of mentally incapacitated individuals. Such arguments are veils. It would help parties to address these fears more directly and resolve differences between themselves, so as to mend the fracture in their relationship that has only recently surfaced.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 30 of the defendant’s affidavit of 5/9/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The are 2 brothers in the family, one of whom has passed on.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>There were 2 separate LPAs, one addressing personal welfare and the other, property/affairs.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 12 of the plaintiff’s affidavit of 29/5/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Clause 4 of the 8/3/2021 (Singapore Will).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 48 of the defendant’s affidavit of 5/9/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>As P was the joint owner of a property with her late husband, this too came to be held in her sole name upon his passing in addition to properties she already held solely in her name.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of the defendant’s affidavit of 18/11/2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>S 3(2) of the Mental Capacity Act.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Ibid. s 3(3).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup><em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1257.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1257</a> (HC); <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17722-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 81</a> (CA).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Page 24 of Dr X’s affidavit dated 18/2/2025 and page 84 of Dr C’s affidavit of 4/3/2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Tanner, C.M. &amp; Ostrem, J.L.

class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">26 November 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was an ancillary matters hearing where orders were made at the conclusion of hearing on custody, care and control, division of assets and maintenance. The Mother, being dissatisfied with the outcome, has appealed against the entirety of my decision. I had provided brief grounds at the conclusion of the hearing. I provide my full grounds herewith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother filed for divorce on 28 November 2023. Through the course of the proceedings, she had failed to comply with court directions and absented herself from hearing and mediation sessions on multiple occasions. This led to the present ancillary matters being heard some 21 months after the divorce was filed on 13 August 2025. In the midst of the proceedings, the Mother also filed an application under s 69 of the Women’s Charter for a lump sum maintenance of $2,580,000 for herself and her children on 3 December 2024. As interim maintenance had already been awarded, I directed that this maintenance application be heard together with these ancillary proceedings, which were originally scheduled to proceed by March 2025. It bears noting that this was not the first maintenance application made by the Mother – an earlier maintenance summons (MSS XXX/2024) filed on 3 May 2024 was dismissed on 4 December 2024 due to her failure to attend the hearing on more than one occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       By way of context, there were also various allegations of family violence and harassment traded in the course of the proceedings. The Mother first filed SS XXX/2023 on 8 December 2023 seeking a personal protection order for verbal abuse by the Father. The matter proceeded to trial but was dismissed, with the Mother being noticeably absent when the Court delivered its decision. The Mother then filed a further application for a personal protection order in SS XXX/2024 on 13 May 2024, on behalf of herself and her children, for alleged family violence on the part of the Father. This was struck off at first mentions due to the Mother’s absence from the proceedings. The Father himself filed for a personal protection order on 19 July 2024 in SS XXX/2024 alleging that the Mother had struck him on his neck and head. A personal protection order was eventually issued in the Father’s favour, and parties were ordered to attend mandatory counselling at FAM@FSC. There was also a protection from harassment suit filed by the Father in PHC XXX/2024, involving allegations of verbal harassment by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Given the complexity of the matter and the high level of acrimony between the parties, the case was docketed before myself from February 2025 onwards, to handle the remaining ancillary and maintenance applications as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       This matter concerns a 19-year marriage. The Plaintiff (“Mother”) and the Defendant (“Father”) were married on 31 May 2004. Although the Mother filed for divorce on 28 November 2023, her Statement of Claim was eventually struck out on 15 October 2024 as she had failed to file her Reply and Defence to Counterclaim despite being granted two extensions of time. Interim judgment was accordingly granted one year later on 29 November 2024, on the facts stated in the Father’s Counterclaim. Since then, the matter has been further delayed because of the Mother’s refusal to file her Affidavit of Assets and Means, as well as to comply with discovery obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Both parties are 47 years old. The Father works as a Director of Business Development at a pharmaceuticals company. The Mother is a Non-Executive Director at a family-owned manufacturing company situated in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are two children to the marriage, R and T. R is male, aged 14 years, and T is female, aged 10 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Prior to 26 May 2025, parties resided together at a rented apartment in Chancery Court. The lease for that property terminated on 26 May 2025. The Father and children then stayed together at another rented property at Belmond Green, while the Mother initially resided at guest rooms at the Tanglin Club, before renting an apartment at Stevens Road.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The parties own a matrimonial property as joint tenants (“the Proximo apartment”). This was tenanted out under a 24 month tenancy, which was due to expire on 16 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parties filed two Affidavits of Assets and Means each. The Father also sought to refer to affidavits filed in the discovery process, his pleadings, as well as related affidavits in the family violence, harassment and maintenance applications, and affidavits filed by the Mother’s former solicitors in their discharge application.

be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There was no agreement reached on any aspect of the ancillary matters. Accordingly, it fell to the court to determine:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The custody, care and control of R and T;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The division of matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Spousal maintenance for the Mother and maintenance for both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children’s Issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties’ Positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother in her affidavit of assets and means asked for full custody, care and control for both children, on account of her track record in caring and raising them since birth. In the alternative, she sought shared care and control, with the children to spend four days with her and three days with the Father each week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father’s position was to request for full custody, care and control of both children. This request was premised on the Mother’s deteriorating emotional and psychological state over the course of proceedings, which the Father argued had manifested in erratic and volatile behaviour towards himself and the children, the Mother’s former legal team, the Father’s own legal team, and even to the Court itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In his pleadings, the Father detailed numerous incidents reflecting the Mother’s decline in mental stability. It was pointed out that throughout the marriage, the Mother had experienced sudden mood swings and personality shifts, which escalated to signs of mental instability some time in 2019. According to the Father, the Mother began isolating herself from friends and extended family and compelled the Father to do the same. She was also alleged to exhibit violent behaviour, which involved digging her fingernails into his hand and using profanity in conversations and texts directed at him, including calling him derogatory remarks such as “a sociopath”, “a eunuch”, “a fool” and “a piece of faeces”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father also detailed episodes of verbal aggression, emotional instability, irrational accusations, and unpredictable behaviour on the part of the Mother, that have directly impacted the children, the Husband, and extended family members. Several incidents were witnessed by the Mother’s own parents, close family friends, and police officers who responded to multiple non-emergency calls made by the Mother. The Father also pointed out that the Mother compulsively overspent on the children’s extra-curricular activities, depleting her own savings in the process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father specifically highlighted an incident on 15 July 2024, which was the subject of his application for a protection order in SS XXX/2024, when the Mother physically assaulted him while he was tending to their unwell daughter. This assault occurred in the children’s presence, and involved strikes to his face, head, neck and arms. The injuries were supported by medical evidence, and the Court accordingly granted him a personal protection order on 27 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father also pointed out the manner in which the Mother’s former solicitors, Dentons Rodyk &amp; Davidson LLP, applied to discharge themselves following a breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship. In their Discharge Affidavit dated 11 September 2024, the Mother’s lawyers averred that there was a “serious loss of confidence” between the parties. According to her former solicitors, the Mother had repeatedly questioned the firm’s competence and integrity, and accused them of siding with the Father, for example, stating that they were “<em>pandering to [Clifford Law’s] every request</em>” and “<em>constantly sid[ing] with the other party</em>.” Her former solicitors also pointed out that she refused to provide instructions for the filing of pleadings and affidavits despite multiple follow-ups, and ultimately refused to attend the court-scheduled trial on 5 September 2024 in PHC XXX/2024. The firm was granted an Order of Court for discharge on 15 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On account of her erratic behaviour, the Father argued that the Mother displayed a disturbing inability to manage her own affairs. In his view, her ongoing refusal to seek medical help raises grave concerns as to her ability to provide a stable, secure, and emotionally safe environment for the children. Accordingly, the Father sought sole custody, care and control of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     With regard to access, the Father’s position was that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Mother was to have access once a week on Friday evening from 5 pm to 8 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With regard to school holidays, the Father proposed that there be no access for a period of six to 12 months from the determination of the ancillary matters, and that there be limited access thereafter in the following manner, subject to the Mother undergoing medical treatment and being found to be of sound mind:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Two days (9 am to 5 pm only) during the one week March holidays</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       One week (9 am to 5 pm only) during the four week June holidays</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Two days (9 am to 5 pm only) during the one week September holidays; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       One week (9 am to 5 pm only) during the six week November-December holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There be no overseas travel without the Father’s consent and the children’s agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Court’s Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Section 124 of the Women’s Charter 1961 provides that in making orders relating to the custody, care and control and access to a child, the court should take into account the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration. In making this assessment, the Court of Appeal in <em>CX v CY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a> has given guidance that the court generally leans in favour of joint parenting, at [26]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">There can be no doubt that the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The needs of a child do not change simply because his parents no longer live together. Thus, in any custody proceedings, it is crucial that the courts recognise and promote joint parenting so that both parents can continue to have a direct involvement in the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     While joint custody is generally the preferred arrangement, I agreed with Counsel for the Father that there are circumstances where sole custody may be warranted, particularly where the conduct or condition of the other parent compromises the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In this particular case, having been docketed to this matter and seen parties for more than half a year, I have witnessed unusual, disturbing, erratic and offensive behaviour from the Mother both in court and in her correspondence to the court. Despite countless warnings not to write in administratively on matters before the court, to desist from copying external parties in contravention to s 10 of the Family Justice Act 2014, as well as to ensure that the other party is copied in correspondence addressed to the court as required under the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions 2014 (paragraph 168(2)), the Mother has repeatedly and flagrantly persisted in writing to court in breach of these directions. Her repeated practice of copying emails to her relatives and even her discharged solicitors is particularly egregious, as it undermines a fundamental tenant of family proceedings, which under s 10(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 should be held in private by default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother’s conduct in court has also been decidedly rude and contemptuous at various points in the proceedings. She constantly disparages the Father for being incompetent and inferior to her in intelligence and education. Her behaviour went beyond the pale at a discovery hearing on 18 June 2025, where she made derogatory comments about the caste of Father’s counsel, suggesting to the court that counsel carried no credibility because she belonged to a caste which had assassinated a previous prime minister of India. Even after being sternly warned by the court that such views had no place in Singapore, much less in a court of law, the Mother persisted in making such derogatory comments, and did not withdraw them on pain of contempt. The Court eventually did not proceed with contempt proceedings only because the Father’s counsel charitably shrugged off these comments, and expressed her preference to expedite matters rather than to cause delay with a separate set of contempt proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother’s behaviour in court is also consistent with various police reports filed by the Father, as well as affidavit evidence provided by the Father and the Mother’s father and brother, in addition to audio evidence tendered by the Father, of various disturbances and altercations caused by the Mother while she was living with the family in the Chancery Court premises, as well as her rude and disparaging treatment of the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Having considered the evidence in totality, I accepted that there was ample evidence in this case to suggest that the Mother would not be fit in her present state of mind to exercise joint custody over the children. She has repeatedly demonstrated behaviour that is contemptuous, rude, and most inexplicably, contrary to her own interest in the proceedings. One particularly perplexing episode involved the Mother’s repeated refusal to file her Affidavits of Assets and Means, even though it was she who had initiated divorce proceedings as the plaintiff. The court’s initial direction was for the First Affidavit of Assets and Means to be filed and exchanged by 24 January 2025. This was later extended multiple times to 7 March, 13 March, 17 March and 28 March 2025, with the final deadline accompanied by an unless order, i.e. that if the Mother failed to so file, the court would take it that she is not submitting any affidavit evidence in the ancillary proceedings. Despite these directions, by the time of a case conference held on 15 April 2025, the Mother’s ancillary affidavit had still not been properly commissioned and filed. The Mother’s explanation for her non-compliance was that she was impecunious and did not have the money to travel down to the courthouse and the CrimsonLogic Service Bureau for the purpose of commissioning and filing her affidavit. To prevent any further delay, the Court made a special arrangement for a court commissioner to be present at the case conference to commission the Mother’s affidavit on the spot, to ensure that the document was properly filed and the ancillary matter could proceed. Had the Court not granted the Mother such exceptional latitude, she would have had no evidence at all to rely on in these ancillary proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     It was thus with great consternation that the Court discovered, with the revelation at the ancillary hearing of the Mother’s spending habits at the Tanglin Club after her departure from the family home on 26 May 2025, that the Mother had racked up bills amounting to $12,937.32 in the month of July 2025 and was able to make payment of $7,000 towards this expenditure (see P1). The Mother’s alleged impecuniosity was thus totally fictitious, and it was apparent that she had intentionally breached court directions and an unless order over the course of January to April 2025 by withholding the filing of her Affidavit of Assets and Means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother has further displayed her erratic and contemptuous behaviour by refusing to provide even basic discovery despite being ordered to do so. This has persisted even at the present hearing where she preferred to disregard her CPF contributions to the property rather than share her CPF statement with the Father’s counsel. Mindful that the Mother was a litigant in person, much effort was taken to explain her obligations in discovery and the implication of withholding such evidence from the Court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That the Mother flagrantly refused to access her CPF statement despite repeated exhortations is clear evidence of her dysregulated behaviour and flawed decision-making process, which in turn raises serious questions about her ability to make considered decisions for the welfare of the children. While there is no medical diagnosis of the Mother’s mental state available (as the court does not have the power to compel a party to seek medical treatment in divorce proceedings), the Court must act in the best interest of the children to ensure that a parent exercising access is in the correct frame of mind to make the right decisions in regard to their care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this regard, I note that in other cases where a parent displayed a mental health condition or erratic behaviour that belies an impaired ability to make decisions in the child’s best interests, the courts have taken on board such considerations in granting sole custody to the other parent. In <em>AVM v AWH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17698-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 194</a>, the High Court granted the wife sole custody of the children because the husband’s behaviour demonstrated that he had a poor ability to make decisions for his own welfare. His conviction for possession and consumption of illegal drugs, his promiscuous lifestyle, and the circumstances by which he contracted HIV had shown a reckless failure to exercise personal responsibility, which in turn justified the grant of sole custody to his wife. In <em>ACU v ACR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0322.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 322</a>, the court accepted that the wife’s reactive depression and her threats to threats to commit suicide would have been relevant to considering the grant of care and control to the other parent (at [46]). On the facts of the case, this was not necessary as the medial report suggested that her reactive depression was temporary and did not inhibit her care of the children. The point remains though that where a parent is demonstrably unfit to make decisions in the best interest and welfare of the children, sole custody and care and control can be granted to the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I considered the present case to be an exceptional one where joint custody would not be appropriate, given the Mother’s behaviour in court and multiple incidents and altercations at the family residence. I was of the firm view that the interest and welfare of the children would be best served by giving the Father sole custody in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Turning to care and control, I note that the Father had been the primary caregiver in recent times with the Mother’s increasingly erratic behaviour, and had taken an active role in their upbringing, including the management of their schooling, the handling of their daily routines and seeing to their physical and emotional well-being. In particular, the children have resided with the Father since the parties’ separation and share a close, stable relationship with him. The Father is also assisted by a domestic helper, whom the children have adapted well to living with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In contrast, I note that even prior to the separation, the Mother had begun to withdraw from the family and isolated herself in the bedroom. She did not cook or clean for the family, chain-smoked incessantly, and lived on coffee and peanuts. The children have also complained about the cigarette smoke in the house when they were living together with their mother, which caused them to be uncomfortable with her breath.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I also note that the children have expressed their wishes to live with their father and not their mother. In particular, I note that R had complained to the Father that the Mother had exposed herself in front of him and that he was shocked and embarrassed by this incident. This was expressed in an email by R to the Father dated 13 July 2024, which read as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">After my shower, I went into my sisters room to say hello to her, mama then walked in and asked if her bum looked good, then proceeded to lift her dress up and show us her bum. I was thoroughly disgusted and asked her to stop as I walked away. In the master bedroom, I was putting cream on my arms when mama walked in and asked if her breasts looked good, and lifted her dress up and showed me her breasts; without any bra on. It was truly an uncomfortable experience that I wish would never happen to anyone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I have further noted the express wishes articulated by the elder child against the Mother being granted custody, although I do note that the preferences of minor children are not necessarily a conclusive factor in the determination of what is in their best interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Taking the evidence in totality, I was satisfied that the Mother’s behaviour suggested that she did not have the ability to provide appropriate care for the children on a day-to-day basis. The children had been effectively estranged from her by her erratic behaviour, and she had not participated actively in their daily care since the onset of her mood swings and extreme behaviour. I therefore agreed with the Father’s position that he should have sole care and control of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     With regard to access, as a starting point, I agreed with the Father that access could be granted to the Mother on Friday evenings for three hours from 5 pm to 8 pm. This arrangement ensures that the school week is uninterrupted, and also facilitates the Mother in arranging for full-time employment post-divorce. Going forward, a greater scope of access would be granted to the Mother if (1) the Mother attends at the IMH for a detailed assessment by a psychiatrist on her mental state of health, and attend any follow-up treatment or take any such medication that the doctor deems necessary, and (2) the doctor provides a full medical report that shows the Mother to be free from any mental condition that may impair her ability to care for the children. Should these conditions be satisfied, an expanded scope of access can be granted to the Mother as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Additional weekend meal access over three hours every week, at a time to be agreed between the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     School holiday access in the format as proposed by the Father (in paragraph 19(b)(i)-(iv) above); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Three hours of access to the children by the Mother on each public holiday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     At a later date, should the Mother complete her consultation and her situation stabilises, parties may mutually agree to a greater degree of access, or may file the necessary variation application should they be unable to do so amicably. I would add that the passage of time alone may not be sufficient to constitute a material change of circumstances – one would need to see that the Mother has taken concrete steps to improve her mental and psychological state of mind before there can be a step up of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father’s position at the ancillary hearing was that this was primarily a single income marriage of moderate duration. The Father noted that in <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a>, the Court of Appeal had observed that while long single-income marriages justified an equal division of matrimonial assets, “moderate-length marriages” (of approximately 15-18 years) would justify awarding the non-income earning spouse approximately 35% to 40% of the matrimonial pool (at [113]). Accordingly, the Father submitted that a 60:40 division in his favour would be an equitable division under the <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20026-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 15</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) approach for single income marriages. To effect this division, the Father was prepared to pay the Mother 40% of the market value of the matrimonial home less the respective CPF contributions, with fees for the transfer, including all administrative fees and legal costs, to be borne equally between the parties. The Father was also willing to buy over her Tanglin Club Membership at the current market value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     At the outset, I did not consider this to be a single-income marriage to be determined in accordance with <em>TNL</em>, as both parties had worked and contributed to the household for substantial parts of the marriage. In particular, the Mother had worked in senior roles as an investment banker prior to 2014 and contributed to the household income in the earlier half of the marriage. Accordingly, the structured approach for a dual income marriage as established in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a> should apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     This approach involves the following steps:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Determine the total matrimonial pool in accordance with s 112 of the Women’s Charter (1961) by aggregating the jointly held matrimonial assets, as well as assets held in each party’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Determine the parties’ direct financial contributions towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Express as a second ratio the parties’ indirect contributions to the well-being of the family, considering both financial and non-financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Derive the parties’ overall contributions by averaging the two ratios, with possible adjustments based on the circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Apply the ratio to effect a division of the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Matrimonial Pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     There was little dispute over what constituted the matrimonial pool, save for a Mumbai property which the Mother had declared (at the hearing) to be purchased pre-marriage. I accepted that premise and excluded that property from the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As the Mother did not provide any evidence of other assets or the valuation of her Tanglin Club membership, I accepted the Father’s valuation that the latter would be worth at least $100,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Accordingly, the matrimonial pool, based on the available evidence provided by the Father, would comprise the following:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"

I accepted that the Mother had made significant contributions in the earlier years of the marriage towards the parties’ finances, and had also been the primary caregiver until recent years when the relationship worsened and the Father took over this role. Accordingly, I was prepared to give the Mother a greater weightage of 60:40 for her indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Overall Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I saw no reason to give greater weightage to either ratio for direct or indirect contributions. Averaging the two ratios, the overall percentage of the Father’s contributions would be 60.1% (average of 80.2% and 40%), while the overall percentage of the Mother’s contributions would be 39.9% (average of 19.8% and 60%).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adverse Inference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father submitted that the Court should draw an adverse inference against the Mother for her failure to comply with the Discovery Order made against her, and also for completely disregarding her disclosure obligations her Affidavits of Assets and Means. The Father noted that despite directions from the Court, the Mother had not provided any documents or explanation regarding her financial position or contributions to the matrimonial assets, save for attaching a copy of her membership cards at the Tanglin Club and the Singapore Cricket Club (which were not helpful to even estimate the value of such assets). The Father submitted that the Mother’s refusal to provide supporting documentation has rendered any evaluation of her contributions to the matrimonial pool to be virtually impossible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I accepted the Father’s arguments that the Mother was in contumelious breach of her discovery obligations. She had failed to provide even the most basic of documents relating to her income tax, CPF, bank account statements and investments in her Affidavits of Assets and Means. Neither had she provided any evidence aside from bare assertions on her direct and indirect contributions towards the matrimonial pool. Further, despite a contested summons for discovery filed by the Father (in FC/SUM 1167/2025), which was eventually granted in the whole save with regard to the Mumbai property, the Mother’s compliance affidavit was completely devoid of the required financial documents, and failed to explain whether such documents were in her power, possession or control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It was also amply clear during the ancillary hearing itself that there was a property which the Mother jointly owned with her mother, but had failed to declare in her Affidavit of Assets and Means.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The fact that the Mother could make payment in the sum of $7,000 towards her Tanglin Club bill in July 2025, and could afford her rental for her current apartment at Stevens Road, further suggests that the Mother has a bank account or some other asset which she is drawing upon for her daily needs, which she has failed to declare for the purposes of the ancillary proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     As noted above, I also found that the Mother’s excuses for non-compliance simply did not hold water. Her claim that she was homeless and impecunious after the termination of the lease of the Chancery Court apartment flies in the face of the expenditure racked up during her stay at the guest rooms Tanglin Club after moving out from the family residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I note that in <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16823-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 2</a>, the Court of Appeal held that an adverse inference may be drawn where a party has failed to make full and frank disclosure, especially when such non-disclosure hampers the just and equitable division of matrimonial assets under section 112 of the Women’s Charter. In <em>CHT v CHU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25844-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGCA 38</a>, the Court of Appeal further held at [6] that where an adverse inference is drawn, the Court has the power to give effect to an adverse inference by either including what it finds to be the value of undisclosed assets in the matrimonial pool (the valuation approach); or by ordering that the other party receives an uplift on his/her share of the known assets (the uplift approach).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Under the present circumstances, the Father submitted that the Mother’s conduct justified the drawing of an adverse inference in the most serious terms, as it deprived the Court of the ability to properly assess the Mother’s true financial circumstances. The Father submitted that the most appropriate course would be for the Court to adopt the uplift approach and grant him an uplift of 10%. The Father also submitted that the Court in inferring that the Mother is withholding information regarding matrimonial assets in her possession, should treat her alleged entitlements conservatively when determining division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I agreed with the Father that the Mother’s breaches of her discovery obligations effectively prevented the Court from conducting a proper inquiry into the equitable distribution of matrimonial assets. The valuation approach would not even be applicable in this case as the Mother’s true asset pool is a complete black hole and there are no known assets to which a value can be effectively tagged. Accordingly, an uplift would be appropriate to penalise the Mother for her failure to disclose matrimonial assets in her possession, and also reflect that she may be concealing other matrimonial assets. In the circumstances, I granted an uplift of 8% to the overall ratio in favour of the Father, mindful that this would correspondingly reduce the Mother’s ratio by 8%, resulting in a final ratio of division of 68.1 : 31.9 as between the Father and the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders on Division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Given that the Mother had deliberately withheld her CPF statement from the Court, as well as the real possibility that she had failed to declare other substantial assets in her name, I considered it would be more equitable to apply the ratio of division to the matrimonial home only, and to allow the parties to retain the other assets in their possession. To do otherwise would be to grant the Mother a share of the assets declared by the Father that were held in his sole name, in particular, the substantial amount of $334,713.62 in his CPF Account, without any corresponding consideration to him from her own undeclared asset pool. I consider this to be manifestly unjust. Under such unusual circumstances where there has been a clear and complete dereliction of the Mother’s obligations in discovery, I decided that it would be more equitable to apply the <em>ANJ</em> ratio for division to the matrimonial property alone, and to allow the Father to retain other assets held in his own name. I also do note in this regard that there was a jointly owned asset in the form of a Land Rover, registered on 19 August 2016, with presumedly one year left to its certificate of entitlement. The net value of the car was determined to be $23,178.52 as at the date of the filing of the Father’s first ancillary affidavit (i.e. 15 April 2025), and would have depreciated further by the time of the hearing on 13 August 2025. As such, I considered this asset to be <em>de minimis</em> and disregarded it for the purposes of the division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As the net value of the matrimonial home has been established to be <b>$2,332,396.14</b>, the Father’s share at 68.1% would be <b>$1,586,029.38</b>, while the Mother’s share would be <b>$746,366.76</b>. As the Father wishes for the matrimonial home to be transferred to his sole name, he would have to transfer the Mother a sum of money that fairly represented her share of the asset. Given the Mother’s complete failure to provide discovery, I considered that her retention of the Tanglin Club Membership (the value of which is estimated to be $100,000) should be deducted from her share of $746,366.76 of the value of the matrimonial home. Accordingly, the division of assets would be effected by having the matrimonial home transferred to the Father’s sole name upon his payment of the sum of <b>$646,366.76</b> to the Mother. I would add that parties should bear all administrative and legal fees equally, and the transfer shall take place within six months. The usual Registrar’s Empowerment Clause is to be included in the terms of judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     By way of footnote, I would point out an errata in my brief grounds which reflected the Father’s share of the matrimonial home to be <b>$1,593,493.04</b>. This was a calculation error and the correct sum should be <b>$1,586,029.38</b> as reflected above. In any case, this did not affect the final order, as the amount that the Father had to transfer the Mother to reflect her share of the matrimonial home was computed based on the value of the Mother’s share, which was correctly reflected in the brief grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Recovery of Rental and Loan Repayment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As the Mother had moved out of the rented home from 27 May 2025 after the expiration of the lease, the Father should account for her share of the rental proceeds of the matrimonial home from that point until the end of the tenancy on 11 October 2025, covering a period of about 4⅓ months. This amounts to the sum of $12,458.32, which should be payable as a lump sum at the end of the tenancy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     However, I note that the Father had paid off the Mother’s Education Loan with OCBC Bank <em>after</em> the interim judgment date of 29 November 2024. While the Mother claimed that this sum should be borne by him as <em>quid pro quo</em> for her earlier payment for his MBA degree during the marriage, I did not agree and considered her contribution in this regard to be reflected as part of her indirect contributions made throughout the course of the marriage. Once the interim judgment was granted, liabilities should lie where they fall and insofar as the Father had paid up in full for a sum of $16,800 for which both parties were jointly and severally liable, I would allow him to recover half that amount (i.e. $8,400) by netting this sum off from the rental proceeds of $12,458.32 owed to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In short, the Father is to pay the net sum of $4,058.32 to the Mother by 11 October 2025 (the date of the expiry of the lease on the matrimonial home). I would also allow the Father to deduct from that sum any outstanding cost orders that remain unpaid by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Spousal and Child Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Mother sought spousal maintenance in the sum of $10,000 a month, or a lump sum payment of $2,000,000 in her maintenance application (MSS XXX/2024). I note in this regard that the Father’s monthly income is about $18,000, and his offer was to pay her $1,000 a month for a maximum period of 12 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     It is axiomatic that while the overarching principle embodied in spousal maintenance under s 114(2) of the Women’s Charter is financial preservation, i.e. the wife should be maintained at a standard that is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage, the award of maintenance for a <em>former </em>wife should also take into account the fact that she should regain self-sufficiency and not assume life-long dependency on her former husband (see <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> at [31]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I agree with the Father’s position that the Mother should find gainful employment within 12 months, given her stated views on her capability and high earning power. By her own account, the Mother is highly educated, possessing a master’s degree, and had previously worked at a directorial position in a bank where she was paid $30,000 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As to the quantum of spousal maintenance, a proper analysis is made difficult by the Mother’s failure to itemise her expenses as well as any passive income from existing assets. As interim maintenance was provided in the sum of $500 in addition to the payment of her regular bills at the Tanglin Club, I would direct that a higher spousal maintenance of $1,200 should be provided to the Mother for the period of 12 months or until she finds gainful employment, whichever is earlier. I considered the Mother’s requested sum of $10,000 per month (or a lump sum of $2,000,000) to be completely disproportionate to the Father’s income of $18,000. It also disregards the fact that he will be paying for the upkeep of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     As for child maintenance, the Father has set out the children’s monthly expenses, which amount to $500 for R and $1,428.67 for T. Thus far, the Father has been solely responsible for all the children’s expenses since 2014, when the Mother resigned from her full-time employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Father’s position on child maintenance is that the Mother should contribute $1,000 per month towards the children’s maintenance upon securing employment, or after a period of 12 months, whichever is earlier. The Mother’s position, as found in her MSS application, was that each child should be paid a lump sum maintenance of $290,000. This position is superseded as the Mother will not be receiving care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     While it is a well-established principle that both parents have a joint and equal duty to maintain their children, and that the Mother should therefore contribute towards their upkeep by the Father once she achieves gainful employment, I am mindful of her present mental state, and would be cautious about imposing any requirement for her to pay maintenance at this stage. We would need to see the nature of her employment and her income level to properly ascertain the appropriate sum of her contribution towards child maintenance. This will have to be applied for at a later stage once she finds employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders for MSS XXX/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     As maintenance issues have been resolved globally in the ancillary matters, I make no orders with regard to MSS XXX/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Coda on the Mother’s Mental Capacity to Conduct Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Following the ancillary hearing, and after the orders made were extracted on 21 August 2025, the Mother filed her appeal on 26 August 2025, and appointed fresh counsel to make further arguments by way of letter on 2 September 2025. The further arguments related to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Procedural Fairness</b>: Given the Court’s expressed concerns about the Mother’s mental state, and that she had conducted the proceedings without the appointment of a court friend or the benefit of independent psychiatric evidence, Counsel for the Mother requested for the ancillary matters to be addressed properly now that legal representation was secured.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Custody and Access:</b> The access order on Fridays 5-8 pm was unworkable due to the children having enrichment classes during that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Direct Contributions disregarded and uplift for adverse inference:</b> The Mother’s claimed direct contributions of $200,000 downpayment toward the matrimonial property and undisclosed CPF payments were excluded as they were not presented in affidavit form, and an uplift was applied for adverse inference. Now that the Mother has family support and legal representation, the Court was requested to reconsider how these contributions could be dealt with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Mother’s new solicitors expressed that the appeal was filed merely to preserve the Mother’s rights, and invited the court to grant a short audience to address the Court properly on the above matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     By way of a reply dated 8 September 2025, the Court declined to accept further arguments in the matter as the time for appeal had lapsed. It was clear to my mind that the Court was <em>functus officio</em> as final orders had already been extracted on 21 August 2025. In the response, it was also stated that “a perusal of the record of proceedings will show that the plaintiff was able to fully comprehend the proceedings and articulate her arguments for the case.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Nevertheless, as the issue of the Mother’s mental capacity to conduct proceedings is likely to feature in the appeal, I take the opportunity to elaborate on my observations as to the Mother’s mental capacity to conduct proceedings on her own behalf in this ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     At the outset, I would point out that it is possible for a person suffering from a mental health condition to have the mental capacity to litigate, even her mental state renders her unfit to exercise custody and have care and control over the children. The two issues involve fundamentally different inquiries. The former is concerned with a person’s ability to understand and follow the proceedings, and articulate his or her own views and responses. The proclivity of a party to make unsound judgment calls or bad decisions in the court process do not concern the court, so long as the party’s cognitive and reasoning abilities are intact. However, in assessing whether a party is fit to exercise custody, care and control over a child, the ability to make sound and cogent decisions in the best interest and welfare of the child is paramount. In this regard, a parent with sufficient cognitive skills to comprehend the conduct of litigation may in the same breath be considered incapable of exercising sound judgment in the care of a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevant Legal Principles on Mental Capacity to Litigate </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The starting point when addressing mental capacity of a litigant is Rule 656 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as applicable to the present case), which states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>656.</b>—(1)    A person under disability may not bring, make a claim in, defend, make a counterclaim in, or intervene in any proceedings, or appear in any proceedings under a judgment or an order notice of which has been served on him, except by his litigation representative<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(2)    Subject to these Rules —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>a</em>)    anything which in the ordinary conduct of any proceedings is required by a provision of these Rules to be done by a party to the proceedings must, if the party is a person under disability, be done by his litigation representative<sup>3</sup>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(<em>b</em>)    anything which in the ordinary conduct of any proceedings is authorised by a provision of these Rules to be done by a party to the proceedings may, if the party is a person under disability, be done by his litigation representative<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(3)    A litigation representative of a person under disability must act by a solicitor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Under Rule 654, a “person under disability” is defined as a person who is a minor or who is “a person lacking capacity”. The latter is in turn defined to mean “a person who lacks capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act in relation to matters concerning his property and affairs”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The test for mental capacity is set out in s. 4(1) of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (“MCA”), which reads,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“For the purposes of this Act, a person lacks capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time the person is <b>unable to make a decision for himself or herself in relation to the matter</b> because of an <b>impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain</b>.” (<b>emphasis added</b>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     The test under s 4(1) of the MCA consists of a Functional Component and Clinical Component. The Functional Component relates to a patient or party being “unable to make a decision for himself”, while the Clinical Component relates to whether this inability stems from an impairment of the mind. The Functional Component is a matter for the Court to decide based on the evidence as to the degree that P’s mental functioning is compromised, while the Clinical Component is addressed with the assistance of medical expert evidence, per [134] of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1257.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1257</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The definition of what constitutes inability to make a decision is further provided in s. 5(1) of the MCA as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.—(1)    For the purposes of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself if the person is unable —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    to understand the information relevant to the decision;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    to retain that information;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>c</em>)    to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>d</em>)    to communicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any other means).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Two observations are apposite at this point. First, the presence of a mental health condition does not automatically mean that a person lacks capacity. It must be shown that he or she was unable to make a specific decision at the material time, because of the mental health condition. For example, in <em>Re GAV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0125.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 125</a>, it was held that P had the mental capacity to make decisions for himself even though he suffered from schizophrenia. At [11], the court held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While it was clear from the medical evidence that P suffered from schizophrenia, some schizophrenia patients can, with treatment, lead relatively normal lives. As such, <b>the existence of a diagnosis of schizophrenia did not in itself mean that P must automatically be determined to lack capacity</b>.” (<b>emphasis added</b>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Second, it is specifically provided in s 3(4) of the MCA that “(a) person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because the person makes an unwise decision”. The focus is not on the consequences of a decision, but the capacity to make that decision. The Court of Appeal elaborated on this principle in <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1257.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1257</a>, where it stated, from [175] to [180], that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An unwise decision does not, by itself, mean that he or she lacked the ability to decide on that matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The test is whether that person is able to understand the information relevant to the decision and, if yes, whether he or she is then able to use and weigh all that information in the process of arriving at the decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The ability to use and weigh the relevant information requires him or her to engage with the countervailing considerations relevant to the decision and measure the pros against the cons in a non-arbitrary manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Feelings and intuition may play a part in the decision-making process. The key lies in the ability to engage with all these factors, rather than allow one or some of them to dominate the decision-making process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother was able to Make Decisions For Herself in the Course of Proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I had the opportunity to consider the application of the above principles during my personal observation of the Mother at in-person hearings on six occasions on 6 February, 17 March, 15 April, 13 May, 18 June and 13 August 2025. She presented as a person who was confident, extremely articulate to the point of being argumentative, with a clear ability to explain her actions, raise objections and provide rebuttals against the points made by Father’s Counsel in the course of proceedings. I also noted that the Mother had a tendency to ramble about irrelevant matters, and constantly ignored the court’s guidance to constrain herself to the relevant issues at hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     A perusal of the Notes of Evidence of the ancillary hearing on 13 August 2025 would reveal that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother was able to raise objections to the admissibility of the Tanglin Club statement of accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother was able to articulate her arguments for joint custody and the importance of topics such as health, education, religion, enrichment and other activities to be done in joint consultation between the parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother was able to rebut Father’s Counsel submission that her daughter was embarrassed by her presence at school, by pointing out that she had volunteered at the school’s Racial Harmony Day, and that her daughter had been coaxed by the Father into stating so in the affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother was able to provide supporting reasons for her having care and control in her reply on child issues, showing that she was able to understand and follow the arguments made in proceedings so far. She was also able to articulate her reasons for refusing to undergo medical examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_e\"></a>(e)     When asked if she refuted the Father’s position that she kept to the bedroom and did not interact with the children, the Mother was able to explain that she kept an arms length distance because the Father had called the police in an earlier incident which resulted in her being remanded overnight at the police station, and that she did interact with and teach the children while the Father was on business trips.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Mother had disputed the valuation adopted by Father’s counsel and adduced a more appropriate valuation of $2.67 million which was eventually agreed upon by both parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_84-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Mother was able to provide relevant information to support her indirect contributions, and propose a ratio that should apply to her indirect contributions, showing that she had understood the court’s earlier explanation of the workings of the <em>ANJ</em> test.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The conclusion I came to after observing the Mother over the course of half a year was that while she was frequently irrelevant and irreverent in her responses, she clearly understood the matters being discussed in the proceedings, and was able to put forth relevant arguments to support her position. The fact that she took disadvantageous positions in respect of discovery and the filing of her ancillary affidavit does not necessarily imply that she lacked the ability to make her own decisions. As earlier observed, the ability to decide does not connote the ability to decide well. For the same reason, raising concerns over a person’s mental health condition does not <em>ipso facto</em> connote that the person lacks the mental capacity to litigate or requires a litigation representative. There was no doubt in my mind that the Mother had the mental capacity to represent herself and conduct proceedings on her own behalf in this ancillary matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Having concluded the matter, I invited the parties to address on costs. The Father’s counsel graciously submitted that there be no order as to costs. Accordingly, I directed that there be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In closing, I wish to highlight that litigants in person cannot expect to take advantage of their own ignorance or perceived inadequacies to play fast and loose with the rules of adjudication. While the judge may exercise some latitude to ensure that the litigant in person receives a fair day in court, this should not be interpreted as laxity or weakness in the face of litigants who seek to proverbially have their cake and eat it. The Mother is one such litigant. Having stymied the court process repeatedly with her absenteeism, non-compliance and complete disregard for the rules of discovery, she has to bear the price of her disregard for the court process and suffer the consequences of her refusal to abide by its rules. That she only decided to appoint counsel and seek to re-open the matter after an adverse outcome at the ancillary proceedings speaks volumes of her lack of respect for due process and fair play.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Having said this, I do urge the Mother to take stock of her circumstances and accept that the path to reuniting with the children and establishing her own self-sufficiency are one and the same – that she should consult with medical health professionals to better understand her own state of mind and regulate her behaviour accordingly. It is a pity that a long marriage had suddenly turned south in recent years due to circumstances which appear to be beyond parties’ control. There is still hope that normalcy can be achieved after the divorce, with a proper addressing of these root causes that have so unfortunately resulted in the couple parting ways. It is my sincere hope that parties can find a fresh start and head on the path to recovery and healing, and that future differences can be resolved in an amicable manner, without resort to further litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     By way of summary, I list out the following orders that were made at the conclusion of the ancillary hearing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b>1.

The Father had lent his bank account to his cousin. The reason for this, according to the Father, was that his cousin had told him that he had just gotten a job and needed a bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Since then, the Father had tried, but was unsuccessful, in attempting to open a bank account. The banks had flagged him as a high-risk customer and refused to let him open an account.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> He says he had sought the assistance of his Member of Parliament, but “nothing came out of it”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He told me that without a bank account, it was very difficult for him to find work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He told me that he had resorted to “do[ing] things”, including “illegal ones” such as selling SIM cards to survive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Even accepting that the Father had landed in this predicament because he had lent his bank account to his cousin out of the goodness of his heart, this alone, was not a good reason to not enforce the order against him. That is because this is the second time the Mother had come to court to enforce the order against the Father. As the Mother explained, the son had special needs, and she had been borrowing money to keep up with his expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given that there had already been a previous enforcement application against the Father, it should have been clear to him that he had to take the necessary steps to put his finances in order so that he could support his son. While there was some attempt on his part to do so,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> it was evident, by the fact that the Mother had to file a <em>second</em> enforcement application, that he had not done enough in respect of his finances, to keep up with his maintenance obligations towards his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I thus concluded that the Father had not demonstrated good reasons as to why the arrears should not be enforced against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As to how these arrears should be paid off, I was inclined to give the Father time to get his affairs in order, get back on his feet, and to do his part for his son. That was because the Father had told me, in his testimony, that he understood that he had a responsibility to provide for his son, and acknowledged that he could not continue to engage in illegal activities which would only land him in more trouble, and cause the arrears to snowball.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He also acknowledged that while he was unable to make payment, he was trying to “sort this out”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the circumstances, I ordered that the Father pay off the arrears of $4500 in monthly instalments of $50.

This case concerns the alleged breach of an access order and raises the following questions: What is reasonably expected of the care-parent when the child’s refusal is rooted in fear that the access-parent might commit sexual misconduct against her? Where the care-parent arranges psychological assessment and counselling for the child to address that fear, does this amount to a “major healthcare issue” and thus require the consent of the access-parent (who has joint custody rights over the child)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These questions arise in the present committal application. It is the access-parent’s case that the care-parent has disobeyed access and joint custody orders relating to their daughter. Having considered the evidence and submissions, I found that the access-parent had failed to prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father and the Mother are divorced. They have two children: a daughter born in October 2014 (“<b>Daughter</b>”) and a son born in September 2011 (“<b>Son</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In 2019, the Daughter alleged on two occasions that the Father had touched her sexually. Police reports were made. She was examined at a hospital and the Child Protective Service was involved. The Police ultimately decided to take no further action regarding the allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Following the parties’ divorce, the Syariah Court made the following orders in October 2020 regarding the children: (a) joint custody to both parties (“<b>Custody Order</b>”), (b) care and control to the Mother, and (c) reasonable access to the Father (“<b>2020 Order</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The 2020 Order was varied in November 2024 (“<b>2024 Order</b>”) – the Father was granted care and control of the Son, while the Mother retained care and control of the Daughter. The Father’s access to the Daughter was amended to unsupervised access every other weekend (“<b>Access Order</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Father alleges that the Mother had breached the Custody Order by (a) arranging psychological assessment and counselling for the Daughter at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (“<b>KKH</b>”) in 2024 and (b) changing the venue of the child’s religious classes without his consent. He further alleges that she had breached the Access Order by denying him access to the daughter on five occasions between December 2024 and February 2025 (“<b>Relevant Access Period</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother accepts that she had arranged the KKH consultations and changed the Daughter’s religious classes without the Father’s consent. She contends, however, that she was entitled to make these decisions in her capacity as the care-parent and that her actions did not infringe the Father’s joint custody rights over the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> She further accepts that the Daughter did not attend access during the Relevant Access Period. She explains that this was because the child was fearful of the Father and did not wish to see him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles – Committal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The principles governing committal proceedings are well established: <em>Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18910-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1</a> (“<b><em>Mok Kah Hong</em></b>”) at [85]; <em>CSW v CSX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29906-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 23</a> (“<b><em>CSW</em></b>”) at [44] – [46]; <em>TTZ v TTY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32578-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 46</a> (“<b><em>TTZ</em></b>”) at [17] – [18]; <em>UNE v UNF</em> [2019] SGHCF 96 at [3].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the respondent had breached the court order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10      <em>First</em>, the court determines what the order requires of the respondent, based on the plain meaning of the language used. Any ambiguity is resolved in the respondent’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>Second</em>, the court considers whether the respondent has in fact acted in breach of the order (“<b>guilty conduct</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the respondent had acted with guilty intent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     If the breach is proved, the court must then determine whether the respondent had acted intentionally – i.e. whether he or she knew that the conduct would contravene the order but nonetheless proceeded with it (“<b>guilty intent</b>”). The respondent’s motive for disobeying the order is irrelevant to liability, although it may bear on his or her sentence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Burden and standard of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Finally</em>, the applicant must prove, <em>beyond reasonable doubt</em>, that the respondent committed the guilty conduct with guilty intent. The law imposes this stringent burden of proof because contempt of court carries the potential for imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Alleged breach of the Custody Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will now apply the above principles to the alleged breach of the Custody Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Scope of the Custody Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The first step is to determine the proper scope of the Custody Order – specifically, what decisions fall within “custody” rights (and thus require joint decision-making), as opposed to “care and control” rights (which the Mother may exercise alone)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Custody-related decisions v Care-related decisions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To answer this question, a useful starting point is the following guidance in <em>CX v CY (minor: custody and access)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a> (“<b><em>CX</em></b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">31    ... where parties are splitting up, custody as a general concept is divided into two smaller packages, <em>ie</em>, “care and control” and residual “custody”. ... [R]esidual “custody” is the package of residual rights that remains after the grant of a care and control order that dictates which parent shall be the daily caregiver of the child and with whom the child shall live. To put it simplistically, <b>“care and control” concerns day-to-day decision-making, while residual “custody” concerns the long-term decision-making for the welfare of the child</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    As was appropriately summarised by Anthony Dickey in <em>Family Law</em> (LBC Information Services, 3rd Ed, 1997) at pp 326–327:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[A]t common law, care and control concerns the right to take care of a child and to make <b>day-to-day, short-term decisions concerning the child’s upbringing and welfare</b>. Custody without care and control (that is, custody in its narrow sense) concerns the right to make <b>the </b><b><u>more important, longer-term decisions </u></b><b>concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">33    In other words, a “custody order” only gives the parent the <em>residual</em> right to decide on long-term matters affecting the child’s welfare. For instance, the right to decide on the <b>type of education</b> resides with the parent(s) with custody as it concerns the more important and long-term aspects of a child’s upbringing. The right to decide the <b>particular school </b><b><u>may</u></b> also reside with the custodian(s) <b>depending on the importance of this decision to the child’s education</b>. However, the right to decide how a child should dress or travel to school, what sport he should take up or musical instrument he should play and similar ordinary day-to-day matters, resides with the parent who has care and control. Such a demarcation between the two types of orders proposed by Dickey is generally consistent with our local jurisprudence where matters such as choice of schools, tutors or healthcare have been regarded as matters for the custodian(s) to decide (for example, see <em>Yeap Albert v Wong Elizabeth</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4372-M.xml')\">[1998] SGHC 97</a> at [16]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">34    ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">35    ... We should add that it is an almost impossible task for us to lay down an exhaustive list of matters which will fall under the concept of residual custody. <b>The line is not always clear as to what matters would be considered the important and longer-term decisions concerning the upbringing and welfare of a child. It suffices to say that decisions pertaining to religion, education and </b><b><u>major </u></b><b>healthcare issues would fall into such a category.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Bold and underscoring added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Features of custody-related decisions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As evident from <em>CX</em>, the critical distinction between “custody” and “care and control” lies in the <em>nature and extent of the consequences of the decision on the child</em>. Broadly, custody-related decisions are those which have a major impact on a child’s life, whereas care-related decisions are those which has a lesser impact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     According to case law, decisions which have a major impact tend to –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Affect the child’s legal status</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Examples include decisions concerning the child’s –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(i)       citizenship: <em>VLI v VLJ</em> [2022] 5 SLR 30 at [15],</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(ii)       country of residence: <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a> (“<b><em>VZJ</em></b>”) at [1], [4] and [7],</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iii)       passport application: <em>VZJ</em> at [21], and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iv)       immigration status: <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> at [3] and [6].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Shape the child’s identity, beliefs and values</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Examples include decisions concerning the child’s –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(i)       surname: <em>UPD v UPC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24875-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 4 SLR 699</a> at [77], and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(ii)       choice of religion: <em>CX</em> at [35].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <u>Affect the child’s life trajectory</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Examples include decisions concerning whether the child –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(i)       Should enrol in a particular school: <em>YG v YH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/58923-M.xml')\">[2008] SGHC 166</a> (“<b><em>YG</em></b>”) at [9],</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(ii)       Should enrol in a polytechnic or a junior college: <em>AQL v AQM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 1 SLR 0840.xml')\">[2012] 1 SLR 840</a> at [6], and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iii)       Should study in Singapore or abroad: <em>VZJ</em> at [1], [4] and [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <u>Carry significant risks for the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Decisions concerning “major healthcare issues” of the child is a good example: <em>CX</em> at [35]. Logically, such decisions include (i) surgery on the child as well as (ii) starting or stopping the child on treatment for a serious medical condition. In <em>YG</em>, the High Court explained that the wife (as a care-parent) owed the following obligations to the husband who had joint custody of the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">9    The Wife does not have to consult the Husband on every minor health issue of the children, <em>eg</em>, cold, cough and fever, but is to consult the Husband on every intended hospital admission or hospital procedure unless it is not possible to do so, as in the case of an emergency. If any of the children is hospitalised on an emergency basis, the party having physical care of the child at the time of hospitalisation is to inform the other party as soon as is practicable, for example, within two hours of the start of the emergency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>A similar approach was taken in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<b><em>TAU</em></b>”). There, the court made the following observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">37    ... I reiterated to the parties that they have joint custody of Emma. It follows from this that they must consult each other and jointly make <em>major</em> healthcare decisions for her. <b>The Mother who has care and control can take care of Emma for minor day-to-day healthcare matters that arise.</b> Nevertheless, in so far as the parties themselves desire to update each other on Emma’s day-to-day healthcare matters, I encouraged the parties’ willingness to co-parent.

From 2020 to 2023, she received counselling from Ms C, a psychologist at a Family Service Centre. The Father knew of this counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In 2023, the Daughter began speaking about the alleged sexual abuse again. In January 2024, Ms C advised the Mother that it would be best for the Daughter to obtain more structured professional help to deal with her feelings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">What happened at KKH</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother thus brought the Daughter to KKH in February 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The child was assessed by KKH’s Psychological Trauma Support Service (“<b>PTSS</b>”) in May 2024. The assessment involved clinical interview, questionnaires, and behavioural observation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     PTSS found that the Daughter displayed distress reactions as well as fear and avoidance towards the Father. However, they concluded that she did <em>not</em> meet the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As at March 2025, the Daughter had attended four PTSS sessions aimed at teaching her coping strategies and helping her manage her emotions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Do the consultations concern a “major healthcare issue” </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father contends that any decision for the Daughter to see a psychologist is a “major decision” which must be made jointly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This is because the psychological intervention involved an “intrusion” into the child’s mind and could potentially have long-term adverse effects on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I disagree.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father cites no authority for this sweeping contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Based on his contention, every time that the Mother speaks with the Daughter to understand her feelings and to address her negative emotions would be an “intrusion” into her mind which requires his prior approval. Likewise, every conversation that the child has with a school counsellor – to manage stress or cope with change – would also require his consent. This does not make any sense. A child who is sad needs comfort, a child who is anxious needs reassurance. These are not “major healthcare issues”. Ordinary conversations and emotional support do not become “major healthcare issues” merely because the listener is a psychologist or psychiatrist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father’s contention is also inconsistent with case law. As shown earlier, courts have emphasised that only decisions concerning “major healthcare issues” engage custodial rights.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Such decisions typically involve procedures that are invasive or carry significant risk to a child’s physical or mental integrity. The prescription of psychiatric medication or institutionalisation in a psychiatric facility are some examples.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In my view, the KKH assessment and counselling do not involve “major healthcare issues”:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The PTSS assessment consisted of interview, questionnaires, and observation. There is no evidence that the assessment had exposed the Daughter to any risk of physical or mental harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In its report dated 1 July 2024 (“<b>KKH Report</b>”), KKH assessed that the Daughter did <em>not</em> suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Father “respect[ed] and accept[ed]” this assessment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There is no evidence that the child had any major mental condition that would qualify as a “major healthcare issue” requiring his specific attention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Crucially, the Father did not dispute the fact that the KKH consultations (1) were non-invasive and (2) did not have long-term adverse effects on the Daughter. The counselling sessions were intended to simply equip the child with strategies to manage her emotions and were therapeutic in nature. She had found them to be calming and helpful.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       According to the Father, he had “no emotion” (which I take to mean no strong views) about the Daughter seeing a psychologist.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> This shows that he does not genuinely view the KKH consultations as raising “major healthcare issues”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d-p3_v\"></a>(v)       This is reinforced by the fact that when he had care and control of the Son (June 2022 to November 2024), the Father had taken the child to see counsellors and psychologists without first seeking the Mother’s consent. It is therefore plain that he did not consider the mere act of consulting counsellors or psychologists to be a serious matter which required joint custodial consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In summary, the Father has failed to show that the Mother’s decision to arrange the KKH consultations had interfered with his joint custody rights. It was a decision that she was entitled to make unilaterally as the Daughter’s care-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the KKH Report was prepared for the purpose of litigation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Before moving to the next issue, I wish to address briefly an issue raised by the Father. According to him, the Mother had breached r 35(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>2014 Rules</b>”) by obtaining the KKH Report and exhibiting it in these proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Rule 35(1) provided that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where a child is a <em>party to or a subject</em> of any action or proceedings, or where any action or proceedings <em>involve the welfare or custody of a child</em>, a party must not, without the leave of the Court, cause the child to be <em>examined or assessed</em> by any registered medical practitioner, psychologist, counsellor, social worker or mental health professional <em>for the purpose of preparing expert evidence for use in those proceedings</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Rule 35(1) has since been superseded by P10, r 4(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2024 (“<b>2024 Rules</b>”). Rule 4(1) provides –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where any proceedings relate to the welfare or custody of a child, a party must not cause the child to be examined or assessed by any expert for the purpose of preparing expert evidence <em>for use in those proceedings</em> unless the Court approves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     To bring the Mother’s conduct within r 35(1) and r 4(1), the Father must show that she had caused the Daughter to be examined or assessed <em>for the purpose</em> of preparing expert evidence for use in these committal proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I find that the Mother’s act of procuring the KKH Report did not breach either r 35(1) or r 4(1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Daughter was assessed by PTSS in or around February 2024. In or around June 2024, the Mother requested a report from KKH. The KKH Report was issued in July 2024. The Father commenced the present committal proceedings only in December 2024 – approximately 10 months <em>after</em> the assessment and five months <em>after</em> the report. On this timeline, the Mother could not have arranged the KKH consultations for the purpose of preparing expert evidence in these committal proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I also accept the Mother’s evidence that she referred the Daughter to KKH in 2024 because she had wanted healthcare professionals <em>to help the child</em>. The referral was driven by concern for the Daughter’s welfare.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> KKH’s findings, which confirm that the child had psychological and emotional difficulties at the material time, bear this out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> On these facts, the KKH consultations were clearly not for the purpose of litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Decision to change religious classes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Next, I turn to the Mother’s decision to change the venue of the Daughter’s religious classes in or around January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Father contends that this is a breach of the Custody Order and the Mother should thus be held liable for contempt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I have two difficulties with this contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No leave was granted </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The first is procedural.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is undisputed that the change of religious classes was not particularised in the Father’s supporting affidavit as a ground for committal. Further, leave was neither sought or granted to pursue it as such.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> Under P 24, r 7(2) of the 2024 Rules, an applicant “must rely on only the grounds set out in [his or her] supporting affidavit”. Strictly applied, P 24, r 7(2) would require me to disregard the Mother’s decision to change the Daughter’s religious classes as a ground for committal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It bears reiterating that (i) the power to punish for contempt is quasi-criminal and (ii) the purpose of P 24, r 7(2) is to safeguard the respondent’s liberty: <em>Mok Kah Hong</em> at [61], [68] – [69]. In the circumstances, P 24, r 7(2) must be scrupulously observed and strictly complied with: <em>Allport Alfred James v Wong Soon Lan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1988] 2 SLR(R) 0520.xml')\">[1988] 2 SLR(R) 520</a> at [8]. Given that no leave had been granted to rely on the Mother’s decision to change the religious classes as a ground for committal, it would be unfair to consider the decision in these proceedings. The Father’s counsel accepted this point in oral submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Pending PPO proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The second difficulty is substantive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The circumstances leading to the change of religious classes form part of the Mother’s personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) application in SSP 442/xxxx (“<b>SSP 442</b>”). In SSP 442, she alleges that on 5 October 2024, the Father had turned up at the Daughter’s religious class unannounced, asked to see her, and frightened the child (“<b>5 October incident</b>”). She testified that she had changed the venue because she felt that it was no longer safe for the Daughter to continue attending classes at the same location.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother’s account of the 5 October incident is hotly contested by the Father, both in this committal application and in the PPO proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It would be undesirable for this court, in the context of quasi-criminal committal proceedings, to make definitive findings on the same incident which might later be perceived as constraining or pre-empting by the court hearing the PPO proceeding. The safer and fairer approach is to confine my decision in the committal proceeding to matters that properly fall within the leave granted and do not overlap in a way that risks influencing the outcome of SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Accordingly, I decline to consider the Mother’s change of religious classes as a ground for committal in this proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this judgment should be taken as expressing any view on the 5 October 2024 incident or on whether her decision to change the Daughter’s religious classes is justified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Alleged breach of Access Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Finally, I turn to the alleged breach of the Access Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Care-parent’s evidential burden</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     A care-parent bears an evidential burden to show that he or she has taken all reasonable efforts to comply with an access order. This burden arises even where it is alleged that the child (i) is unable to see the access-parent or (ii) does not wish to do so: <em>TTZ</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In the case of (ii), the care-parent owes a duty to take positive steps and reasonable efforts to enforce the order after learning that the child does not wish to see the access-parent: <em>VRI v VRH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29366-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 8</a> (“<b><em>VRI</em></b>”) at [16]; <em>TTZ</em> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     If there is a complaint of breach, the care-parent must show that he or she has taken genuine and proactive steps that an ordinarily responsible parent could reasonably be expected to take to facilitate access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Scrutiny of the reasons for the non-access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In assessing whether such steps were taken, the court applies an <em>objective test</em>, having regard to all the facts and circumstances: <em>TTZ</em> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In particular, the court will examine whether the asserted reason for non-compliance is true. To give an example – a court may disbelieve a claim that the child could not attend access due to illness if there is evidence that the child was able to travel on public transport at the relevant time or lacked a medical certificate: <em>VRI</em> at [14] and [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Claim that the child refused to see the access-parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Where the reason for the non-access is that the child was unwilling to see the access-parent, the court will inquire into the source of the child’s negative feelings and whether they stem from the child or from the care-parent’s influence: <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> at [61]; <em>CSW</em> at [63] – [65]. Depending on the circumstances, such an inquiry may take various forms, such as (a) judicial interviews, (b) calling for an access evaluation reports or specific issues report, or (c) assessing relevant evidence adduced by the parties. If the care-parent is found to have influenced the child not to meet the access-parent, this may be viewed as evidence that the care-parent did not intend to comply with the access order: <em>TTZ</em> at [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Children will, as they mature, develop their own preferences and make their own choices. The assessment into whether the care-parent had made “reasonable efforts” to facilitate access is a practical one: did the parent do what could fairly be expected of him or her, bearing in mind the child’s age, temperament, and the surrounding circumstances? In making this assessment, courts frequently have the challenging task of balancing two considerations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a starting point, parents cannot disclaim all responsibility for their children’s actions. Care-parents remain responsible for guiding their children and setting appropriate limits. An important aspect of this responsibility is facilitating the child’s relationship with the other parent: <em>VDZ v VEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25015-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 4 SLR 921</a> (“<b><em>VDZ</em></b>”) at [45] – [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That said, the child’s welfare – not the wishes or interests of either parent – is paramount. If access is for the child’s welfare, then the child’s willingness (or lack of it) must be factored into the assessment of whether reasonable efforts were made: <em>TTZ</em> at [45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Where the child genuinely does not wish to meet the access-parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Ultimately, if the care-parent can show that (1) the child genuinely does not wish to see the access-parent, and (2) he or she has taken reasonable efforts to comply with the access order, it is unlikely that the court will force access against the child’s wishes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The building of a meaningful parent-child relationship is not amenable to judicial command: <em>WOZ v WOY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31019-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 11</a> at [4]. The law cannot compel a child to love a parent: <em>TEN v TEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25288-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 20</a> at [43].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Forcing access in the above circumstances will not assist in repairing the parent-child relationship. It may in fact strain the relationship further, and even traumatise the child: <em>VDZ</em> at [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parties should consider other ways of communicating and parenting to pave the way for meaningful access in future: <em>TTZ</em> at [23] and [53].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     One further point. Given that the applicant/access-parent bears the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt, it follows that the respondent/care-parent will not be liable for contempt if he or she –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     can prove [45(1)] and [45(2)] on a balance of probabilities, or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     can raise a reasonable doubt that the breach was intentional – even if he or she is unable to prove [45(1)] and [45(2)] on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summing-up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In summary, once a breach of an access order is shown, the care-parent must establish that he or she took reasonable efforts to comply. This, in turn, requires establishing three matters. <em>One</em>, the reason for the child’s alleged inability or unwillingness to meet the access-parent. <em>Two</em>, whether the care-parent had caused or contributed to that situation (including whether the care-parent had influenced the child not to see the access-parent). <em>Three</em>, the steps taken by the care-parent to enforce the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I now apply these principles to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mother’s explanation for non-access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     According to the Mother, she could not facilitate the access during the Relevant Access Period because the Daughter was “terrified” at the mere mention of meeting the Father and “resolutely refused” to see him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Daughter corroborated the Mother’s explanation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Daughter corroborated the Mother’s account. She testified that she knew of the Access Order and understood that she was to see the Father. However, she was “scared” of him – even during supervised access. She did not want to meet him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Daughter explained that this fear stemmed from the following.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Sexual touching in 2019</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>She testified that the Father had touched her sexually on two occasions and she was afraid that he would do so again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Touching in 2022</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>She described multiple instances where he draped his arm around her shoulder, hugged her from behind, and pulled her closer without her permission during access periods in public places.

She feared that he would do the same to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     If believed, the Daughter’s evidence would prove that the Mother did not deliberately disobey the Access Order – and that the child was the one who had prevented the access from occurring. The critical question is whether I should accept the child’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The “unusually convincing” standard</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Father submits that the Daughter’s evidence should be rejected because it is “not unusually convincing”, citing <em>Public Prosecutor v GHI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30752-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGDC 295</a> at [17].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Mother argues that the “unusually convincing” standard does not apply because these are not criminal proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     At the outset, I note that the phrase “unusually convincing” does not establish a different standard of proof. It is a cautionary reminder in <em>criminal cases</em> that where the Prosecution’s case rests largely or solely on the uncorroborated evidence of a single witness. In such cases, the court must examine that evidence with special care before being satisfied that guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt: <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a> (“<b><em>GCK</em></b>”) at [87], [91], [98], [99], [104], [137], [144], [145], [149].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The courts have not yet addressed whether the “unusually convincing” standard applies in <em>committal proceedings</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In this case, it is unnecessary to decide that question. This is because even if I were to assume that the standard applies in contempt cases, it does not assist the Father for three reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, in criminal cases, the “unusually convincing” standard is directed at <em>the Prosecution’s evidence</em> – not the accused person’s or defendant’s. The standard is used to assess whether the Prosecution’s sole witness is so reliable, credible and plausible that his or her uncorroborated testimony can be the basis for conviction. The Daughter, however, is a witness called in support of the Mother’s <em>defence</em> – <em>not</em> the Father’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is wrong in principle to require an accused person (in criminal cases) or a respondent (in committal) to satisfy the “unusually convincing” threshold in order to raise a reasonable doubt. This unreasonably reverses the burden and standard of proof in criminal and committal proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, and in any event, the Daughter’s account of her fears and of the key incidents underpinning those fears is materially corroborated by independent or undisputed evidence. As such, there is no need to trigger the cautionary reminder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <u>Sexual touching in 2019</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>In relation to the sexual touching incidents, (1) police reports were lodged, (2) the Daughter was referred for medical examination, (3) Child Protection Services was activated, and (4) the child was followed up by social service agencies for several years thereafter. In highlighting these undisputed facts, I make no finding regarding whether the sexual touching incidents did in fact occur. I remain conscious of the fact that these incidents have been strongly disputed, are not the subject of this committal application, and the parties did not lead full evidence regarding them. I refer to the foregoing matters only to note that the Daughter’s account of the incidents is not a recent fabrication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <u>Touching in 2022</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is undisputed that the Father had physical contact with the Daughter during access at public places. Given her claims regarding the sexual touching incidents in 2019, it is unsurprising that she felt uncomfortable to such contact from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <u>Attempt to drive away with the Daughter in 2022</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>A video of the incident shows that despite the Daughter wanting to remain with the Mother, the Father had (1) carried the child away from the Mother, (2) forced her into his car, and (3) intended to drive off with the child. The video also shows the Daughter to be crying.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> According to the Father, he had merely wanted to bring her to a mosque and did not harbour any ulterior motive. In my view, even if he had acted with innocent intent, the fact is that the child was clearly distressed by his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <u>Non-return of the Son in 2022</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>It is undisputed that the Father had breached the 2020 Order by refusing to return the Son to the Mother after the June 2022 holidays.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Daughter’s concern that he might do likewise to her is not inherently incredible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Taken together, the above events, and the fact that the Daughter has been in counselling for several years since 2019, demonstrate that there is a factual foundation for her fear of the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Did the Mother coach the Daughter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Father submits that the Mother had coached the Daughter to testify that she did not wish to see him and caused the child to be fearful of him. He highlights that the Daughter repeatedly expressed a fear of being taken away even though, apart from the 2022 incident, he had not actually done so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I am not persuaded by the Father’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the mere fact that the Father did not attempt to forcibly take her away after the 2022 incident does not render the Daughter’s fear of him to be illogical. As explained above, there is a confluence of factors contributing to such a fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, even if the fear were irrational, that would not, by itself, prove that the Daughter had been coached or that the Mother caused or contributed to the child’s fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Mother had coached the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The child is emotionally mature and intellectually precocious. For instance, she expressed frustration that despite repeatedly telling many people about the “incidents”, the matter had not been resolved, and she did not feel believed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> She testified that she wished for all of this to stop so she could stay with the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       She spoke plainly and candidly acknowledged when she could not recall or was unsure of details.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Her tone was measured – there was no hint of animosity or bias towards the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I therefore find that the Daughter’s evidence about her fear of the Father is credible, supported by objective/undisputed evidence, and is not the product of coaching.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Did the Mother influence the Daughter not to meet the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     I next consider whether the Mother had caused or contributed to the Daughter’s unwillingness to meet the Father during the Relevant Access Period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In my view, she did not.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Daughter testified that the Mother did not say anything bad about the Father to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Mother appears to have shielded the Daughter from her own views about the Father. The Daughter testified that the Mother did not tell her what transpired at court hearings with the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> When she asked why the Son did not return after the June holidays, the Mother replied that she did not know<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> – even though it is undisputed that the Father had unlawfully retained the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Father did not provide any concrete evidence to show (i) that the Mother had influenced the Daughter not to meet him during the Relevant Access Period, (ii) why the child’s evidence should be disbelieved, and (iii) why the Mother would want to intentionally frustrate his access with the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Did the Mother take reasonable efforts to enforce the Access Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I now turn to the final issue: whether the Mother had taken reasonable efforts to enforce the Access Order during the Relevant Access Period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     On the facts, the Mother did make efforts to comply with the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Daughter testified that the Mother had informed her of upcoming access sessions several days in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother did not merely adopt a passive stance when it came to facilitating access. Even before the Access Order was made in November 2024, she had taken active steps to restore the Father – Daughter relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       She arranged the KKH consultations to address the Daughter’s fear of the Father. The Daughter testified that she had benefited from these consultations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       She had also approached the Community Psychology Hub (“<b>CPH</b>”) regarding access difficulties. On 27 September 2024, CPH proposed various interventions, including (1) their involvement in facilitating sessions between the Father and Daughter, (2) participation in the “Children of Divorce Intervention Programme”, and (3) co-parenting work with CPH and REACH to improve the parent–child relationship and co-parenting dynamics. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father however contends that the Mother had not done enough. He relies on the following aspects of the Daughter’s evidence to support his contention.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>(a)     When the Daughter testified that she did not want to meet him, the Mother had told her she was sorry she “had to go” for access, but that <em>she could choose not to go</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother did not persuade the child to attend, nor did she tell her that she (the Mother) might get into trouble if access did not take place. Instead, the Mother said that she would “sort out” the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I agree that in a typical case, it would not suffice for a care-parent simply to say: “The child refuses to go for access, and I cannot force him or her to act otherwise.” Such passivity does not meet the requirement of reasonable effort. Nor is it acceptable if a parent, consciously or otherwise, communicates negative views about the access-parent or fails to create an emotionally conducive environment for access. The care-parent is expected to take positive steps to promote the child’s relationship with the access-parent – access is a right of the child, not merely a privilege for the access-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     However, this is not a typical case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it appears that the Daughter’s fear of the Father is deep-seated, long-standing, and anchored in undisputed events as well as serious (though un-established) allegations of sexual misconduct. I must factor all these into the assessment of whether requiring the Mother to do significantly more to get the child to attend access would risk trauma or harm, bearing in mind that the duty to comply with an access order must yield to the paramount consideration of the child’s welfare: s 125 of the Women’s Charter (“<b>Charter</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Mother’s decision to tell the Daughter that she had a choice whether to meet the Father, and not to press the child further, must also be considered in light of the <em>Father’s unreasonable stance</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       On 30 September 2024, the Father responded to CPH’s proposals by citing extracts from Family Court judgments and writing cryptically: “There is no assurance that [the Daughter] would (ever) be deemed ‘ready’ for proposed joint parent–child sessions, isn’t it”. He then expressly declined the proposed intervention plans.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       During cross-examination, the Father insisted that even if the Daughter told him in person that she was fearful and did not wish to see him, this would not satisfy him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Additionally, he disagreed that the appropriate response would be to help her address such fears if the child was unwilling to see him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The above stance of the Father shows that he does not regard the Daughter’s feelings as being relevant. In my view, his mindset carries a real risk that he will disregard what the child says to him during unsupervised access and thereby heighten her fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Given the above, the Mother was placed in a difficult position. The Daughter was genuinely terrified. Professional counsellors proposed gradual reintroduction. The Father rejected that approach and insisted on immediate, unsupervised access based on the Access Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In my view, it would not be reasonable to expect the Mother to disregard the Daughter’s emotional state, compel access at all costs, and risk re-traumatising the child. I am satisfied that the Mother had taken reasonable and good-faith steps to facilitate access. She did not act in defiance of the Access Order – she had reacted to the child’s genuine fear and distress. The steps that she had taken – seeking professional assistance and exploring therapeutic solutions – show compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the Access Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Accordingly, I find that the Father has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Mother had wilfully disobeyed the Access Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     At this juncture, I wish to emphasise a few points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, this decision should <em>not</em> be read as a general licence for care-parents to treat access as being optional. It is confined to the exceptional facts of this case: (i) the Daughter’s fear has a documented history and is corroborated by multiple sources, (ii) the Mother had sought professional help for the Daughter’s fear and had proposed a graduated approach to reintroducing the Father into the child’s life, and (iii) the Father had unreasonably rejected those efforts and insisted on immediate compliance on the Access Order. In these circumstances, the Mother’s conduct was protective (rather than defiant) and was directed at the Daughter’s welfare (rather than the exclusion of the Father). To characterise her actions as contemptuous is incompatible with both the welfare principle and the therapeutic aims of family justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the law does not allow a care-parent to avoid compliance merely by saying that the child has “chosen” not to attend. A care-parent may be liable for contempt if he or she passively abdicates responsibility, deliberately obstructs access under the guise of the child’s reluctance, and/or fails to take genuine steps to encourage and facilitate access – for example, by disparaging the access-parent or affirming the child’s refusal to meet the access-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, my finding that the Mother was not in contempt during the Relevant Access Period does <em>not</em> vary, rescind, or suspend the Access Order. It remains in full force. My finding simply reflects the finding that, during the Relevant Access Period, physical access could not occur because of the unique circumstances that I had described.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, if either party considers that the existing access arrangements should be substantively changed, the proper course is to seek a variation in accordance with the legal requirements. Until it is varied, the Access Order remains the baseline against which the parties’ future conduct – whether in facilitating or seeking to enforce access – will be evaluated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     For the above reasons, the Father’s committal application is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Before I conclude, a few words for the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><em>To the Mother</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is good practice to keep your ex-spouse informed of developments in your daughter’s life – even if you are not legally obliged to do so. A lack of information can breed suspicion. If he comes to discover these developments, he may wonder – “Am I being cut out of my child’s life? What else am I not being told?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I appreciate that providing information may lead to further acrimony between the two of you – and worse, attempts to frustrate your efforts to care and help your daughter. You are likely to be worried that he may react unreasonably or seek to obstruct. I have no easy answer to address your dilemma save to say this – if you can demonstrate that you are acting transparently and in good faith, the law will have no difficulty deciding who is the more responsible parent and in supporting your decisions as the care-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, I recognise your dissatisfaction with aspects of the 2024 Order and your emotional difficulty of complying with them. Nonetheless, I must reiterate that until those orders are rescinded or varied, they must be obeyed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><em>To the Father</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Access Order is not a certificate of entitlement to be enforced in disregard of your daughter’s emotional state. The law cannot compel a child to love a parent. It is difficult to see how imprisoning your daughter’s primary care-giver will be in her best interests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> It will not make her less afraid. It will certainly make matters worse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_e\"></a>(e)     If you genuinely wish to restore your relationship with your daughter, you will need to listen to her more, acknowledge her fear towards you (even if you believe it to be unjustified), and accept professional guidance on how to move forward. The path will not be easy – especially as your daughter is now entering the teenage years. Winning your daughter’s affections back will require persuasion, patience, and perseverance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Finally, the law strives for balance – orders must be obeyed, but always with the child’s welfare as the guiding light. Your attempts at reconciling with your daughter are more likely to be successful if you heed these words to guide your future actions.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The 2020 Order is in the Respondent’s affidavit dated 11.03.25 at Tab 4 (page 101).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The 2024 Order is in the Respondent’s affidavit dated 11.03.25 at Tab 5 (page 105).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 10.10.25 at [6] to [10] and [47] to [50].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 10.10.25 at [27] and [28].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Mother’s Affidavit dated 11.03.25 at [8], [10], [16]; Father’s Affidavit dated 27.12.24 at page 12 to page 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Mother’s Affidavit dated 11.03.25 at [8], [10], [16], [19] and page 405 (report by KKH dated 01.07.24).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Applicant’s Submissions dated 08.10.25 at [27].

Where there is a contest between parties as to who should be appointed as the deputy/deputies of P, the Court will have to decide on which person or persons, whether they be P’s family members or other persons close to P, to be appointed as the deputy/deputies of P as well as the scope of their powers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The saying “<em>blood is thicker than water</em>” is often misused. The plain reading of this saying suggests that the familial bonds are stronger than other relationships. In this regard, an argument was made during the proceedings that the Court should favour the appointment of a family member to be P’s deputy. However, there is recognised scholarly discourse that the original saying was actually used in the military context of describing that the “<em>water of the womb</em>” is not thicker than the “<em>blood of the covenant</em>”, suggesting that one's blood covenant in battle or through adversity could be more important than a person’s familial bonds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       While paragraph 50 of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions 2015 (which is substantially the same as paragraph 74 of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions 2024) does suggest that P’s immediate family members, by virtue of their relationship to P, are likely to have an interest, such that they should be notified as Relevant Persons of any proceedings under the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (“<b>MCA</b>”) relating to P, this presumption is rebuttable. Persons who are not immediate family members could very well be closer to P or concerned over the care and financial management of P for them to be considered as Relevant Persons. Whereas family members who are estranged or wholly uninvolved or unconcerned about P’s care may not be Relevant Persons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Similarly, the person that the Court appoints as P’s deputy, who must be a Relevant Person, may be a family member, but there could potentially be a person outside of the immediate family that would better placed to be appointed as P’s deputy to serve P’s best interests. The Court, thus, has to consider the specific circumstances and relationships that the proposed deputies have with P to select the right person or persons to be P’s deputy/deputies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The applications of FC/OSM 184/2023 (“<b>OSM 184</b>”) and FC/OSM 286/2023 (“<b>OSM 286</b>”) presented competing applications for the appointment of a deputy for P. OSM 184 was commenced by the ex-wife of P (the “<b>Ex-Wife</b>”), who had been coparenting P an P’s Ex-Wife’s 2 sons aged 15 and 13 with P (the “<b>Sons</b>”) in a largely cordial manner prior to P’s stroke. OSM 286 was commenced by the elder sister of P (the “<b>Sister</b>”), whom P also had a fairly good relationship with. P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister disagreed on the care of P and how P’s property and assets should be managed. The Court had the unenviable task of deciding whom to appoint as the deputy for P or whether both P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister could work collaboratively as P’s deputies and the range of powers for said deputyship that would be in P’s best interest. Ultimately, after considering the evidence and parties’ arguments, P’s Ex-Wife was unable to convince the Court that she instead of P’s Sister was better placed to be P’s deputy. Instead, P’s Sister evidenced consistent care of P. Hence, P’s Sister was appointed as the sole deputy for P with certain specified powers. Therefore, OSM 184 was dismissed, and orders were made in OSM 286. P’s Ex-Wife being dissatisfied with my decision, filed appeals against both of the decisions in OSM 184 with HCF/DCA 80/2025 and in OSM 286 with HCF/DCA 81/2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       P was a Singaporean businessman who had suffered a stroke in March 2023 at the age of 48. As of the time of the decision, P was about 50 years old and was under the care of a nursing home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       P’s Sister, also a Singaporean, was five (5) years older than him and was his only sibling. P’s and P’s Sister’s parents had passed away quite some time prior to these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       P’s Ex-Wife was a Singaporean woman who was about 42 years old at the time of the decision. P’s Ex-Wife worked as a math tuition teacher, either working out of her residence or over zoom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">P’s relationships with P’s Ex-Wife’s and P’s Sister and their relationship with each other</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       P and P’s Ex-Wife were married in July 2008. P’s and P’s Ex-Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> Son was born in January 2010 and then 2<sup>nd</sup> Son was born in January 2012.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 5 January 2018, P filed for divorce against the Ex-Wife on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage based on the factual scenario that the Ex-Wife had behaved in a manner that it would be unreasonable for him to stay in the marriage. In the divorce proceedings, P had alleged that there were many disagreements and quarrels between P’s Ex-Wife and him, and that P’s Ex-Wife would keep late nights away from P and the family. P found P’s Ex-Wife to be stubborn and would have outbursts of anger and that there was a lack of communication and understanding for his financial situation which added to his stress. Due to this, they ceased conjugal relationships since 2011 (i.e. shortly after the conception of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son) and had slept separately since. While the Ex-Wife filed a memorandum of appearance, she indicated she was not contesting and did not file a defence to these claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Interim Judgment was pronounced on 5 April 2018 with a consent order for all ancillary matters. Pursuant to this, P and P’s Ex-Wife shared joint custody with care and control going to P’s Ex-Wife and P granted liberal access to P’s Sons. P was also to make monthly maintenance payments of S$1,600 payable to P’s Ex-Wife being half of the purported expenses for both of P’s Sons to be paid at the start of each month. The Final Judgment for divorce was then granted on 9 July 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     P had made certain comments to friends and on social media which appeared to suggest that he believed P’s Ex-Wife had an extramarital affair with a parent of one of her tuition students. During the course of proceedings, it was belatedly revealed that P’s Ex-Wife had a third child, a son, who was not P’s biological offspring and was aged 6 years old (the “<b>Little Boy</b>”). Based on the fact that he was born in the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter of 2019, the Little Boy would have been conceived either during P’s and P’s Ex-Wife’s marriage or shortly after the Interim Judgment had been pronounced. As at the time of the hearings, P’s Ex-Wife appeared not to be in any romantic relationship with another person. P’s Ex-Wife claimed that the Little Boy would be care for by her mother on most days at her mother’s residence instead of at her residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     By the time that P suffered a stroke in March 2023, they had been divorced for about five (5) years. However, there was substantive evidence provided that P and P’s Wife had a cordial relationship and would still frequently converse with each other over WhatsApp. Such correspondence was, however, largely about their Sons, such as discussing meals and access arrangements. P’s Wife would let P stay over at her residence in a separate bed on occasion and there was some correspondence and photographs indicating that P was comfortable around the Little Boy and would even dote on him even though he was not his child. P’s Ex-Wife claims that P remained her close friend and confidant despite their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     According to P’s Ex-Wife, she also remained in constant communication with P on other matters and that P would share his thoughts on his work. Such level of discussion could not be fully evidenced by their text messages, which seemed to be centred on mundane tasks of getting food or on expected time of arrival. In any event, P appeared to be comfortable enough with P’s Ex-Wife to seek a loan of purportedly S$60,000 for his business. That being said, P also sought a loan from P’s Sister. Both P’s Sister and Ex-Wife were in agreement that it was P’s preference to take out loans with family members and friends instead of with financial institutions for his business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     P and P’s Sister maintained a good relationship and cordial correspondence over text messages. They would meet up to celebrate festivities together as a family. P’s relationship with P’s Sister appeared to be secure. P’s Sister claimed that P had confided in her over his personal matters, particularly over his divorce from P’s Ex-Wife and provided some examples of text messages from P updating her on the sale of the matrimonial properties and his acquisition of new residence. Given the status of their fairly close relationship, P had also facilitated P’s Sister’s contact with P’s 2 Sons, where messages were provided evidencing that the P’s 2 Sons would independently seek to speak with P’s Sister and provide her with updates. P’s Sister’s son was also allowed by P to utilize the facilities at P’s residence. P and P’s Sister would also have regular meetups for family events. While P had more frequent contact with P’s Ex-Wife, these do seem to be centred around P’s 2 Sons, whereas P’s contact with P’s Sister while less frequent, was consistent and friendly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     According to P’s Sister, just prior to his stroke, P had voluntarily intimated to her that he was dating another woman and was in a “<em>long term relationship</em>” since sometime in 2022. P’s Ex-Wife was unaware of any such person. However, since P’s stroke, no such person has come forward and parties could not locate any such person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Other than P’s 2 Sons, P’s Sister would be P’s closest family member. By all accounts, it appeared that P was fairly involved in the lives of P’s Sons. He would regularly spend a significant portion of the weekends with P’s Sons, and this also at times involved spending time with P’s Ex-Wife and the Little Boy. P would volunteer to ferry P’s 2 Sons to various activities and events. P had stated over a text message that if he were to pass, he would want each of his 2 Sons to inherit half of P’s Condominium Apartment. Had P’s 2 Sons been of age, strong consideration would have been given to them potentially being P’s deputies. However, P’s eldest Son was still about half a decade away from reaching the age of majority.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     According to P’s Sister, for reasons best known to P’s Ex-Wife, she had always acted in a hostile and antagonistic manner towards P’s Sister. Prior to P’s stroke, they had ceased all forms of communication since 2016 (i.e. about 7 years). P’s Ex-Wife’s WhatsApp messages to P’s Sister over P’s care do evidence seemingly unprovoked rudeness on P’s Ex-Wife’s side. P’s Ex-Wife conversely alleged that P’s Sister held animosity towards her for P’s Sister’s perception over how P’s Ex-Wife’s martial relationship with P had fallen apart.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     P’s Sister claimed that she and her family used to maintain a close and loving relationship with P’s 2 Sons, but given P’s Ex-Wife involving them in Court proceedings, that this relationship has since soured. P’s Sister, however, remained open with interacting with P’s 2 Sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">P’s stroke and subsequent hospitalization.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On 23 March 2023, P suffered sudden onset of right-sided weakness (i.e. hemiplegia) and difficulty talking. He was admitted to National University Hospital (“<b>NUH</b>”) where he was diagnosed with a left-sided haemorrhagic stroke. An emergency craniectomy was conducted. A 2<sup>nd</sup> surgery was also conducted on 26 March 2023 to relieve pressure in his brain. When his condition improved, he was transferred to Alexandra Hospital (“<b>AH</b>”) on 14 April 2023 for rehabilitation. P was initially making incremental improvements post-stroke on this basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     However, P had to be readmitted to NUH for an infection and swelling in June 2023, where he suffered two (2) seizures and pneumonia. He was then diagnosed with ischemic stroke. He was subsequently transferred to AH for a rehabilitative program in July 2023, and then to Crawfurd Hospital before being transferred to All Saints Home (Jurong East) (“<b>ASH</b>”) on 9 October 2023, where he remains. P’s accommodation at ASH was a non-airconditioned ward that was shared with seven (7) other residents. P’s Ex-Wife had provided a portable evaporative air cooler to make his stay more comfortable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     When P first suffered his stroke on 23 March 2023, P’s Ex-Wife was initially appointed by NUH to be P’s spokesperson. However, sometime around 25 March 2023, P’s Ex-Wife voluntarily relinquished this role and P’s Sister was appointed as P’s spokesperson. After 31 March 2023, P’s Ex-Wife was purportedly not allowed to visit P for a period of time. P’s Ex-Wife subsequently resumed visits with P at ASH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties contact with P</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Both P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister alleged that the other had attempted to restrict access. P’s Ex-Wife alleged that P’s Sister had banned her and her mother from visiting P when he was in AH. P’s Sister did not deny an initial limitation of access, but maintained that P’s 2 Sons were always at liberty to have access to P. According to P’s Sister, there was nothing to suggest at that point in time that P’s Ex-Wife and P had reconciled for P’s Ex-Wife to be provided such access. P’s Ex-Wife claimed that by not allowing P’s Ex-Wife or her mother from accessing P during those initial periods limited P’s Sons access to P as they needed to be accompanied. Such restrictions were subsequently lifted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On the other hand, P’s Sister alleged that P’s Ex-Wife had repeatedly attempted to obstruct her and her family from visiting P at NUH and demanded that P’s family members, including P’s cousins, vacate the hospital ward, insisting that P’s Ex-Wife be provided with the space for her alone. P’s Sister alleged that it was P’s Ex-Wife who initiated hostility and tried to alienate his family members from visiting him. P’s Sister insisted that she consistently ensured that P’s Ex-Wife and P’s 2 Sons were kept informed of P’s medical condition and that P’s Ex-Wife blocked all correspondence from her instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     P’s Ex-Wife claimed that she and P’s 2 Sons would visit regularly while P was at NUH, AH and ASH. According to P’s Ex-Wife’s recounting of events, she was very involved in P’s care and that she would bring entertainment shows for P to watch and did other things to make his stay more comfortable. P’s Wife further claimed that P’s Sons expressed exasperation at the limitations on visitation and what they could do with P at ASH. Moreover, they did not stay near ASH and would have to travel far to visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Despite P’s Ex-Wife’s claims of being very concerned over P’s care, subsequent records of visitation of P at ASH for the months of March and April 2025 revealed that after the filing of the initial rounds of affidavits around November 2024, P’s Ex-Wife and P’s 2 Sons appeared to have ceased visits and had not visited P for about half a year by the time of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     P’s Ex-Wife claimed that she befriended an elderly lady whose husband was in the same ward as P and who would share updates on P’s condition with her. While some WhatsApp messages were exhibited, they included only voice memos, and no recordings or transcripts were provided to verify this claim. In any event, P’s Ex-Wife’s position was that she was the one that best knew P and could attend to his needs, however, her interest in caring for P appeared to have waned after parties were under the impression that evidence had closed. Even if she got regular updates, by not visiting P, she was unable to perform any acts of service that she purported gave P much comfort. Additionally, P would not have had the benefit of seeing his Sons during this period of time. In contrast, records reflect that P’s Sister maintained regular visitation with P throughout proceedings and remained concerned about his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, P’s Sister had named NUH and AH as the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Respondents. However, when they were served on NUH and AH, they had indicated that there was &quot;<em>[n]o such Patient’s name</em>” and their representatives did not participate in any of the hearings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">P’s Assets, Financial Matters and Business Affairs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     P and P’s Ex-Wife had 2 properties together when they were married, and the Interim Judgment included orders for P to transfer his rights on both properties to P’s Ex-Wife, with P’s Ex-Wife paying him a sum of S$340,000. By the time of these proceedings, P’s Ex-Wife had sold off the properties and was renting her residence, with the intentions of subsequently acquiring a property as her home with P’s Sons and the Little Boy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In or around May 2019, after P and P’s Ex-Wife had divorced, P acquired a private Condominium Apartment (“<b>P’s Condominium Apartment</b>”) where he resided in till his stroke. P’s Sons would also reside with P at P’s Condominium Apartment during his access with them, which was usually over weekends. P’s Sons were provided with an access card, passcodes and a duplicate set of keys to P’s Condominium Apartment, which P’s Ex-Wife was also able to use. According to P’s Ex-Wife, she would stay at P’s Condominium Apartment on occasion and would even conduct some of her zoom classes from his residence on Fridays and weekends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     P was also a businessman involved in three (3) companies involved in the care and works for automobiles, with a business partner (the “<b>Business Partner</b>”). The Business Partner was named as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondent in OSM 184 but chose not to participate in proceedings. Based on the accounts provided by both sides, it appeared that the companies were not doing particularly well and may have been running losses. Hence, the reason why P was seeking loans from P’s Sister and P’s Ex-Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Besides P’s Condominium Apartment and businesses, P had 2 other assets which parties had significant dispute over: P’s Car and P’s Mobile Phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     When P suffered a stroke, P’s Car had been left parked somewhere around a temple. P’s Ex-Wife was informed of this and proceeded to remove P’s Car from this location and drove it back to her residence. Thereafter, P’s Ex-Wife continued to make the hire-purchase instalment payments for P’s Car and would use it every now and then purportedly to maintain P’s Car and to ferry P’s Sons. P’s Sister did not take issue over the removal of P’s Car from the temple so as to not incur further charges or the vehicle being towed but took issue that P’s Ex-Wife had refused to account for P’s Car until P’s Sister had to engage a private investigator and provided evidence that it was in P’s Ex-Wife’s possession and that she used it fairly frequently. When the Court directed that more information over the use of P’s Car, it was belatedly revealed that in the midst of proceedings, without seeking an interim order, P’s Ex-Wife unilaterally decided to sell P’s Car back to the car dealership. Due to the outstanding hire purchase sums, there was purportedly no balance value from the sale to be credited to P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     With regard to P’s Mobile Phone, P’s Ex-Wife also initially failed to account for it. In the course of proceedings, it was revealed that P’s Ex-Wife had made the unilateral decision to give P’s Mobile Phone to P’s eldest Son and transferred the mobile line into her own name for his personal use. Additionally, P’s Ex-Wife had exhibited transcripts of WhatsApp text messages between P and herself, which she claimed came from P’s Mobile Phone and not hers as such information was no longer available on hers. When P’s Sister applied to inspect the original messages on P’s Mobile Phone to consider whether she was going to challenge the authenticity of the messages, P’s Ex-Wife claimed that it was not in her possession, custody or power as she had given it to P’s eldest Son, even though she had utilized the same to produce transcripts of her and P’s past correspondence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     With regard to P’s maintenance for P’s 2 Sons, he was obliged by the Interim Judgment to make monthly payments for the maintenance of P’s Sons of S$1,600 every month, P’s Ex-Wife claimed that she initially reduced it down to S$1,200 and then did not insist on its payment, when she knew that P was tight on cash around November 2022. P’s Ex-Wife claimed to have instead provided P with some money for his meals with P’s Sons when he brought them out, but there was no supporting documentation for this. P’s Ex-Wife had initially sought for the power as P’s deputy to rent out P’s Condominium Apartment and for the rental proceeds after deducted S$1,000 for P’s expenses, to be deposited into a joint account between P and P’s 2 Sons. When asked whether this was to fulfil P’s maintenance requirements for P’s Sons, who were to be considered as P’s dependents, or whether this was effectively P’s Ex-Wife gifting money due to P to P’s Sons, which is not something a deputy is allowed to do, P’s Ex-Wife withdrew this request. She further took the position that she would not be seeking that such maintenance order be enforced against P. It is noteworthy that if that was pursued, that would have placed P’s Ex-Wife in conflict of interest against P’s interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">History of MCA Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     OSM 184 was commenced by P’s Ex-Wife on 15 June 2023, naming P’s Sister and the Business Partner as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Respondents and sought a declaration that P lacked mental capacity in relation to decisions relating to both personal welfare and property and affairs and that P’s Ex-Wife be appointed to be P’s sole deputy in all matters. The powers sought included general financial management of P’s funds, making insurance claims and the leasing out or sale of P’s Condominium Apartment. This application was filed without a doctor’s affidavit and also sought, among other things, an interim order pursuant to section 36 of the MCA that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     NUH and AH to provide medical reports on P to P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Ex-Wife be granted access to P’s medical records;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     P’s 2 Sons, P’s Ex-Wife and her mother be permitted to have liberal, unsupervised access to P and AH or other facilities P is transferred to;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     P’s Sister be prohibited from accessing P’s Condominium Apartment; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)     P’s Sister and her spouse are to account for all property and documents belonging to P, which they obtained access to from 20 April 2023 to the date of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As mentioned in paragraph 31 above, P’s Business Partner did not participate in proceedings. P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister attended a 1<sup>st</sup> case conference for the matter before District Judge Colin Tan (“<b>DJ Colin Tan</b>”) on 4 August 2025. DJ Colin Tan declined to make any of the interim orders at this juncture. With regard to medical reporting and records, as NUH and AH were not parties to proceedings, no orders could be made against them. With regard to access, it was questionable whether P would even know he had visitors. In any event, there was no dispute over P’s 2 Sons being able to see P and given their age, they would be able to see P without having P’s Ex-Wife or her mother present. Given parties disputed positions, DJ Colin Tan decided that it would be difficult to say with great confidence that such visits from P's Ex-Wife and her mother should be allowed without delay and declined making interim orders in this regard. As P’s Sister indicated that she intended to make a cross-application, directions were given by DJ Colin Tan on its filing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     OSM 286 was then filed by P’s Sister on 30 August 2023, naming P’s Ex-Wife, NUH and AH as the 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> Respondents. NUH and AH did not participate in these proceedings. P’s Sister also sought a declaration that P lacked mental capacity in relation to decisions relating to both personal welfare and property and affairs and that P’s Sister be appointed to be P’s sole deputy in all matters. This application was filed with a doctor’s affidavit on P’s lack of mental capacity and also sought an interim order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     NUH and AH to provide medical reports on P and P’s Sister be granted access to P’s medical records;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     P reside with P’s Sister or in a nursing home at P’s Sister’s discretion;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     P’s Sister be the sole person to deal with medical social workers for P and to make enquiries;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     P’s Ex-Wife be excluded from P’s Condominium Apartment;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>(e)     an account for all of P’s property held by P’s Ex-Wife and to hand them over to P’s Sister; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_f\"></a>(f)     P’s Ex-Wife “<em>shall not question [P’s Sister] aboutor [sic] interfere with the decision that would be made by [P’s Sister]</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     At the 2<sup>nd</sup> case conference and 3<sup>rd</sup> case conference before DJ Colin Tan on 8 September and 27 October 2023, more time was requested for certain filings which were allowed with a costs order of S$400 made against P’s Ex-Wife for delay. Further requests for fixing were filed and allowed before Parties were fixed for a 4<sup>th</sup> case conference before me on 6 December 2023 as DJ Colin Tan had retired. Given what parties raised, I directed for the filing of summonses for the outstanding issues and fixed a hearing on 10 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     On 5 January 2024, P’s Ex-Wife filed FC/SUM 61/2024 (“<b>SUM 61</b>”) for leave to file further affidavits and FC/SUM 90/2024 (“<b>SUM 90</b>”) for the medical examination of P and the preparation of a home care suitability report. At the 5<sup>th</sup> case conference on 10 January 2024, directions were provided for the necessary filings for the summonses. At the 6<sup>th</sup> case conference and hearing of SUM 61 on 6 February 2024, orders were granted for a further affidavit to be filed and directions were provided for this filing. On 7 February 2024, P’s Ex-Wife filed her affidavit and P’s Sister filed her reply affidavits on 13 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     At this 7<sup>th</sup> case conference and hearing of SUM 90 on 19 March 2024, I heard parties on the issue of the interim orders being sought. I pointed out that as explained in <b><em>Goh Tze Chien v Tan Teow Chee &amp; Anor</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30861-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 1</a> (“<b><em>Goh Tze Chien</em></b>”) and <b><em>ULP &amp; Ors v ULS</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21771-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 43</a>, medical assessments of P should not be ordered under an interim order pursuant to section 36 of the MCA. Instead, it would require P to be named as a party and the Court making an order for P to undergo medical examination. Upon request, the matter was stood down for instructions to be taken. After which, the Ex-Wife withdrew the application and ordered costs of S$2,500 payable by P’s Ex-Wife to P’s Sister. I directed parties to consider whether any further applications needed to be filed or whether they would agree to updated medical reporting on P and fixed timelines for the exchange of proposals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     At the 8<sup>th</sup> case conference on 16 April 2024, I repeated my observations that the medical report appeared to be done shortly after P suffered a stroke and that there was a fair possibility of significant improvements in the year after stroke and asked parties to consider whether they would agree with each other to get an updated medical report on P’s mental capacity. Both P’s Ex-wife and P’s Sister had attested to noticing improvements in P’s condition where P appeared to make some cogent forms of communication. Hence, there was an in-principle agreement to get such an updated report. Subsequent to this, the matter was adjourned a few times for the necessary work done to get an updated medical reporting and I had seen P’s Ex-Wife’s for the 9<sup>th</sup> case conference on 14 May 2024 as a request to refix hearing was applied and approved just before this case conference. A further request for refixing was allowed adjourning the next hearing from 18 June to 16 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     At the 10<sup>th</sup> case conference on 16 July 2024, by consent, I ordered that: “<em>[t]hat [the doctor how had been treating P at NUH], care of National University of Singapore, NUH, produce an updated medical report and doctor’s affidavit on the current condition of [P] for the court’s purpose of determining the necessary mental capacity orders (i.e. deputyship and level and preference of care) and that [P’s Sister] be authorized to receive said medical report and doctor’s affidavit to be filed in proceedings.</em>” Through subsequent correspondence in OHRRs, several adjournments were granted for the doctor assessing P to further review the appropriate care necessary given P’s condition and his Affidavit was eventually filed on 12 December 2024, where it was confirmed that P continued to lack mental capacity and that he could be cared for in a Nursing Home (i.e. low intensity level healthcare facility) or at home, provided that there were at least 2 dedicated caregivers who were able to give full time care and modifications to be made by recommendation by an occupational therapist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     At the 11<sup>th</sup> case conference on 28 January 2025, I saw parties and gave directions for the necessary filings of written submissions for the hearing of both OSM 184 and 286 by 10 March 2024 and this direction was duly complied with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     At the 1<sup>st</sup> half-day Hearing on 17 March 2025, I heard parties for their oral arguments and provided a list of 11 matters for parties to address by the filing of supplementary affidavits by 14 April 2025 and for a further hearing 21 April 2025. Parties filed their affidavits on these matters on 15 April 2025, after a request for extension of time was filed the day before and approved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     At the 2<sup>nd</sup> half-day Hearing on 21 April 2025, I noted that P’s Sister had considered her husband and son to be relevant persons, but their consents had not been filed, and I directed this to be corrected, which was done on 23 April 2025. At this hearing, P’s Sister also raised issues relating to consistency of positions taken by P’s Ex-Wife’s counsel in an Other Hearing Related Request (“<b>OHRR</b>”) and P’s Ex-Wife’s tenancy agreement that had been disclosed in the P’s Ex-Wife’s affidavit filed on 15 April 2025. There were also issues of the authenticity of documents and purported new allegations made. Directions were provided to follow-up on this, as well as an additional list of concerns was raise with parties to address and the matter was adjourned for a further hearing on 30 May 2025. Consequentially, both P’s Sister and P’s Ex-Wife filed their further affidavits on 30 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On 14 May 2025, P’s Ex-Wife filed an OHRR requesting to file an affidavit to reply to P’s Sister’s Affidavit filed on 30 April 2025 on purported new matters raised. A reply affidavit by P’s Ex-Wife was directed to be filed by 19 May 2025 and for parties to make arguments as to whether any portions of P’s Sister’s Affidavit filed on 30 April 2025 needed to be expunged. Then on 16 May 2025, P’s Sister filed an OHRR reserving the position to apply to expunge portions of P’s Ex-Wife’s Affidavit. P’s Ex-Wife’s further affidavit was this filed on 19 May 2025. Then on 22 May 2025, P’s Sister filed an OHRR taking objection to P’s Ex-Wife’s affidavit and seeking that it be wholly expunged, but this position was subsequently adjusted to cover specific paragraphs. P’s Ex-Wife filed a further OHRR on 23 May 2025 on their objections. The Court replied, retaining the hearing on 30 May 2025 for parties to address their issues to the Court. Supplementary Written Submissions were filed by P’s Ex-Wife on 26 May 2025 and P’s Sister on 29 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     At the 3<sup>rd</sup> half-day Hearing on 30 May 2025, I allowed P’s Ex-Wife’s Affidavit but reserved costs on it. P’s Sister raised the issue of not being able to verify the authenticity of certain text messages as P’s Ex-Wife had claimed that the messages on her phone had been lost as she had changed phones and refused for P’s Mobile Phone, which was held by P’s eldest Son, to be inspected to verify the authenticity of the messages. I did not allow any further discovery but allowed parties to make arguments on conduct of parties for final oral submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     There was also an issue in relation to paragraph 18.3 of the Ex-Wife’s affidavit filed on 19 May 2025 in relation to lawyer’s conduct. It was alleged that there was an inconsistency in P’s Sister’s evidence given that her lawyer failed to mention his call with an officer of the ASH in an email sent by him to that officer of ASH. P’s Sister’s lawyer took issue with the suggestion that he had not made this call and that it ran afoul of Rule 39 of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules 2015 by not giving him forewarning of an allegation made against solicitor. I allowed P’s Sister’s lawyer to file an affidavit by 6 June 2025 in response to this issue to place his clarification on record. I then finished hearing further oral arguments from both P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister on the main matter and reserved judgment for 30 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     After the hearing, on 6 June 2025, P’s Sister’s lawyer file his affidavit confirming that he made a call to the specific officer in question of ASH on 29 April 2025 and had a partial audio recording of the call, which was provided with a transcript. On 12 June 2025, P’s Ex-Wife’s lawyer filed an OHRR to enclose their correspondence with P’s Sister’s lawyer to state that there were no allegations of misconduct made against lawyer, and that it was just the Ex-Wife’s observations. On 17 June 2025, P’s Sister’s lawyer replied with an OHRR for completeness on the correspondence up to 13 June 2025, which rejected this clarification provided by P’s Ex-Wife and that P’s Sister’s Counsel was prepared to address at the start of the further hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Then on the 4<sup>th</sup> half-day Hearing on 30 June 2025, I allowed each side’s lawyers to state their position on the aforementioned issue for the record. I then rendered decision in favour of P’s Sister and went through with parties on my oral grounds of decision. I heard parties on costs and disbursements and ordered an order for costs of S$20,000 payable by P’s Ex-Wife to P’s Sister, but for the costs to be equally split between OSM 184 and OSM 286 and directed parties to correspondence on disbursements. However, I reserve the making of the final orders till 8 July 2025, as I required P’s sister to finalize a draft copy of the orders and the scope of powers of deputyship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     At the 5<sup>th</sup> half-day Hearing on 8 July 2025, final orders were made and I recorded the agreement on disbursements and included a roughly half share of these disbursements into each of the costs orders in OSM 184 and OSM 286.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Being dissatisfied with my decision P’s Ex-Wife filed HCF/DCA 80/2025 in relation to my decision in OSM 184 and HCF/DCA 81/2025 in relation to my decision in OSM 286 on 18 July 2025 with new lawyers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     As of 17 July 2025, P’s Ex-Wife filed a Notice of Change of Solicitors in both proceedings appointing Covenant Chambers LLC to replace Lexcompass LLC. This set of new counsel are representing P’s Ex-Wife for the appeals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties Cases and Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As previously mentioned, both P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister sought for a declaration that P lacked mental capacity to make decisions in relation to P’s personal welfare and property and affairs and that they each desired to be appointed as P’s sole deputy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     P’s Ex-Wife further sought that P be moved from a nursing home to reside in her rented residence and to be cared by her and a domestic helper. Additionally, she wanted P’s Condominium Apartment to be preserved for P’s 2 Sons and that it be rented to generate income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Conversely, P’s Sister sought for P to remain at ASH. With regard to P’s Condominium Apartment, she was seeking to sell it if necessary to meet P’s needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In these 2 OSMs, the key issues that required the Courts determination were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether P lacked mental capacity;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_b\"></a>(b)     who should be P’s deputy/deputies; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_58-p2_c\"></a>(c)     what powers should be granted for such deputyship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: P’s Mental Capacity </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I do agree with P’s Ex-Wife’s submissions that pursuant to section 4(1) of the MCA, a person is determined to lack mental capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time the person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself in relation to the matter because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain. P’s inability to make decisions for himself is further determined on the 4 limbs of section 5(1) of the MCA, namely:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_a\"></a>(a)     to understand the information relevant to the decision;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_b\"></a>(b)     to retain that information;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_c\"></a>(c)     to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_59-p2_d\"></a>(d)     to communicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any other means).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Court of Appeal in <b><em>Re BKR </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17323-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 26</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17722-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 81</a></b> expounded that the test in s 4(1) of the MCA has a functional component: on P being unable to make decisions and a clinical component: on this inability being due to a form of mental impairment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Given the most recent reporting by P’s doctor, it was undisputed that P lacked the ability to make decisions on all 4 facets under section 5(1) of the MCA for both personal welfare and property and affairs as a result of left-sided haemorrhagic stroke. Hence, both functional and clinical components were satisfied. Thus, a declaration was ordered that P lacked mental capacity in relation to decisions relating to both P’s personal welfare and property and affairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     This issue was agreed to by both P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister. The main contention was where P was to be cared for, who were to be P’s deputy/deputies and what powers should the deputy have, in particular whether they should be authorized to sell P’s Condominium Apartment, which are addressed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Whether P is to be cared for in a Nursing Home or in Home Care</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     With regard to nursing home or home care, P’s doctor had opined that P could be safely taken care at a low intensity level healthcare facility, such as a nursing home or at home with 2 dedicated caregivers who are able to provide him with full-time care and that the necessary modifications as recommended by an occupational therapist to the home be made to optimized case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     P’s condition did not require intensive medical attention or 24-hour supervision that a nursing home would provide. While nursing homes, in general, can provide excellent care, all things being equal, if medical attention is not regularly required, home care would be preferable, as in an ideal situation, there would be people who are familiar with P, who know how to interpret P’s gestures, have a keen understanding of his preferences and attend to P’s needs on a more dedicated basis. However, this hinged on whether there are appropriate measures that can be implemented to allow for such home care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     P’s Ex-Wife had proffered that she and her domestic helper, who had received basic training on caring for a person in P’s condition, could care for P and that her mother, who would visit often, could also assist. She has also indicated that she intends to employ an additional caregiver. P’s Ex-Wife further claimed that she and her mother had prior experience caring for her late father who also had similar issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Because P’s Ex-Wife is seeking to care for P at her home, it would not be unreasonable for the Court to insist that a party be obliged to engage a domestic helper, or 2 domestic helpers if their financial circumstances allow for it. P’s Ex-Wife claimed that she and her domestic helper who be able to serve as the 2 dedicated caregivers and was willing to hire another domestic helper. I have to take into consideration that P’s Ex-Wife had a full-time job providing private tuition and there is a young child, the Little Boy, to care for. While it is alleged that the Little Boy is in the care of P’s Ex-Wife’s mother, the intention was for all of them to be cared for together at P’s Ex-Wife’s residence eventually. Moreover, I had to further take into consideration that the current domestic helper was already assisting the family in their daily needs and was not dedicate to just P’s care. There was thus, some concern as to whether P’s Ex-Wife was able to satisfy the Court that there were 2 dedicated caregivers to care for P at her residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Additionally, the place that P’s Ex-Wife resided at was a rental apartment. Any modifications to this residence would be subject to landlord’s approval, which P’s Ex-Wife stated she had for making a partition in the living room for P’s care. It is unclear to what extent P’s Ex-Wife is able to make further modifications to the apartment for P’s care. She could not provide any strong written documentation to confirm that she had the landlord’s approval to make such changes. Additionally, the apartment had not been reviewed by an occupational therapist on what would be the appropriate measures that needed to be taken to facilitate P’s care. Besides the purchase of significant equipment, recommended modifications may involve the widening of doors, such as for access to the toilets and bathrooms or installation of handles and ramps. Moreover, P’s Ex-Wife had moved several times since the divorce and had hoped to purchase a new permanent residence in the future for her, P’s Sons and the Little Boy to reside in, but had no concrete plans on that front. Hence, any stay at P’s Ex-Wife’s residence may be transient and further costs would need to be incurred to return the residence to its original state to the landlord when the tenancy was up and in outfitting any new residence acquired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     As rightfully pointed out by P’s Sister, in <b><em>WVG v WVH and another </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31182-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 14</a></b> (“<b><em>WVG v WVH</em></b>”), the Learned District Judge Shobha Nair (“<b>DJ Shobha</b>”) affirmed at [13] the fundamental principle that “<em>there is a need for stable and sustainable care for persons without mental capacity</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Hence, there was significant concern over whether P’s Ex-Wife would be able to satisfy the necessary arrangements for P to be transferred from the nursing home into her home care. This was exacerbated by the fact that the living circumstances would not be permanent. Most importantly, whether P could be cared for at P’s Ex-Wife’s residence hinged on whether she was determined to be the deputy or one of the deputies for P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Choice of Deputy</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Both P’s Sister and P’s Ex-Wife have sought to be named as P’s sole deputy. If P’s Ex-Wife were to be appointed as a deputy, because she is no longer married to P and thus not related to P by blood or marriage, pursuant to Rule 176 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (which is substantively similar to FJGR P. 5 r. 7), permission would be required as she was not one of the categories of persons where permission is not required. Whereas, P’s Sister as a blood relative, would not require such permission. However, not all siblings are close, and not all divorced parties are acrimonious. There was no question that the marriage between P and P’s Ex-Wife was over, and they had not since then rekindle a romance with each other. The question was whether or not there was another existing relationship which was close enough that she may be able to better discern his needs for P’s best interest than P’s Sister. Hence, the facts had to be examined to determine who would be better placed to be P’s deputy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Both sides had relied on case law on the Court’s selection of P’s deputy/deputies, which are analysed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     P’s Sister cited the Family Division of the High Court decision in <b><em>WLR &amp; Anor v WLT &amp; Anor </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29728-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 24</a></b> (“<b><em>WLR v WLT</em></b>”) for the importance of continuity in care and that P’s welfare was to be entrusted to someone with an established history of managing P’s affairs. P’s Sister argued that since P suffered a stroke, she has been the one managing P’s affairs and thus status quo was in favour of her being appointed as P’s deputy. Status quo is indeed a significant factor. However, I have to note that P’s Sister’s involvement in P’s care and life occurred largely after P lost mental capacity and there has been no evidence that she was significantly involved in P’s life save for visits during Chinese New Year and certain occasions, prior to him suffering a stroke. So, while it is pertinent to consider the care provided after P loss mental capacity, the Court also needed to consider the circumstances of the level of involvement and continuity of care prior to P losing mental capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In <b><em>WVG v WVH</em></b>, also relied on by P’s Sister, it was argued that the Courts should exercise caution in appointing a deputy where there were prior allegations of financial irregularities or when P had been recently divorced. This was actually a case where the plaintiff, who had been in a romantic relationship with P applied to revoke the Order appointing P’s children and ex-wife as deputies on the basis that they failed to disclose her relationship with P to the Court. DJ Shobha found that there was no need to revoke the appointment as a result of this omission to the Court. The omission, while regrettable was not fatal, and maintained the previously appointed deputies as they were still found to be the more appropriate persons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     P’s Sister also relied on the case decided in the United Kingdom of <b><em>Re Various Incapacitated Persons </em></b><b>[2018] EWCOP 3</b>, which actually centred on the issue of the appointment of trust corporations as deputies. It was claimed that the key attributes of a suitable deputy included the ability to competently discharge their responsibilities, pre-existing relationship with P, financial probity and prior experience in overseeing P’s affairs. P’s Sister argued that this was a persuasive authority that should be applied here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     P’s Ex-Wife relied on the case of <b><em>WBK v WBL </em></b><b>[2024] SLR(FC) 192</b>, (“<b><em>WBK v WBL</em></b>”) which was also decided by DJ Shobha in relation to the rights and responsibilities of donees appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney and the making of declarations on the lawfulness of certain acts. Even though this case related to donees, P’s Ex-Wife relied on [25] of <b><em>WBK </em></b><b>v </b><b><em>WBL</em></b> where DJ Shobha made a comparison of the choice of donees to the appointment of deputies by the Court. DJ Shobha had stated in this analysis, that access to P by P’s family members was something that ought to be encouraged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The case law pointed out above were all valuable considerations, but overall, the role of the Court in selecting who should be P’s deputy/deputies was on the basis of what would be in P’s best interests. Section 6 of the MCA addresses the issue of what is in P’s best interests and specifically provides at section 6(8) of the MCA that the Court should consider the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_76-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the person’s past and present wishes and feelings (and in particular, any relevant written statement made by the person when the person had capacity);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_76-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the beliefs and values that would be likely to influence his or her decision if the person had capacity; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_76-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the other factors that the person would be likely to consider if the person were able to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Hence, the choice of P’s deputy/deputies is analysed through this lens below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Documentation on P’s Past Wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     To discern P’s past wishes, other than each party giving their account, documentary evidence would be useful for the court to discern what those past wishes were. In this case, though it was alleged by P’s Sister that there had been a Will executed by P, even after an opportunity was provided for both sides to make the necessary enquiries to produce one, neither of them could provide any documentation to show that any such Will made by P was registered on the Will Registry and P’s Ex-Wife further made enquiries to a law firm, Amarick Gill LLC, who had acted for P in the divorce proceedings, and they confirmed that they had not assisted in a drafting of a Will for P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Both sides also confirmed that there are no records of a Lasting Power of Attorney (“<b>LPA</b>”) executed by P and/or registered with the Office of the Public Guardian. A Will or an LPA (even if not in compliance with registration) would be documents that would help reflect on who P believed to be the appropriate persons to manage his property an affairs and also personal welfare matters if P were no longer to make such decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     Hence, besides some records of text messages and social media postings where P’s past wishes could potentially be inferred, there was no strong documentary evidence on P’s past or even present wishes as to who would be best to manage his personal welfare and property and affairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">P’s Beliefs and Values</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     On P’s beliefs and values, P’s Sister argued that P’s act of initiating divorce against P’s Ex-Wife indicated that he wanted nothing to do with P’s Ex-Wife, save for dealing with matters relating to P’s 2 Sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On this, I do note that that divorce was filed in 2018 on an uncontested basis, and while the factual circumstances surrounding the case seemed to suggest that there was some form of improper association on P’s Ex-Wife’s side, this was not something alleged in the divorce filings itself. What was, however, alleged for the grounds of divorce was that P and P’s Wife would have “<em>many disagreements and quarrels</em>” and P found P’s Ex-Wife to be a “<em>stubborn and level-headed individual and does not provide room for negotiations whenever parties are having discussions</em>”. Additionally, P had alleged that P’s Ex-Wife “<em>also refuses to give [P] an opportunity to explain or reason himself when he made certain suggestions</em>” and that there would be “<em>outburst of anger</em>” by P’s Ex-Wife, which would leave their issues/differences unresolved. Moreover, P took issue with P’s Ex-Wife keeping “<em>late nights away from [P} and the family</em>”, and that she did not “<em>carry out her duties as a wife</em>”, leaving the home messy for P to clean up and do household chores even after work. As P’s Ex-Wife filed no Defence in response to P’s Statement of Particulars, it was deemed that these allegations were uncontroverted, and divorce was granted on such grounds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     That being said, P suffered a stroke in 2023, which was about 5 years after the divorce. During this period, P and P’s Ex-Wife appeared to have a cordial relationship. However, a significant portion of the correspondence between them was on coparenting, and while there was further interactions on other financial and personal matters, it was unclear if the same difficulties P took issue with P’s Ex-Wife in the divorce filings still existed and just that as they were no longer living as husband and wife that such similar issues did not arise. These issues of P’s Ex-Wife not taking his views into consideration were significant when a deputy would be empowered to make decisions on behalf of P and to make them in a manner that would be consistent with P’s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     P’s Statement of Particulars which was then affirmed in an Affidavit of Evidence in Chief was the only strong documentary evidence as to his feelings, beliefs and values that came directly from P and had to be given due weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     As stated above in <b><em>WVG v WVH</em></b>, the Court should exercise caution in appointing a deputy where there were prior allegations of financial irregularities or when P had been recently divorced. While the divorce was not recent, and there was about half a decade till P suffered a stroke, I had to take into cognisance of P’s choice to sever their marital status and ties to P’s Ex-Wife as husband and wife. He was the plaintiff in the divorce and there was some suggestion that he had a new romantic partner, but who does not appear to be in the scene any longer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Hence, for me to consider P’s Ex-Wife as P’s deputy, there would need to be cogent evidence that despite the divorce, that she would be the more appropriate person to be appointed deputy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ Behaviour</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Given that there was no other strong documentary evidence on P’s wishes, feelings, beliefs and values, the Court had to consider the other factors of parties’ behaviour and how this reflected on whether they could be able to handle the responsibility of making decisions on behalf of P as P’s deputy/deputies that would further P’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I have to also take into consideration that P’s Ex-Wife gave birth to the Little Boy out of wedlock. P’s Sister alleged that to make P reside in the same residence with the Little Boy would present a constant reminder to P of P’s Ex-Wife’s infidelity. Based on P’s Ex-Wife’s exhibition of WhatsApp messages and photographs, P appeared to have taken a shine to the Little Boy and appeared to have welcomed the Little Boy and P’s Ex-Wife to stay over at his residence. However, the Little Boy’s existence was kept secret and only revealed in proceedings when P’s Sister had first raised issues in relation to this and the Court had to direct for further affidavits to be filed. P’s Ex-Wife claimed that she had concealed the Little Boy’s existence as she did not want to get him involved. It was notable that this was not the only concealment or obfuscation. The fact that P’s Ex-Wife also had to care for the Little Boy was a significant factor for determining whether P’s Ex-Wife was able to dedicate time to fully care for P at her residence. Also, given that P’s Ex-Wife claimed that the original messages had been lost with the change of her phone and that she refused to allow P’s Sister to inspect the authenticity of the messages on P’s Mobile Phone which was in the hands of P’s eldest Son, even though it was within her power to do so, this further called P’s Ex-Wife’s candour into question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     It was argued by P’s Ex-Wife that her financial support for the paying of P’s Car hire-purchase instalments, mortgage instalments and certain insurance premiums after he suffered a stroke was an indicator that she was being selfless in caring for P. On the other hand, P’s Sister claimed are self-interested as P’s 2 Sons were eventual beneficiaries of P’s Condominium Apartment and Insurance Policies. On this, there was evidence presented that some of the insurance policies were for P’s benefit but a significant portion of these insurance policies were also in relation to life polices for P’s Sons to be able collect on after P’s passing. Towards this end, in the Interim Judgment for divorce, it had been explicitly specified that P “<em>shall not terminate his life insurance policy with NTUC Income Insurance Cooperative …. And shall pay on time all necessary premium to maintain the policy for the benefit of [P’s Sons] absolutely</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     With regard to P’s Car, P’s Ex-Wife appeared to have acted without authorization on multiple occasions. As mentioned earlier, when P suffered a stroke P’s Car had been left unattended near a temple and P’s Ex-Wife proceeded to commandeer his keys and moved P’s Car to her own car park. P’s Sister conceded that the moving of the car was not the issue, as it avoided P getting into trouble for it being left parked in public incurring charges. However, P’s Sister complained that P’s Ex-Wife had been utilizing P’s Car significantly for her own purposes and this appeared to be supported by a private investigator’s report (“<b>PI Report</b>”). This report was necessitated as P’s Ex-Wife had also concealed that she was in possession of P’s Car. She took inconsistent positions initially claiming not to have P’s Car or car keys but subsequently revealed it when found to be untruthful given the PI Report. This was another instance where P’s Ex-Wife obfuscated. P’s Ex-Wife had attempted to explain on the use of P’s Car, that after it had been transported over to her home, it was largely left idle, but it had to be used every now and then to run arrands with P’s Sons, to ensure it was still serviceable. I accept that the occasional use of P’s Car would be basic car maintenance. To determine whether P’s Car had been abused by P’s Ex-Wife and used for purposes other than P’s care and maintenance or the care and maintenance of P’s dependants, i.e. P’s 2 Sons, I directed P’s Ex-Wife to disclose the mileage on P’s car. It was only at this point that it was subsequently revealed that P’s Ex-Wife had sold P’s Car back to the car dealership. This had occurred shortly after the initial affidavits were filed and parties were under the impression that no further evidence would be led. This was even though P’s Ex-Wife was aware that P’s Car was an issue in dispute in these proceedings. Consequentially, because P’s Car had been purportedly surrendered back to the hire purchase company without any balance proceeds, P’s Ex-Wife was unable to provide evidence on the mileage recorded for the use of P’s Car. P’s Ex-Wife’s actions in this regard were concerning. Even if P’s Car was a depreciating asset, with an outstanding car loan, which P’s Ex-Wife had been voluntarily paying for, this should have been raised to the court and an interim order sought on this. P’s Ex-Wife’s unilateral actions, without Court authorization gave me significant pause as to whether she would be an appropriate person to be appointed as deputy for P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     On a separate note, I did point out that whoever was appointed as P’s Deputy may very well need to pursue issues on the sale of P’s Car in separate legal proceedings, if necessary. However, this point did not appear to be followed up on for the eventual draft orders to authorise the deputy to take up the necessary legal proceedings in this regard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     With regard to P’s Mobile Phone, as mentioned earlier, it was only belatedly revealed that P’s Ex-Wife, who had used P’s Mobile Phone to exhibit her purported WhatsApp exchange with him, had transferred the mobile phone line from P’s name to her own name and had handed P’s Mobile Phone to be used by P’s eldest Son, who as a minor was under P’s Ex-Wife’s care and control. Such acts were done without seeking an interim order from the Court. Moreover, she refused to allow P’s Sister’s counsel to inspect P’s Mobile Phone on the purported basis that it was not in her possession, when it was clearly within her power to do so, being P’s eldest Son’s mother, and she had independently used it to produce documentation in support of her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     At the same time though, I had to acknowledge that P’s Sister’s actions were not all above board either. P’s Sister had in the initial stages of proceedings, without Court authorization change the locks to P’s Condominium Apartment. This was out of fear of P’s Ex-Wife’s access to the property and P’s possessions therein. Additionally, as P’s spokesperson to the hospital for P’s medical care (a role relinquished by P’s Ex-Wife voluntarily), she had limited the access of certain persons to P and had further decided to place P in a nursing home after his discharge from the hospitals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     While both have acted without authorization in the past, it is noteworthy that while P’s Sister’s actions appear to be historical (i.e. in the past), P’s Ex-Wife’s behaviour continued well into proceedings. While P’s Sister duly disclosed such issues in her affidavits, P’s Ex-Wife had a trend of denying, obfuscating and then coming clean only when she had been found out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     With regard to the giving of loans to P, this was perhaps a neutral factor as both P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister claimed to have provided loans to him, but neither had any concrete documentation on this. It appeared that P had a habit of seeking loans from friends and family instead of taking loans from banks and that P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister were not the only ones who had been approached for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     What was most pertinent was that it was between substantive hearings of the matter, where I had directed P’s Sister to disclose visitation logs of her visits with P at ASH, that it was surprisingly revealed that P’s Ex-Wife and Sons had not been visiting P. While P’s Ex-Wife was allowed to file an affidavit addressing the visitation logs on 19 May 2025, and P’s Ex-Wife continue to not admit to these allegations, she was unable to provide any evidence to show that she and P’s Sons continue to visit P during this period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     Instead, P’s Ex-Wife had presented reasons for the challenges in the frequency of visitation: that P’s Sons were busy with studies in 2024 and 2025, that the location of the nursing home being too far off in Jurong and also there had been prior instances of P’s Sister and her husband being there when they wanted to visit and that she wanted to avoid seeing them. P’s Ex-Wife also claimed that P’s Sister had instructed the nurses and staff to strictly enforce their own nursing home rule not to buy food for or to feed P outside food, not to massage him or not to allow persons to obtain medical information on him and that P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sons purportedly felt like they were watched closely during visits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Additionally, P’s Ex-Wife claimed to have befriended an elderly lady whose husband was a ward mate of P, whom she exhibited in her affidavit a log of voice memo messages. No transcripts or the audio files themselves were provide in evidence. P’s Ex-Wife claimed that she would rely on this elderly lady to provide her with updates on P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     P’s Ex-Wife’s position was that P’s Sons continued to try to visit in early 2025 but claimed that they were upset over the visits and conveniently stopped visiting in March 2025, where no further visitor logs could be exhibited. No documentary corroboration was provided for this, and their decision to no longer visit appears to match up with the March and April logs. It was highly probable that since the last filing of affidavits by parties in early November 2024 on the substantive matter (i.e. not related to the summonses SUM 161 and 90), visitation by P’s Ex-Wife had ceased. If there had been visits over the Christmas festivities and Chinese New Year period, there would have likely been at least some photographs to support their position, but none were provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    Even if P’s Ex-Wife’s account that she relied on updates from the elderly wife of P’s ward mate, getting updates from a third party and not visiting P for what appeared to be over half a year was very troubling. The visits to P were not only for persons to check up on P’s condition, but they are meant to provide P with comfort. By not visiting P for an extended period of time, P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sons could not render comfort and assistance to P. This downgraded the significance of P’s Ex-Wife’s evidence that she had tried to make P’s stay at the nursing home more comfortable by bringing him entertainment shows and quickly attending to his needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    Even if ASH had restrictions as all nursing homes have, that did not excuse the sudden lack of interest in the care of P. Given that the stated objective of P’s Ex-Wife seeking sole deputyship for P, was to allow P to spend more time with P’s Sons, if P’s Ex-Wife was genuine in her care for P, there would not have been such a significant absence of visits for a substantial period of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    On the other hand, P’s Sister had presented some evidence of her visiting consistently on weekends with logs provided for March and April 2025 and further claimed that she had regularly visited P just about every weekend. The evidence of her regular visits with P could not be said to be manufactured, as parties did not have any reasonable expectation that they would have to provide further evidence in relation to this until I had directed for such logs to be disclosed. And the fact that only the March and April 2025 logs were available from ASH, does not detract from P’s Sister’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    While P’s Sister perhaps had less evidence of frequent correspondence with P prior to him losing mental capacity, she still maintained regular contact with him and had been helping to manage his affairs since he suffered a stroke and lost mental capacity. Additionally, more regular correspondence between P and P’s Ex-Wife would have been expected as P was exercising regular access to P’s Sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Additionally, while there is a potential for conflict of interest as Ms Louise’s 2 Sons would be the sole beneficiaries of P’s estate, i.e. P’s Condominium Apartment and are beneficiaries of his life insurance policies, P’s Sister does not stand to gain anything from P in her personal capacity. Additionally, if P’s Ex-Wife were to pursue any enforcement of maintenance, which she is entitle to do, this would put her in conflict of interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    Given, among other things, P’s Ex-Wife’s past conduct of concealment, and only belatedly providing information when her lies had been uncovered, her acting without authority on P’s Car and Mobile Phone and the fact that P had divorced her and decided to sever their ties as husband and wife, even if they continue to coparent, I was not comfortable with appointing P’s Ex-Wife as P’s deputy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Appointing P’s Sister as P’s deputy, even though they were perhaps not the closest of siblings but still maintained a good relationship, was preferrable to ensure that P’s best interests were well protected. P’s Sister had shown consistency in care and concern for P and had been attending to P’s needs dutifully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    With regard to the potential appointment of each of the applicants as deputies, P’s Ex-Wife’s Counsel cited the case of <b><em>VUW v VUT </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26995-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 41</a></b>, where at [12], then Presiding Judge of Family Justice Courts, Justice Debbie Ong had found that the plaintiffs and defendants had a very difficult relationship where trust was very much lacking, and arranging for care on alternate weeks by a deputy from 1 faction to the other would negatively impact the welfare of P. Hence, in considering whether to appoint 1 person from each faction as P’s deputies, that would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Given the history of contentious relationships between P’s Ex-Wife and P’s Sister, this case was not suitable to consider such an arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    Hence, overall, on a balance of factors, I determined that P’s Sister would be the most appropriate person to be P’s Deputy to make decisions for him to further his best interests. Consequentially, as P’s Ex-Wife was not being appointed as P’s deputy, besides the various concerns earlier raised in paragraphs 63 to 69 above, it would be inappropriate for the Court to order for home care at P’s Ex-Wife’s residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 4: Sale of P’s Condominium Apartment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    With regard to the issue of P’s Condominium Apartment and whether it should be sold, it is noted that that P’s Sister was seeking for its sale, whereas P’s Ex-Wife wanted this property to be preserved as P had intended for P’s Condominium Apartment to be passed down to P’s Sons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    In this regard, P’s Ex-Wife rightfully pointed out that section 23(2) of the MCA does provide that any orders made on disposition or settlement of P’s property would have to consider section 6(7) of the MCA, that the aim is to ensure that the person’s property is preserved for the application towards the costs of maintenance during the person’s life. So, while P’s intention to have this passed down to the children is a consideration, as P’s best interest extends beyond death (kindly see <b><em>BHR &amp; Anor v BHS</em></b> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0149.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 149</a> at [56]), the primary concern is whether there are sufficient funds for his current care and maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    Based on the evidence presented by parties, there was insufficient evidence that renting out P’s Condominium Apartment would not be sufficient to meet the payments for the mortgage and P’s further nursing home needs, even with the nursing home fees were increasing as P’s subsidy was being reduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    In the circumstances, I did not allow for the sale of P’s Condominium Apartment but allowed it to be rented out instead to generate income. I further authorized P’s Sister to manage P’s finances and to wind up P’s businesses and to make certain reimbursements to P’s Sister for P’s hospitalizations in FC/ORC xxxx/2025. Such further powers do not appear to be in contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    After delivering my decision with my brief oral grounds, I invited parties to submit on the issue of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    P’s Sister’s initial position was that costs should be awarded in favour of P’s Sister to the sum of S$80,0000 on a party-to-party (“<b>P&amp;P</b>”) basis. When highlighted that this quantum of costs was higher than what the High Courts had ordered in previous proceedings such as <b><em>WLR v WLT</em></b>, where the costs order was S$40,000, P’s Sister adjusted her position that such costs should be paid on a solicitor-and-client (“<b>S&amp;C</b>”) basis. When asked for case law to support the position, P’s Sister took the position that this was under the Court’s discretion. With regard to disbursements, P’s Sister claimed for S$10,070.64. This included the procurement of the PI Report, the medical records, doctor’s reports and eLitigation filing fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    P’s Ex-Wife agreed that costs should follow the event, and that based on the proportionality for the case, that costs should be fixed at S$15,000 instead on a P&amp;P basis. With regard to disbursements, they sought clarifications on the calculations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    With regard to whether this should be costs on a P&amp;P or S&amp;C basis, I note that P’s Sister’s counsel has not provided any case authorities on what would have escalated the costs in this case to go from a P&amp;P basis to an S&amp;C basis. There was no evidence of a “<em>without prejudice</em>” offer made that was more favourable that the decision I delivered or that the conduct of parties was had reached such high threshold to warrant the ordering of costs on an S&amp;C basis. Hence, the costs order is made on a P&amp;P basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    The general benchmark for costs in MCA proceedings for a substantive half day were between S$800 to S$4,000, and an additional S$800 to S$2,000 for further half-days of hearing. That would have put the overall costs for the hearing in the range of range of S$1,200 to S$8,000. However, I also had to take into account the protracted nature of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Part of the protraction of proceedings was due to the obtaining of updated medical reports. The matter was heard over 3 contested half-day hearings (excluding the decision hearing and the hearing to finalize orders). The initial intention was to hear parties in the 1<sup>st</sup> hearing and then have decision hearing after hearing rebuttals in the 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing. However, by the 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing there were significant issues of requiring further documentation and/or inspection and after hearing further submissions, I needed some further information and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    Hence, this was not a run-of the-mill type of MCA proceeding, and I had to take notice of the work done in this case, which was substantial. There were 2 rounds of Written Submissions and about 10 Affidavits had been filed, and each were fairly substantive. P’s Sister was ultimately successful, save for the issue on the sale of P’s Condominium Apartment, which was not significantly pressed for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    Additionally, I had to take into account the inconsistent positions taken by P’s Ex-Wife, which required further clarifications. There were the issues of the late disclosure of the Little Boy, the sale of P’s Car, the issue of P’s Mobile Phone. Moreover, a significant amount of time for the oral submissions was spent disproportionately on P’s Ex-Wife’s counsel’s arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    Taking all this into consideration, I ordered costs to the sum of S$20,0000 payable by P’s Ex-Wife to P’s Sister overall. Given that there were 2 proceedings, I ordered for this costs to be apportioned equally to the amount of S$10,000 for each application. I allowed parties to correspond on disbursements, and when they returned on 8 July 2025, parties had agreed that the disbursements were to the sum of S$10,175.59. I ordered that such disbursements should also be equally split between the applications, for disbursements of S$5,087.79 in OSM 184 and disbursements of S$5,087.80 in OSM 286, payable by P’s Ex-Wife to P’s Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Overall, the Court was put in a difficult position of determining who was best placed to be appointed as P’s deputy so as to ensure that P’s best interests were protected. While P’s deputy need not be a family member, given the circumstances of this case, P’s Ex-Wife was not more appropriate than P’s Sister to be P’s deputy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    Pertinently, if a party were to be seeking to be appointed as a deputy, they should come to the Court with clean hands, making full and frank disclosure at an early instance. Additionally, potential deputies need to exhibit their commitment to caring for P and if they were earnest in their bid to be appointed P’s deputy, that such care and concern should not wane over time. As the responsibilities and duties of a deputy are significant, the Court must have significant confidence in the appointment of a deputy for P and it is the responsibility of the applicant to provide the necessary evidence to convince the Court on this.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Relocation – Child – Whether permission should be granted for a 12-year-old child to be relocated to the United Kingdom to attend a boarding school while both parents continue to reside in Singapore – Framework for assessing relocation applications"],"date":"2025-11-17","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OADV 468 of 2025","title":"XUL v XUM","citation":"[2025] SGFC 123","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34095-SSP.xml","counsel":["Amy Lim Chiew Hong (M/s Amy Lim Law Practice) for the Mother","Alain Abraham Johns & Emira binte Abdul Razakjr (M/s Alain A Johns Partnership) for the Father."],"timestamp":"2025-11-20T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XUL v XUM</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XUL <em>v</em> XUM </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34095-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 123</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OADV 468 of 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">17 November 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kow Keng Siong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Amy Lim Chiew Hong (M/s Amy Lim Law Practice) for the Mother; Alain Abraham Johns &amp; Emira binte Abdul Razakjr (M/s Alain A Johns Partnership) for the Father. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XUL — XUM </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Relocation</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Whether permission should be granted for a 12-year-old child to be relocated to the United Kingdom to attend a boarding school while both parents continue to reside in Singapore</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Framework for assessing relocation applications</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">17 November 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This case concerns a mother’s application to relocate her 12-year-old son from Singapore to the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”). Two features make this application unusual. <em>First</em>, unlike the typical relocation case, the applicant-mother will not reside with the son in the UK. Instead, she intends for him to reside at an English boarding school while she remains in Singapore. <em>Second</em>, she contends that the idea of boarding originated from the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The father opposes the application on two bases. <em>First</em>, a 12-year-old would not, on his own, propose attending an English boarding school. <em>Second</em>, the child is not sufficiently mature to understand the implications of living overseas without his parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       When a parent seeks to relocate a child from Singapore, the court’s overriding concern is the child’s welfare and best interests: <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> (“<b><em>BNS</em></b>”) at [19]. Applying this principle, the question here is whether it will serve the 12-year-old’s welfare and best interests to relocate him to the UK to attend a boarding school while his parents remain in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The applicant-mother (“<b>Mother</b>”) and respondent-father (“<b>Father</b>”) are divorced. Their son was born in November 2013 (“<b>Son</b>”). Since 2022, the Mother has been the care-parent, while the Father has weekend access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       According to the Mother, the Son expressed, in early 2024, a desire to pursue secondary education abroad. She took his aspirations seriously: she conducted the relevant research, engaged educational specialists, and visited potential schools. She believes that she can fund the boarding education on her own.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In September 2024, the Mother presented the overseas-study proposal to the Father. He opposed it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In April 2025, an English boarding school (“<b>School</b>”) indicated that it could enrol the Son for the January 2026 intake, subject to the Father’s consent. The Father maintained his objection, thus resulting in the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Overriding consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As noted, the overriding consideration in relocation applications is the child’s welfare and best interests. This is the lens through which every other consideration is assessed. The assessment is an objective one. It eschews (a) any “pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy” among factors, (b) categorical pigeonholes that predetermine outcomes, and (c) presumption for or against relocation: <em>BNS</em> at [20] to [22]; <em>WRU v WRT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31510-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 23</a> (“<b><em>WRU</em></b>”) at [18]; <em>UYK v UYK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a> (“<b><em>UYK</em></b>”) at [38]; <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> (“<b><em>TAA</em></b>”) at [17]. Thus, neither a parent’s good intentions nor a child’s strong desire to live abroad is determinative. These are simply factors to be weighed against others in assessing whether relocation should be permitted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Analytical framework</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What factors are relevant, and how do courts determine whether relocation serves a child’s welfare and best interests? The case law provides the following guidance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasons for relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The court first examines the reasons advanced for relocation, assessing whether they are genuine, rational, and coherent: <em>TAA</em> at [25] to [27]; <em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a> (“<b><em>UXH</em></b>”) at [23]; <em>UYK</em> at [67] and [69]; <em>Liew Kah Heng v Kwok Fong Ee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/5105-M.xml')\">[2000] SGDC 7</a> at [18] and [19]. In general, applications aimed at diminishing the child’s relationship with the access-parent will be rejected: <em>BNT v BNS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16727-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 859</a> (“<b><em>BNT</em></b>”) at [51] and [53]; <em>Re C (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0502.xml')\">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 502</a> (“<b><em>Re C</em></b>”) at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Impact of relocation on the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Next, the court considers the impact of relocation on the child: <em>Re C</em> at [17(a)]; <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> at [26] and [27]; <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a> at [9] and [10]; <em>VTU v VTV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27401-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 598</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In assessing such impact, the court considers, among others –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The extent of the child’s integration in Singapore and his or her ability to adapt to change.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       For instance, relocation may be less disruptive for a child accustomed to moving with expatriate parents than for a child who has lived here since birth with Singaporean parents. Further, what may be manageable for a mature teenager can feel very different to a child in early adolescence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Apart from age, the court will also consider the child’s (1) personality, (2) physical, emotional, and educational needs, and (3) each parent’s capacity to meet those needs if relocation is granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The strength of the child’s attachment to his or her parents and other caregivers. <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [51] and [52]; <em>UXH</em> at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Distance can strain even the strongest of bonds. The court will scrutinise the applicant-parent’s willingness to sustain the child’s relationship with the respondent-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       A history of cooperation between the parents may give confidence that contact will be facilitated. On the other hand, a pattern of high conflict points the other way and may call for the applicant-parent to provide clearer safeguards if relocation is to be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the applicant-parent has concrete plans to minimise the disruptions caused by relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>The court will assess whether the post-relocation environment will be stable or uncertain. Specifics matter. Vague, speculative, or hastily made unilateral plans are likely to count against relocation: <em>WRU</em> at [37]; <em>TAA</em> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The child’s views</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The child’s views are also important part. The weight to be accorded to such views depends on (a) the child’s age and maturity, (b) whether the views are supported by reasons, (c) whether the views have been held for a long time or a transient, (d) whether the child has been influenced or coached, and (e) whether the child understands the implications of the relocation: see e.g., <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<b><em>WKM</em></b>”) at [45(a)]; <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> at [15] and [25]; <em>ZO v ZP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0647.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 647</a> at [15] and [16]; s 125(2)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden and standard of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After considering all relevant factors, the court will then evaluate the two options: (a) permit relocation, or (b) maintain the status quo in Singapore. This evaluation involves two steps: <em>first</em>, identify the benefits and harms of each option; <em>second</em>, compare the options to determine which one better serves the child’s welfare and best interests in both the short and longer term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The parent seeking to uproot a child from a settled living arrangement bears the burden of proof. That parent must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the child’s overall welfare is better served by relocation than by remaining in Singapore. The question is not merely whether relocation offers advantages, but whether – <em>taken as a whole</em> – it is the better path for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In assessing whether this burden is met, several points bear emphasis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The assessment is <em>forward-looking</em>: it considers not only what the child presently enjoys, but also what he or she stands to gain – or lose – by relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Given the high stakes, the court will <em>proceed with care</em>. For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where the potential advantages are speculative and the risks of emotional or developmental harm are substantial, the proper course may be to remain in Singapore. This is especially so for younger, well-settled children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where benefits and downsides are finely balanced, one option may be to defer relocation to a later stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Caution, however, does not equate to a default rule against relocation. Major changes to improve the quality and prospects of life will entail risk and uncertainty. What a court seeks to do is to avoid exposing the child to a level of risk from relocation that is <em>unreasonably high</em> when compared to (i) its potential gains and (ii) the risk from remaining in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I will now apply the above framework – grounded in the child’s welfare and interests – to the facts of this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasons for relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother believes that the School is aligned to the Son’s strengths and will develop his potential.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> She highlights that it has (a) a strong academic reputation, (b) wide co-curricular offerings that emphasise critical thinking, creativity, and leadership, and (c) won awards such as Co-Educational Independent School of the Year and Best Sports School in the UK.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Impact of relocation on the Son</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Nature and extent of impact</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Father, on the other hand, is concerned that the Son (a) is “far too young” to live overseas without a resident parent, (b) is not mature enough to cope with homesickness as well as social and academic pressures, and (c) may face challenges in re-integrating into Singapore in the future, including National Service.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Mother’s mitigation plan</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother contends that the Father’s concerns are “speculative”: She had (a) engaged an educational consultant, (b) visited the School,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and (c) chosen it because of its emphasis on pastoral care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In any event, to mitigate possible adjustment issues, she plans to (a) be in the UK during the first six months of the school term, (b) visit the Son regularly thereafter, (c) maintain frequent video, messaging, and phone contact, and (d) arrange for the child to return to Singapore during school holidays.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Son’s views</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I now come to the Son’s views. There is a dispute as to whether the boarding idea originated with him. To address this, I spoke with the child in chambers with a Court Family Specialist present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Based on that conversation, I am satisfied the idea did originate from the child. He said that it arose after watching a TikTok video about the School. He spoke enthusiastically about its campus, facilities, and co-curricular opportunities. I accept that his wish is genuine and is not the product of coaching or pressure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Although the Son is keen to enrol in the School, I am unable to give it full weight. This is because he appears to lack the maturity to fully comprehend and manage the consequences of relocation. During my conversation with him, he held an unrealistically rosy view of boarding, saw virtually no downsides to the experience, and proposed simplistic coping strategies for homesickness, peer conflict, and academic pressure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In summary, while the Son genuinely wishes to enrol at the School, he has not fully grasped the challenges of boarding. His cognitive and critical-thinking skills are still developing. This is unsurprising as he is only 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Weighing the two options</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I now weigh the benefits and harms of the two options: permitting relocation (“<b>Option A</b>”) or the Son remaining in Singapore (“<b>Option B</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Option A</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I begin with Option A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I accept that the School is reputable and can offer the Son significant educational opportunities and international exposure. Boarding can also cultivate his independence and character.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, the potential downsides are serious and, in my view, outweigh the benefits. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Relocation typically entails (i) emotional strain (homesickness, anxiety), (ii) educational disruption (adjusting to a different system and challenges of eventual re-entry to the Singapore education system), (iii) social upheaval (leaving behind established relationships and building new ones), and (iv) other concerns (safety and stability of living arrangements).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the present case, the impact of relocation is likely to be magnified due to the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At 12, the Son is in early adolescence – a period of heightened emotional and psychological flux. Children at this age generally seek independence while at the same time rely heavily on physically present caregivers to buffer stress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The evidence shows that the Son (1) is closely attached to the Mother, (2) has limited experience in independently managing his wellbeing in Singapore, and (3) has travelled outside Asia only once (to visit the School and to France on the same trip). The child will face difficulties in communicating his adjustment issues to his loved ones in Singapore given the distance and time-zone differences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Further, the enrolment is proposed to take place in less than two months (January 2026). Such a sudden and substantial reduction in emotional support will increase the Son’s vulnerability to anxiety, loneliness, and adjustment difficulties. This is not a small step but a leap – to a new country, culture, independent living, and roommates. The absence of a resident parent in a boarding environment heightens the risk of the child’s emotional difficulties being undetected and unaddressed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Because neither parent would reside with the Son in the UK for a substantial period, I must scrutinise the Mother’s mitigation plan more closely. In this regard, she has failed to satisfy me that it adequately addresses the above concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Her plan relies heavily – after an initial six-month stay – on the School’s pastoral system and the child’s self-reporting. There is no detail on how early emotional or behavioural warning signs will be identified, escalated, and addressed if he struggles. Neither is there evidence of the School’s protocols to handle bullying.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In my view, the Mother’s proposal for regular virtual contact underestimates practical constraints of time zones and school schedules. While digital platforms help, they cannot substitute the warmth and immediacy of physical presence, especially for younger children. As observed in <em>BNT</em> at [35(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The facts of the children’s young ages and the difference in time zones between Canada and Singapore will make it difficult for their father to sustain the closeness of his present relationship with them. With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction: conversation. Normal family life consists of much more than conversations between parent and child – there are joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There is also a real possibility that boarding may prove too much for the Son. A premature return to Singapore could bring further risks: (i) re-adjustment to the local syllabus, (ii) the burden of perceived “failure”, and (iii) guilt over having wasted funds and time – an onerous burden for a young child. The Mother has not dealt with these issues in her evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Instead, she submits that the Son is resilient and will adapt. As in <em>XBF v XBE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32437-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 42</a> at [16], I see no reason to test his resilience through a high impact move. There is no pressing need for boarding now – overseas education can still be considered when he is older.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     At the hearing, the Mother’s counsel, for the first time, suggested that she might relocate to the UK so the Son would not be without a resident parent, and that this could be imposed as a condition for allowing the application. In my view, it is not appropriate to decide in favour of relocation based on this late oral suggestion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother had ample opportunity to run this suggestion as her primary case. She did not. Instead, her evidence proceeded on the basis that she would return to Singapore after six months, leaving the Son in the UK. Her financial and logistical planning reflects that premise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the suggestion lacks details. For instance, the Mother did not explain how she would obtain permission to work in the UK, how she would support herself and the Son, and how long such an arrangement could be sustained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, if the suggestion were to be given serious consideration, this would likely require fresh evidence from the Mother. This would prejudice the Father and prolong uncertainty for the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, although not requested by the Mother, I have considered adjourning the matter to allow her to formulate a detailed plan to relocate with the Son. I eventually declined to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the School’s intake is imminent – less than two months away. An adjournment would lead to hurried proposals on life-shaping decisions. It would also create acute stress and uncertainty about the child’s immediate living and schooling arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, if, in future, the Mother develops a concrete plan to relocate with the child, she remains free to file a fresh application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Option B</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Next, I turn to Option B. This option preserves a stable home environment. From my conversation with the Son, it is evident that he has strong connections with the Mother and paternal grandparents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The potential downsides are that the child may view dismissal of the application as extinguishing his aspirations, feel frustrated, and blame the Father. These downsides are less serious than the risks under Option A. They can also be mitigated – he may revisit overseas education later, when he is more mature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     For completeness, there is no evidence that (a) the child has needs that cannot be met by Singapore’s education system, or (b) the current arrangements are incompatible with his welfare and best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The balance tips in favour of Option B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In my view, the risks to the Son under Option A are unreasonably higher than its benefits. While relocation offers educational and experiential upside, at this stage, it does not outweigh the significant risks to his emotional security and developmental need for day-to-day parental presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The downsides of Option B are manageable. On a holistic assessment, the child is more likely to suffer greater harm under Option A than Option B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As the Mother has failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Son’s overall welfare is better served by relocation than by remaining in Singapore, I dismiss the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Final observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Before concluding, I have some observations for the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the parents</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Both of you are trying, in your own ways, to do what you believe is best for your son. You share the same goal but differ in approach: one emphasises opportunity and early independence; the other, stability and certainty. This decision is not a judgment on your parenting philosophies. Neither does it suggest that your child is undeserving of overseas education, nor that boarding is inherently unsuitable. It reflects only my assessment that such an experience is presently not in his welfare and best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the Mother and the Son</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I understand your disappointment. The Mother has invested time and resources to find a suitable school. The Son looked forward to a unique experience. This decision does not close the door to overseas education. The question can be revisited when the child is older and more mature. For now, the safer course is for him to remain in Singapore, with both parents playing prominent roles in his life – rather than appearing only as images on a screen from afar.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup><sup></sup> Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 09.10.25 at [38] to [43].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><sup></sup> Written Submissions for Applicant Mother dated 09.10.25 at [44], [45] and [60] to [64].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><sup></sup> Written Submissions for Applicant Mother dated 09.10.25 at [37] to [40].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup><sup></sup> Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 09.10.25 at [3], [26] to [31];

An interim judgment of divorce was granted on 21 October 2020, but the ancillary matters have yet to be heard to-date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is of considerable concern that more than five years have passed since proceedings were initiated, yet they remain resolved. Protracted litigation in family proceedings risks undermining both finality and the parties’ ability to move forward. Indeed, as noted by Tan Siong Thye SJ in <em>WXD v WXC and another appeal and another matter</em> - <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32854-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 14</a> (at [37]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The value of finality in matrimonial proceedings is vital. The parties have to close this painful chapter of their lives, and to look forward and start anew …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In <em>VTP v VTO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33727-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 52</a>, Teh Hwee Hwee J reiterated (at [28]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Therapeutic justice, as it is practised in the Family Courts, is forward-looking, and directed at enabling parties to move on with their lives following a divorce. There is much to be said for emphasising the importance of finality in litigation…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The procedural history of the case indicates that the Husband has adopted a course of conduct that has been unduly litigious, thereby contributing to the protraction of the proceedings. In the course of an earlier appeal filed by the Husband <em>vide</em> FC/RA 1/2023 (“RA1/2023”) against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Adriene Cheong (“the AR”) given on 13 January 2023 dismissing his application in FC/SUM 3637/2022, I made the following observations:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is highly unfortunate, in my view, that the Defendant has chosen to adopt a needlessly aggressive and combative approach of taking out a summons under Rule 695, and threatening to institute committal proceedings against the Plaintiff (in his affidavit of 9 November 2022, at [14]-[15]), when this vexatious course of action was completely unnecessary for the protection of his juridical interests in this proceeding …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband’s further appeal to the Family Division of the High Court <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 4/2023 was dismissed by Lai Siu Chiu SJ who observed as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I go further to say he is motivated by malice and ill will. He is deliberately making unnecessary and unreasonable discovery requests of the Respondent and causing her to incur substantial charges in the process. This court and no court will impose deadlines over and above what a court has ordered just so the Appellant in this case    can apply for committal proceedings when the Respondent's conduct does not show any contumelious behavior.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband’s litigious behaviour was evident in another appeal filed by him <em>vide</em> FC/RA 1/2024 (“RA1/2024”). This was the Husband’s appeal against the decision of the AR given on 16 February 2024 refusing, <em>inter alia</em>, his application for the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking to be lifted in relation to certain documents and information, and for those documents and information to be used for the purpose of related proceedings in the General Division of the High Court (“Related HC Proceedings”) to determine the beneficial ownership of [Property A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For the reasons explained in <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> (“<em>WWK v WWL</em>”), I dismissed the Husband’s appeal. The Husband’s further appeal to the Family Division <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 6/2024 was also dismissed on 19 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As observed in my written grounds in <em>WWK v WWL</em> (at [56]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Given that there is no real necessity for the Husband to commence the Related HC Proceedings and taking into account the expansive nature of the orders sought by the Husband, the Wife’s apprehension that the Husband may misuse the documents and information if he is released of the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking is not without basis. This risk cannot be discounted given the conduct of the Husband as observed in FC/RA 1/2023 and HCF/RAS 4/2023. Additionally, his frequent change of solicitors deepens my concern about the propensity on his part to engage in a course of conduct that is unnecessarily acrimonious and confrontational.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It was against the above backdrop that FC/RA 10/2025 (“RA 10”) came to be heard before me. RA 10 was the Husband’s appeal against the AR’s decision given on 25 July 2025 in FC/SUM 559/2024 (“SUM 559”) and FC/SUM 560 (“SUM 560”). By the time of this third Registrar’s Appeal filed by the Husband, he had engaged and replaced no fewer than seven law firms<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, a circumstance which speaks to the manner in which he has conducted these proceedings. This pattern of conduct is emblematic of his broader tendency to engage in aggressive litigation, with little regard to finality and proportionality. The result has been to prolong the proceedings, resulting in the needless consumption of time and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     SUM 559 and SUM 660 were the Husband’s applications for discovery and interrogatories. The AR made no orders on both applications and directed for the matter to proceed for ancillary hearing without further interlocutory applications to be filed by either party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The AR noted that a comprehensive disclosure process had already taken place over two years ago, with at least five rounds of requests made by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The current applications were filed in February 2024, following which the parties entered into negotiations culminating in an agreement to undertake a joint valuation of the Wife’s companies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Wife had executed the Letter of Engagement (“LOE”) and paid her share of the required deposit to the agreed valuer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The AR noted that despite multiple court directions and stipulated deadlines, the Husband failed to execute the LOE and remit his share of the deposit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s persistent non-compliance with the AR’s directions effectively frustrated the implementation of the agreed joint valuation exercise<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and resulted in a significant and unwarranted delay of at least nine months spanning from August 2024 to April 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The AR also observed that the Husband’s litigation strategy appeared calculated to obtain further disclosure orders by repudiating the previously agreed joint arrangement without any valid justification.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> His approach has not only caused the Wife to incur unnecessary costs but has also resulted in inefficient use of judicial resources.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having regard to the submissions of parties and the procedural history of the case, I agreed with the AR that the Husband’s conduct has had the effect of delaying and obstructing the progress of these proceedings. Greater judicial control is clearly warranted to ensure that the case advances without further undue delay to a hearing. Accordingly, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal. I indicated that in the event of a further appeal, I will provide full written grounds to explain my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband has filed a further appeal to the Family Division <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 29/2025, through his ninth set of solicitors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This is his third appeal to the Family Division. I now set out my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is trite that a judge hearing a Registrar’s Appeal exercises confirmatory jurisdiction, as opposed to appellate jurisdiction: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> (at [21]-[22]). As noted in <em>AOD v AOE</em> [2015] SGHC (at [21]), there are practical implications to the fact that the judge exercises confirmatory, rather than appellate jurisdiction. Among other things, the judge is not confined to interfering with the assistant registrar’s exercise of discretion only if it had been exercised on wrong principles of law or misapprehensions of fact but is entitled to exercise his discretion afresh, while giving due weight to the assistant registrar’s decision. In effect, he hears the appeal as if the matter came before him for the first time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Although RA 10 was an appeal against the whole of the AR’s decision, the Husband clarified at the hearing that he was not appealing the AR’s decision making no orders on the discovery applications. His appeal was confined to the AR’s direction for the matter to proceed for ancillary hearing without further interlocutory applications to be filed by either party and the costs order. The Husband accepted that it was within the power of the AR to make orders to expedite the progress of the case under the Judge-led approach but contended that the order made by the AR was draconian as it precluded the Husband from taking out any application to appoint an expert valuer to provide an expert report for the valuation of the Wife’s companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Judge-led approach</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Rule 22(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”) (which applies to the present proceedings since they were commenced before 15 October 2024) provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In adopting a judge-led approach, the Court may, at any time after the commencement or at the hearing of any proceedings, of its own motion or on an application by any party to the proceedings, direct any party or parties to those proceedings to appear before it, for the Court to make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As the Minister for Law explained at the Second Reading of the Family Justice Bill, the Judge-led approach to adjudicating family disputes is intended to allow judges “to lead and control the pace and direction of each case, in a manner tailored to the needs and sensitives of each family”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Judge-led powers, encapsulated in Part 3 of the FJR 2014, were further strengthened by the introduction of s 11A of the Family Justice Act 2014 (“FJA”) pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System (“RERF Committee”). This provision, which came into operation on 14 October 2024, empowers the Court, <em>inter alia</em>, to control the filing of any application that will or is likely to impede the just, expeditious or economical resolution or disposal of any matter in the relevant proceedings. The enhanced powers reflect the legislative intent to reinforce active judicial case management, curb the proliferation of unmeritorious applications, and ensure that family proceedings are conducted efficiently. As observed by the RERF Committee in its report, “[t]he filing of unnecessary applications prolongs proceedings, promotes acrimony and strains judicial resources”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The exercise of discretion in judicial case management</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The exercise of the Court’s case management powers is a matter of discretion and will often require a balancing of competing interests and considerations. As noted by Choo Han Teck J in <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27460-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 9</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    … <b><em>It must also be remembered that many interlocutory orders are discretionary in nature or discretionary to a large extent. The exercise of a court’s discretion, unlike the application of an express rule or principle, should not be disturbed except in the most obvious instance in which the exercise of that discretion had led to a miscarriage of justice</em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12    A court’s decision to allow an adjournment or an extension of time to comply with a previous order is the clearest instance of the exercise of judicial discretion. Appealing against such an order should only be made in the rarest of cases – to prevent a clear and irredeemable injustice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">13    In family matters, it behoves counsel to impress upon their clients that the resolution of their dispute ought to be made with a clear mind. This often seems terribly difficult because of the rage and animosity between people whose relationships had from love to hatred turned. Nonetheless, litigants should be advised that interlocutory orders should not be lightly appealed against …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As also noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> (at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… an exercise of discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate court unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into account or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have taken into account, or his decision is plainly wrong</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is not open to an appellate court to interfere with the first instance exercise of discretion simply because it would have been inclined to find a different balance: see <em>Kiri Industries Ltd v DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29590-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGCA(I) 3</a> (at [80]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     That said, I am mindful that in a Registrar’s Appeal, the Court is not bound by the manner in which the assistant registrar exercised his or her discretion. Nonetheless, I am of the view that the Court should be slow to interfere with the assistant registrar’s exercise of discretion in matters of case management. To do otherwise would risk undermining the effectiveness of the assistant registrar in managing cases and invite unnecessary appeals against proper case management decisions. Allowing proceedings to protract through such appeals defeats the very purpose of conferring broad judge-led powers on the Court to control proceedings. It also runs counter to the legislative intent underlying s 11A of the FJA, which is to strengthen judicial control and deter unmeritorious litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The AR’s decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The AR noted that that the Husband’s overall conduct throughout the proceedings of close to five years has caused substantial impediment to the expeditious resolution of the matter. The AR cited the following examples:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Obstruction of the Wife’s reasonable access to the matrimonial home (whilst seeking disclosure of documents retained within the property), which required a formal application for orders by the Wife to access the home to retrieve her belongings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Pursuit of multiple interlocutory appeals, none of which have materially advanced the proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     No fewer than six changes in legal representation, each necessitating familiarization time and consequential procedural delays. The latest change of solicitors caused the hearing of the application to be adjourned for about six weeks from June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The AR noted that such conduct has not only prolonged the proceedings but also imposed additional costs and emotional burden on the Wife, while frustrating the Court’s objective of ensuring efficient administration of justice in matrimonial proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The AR found that the Husband’s pattern of conduct throughout the proceedings demonstrated not merely a casual disregard for procedural efficiency, but rather a deliberate strategy to frustrate the expeditious resolution of these proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The AR noted that the Wife had stated the values of her companies in her first affidavit in March 2021, but the Husband only pursued the issue of valuation in December 2023 and filed the present applications only in February 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Having agreed to undertake a joint valuation exercise<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, the Husband unilaterally withdrew from the agreed joint valuation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> and persisted with pursuing his applications, contending that he needed the disclosure orders for the purposes of obtaining his own valuation of the Wife’s companies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The AR noted that the Husband has been afforded multiple opportunities to address the valuation issues in a timely and constructive manner.

The Wife explained, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… we note that the Letter of Engagement signed by our client has catered for a situation where a party may elect to have 2 valuation dates, and in the absence of any party exercising this option, that you will “assume that this option will not be exercised”. There is hence no need to make any changes, since this was the understanding that both parties had (the possibility of which we had updated the Court about at the case conference on 11 March 2022).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     SSPL replied on the same day to say that they would not be making any changes to the LOE until parties confirm the steps to be taken.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     On 19 March 2025, the Husband’s solicitors informed the AR via correspondence as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… we understand that the cut-off date of November 2024 applies only to Phase 1 and the joint valuer is at liberty to request for additional documents beyond November 2024 for Phase 2 of his work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.    On this basis, our Client will be making payment to Mr. Wan and sign the LOE forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     However, he did not do so but instead wrote another letter to the Court dated 1 April 2025 seeking the Court’s guidance on the “Ancillary Proximate Date” (“APD”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> He stated that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff appears to propose November 2024 as the APD, without prejudice to the valuer’s ability to request further documents. The Defendant, on the other hand, takes the reasonable view that the APD should minimally be the first quarter of 2025, to account as far as practicable for the full financial year of 2024 for all three companies (whose financial years end in December 2024, April 2025 and June 2025), so as to ensure a true and fair valuation as close as possible to the Ancillary Matters hearing date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Court replied on 4 April 2025 that it was not in a position to make a determination on this issue via correspondence and strongly encouraged parties to discuss and reach a consensus without delay.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     On 22 April 2025, the Husband informed the AR that he was unable to sign off on the LOE.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Consequently, the Husband’s discovery applications, which were held in abeyance, were restored for hearing on 5 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> At the hearing on 5 June 2025, the Husband’s solicitors applied to be discharged,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> which resulted in the hearing having to be adjourned and delayed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In my view, the AR was justified in finding that the Husband had repudiated the agreed joint valuation arrangement without any valid justification. Having agreed to the TOR on 28 January 2025, the Husband sought unilaterally to change the terms of the TOR via the LOE by instructing SSPL to amend the LOE “to reflect that the Plaintiff should provide to you all relevant documents for the three companies up to end-February 2025”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s attempt to instruct SSPL on the conduct of the valuation undermined the ability of the joint valuer to undertake its work independently and was contrary to the spirit of a joint appointment. His insistence that the LOE be amended to include documents up to end-February 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> was unreasonable, bearing in mind that it was within the purview of the expert valuer to determine the documents they required for their work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the LOE also provided for an option for two valuation dates.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> There was hence no justification for the Husband to interfere with the independent work of the joint valuer by dictating what documents should be obtained from the Wife and to subsequently abandon the agreed joint valuation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As a result of the Husband’s conduct, SSPL could not even proceed with Phase 1 of its work, which did not involve the valuation of the three companies. As noted above, the TOR provided that the parties will consider if they jointly agree to the next stage of work of determining the actual value of the Wife’s companies to be proceeded with after SSPL has provided their 1<sup>st</sup> Stage Opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Regrettably, the Husband’s conduct is indicative of bad faith. His deliberate departure from the agreed process is wholly inconsistent with the spirt of cooperation envisaged in the joint valuation exercise and reflects a continuing pattern of obstructive and tactical behaviour. Such action not only frustrate the orderly conduct of the case but also needlessly protract the resolution of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The AR was correct to find that the Husband’s conduct has had the effect of delaying and obstructing the progress of these proceedings. Such conduct undermines the fair administration of justice, particularly in the context of family disputes where finality of proceedings is important for parties to heal and move on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my view, this is precisely the sort of case in which the Court must wield its case management powers decisively to rein in obstructive conduct and move the case towards final resolution. As the AR was not in error, there was no reason for me to interfere with her case management decision. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I would have exercised my discretion in the same manner as she did.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The AR was mindful that the absence of either a joint valuation or competing valuations may constrain the Court’s assessment at the ancillary stage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> However, it is equally important to note that the Court determining the ancillary matters is not bound by the interlocutory order and retains the discretion to determine if a valuation report is necessary. As noted in <em>WAH v WAG</em> (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Interim and interlocutory orders do not bind the trial judge, and the trial judge may make orders at the trial varying the earlier orders. The fundamental purpose of interim and interlocutory orders is, therefore, to ensure a smoother, quicker trial, and to keep each party’s position evenly balanced until the trial. That purpose is lost if the justice system is clogged with unmeritorious appeals against interlocutory orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Unsatisfactory as it may be, it is necessary to bring an end to the meandering course these proceedings have taken as a result of the Husband’s obstructive and uncooperative conduct, and move the case towards hearing without the valuation report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Appeal dismissed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     For the above reasons, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Rule 854 of the FJR 2014 provides that the Court, in exercising its discretion as to costs, “must, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account … the conduct of all parties, including conduct before and during the proceedings”. Like general civil litigation, the Court in family proceedings also has a discretion to grant costs on an indemnity basis if it considers it appropriate to do so: see r. 878(1) of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The circumstances where an order for indemnity costs may be made were discussed in <em>Pradeepto Kumar Biswas v Sabyasachi Mukherjee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30981-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 3</a>. The Appellate Division noted (at [6]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">An order for indemnity costs is appropriate only in exceptional circumstances (<em>BIT Baltic Investment &amp; Trading Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v Wee See Boon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/30308-SSP.xml')\">[2023] 1 SLR 1648</a> at [83], citing <em>CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0020.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 20</a> at [32]). In deciding whether to order indemnity costs, the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, with the touchstone being that of unreasonable conduct, as opposed to conduct that attracts moral condemnation (<em>Lim Oon Kuin and others v Ocean Tankers (Pte)</em> Ltd (interim judicial managers appointed) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27431-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 1 SLR 434</a> at [36]). From our observations of the Applicant’s conduct, we find it appropriate to award costs against him on an indemnity basis. The Applicant has failed to satisfy numerous outstanding costs orders and seeks to put the Respondents to further costs of defending the EOT Application with little assurance that he will make good any costs ordered against him. He has also been found on more than one occasion to have abused the court process (ie, by the Judge in SUM 268, and by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pradeepto</em> (2022) at [95]). We repeat our observations at [45]–[46] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As noted in <em>XHG v XHH</em> - <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32853-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 13</a> (“<em>XHG v XHH</em>”) (at [7]), costs orders are more finely balanced in family disputes which by their nature involve strong emotions. Even so, the Court may award costs on an indemnity basis in appropriate cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For instance, in <em>XHG v XHH</em>, the Court ordered the husband to pay costs on an indemnity basis for the wife having to respond to husband’s 5<sup>th </sup> affidavit of assets and means, filed just prior to the ancillary matters hearing, because it disclosed information that ought to have been disclosed from the beginning. The Court found that the husband could have provided the bank statements and explained them much earlier, and not just before the proceedings commenced. The Husband’s conduct led to the Court and the wife expending time and effort to deal with the evidence urgently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In my judgment, there were exceptional circumstances warranting an indemnity costs order in the present case. The Husband’s conduct in abandoning the agreed joint valuation and dragging out the process was wholly unwarranted and resulted in unnecessary costs being incurred and valuable time wasted. This was not an isolated incident but a continuation of a pattern of conduct displayed by the Husband throughout the proceedings. His conduct was troubling and unreasonable, to say the least.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Taking into account that the wasted costs relating to the joint valuation was included in the AR’s costs order, I awarded costs of the appeal fixed at $10,000 all in to be paid within 7 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I should point out that the Wife had submitted that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant has decidedly opted to pursue a litigation strategy which further frustrates the expeditious resolution of the divorce proceedings, with the latest salvo being his attempt to stay these divorce proceedings by filing HC/[redacted].

Section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”) sets out the definition of “matrimonial asset”. In brief, a matrimonial asset includes any asset which was “acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage”: see s 112(10)(b) of the Charter. An asset which was acquired before the marriage is not a matrimonial asset, unless transformed in accordance with the tests in s 112(10)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Charter. Any asset that falls within the definition of “matrimonial asset” under s 112(10) of the Charter is subject to division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As noted in <em>WAS v WAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27228-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 7</a> (at [4]) (“<em>WAS v WAT</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be identified at the time of the IJ and valued at the time of the AM hearing. It is noted that the balances in bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as the matrimonial assets are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. Thus, in general, available values as close to the AM hearing date as possible will be used. Nevertheless, where parties had specifically agreed to use a value for the asset or liability as at a different date, I adopted that value instead for this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parties helpfully prepared, pursuant to my direction, a Joint Summary of their respective positions. As the Joint Summary was binding on the parties,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I took into consideration the parties’ positions as stated in the Joint Summary in determining the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Joint Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties agreed that there were two joint assets, i.e. (a) the matrimonial flat and (b) SCB E$aver Account number ~ 7130 (“E$aver”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As neither party provided a formal valuation of the matrimonial flat, I took the average of the value of $1,125,000 proposed by the Husband and the value of $1,078,000 proposed by the Wife as the estimated market value of the matrimonial flat, i.e. $1,101,500. The use of the average value is consistent with the broad-brush approach and has been adopted in several precedent cases in similar circumstances: for example, see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I adopted the outstanding loan as of 21 October 2024, i.e. $314,595.94, proposed by the Wife,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> instead of $316,558.31 as of 31 August 2024 proposed by the Husband,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> since “in general, available values as close to the AM hearing date as possible will be used”: see [9] above. Consequently, the net value of the matrimonial flat to be included in the asset pool was $1,101,500 less $314,595.94, i.e. $786,904.06.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As regards the E$aver, I adopted the value of $21,839.11 as of August 2024 proposed by the Husband,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> instead of $21,454.11 as of 22 October 2024 proposed by the Wife,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> since the value proposed by the Husband was closer to the IJ date: see [9] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I noted from the Joint Summary that the Husband’s assets to be included in the asset pool for division were largely undisputed.

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (“<em>ANJ</em>”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) set out a structured approach towards the division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Charter. The structured approach involves three broad steps by which the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions is first ascertained, relative to that of the other party. This is followed by ascribing a second ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions, relative to that of the other party and finally deriving the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios (see <em>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17978-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 52</a> at [17]). In <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL”)</em>, the CA had the occasion to revisit <em>ANJ</em>. In particular, the CA noted (at [41], [43] and [45]) and that while the <em>ANJ</em> approach works well in “Dual-Income Marriages”, the approach should not be applied to “Single-Income Marriages” as the approach “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband submitted that the <em>ANJ</em> structured approach ought to be adopted. As the Wife was gainfully employed for approximately half of the length of the marriage from 2007 to 2015, he argued that the marriage did not fall within the Single-Income Marriage envisaged in <em>TNL</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Wife, on the other hand, contended that although she had worked from 2007 to around 2015, she was the primary homemaker and as such, the <em>TNL</em> approach would be applicable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The concept of a Single-Income Marriage articulated in <em>TNL</em> was considered by the Appellate Division of the High Court (“AD”) in <em>WXW v WXX</em> [2024] SGHCF(A) 2 (“<em>WXW v WXX</em>”). Debbie Ong JAD, delivering the judgment of the court <em>ex tempore</em>, explained (at [13]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The reason why the <em>ANJ</em> approach does not apply to single-income marriages is that it “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse” (<em>TNL v TNK</em> at [44]) and thus the homemaker spouse is disadvantaged by his or her role in the marriage despite the philosophy that marriage is an equal partnership of different efforts. This rationale should guide how a single-income marriage ought to be understood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The learned judge highlighted that just because one spouse earns far less than the other does not render the partnership a Single-Income Marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The fact that one spouse worked intermittently over the course of the marriage does not in itself determine whether the marriage is a Single-Income or Dual Income Marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The key enquiry focuses on the roles undertaken and discharged by the spouses during the marriage: what is called for is a qualitative assessment of the roles played by each spouse in the marriage relative to each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The determination of the primary roles carried out by each party is based on the facts and circumstances of each case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> A homemaker spouse in a Single-Income Marriage is the primary homemaker, not just a spouse who does some or even substantial homemaking.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As further noted by the learned judge (at [15] and [16]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15    Family law on the division of assets has always emphasised the important roles of both spouses, where each spouse may contribute different efforts in breadwinning and homemaking. Thus, if the spouses have decided on a certain arrangement such that one spouse cares for the children and home while the other provides financially for the family, the law gives equal recognition to both types of efforts. The joint marriage partnership is built on the spouses’ joint and complementary roles where the breadwinner can focus on his or her career, assured that the children and home are well cared for by the homemaker spouse (and vice-versa) …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16    Thus, whichever approach is applied, a just outcome must give sufficient recognition to the contributions of both spouses whether the spouse concentrates on the breadwinning or homemaking role …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The learned judge further emphasised that parties should not apply the <em>ANJ</em> and <em>TNL</em> approaches as if they are “technical” rules, overlooking the very rationale behind them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Whether the task is in assessing the parties’ indirect contributions under the <em>ANJ</em> approach or determining whether a spouse is a primary homemaker in a Single-Income Marriage, the same principles are relevant – a broad-brush approach must be applied in assessing indirect and homemaking contributions, which should discourage needless acrimony during the divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Having regard to the guidance provided by the AD in <em>WXW v WXX</em>, I was of the view that the <em>TNL</em> approach would be more appropriate on the facts and circumstances of the present case. Although the Wife was gainfully employed for approximately half of the length of the marriage, this did not, without more, transform the marriage into a dual-income one, contrary to the Huband’s assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The case of <em>VIG v VIH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25105-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 16</a> (“<em>VIG v VIH</em>”), where the wife had similarly worked for about half the length of the marriage, aptly illustrates the point. In <em>VIG v VIH</em>, the parties were married in 2005. The wife was a homemaker at the time of the ancillary matters hearing. Prior to that, she was working as a lawyer. She worked for about a year while in France, and also worked from 2009 to 2013 in Singapore. The court, taking guidance from the Family Division’s decision in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a> at [48]–[50], held (at [63]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Hence, it is not the case that as soon as one spouse works any amount of time that the marriage cannot be treated as a “Single-Income Marriage” and that the structured approach in <em>ANJ</em> must apply. In my view, the present case falls within the scope of a “Single-Income Marriage” even though the Wife had worked for slightly under half of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the recent decision of the Family Division in <em>XPA v XPB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33891-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 57</a> (“<em>XPA v XPB</em>”), Mavis Chionh J accepted the wife’s submission that the marriage was a long Single-Income Marriage. The learned judge held (at [125]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While it is true that the Wife worked for 28 years out of the 34 years of the marriage, I do not consider that this detracts from the fact that she discharged a primarily homemaking role. I agree with the Wife’s submission that her position is analogous to that of the wives in <em>Yow Mee Lan</em> and <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0520.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 520</a>. It will be recalled that both cases were cited by the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL v TNK</em> as examples of Single-Income marriages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While <em>XPA v XPB</em> was decided after my decision in this matter and was not considered at the time, it lends further support to my conclusion that the Wife’s employment did not necessarily render this a Dual-Income Marriage. Notably, in <em>XPA v XPB</em>, the wife had worked for substantially more than half the length of the marriage, i.e. 28 years out of 34 years of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In the final analysis, as noted by the AD in <em>WXW v WXX</em>, what is called for is a qualitative assessment of the roles played by each spouse in the marriage relative to each other. On the evidence before me, it was clear that the Wife’s primary role throughout the marriage remained that of a homemaker. It was not disputed that the Wife had been the primary caregiver for the children since they were born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the Husband acknowledged as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I acknowledge that that the Defendant had been the primary caregiver of the children. It was with this in mind, and also subject to the children’s wishes to continue staying at the family home that I propose that care and control be granted to the Defendant while I have reasonable access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife bore the additional responsibility of managing [C]’s psychological and behavioural condition as he had been

The Husband said that the Wife was constantly obsessed with finding that there was something wrong with the children and sought to unilaterally impose her beliefs on him and the therapists and counsellors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> However, the assessment and diagnostic report from CGH dated 7 March 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> showed that [C] was referred by the Polyclinic<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> because of concerns about his anger management, excessive online gaming, self-harm, aggressive behaviours directed at family members and passive suicidal ideation. The referral letter from the Polyclinic noted, among other things, that [C] displayed “violence (says he will kill himself, will hit mother – punch mother, younger brother – force grab” and “[h]ear voice calling his name” and had “suicidal verbalisation this week, monday/tuesday, punch his own head”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The report noted, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Social Responsiveness Survey completed by his form teacher suggested deficiencies in social behaviour that were clinically significant and might lead to mild to moderate interference with everyday interactions. The clinical picture that emerged was described as Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by DSM-5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The report noted that [C] may struggle with social cues and meaning behind verbal and non-verbal messages and instructions, and he may also have difficulty reading facial expressions. The report recommended for [C] to continue to receive therapy sessions in the Neurobehavioral Clinic (Autism Services) and that it would be helpful for teachers to play a patient, understanding and supportive role in school. The report further recommended that the parents could benefit from further psychoeducation to help them better understand the disorder and support [C]’s needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The report by CGH, which bore out the Wife’s concerns, demonstrated the Wife’s attentiveness and commitment as the primary caregiver, which stood in stark contrast to the Husband’s dismissive attitude and troubling lack of insight into [C]’s developmental needs. The Husband’s suggestion that the Wife “wanted a medical opinion that she could use as an excuse and pretext that she needed to be home to care for [C] and hence, not look for a job”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> could not be taken seriously. In my view, it reflected a cavalier disregard for the circumstances that prompted the Wife to seek medical attention for [C] and the tremendous burden she had been shouldering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In an attempt to show that the Wife became a stay-at-home mother by circumstance and not by choice, the Husband sought to portray the Wife as a job-hopper, pointing out critically that she did not last for more than six months in several of her jobs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> The Husband also said that the Wife was forced to resign in many of her jobs as her superiors had found her performance to be sub-par.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Yet, I noted that the Wife had remained in her employment for a continuous period of almost five years before her resignation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> By any account, this could not be considered a short period of employment. While it was not disputed that the Wife was asked to resign,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> this must be considered in the context of the realities she faced – having to balance full-time employment with the care of both children, one of whom has special needs - a circumstance that further underscored her role as the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Although the Husband disputed the extent of the contributions made by the Wife and the sacrifices she had made for the family,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> the objective facts showed that the Wife had been the primary caregiver of the children since birth and had been a full-time homemaker since 2015. The Wife’s employment for half of the marriage did not alter the fact that this was, in substance, a Single-Income Marriage. A qualitative assessment of the roles played by each spouse relative to each other showed that she discharged the primarily homemaker role.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     As the Husband had premised his submissions on the basis of the <em>ANJ</em> structured approach, I invited him to provide a supplementary submissions on the basis of the <em>TNL</em> approach. In his supplementary submissions, the Husband submitted as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We submit that if however this Honourable Court is not minded to apply ANJ v ANK structured approach to the facts of the case and is indeed minded to apply the TNL approach, we submit that the outcome ought not to be deviated substantially between the two approaches and regardless of the approach adopted after giving regard to all the circumstances of the case as stipulated paragraph 112(2) of the Women’s Charter, we submit that the decision must accurately reflects the respective parties’ contributions or lack thereof during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my respectful view, the Husband’s contention that that the outcome “ought not to be deviated substantially between the approaches” was not an accurate articulation of the legal position. The fact that the court must give sufficient recognition to the contributions of both spouses whether the spouse concentrates on the breadwinning or homemaking role did not mean that the outcome would be substantially the same whichever approach was taken. It was precisely because the <em>ANJ</em> structured approach “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse” that the CA in <em>TNL</em> found it necessary to provide for a different approach for Single-Income Marriages, in line with the philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In determining the proportion of division in Single-Income Marriages, the trend in past cases is relevant. As noted in <em>BOR v BOS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (at [113]), the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” of around 15 to 18 years was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. In the present case, the length of the marriage was about 16 years and 9 months as of the date of the IJ. Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including the responsibility of caring for two children, one of whom has special needs, I found it just and equitable to award the Wife the higher end of the range, i.e. 40% of the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The final division ratio as such was 60 (Husband) : 40 (Wife).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Consequential orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The total value of the asset pool was $1,738,817.95.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Wife’s 40% share of the asset pool was $695,527.18 and the Husband’s 60% share of the asset pool was $1,043,290.77.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although the Husband wanted to be given the first option to take over the matrimonial flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> and had also indicated that he would prefer to have the matrimonial flat sold in the open market than transferring it to the Wife,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> I was of the view that the Wife should be given the first right of retaining the matrimonial flat given the needs of the children: see s 112(2)(c) of the Charter; <em>VWM v VWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29258-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 4</a> (at [18]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The total value of the assets in the Wife’s sole name and the matrimonial flat was $910,848.51 ($123,944.45 add $786,904.06). Hence, if the Wife chooses to exercise her right to retain the matrimonial flat, the amount to be paid to the Husband would be $215,321.33 ($910,848.51 less $695,527,18) and $X (being the payment made by the Husband towards the outstanding housing loan after 21 October 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In the circumstances, I made the following orders on the division of matrimonial assets:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall have the first right to take over the Husband’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat.

Parties shall bear the costs of the transfer equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In the event that the Wife chooses not to exercise her right in accordance with clause (a) above, the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market at or above market value within 18 months from the date of the Final Judgment.

Thereafter there should be no spousal maintenance for the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the Wife sought $1,250 per month for spousal maintenance for an indefinite period.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The power to order maintenance in favour of a former spouse is supplementary to the power to order the division of matrimonial assets. The court takes into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance for a former spouse: see <em>WRX v WRY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31799-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 22</a> (“<em>WRX v WRY</em>”) (at [57]). It is also a trite principle of law that an “order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency by the former wife on the former husband”. A former wife “ought to try to regain self-sufficiency”: see <em>XKT v XKU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33192-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 27</a> (at [83]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     While I found the sum of $1,000 per month proposed by the Husband to be reasonable, I did not think that this was an appropriate case to fix a duration. The Wife had been out of the workforce for more than 10 years and faced significant issues with her mental and physical health.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> In addition, she would have to take care of the children as the parent with sole care and control. This must, no doubt, be challenging, given that [C] is a child with special needs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> In the event that the matrimonial flat is sold, she would face the additional challenges of helping the children adjust to a new environment. Given these circumstances and the uncertainty that lies ahead, it was simply unrealistic to fix a timeline at this point in time. In any event, the law allows for a variation in the event of a material change in circumstances even if a timeline was not specified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In the circumstances, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife spousal maintenance of $1,000 per month with effect from 15 September 2025 and thereafter on or before the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month into a bank account to be specified by her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Child Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Wife’s position was that the sum of $2,500 ($1,250 per child) should be paid to her monthly, and that medical and dental bills should be paid on a reimbursement basis.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Husband’s position was that he would contribute $850 a month for each child, i.e. totalling $1,700 a month. He sought to pay the monthly sums to the children directly. In addition, the Husband would also pay for the listed expenses at paragraph 45(c) of his Written Submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> directly. He also proposed that upon the Wife procuring gainful employment, she was to bear 50% of the children’s fees, school-related expenses, medical and dental expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As noted by the AD in <em>WRX v WRY</em> (at [62]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">At the outset, we emphasise that parties should not take an overly mathematical or calculative approach to the children’s maintenance. An order for maintenance should not be based on the parties curating a list of specific expenses, as if each item on the list represents an item to be specifically provided for. While parties should submit a list of the current expenses of the children in order to provide the court (and the other party) with the children’s likely monthly expenses, a maintenance order does not cast those listed items in stone as if only those specific expenses are allowed to be incurred for the children. Instead, the assessment of reasonable monthly expenses upon which the order for maintenance is made is based on broad budgeting rather than the itemisation of specific expenses (<em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (“<em>WBU</em>”) at [10]–[11]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As regards the parties’ obligations to maintain the children, the following observations of the court in <em>XOY v XOZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33680-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 49</a> (at [138]) were instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I next consider the appropriate contributions of the parties to C2’s expenses. It is statutorily provided in s 68 of the Women’s Charter that each parent has a legal duty to maintain his or her children. In <em>AUA</em> at [41], the Court of Appeal described that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities undergirds the provision – “both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities”. By way of comparison, I refer to <em>TIT v TIU and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> (“<em>TIT</em>”), which was referred to by the Court of Appeal in <em>AUA</em>. In <em>TIT</em>, the court did not order the Wife to contribute to the maintenance of the children because she had no income at all; at [63]. In contrast, in the present case, the Wife is drawing an income. I find the Husband’s approach, based on the ratio of their respective incomes, to be fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Applying the broad budgeting approach, I found the maintenance sought by the Wife for each child to be reasonable. Indeed, I noted that the difference between the parties’ positions was not that far apart. As the Wife was the parent with care and control of the children and hence bore the responsibility of managing the daily expenses of the children, the maintenance ought to be paid directly to her. Of course, if the Husband wishes to give any additional pocket money to the children out of love for them, he is at liberty to so. Indeed, this will be most commendable. With regard to the Husband’s request to fix a quantum for the Wife’s contribution to the children’s maintenance upon procuring gainful employment, I was of the view that it would be premature for the court to do so. Among other things, the Wife’s income, which is a relevant factor in apportioning the parties’ contributions, would only be known when she has obtained gainful employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the circumstances, I ordered the Husband to pay a monthly sum of $2,500 ($1,250 per child) with effect from 15 September 2025 and thereafter on or before the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month into a bank account to be specified by the Wife. In addition, the Husband is to pay for the medical and dental bills of the children on a reimbursement basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As noted in <em>WRX v WRY</em> (at [75]), the usual costs order in ancillary matters proceedings on financial relief is for parties to bear their own costs. As there was nothing exceptional in the present case to depart from the usual position, I ordered each party to bear its own costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p

The marriage was dissolved in February 2024. On 9 May 2024, a Consent Order was recorded on the ancillary matters comprising orders for the division of the matrimonial flat and other assets (“AM Order”) including the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Each party shall retain their respective assets in their own names.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 6 March 2025, the Plaintiff applied for leave for an Order of Committal against the Defendant for the Defendant’s continual non-compliance of the above order. Leave was granted on 12 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The assets in dispute were 2 dogs named X and Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In the application, the Plaintiff sought the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Defendant is in contempt of Court as he has continually breached the Order of Court by failing, neglecting, and / or refusing to return the 2 dogs to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>b.     The Defendant is to return the dogs to the Plaintiff forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>c.     The Defendant is sentenced to imprisonment and / or fine for contempt of Court should he fail, neglect, and / or refuse to return the Dogs to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>d.     Costs of this application to be provided by the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Having heard the application, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application with costs of $3,500. The Plaintiff appealed against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>a.     Plaintiff affidavit in support filed on 22 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>b.     Plaintiff reply affidavit filed on 12 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>a.     Defendant 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit filed on 6 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>b.     Defendant’s witness “Miss B” filed on 6 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>c.     Defendant reply affidavit filed on 26 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Oral application to strike out </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Under Rule 647, Family Justice Rules 2014, the court may strike out any matter in an affidavit that is scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive. The court’s power to strike out is discretionary in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the start of the hearing on 5 June 2025, the Plaintiff’s counsel applied to strike out parts of the Defendant’s 1<sup>st</sup> and Miss B’s affidavit on the ground that they contained either hearsay or expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Having heard the arguments, the following paragraphs or sentences within the paragraph of the Defendant’s 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit were struck out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>a.     Paragraph 12. The last sentence “They acknowledge my messages and did not request me to return the dogs” and the documents exhibited in TAB 1 of the affidavit were struck out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The following sentences were not:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Sometime in or around end 2024, we found a buyer for the matrimonial and sold our matrimonial home, pursuant to the Order of Court. The completion date of sale was in March 2025. As such, on 20 January 2025, I moved out of the matrimonial home together with X and Y. I wanted to inform the Plaintiff of this but she blocked me on WhatsApp so I could not reach her. I had no choice but to inform the Plaintiff's sister-in-law and her brother instead that I had moved out of the matrimonial home and I have taken X and Y with me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>b.     Paragraphs 13. The sentences in the paragraph other than those below were struck out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">X is a male dog born on 24 February 2015. He was purchased and paid by the Plaintiff's former husband, Mr. A, in or around 2016 <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>c.     Paragraph 14. The whole of paragraph 14 was struck out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>d.     Paragraph 15. The whole paragraph other than the following sentence was struck out <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">After my divorce with the Plaintiff concluded, our matrimonial home was ordered to be sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Plaintiff also applied for paragraphs 16 to 18 and 22 to 26 to be struck out. The paragraphs read:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16.    Screenshots of my WhatsApp conversation with Mr. A on 10 November 2024 evidencing the above are enclosed at TAB 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17.    Y is a male dog born on 5 April 2019. I personally adopted Y in 2019 after I saw my friend, Miss B 's, adoption advertisement on Facebook seeking to rehome Y. Miss B is a dog seller in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">18.    I reached out to Miss A and requested to view Y in person. The Plaintiff did not join the viewing. After viewing, I decided to adopt Y and brought him home. Ever since his adoption, I have been caring for him. The Plaintiff had no role in the adoption. Screenshots of my conversations with Miss B confirming that I was the one who took the step and made the decision to adopt Y are enclosed at TAB 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Plaintiff also objected to paragraph 22 on the ground that it contained expert opinion on dogs. Paragraphs 22 to 26 were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22.    Dogs are highly social animals that require regular attention, interaction, and companionship from their humans to thrive. Without sufficient attention, dogs can experience stress, anxiety, and even depression. As someone who claims to be an owner, the Plaintiff should be well aware of these needs. However, her history of disengagement clearly reflects otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ADD OR AMEND THE VETERINARY RECORD FOR THE DOGS' OWNERSHIP</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23.    On 27 January 2025, I visited M Clinic (&quot;the Clinic&quot;) to obtain the medical records from the Clinic so that I can transfer the Dogs' medical records to another clinic which was nearer to my new home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">24.    However, the Clinic told me that the Plaintiff instructed them not to disclose any information to me. The Plaintiff's act of hindering me access to their medical needs are clearly acting in bad faith and failed to consider the needs of X and Y. It dawned on me that, like her ex-husband, she is merely using them as a pawn to annoy me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">CONCLUSION</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25.    Mr. A is the actual owner of X. He has expressly given his consent for me to have and care for X. As for Y, I personally adopted him and have been solely responsible for his upbringing, care, and well-being since the adoption. My role as the person who has provided for both dogs clearly reflect me as the beneficial owners of the Dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">26.    The act of registering X and Y in her name does not confer the Plaintiff's ownership especially where I have been their primary caregiver. Ownership is not determined solely by registration, but by the actions and responsibilities undertaken in caring for the animals. I aver that I am the beneficial owner of the Dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I was of the view that the matters stated in paragraphs 16 to 18 and 23 to 24 were relevant. Paragraph 16 made reference to WhatsApp messages between Mr A and the Defendant including the following by Mr A to the Defendant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Previously she was supposed to handover X to me or pay me back $5k agreed with her lawyer. X is under my name and I purchased him using my card. She neglected him for many days and went away and didn’t come back.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for the matters set out in paragraph 22, I did not think these were confined only to experts. Paragraphs 25 and 26 were the Defendant’s concluding remarks which should be allowed to stand. I thus did not order for the above-mentioned paragraphs to be struck out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Plaintiff also objected to paragraphs 5 and 8 of Miss B’s affidavit which read as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.    I recall that Z then sent me a Facebook message informing me that the Defendant is interested in adopting W (Y’s former name) . The messages are enclosed herewith at TAB A. At the material time, I did not share a close personal friendship with the Defendant. Shortly after receiving Z ’s message, I recall that the Defendant contacted me directly via my mobile phone to express his interest in adopting W and requested to view W in person. Upon learning that the Defendant was already keeping another beagle as a pet, I was reassured that W would be placed in a home where he would receive appropriate care. Consequently, I agreed to permit the Defendant to adopt W and duly informed Z of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.    Moreover, W is a beagle, a breed known for its high energy levels and natural hunting instincts. Thus, beagles are active and intelligent dogs that require regular exercise, mental stimulation, and structured routines to ensure their physical and emotional wellbeing. It is clear to me that the Defendant is well aware of their needs and has shown a commitment to providing W with appropriate care, including daily walks, playtime, and engagement, all of which are essential to the breed’s health and happiness. I know all this because following the handover, I remained in occasional contact with the Defendant for the purpose of checking on W’s well-being, and I subsequently came to understand that the Defendant had renamed the dog as Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Paragraph 5 narrated how Y (formerly called “W”) came into the Defendant’s possession while paragraph 8 contained Miss B’s account of Y which the Plaintiff objected on the grounds that it contained expert opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. I did not accede to the application to strike out these paragraphs. Paragraph 5 was relevant while in paragraph 8, Miss B had made the statements not as an expert but based on her personal knowledge of the subject-matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     At the above hearing, the Plaintiff’s counsel informed that the Plaintiff had additional documents of about 147 pages to submit to the court as she thought that she could do so at the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     As Defendant had not seen the additional documents, I directed the Plaintiff to file a further affidavit with the additional documents and that the Defendant filed an affidavit in reply to that further affidavit. I also gave the Plaintiff permission to raise any objection if the Defendant raised any new issue in his reply affidavit. I directed written submissions to be prepared after which I would deliver my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Plaintiff’s further affidavit was filed on 12 June with the additional documents to show how she took care of the 2 dogs. She produced invoices from veterinary clinics and pet shops. She also submitted photographs of her and the dogs to show that she had cared for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Defendant’s affidavit in reply of 26 June in response to the Plaintiff’s affidavit also contained the Defendant’s evidence on the expenses he incurred on the dogs and photographs of the Defendant and the dogs to show that he had also cared for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Plaintiff also sought to expunge paragraphs 10 to 15 of the Defendant’s affidavit in reply on the basis that these were not included in his earlier affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Having considered the objections, I was not inclined to do so as the paragraphs concerned were in rebuttal to the Plaintiff’s further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Plaintiff’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The grounds for committal as stated in the Statement for Order of Committal was that the Defendant had breached the Order by “failing, refusing, and/or neglecting to return” the 2 dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff claimed that she should retain ownership and possession of the dogs as the dogs were in her sole name as evidenced by the licenses issued to her by the Animal and Veterinary Service (“AVS”) pursuant to the Animal and Birds Act 1965 read with the Animal and Birds (Licensing and Control of Cats and Dogs) Rules 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>a.     In respect of X, the Plaintiff was issued a Dog Licence in July 2016, before the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>b.     In respect of Y, the Plaintiff was issued a Dog Licence in January 2025, after the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In breach of the Order, the Defendant had, on 20 January 2025, removed the dogs from her residence. On 27 January 2025, her solicitor served on the Defendant a letter with the Order of Court endorsed with a Penal Notice notifying the Defendant of the breach and seeking the return of the dogs. The Defendant did not return the dogs to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Defendant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Defendant contended that the dogs were not matrimonial assets and should not be treated as divisible matrimonial assets. Dogs were not capable of valuation for division and should not be treated as commodities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Plaintiff had never mentioned, discussed or negotiated an agreement with him on the dogs throughout the proceedings despite being represented in the divorce proceedings. The Plaintiff had always felt that the dogs belonged to him and as he did not think that was in dispute, the parties had not contemplated the issue of the dogs at that juncture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As the completion date for the sale of the matrimonial home was in March 2025, on 20 January 2025, he moved out of the home together with the 2 dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Defendant claimed that X was owned by Mr A, the Plaintiff’s former husband, and after the annulment of her previous marriage, the Plaintiff was supposed to handover X to the Defendant but the Plaintiff went ahead to obtain the dog license for X in her sole name without the former husband’s consent. The Defendant claimed that Mr A agreed that the Defendant could keep X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As regards Y, the Defendant informed that he had personally adopted Y (i.e., to keep Y as his pet) in April 2019 after seeing an advertisement on Facebook put up by Miss B, a dog seller. He did not think that it was necessary to register Y with AVS. Without his consent and knowledge, the Plaintiff registered Y in her name with AVS in January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Miss B’s confirmed that she did place Y for adoption via Facebook. She received a message from a close friend that the Defendant was interested in adopting Y. The Defendant contacted her personally and eventually Miss B agreed to the Defendant adopting Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the dogs were matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To address the Defendant’s contention, the Plaintiff relied on <em>Tan Huey Kuan (alias Chen Huijuan) v Tan Kok Chye and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0086.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 86</a> wherein the court faced a similar issue. In that case the dispute before the High Court was over the ownership and possession of a female black terrier dog. The court in the above case, decided on the issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In view of the above, I came to the view that the dogs were matrimonial assets. As with other assets, parties could agree on how they were to be dealt with including an order for them to be given to which party, declaring which party to own such or ordering a sale and division of the proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Was the Plaintiff the owner of the 2 dogs and thus capable of enforcing the Court Order if the Defendant had been in contempt?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The AM Order had no mention of the 2 dogs. To prove ownership, both the Plaintiff and the Defendant produced evidence to show that they had cared for, paid for or contributed towards the expenses to maintain the 2 dogs. However, in my view, the real issue was not so much as to who has cared or expended more for the dogs but who was the actual legal owner of the 2 dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     From the facts, there was no evidence that parties had applied their minds as to whom the dogs should go to or how they were to be dealt with when dealing with the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     There was no evidence that the 2 dogs were featured in the prayers for ancillary reliefs in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. There was also no Affidavit of Assets and Means prepared where parties addressed their minds as to the fate of the 2 dogs when considering the ancillary issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Plaintiff had to prove that she was the owner of the 2 dogs. This could be done by showing, for example, that she had bought the 2 dogs or they were gifted to her by someone which would make her the owner of the dogs. The Plaintiff was unable to provide any such evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Plaintiff claimed that she owned the dogs by virtue of the licenses issued to her under the Animals and Birds (Licensing and Control of Cats and Dogs) Rules 2024 (“Rules”). The Dog Licence for X and Y named the Plaintiff as the licensee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I was of the view that the licensing of the dogs under the above rules did not confer ownership on the licensee. Under rule 4 of the above Rules, a person who intended to keep a dog in any premises must submit an application for a licence. There was no requirement that the person applying for such a license must be the owner of the dog.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Unlike in <em>Tan Huey Kuan’s</em> case where the parties went to the extent of adducing evidence at the main hearing as to who had the right to possession and ownership of the dog, there was no such proceedings in this case. In my view, a committal proceeding was not the correct procedure for such an inquiry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Defendant provided an explanation as to how X came into his possession. At paragraph 16 of his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit, he exhibited screenshots of his WhatsApp conversation with Mr. A on 10 November 2024. The WhatsApp message stated that Mr A was the owner of X and that the Plaintiff was supposed to handover X back to Mr A or pay Mr A the sum of $5,000 as was agreed previously with the Plaintiff’s lawyer. Mr A had paid for X and was thus the true owner of X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As for Y, it was the Defendant who was the party responsible for bringing Y into their former household. This was confirmed by his witness, Miss B, who stated that she gave Y to the Defendant and not to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Court’s powers to punish conduct in relation to an order of court is set out in section 4 (1) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (“AJPA”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4(1)  Any person who —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    intentionally disobeys or breaches any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    intentionally breaches any undertaking given to a court, commits a contempt of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Further, section 21 of the AJPA provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“A person is not guilty of contempt of court under section 4(1), (2) or (3) if the person satisfies the court that the failure or refusal to comply with a judgment, order, decree, direction, writ or other process of court or any undertaking given to a court was wholly or substantially attributable to an honest and reasonable failure by that person, at the relevant time, to understand an obligation imposed on the person bound by the judgment, order, decree, direction, writ, process or undertaking and that that person ought fairly to be excused.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The standard of proof for civil contempt is that of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The person alleged must also be shown to have committed the breach intentionally. The court in <em>Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18910-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1</a> stated at [85] and [86]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">85.    First, it is well-established that the applicable standard of proof to both criminal and civil contempt is that of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt: Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0518.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518</a> (“Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd”) at [31]–[32], citing In re Bramblevale Ltd [1970] Ch 128 at 137.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">86.    Secondly, as regards the issue of the requisite mens rea to establish contempt for disobedience of court orders, it is accepted that it is only necessary to prove that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the court order was intentional and that it knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order: Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd at [51]. This necessarily includes knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms. It is, however, not necessary to establish that the party had appreciated that it was breaching the order. Therefore, the motive or intention of the party who had acted in breach of the order is strictly irrelevant to the issue of liability though it may have a material bearing in determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     On the evidence, I was of the view that Plaintiff had not discharged the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I was not satisfied that the Defendant had intentionally committed the breach. In respect of X, the Defendant must have genuinely believed that the Plaintiff was not the rightful owner of X as Mr A, X’s rightful owner has represented to the Defendant that the Defendant could keep X. The Plaintiff had not given any evidence to prove otherwise. In respect of Y, it was given to the Defendant by Miss B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The court order concerned must not be ambiguous or unclear. In Mok Kah Hong’s case at [78], the Court of Appeal, stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">78.    In our view, the decisions in Re Oddy ([74] supra) and Iberian Trust ([74] supra) demonstrate the importance and impact of the manner in which an order of court is framed and extracted in determining whether the order can be enforced by way of committal proceedings. As Luxmoore J had observed in Iberian Trust, an order must state in unambiguous terms what had to be done on the part of the defendant in order for committal proceedings to lie against the defendant. This is, in our view, a rule of fairness. A defendant cannot be punished for failing to comply with an order of court if it is unclear what is expected of the defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I agreed with the Defendant’s submission that the clause concerned was ambiguous. As explained in paragraph 33 to 34 above, there was no evidence that parties had applied their minds as to whom the dogs should go to or how they were to be dealt with. There was no evidence that the 2 dogs were featured in the prayers for ancillary reliefs in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. There was also no Affidavit of Assets of Means prepared where parties addressed their minds as to the fate of the 2 dogs when considering the ancillary issues. Such ambiguous clause should be interpreted in favour of the Defendant. His conduct would also be excusable under section 21 of the AJPA mentioned above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     For completeness, I would add that the Plaintiff had also submitted that she was also the beneficial owner of the 2 dogs. No legal basis was put forth by the Plaintiff to show that there was such a concept for the asset involved. I thus did not think that the Plaintiff could succeed on this basis as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     For the above reasons, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having considered the extent to the work done to resist the application I awarded costs of $3,500 to the Defendant.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Proceedings (NOP) at page 14 line 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>NOP page 19 line 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>NOP page 20 line 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>NOP page 21 line 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>NOP page 28 at line 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Made in the Plaintiff written submissions.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2025-11-03","court":"Family Court","case-number":"OADV 78/2025 and MSS 2631/2024","title":"XTW v XTX and another matter","citation":"[2025] SGFC 119","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34034-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Nur Amalina Binte Saparin (Adel Law LLC) for the Father, applicant in FC/OADV 78/2025 and respondent in MSS 2631/2024","Ms Fang Yashi (Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Mother, respondent in FC/OADV 78/2025 and applicant in MSS 2631/2024."],"timestamp":"2025-11-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Phang Hsiao Chung","html":"<root><head><title>XTW v XTX and another matter</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XTW <em>v</em> XTX and another matter </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34034-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 119</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">OADV 78/2025 and MSS 2631/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">03 November 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Phang Hsiao Chung </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Nur Amalina Binte Saparin (Adel Law LLC) for the Father, applicant in FC/OADV 78/2025 and respondent in MSS 2631/2024; Ms Fang Yashi (Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Mother, respondent in FC/OADV 78/2025 and applicant in MSS 2631/2024. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XTW — XTX </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">3 November 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Phang Hsiao Chung:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties are the father (the “Father”) and the mother (the “Mother”) of a boy (the “Child”) born in 2009.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 7 March 2013, the Mother commenced divorce proceedings against the Father in D 1145/2013. By an Interim Judgment granted on 12 August 2013 (the “Interim Judgment”), the marriage between the parties was dissolved by reason that the Father had behaved in such a way that the Mother cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Paragraph 3 of the Interim Judgment contained the following orders, which were made by consent of both parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    Both parties are given joint custody, care and control of the [Child].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">i.    The [Father] shall have care and control of the [Child] from Sunday 8pm to Friday 12pm with reasonable access to the [Mother].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">ii.    The [Mother] shall have care and control of the [Child] from Friday 12pm till Sunday 8pm with reasonable access to the [Father].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Each party is entitled to spend time with the [Child] during Chinese New Year. This shall be in alternate years, starting with the [Father] in 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    Every June and December school holidays, the [Mother] is entitled to bring the [Child] overseas for a period up to 10 days. The [Mother] must give the [Father] the full itinerary ie. date, place and contact number for the overseas trip at least 7 days before the travel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    The [Father] is to pay $40,000 as lumpsum maintenance for the [Mother].

The Mother declared in her complaint that: (a) under the Interim Judgment, the Father was ordered to pay $500 per month for the maintenance of the Child; and (b) the Father was in arrears of $18,000 as at 28 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 7 February 2025, the Father applied by FC/OADV 78/2025 for paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment to be deleted, and for

June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As regards MSS 2631/2024, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father is

The Father stopped making the payment “when the Child no longer stayed with the [Mother], and when she had ceased providing any financial support towards the Child’s expenses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The Father knew that the Mother paid for the Child’s meal when the Mother and the Child ate out together, and that the Mother gave the Child some cash on an ad-hoc basis (around $20) to supplement his pocket money when they met.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother gave the following evidence in her affidavit for FC/OADV 78/2025 filed on 9 June 2025 (“MA1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother always tried to take care of the Child during her designated time from Friday 12 pm to Sunday 5 pm. On the weekends when the Mother had to work, she made other arrangements to make sure she still spent time with the Child and stayed involved in his life by “coordinating a replacement time” with the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father often made it hard for the Mother to spend time with the Child. There were “many times” when the Mother’s parenting time was limited because the Father “gave last minute reasons” or “didn’t communicate properly”. There were several weekends when the Mother was told that the Child could not stay over, and could only meet for dinner, usually because of schoolwork or exams. There were also multiple occasions when the Mother was not informed by the Father, and found out from the Child, that the Child had travelled overseas with the Father. The Father deliberately limited the Child’s time with the Mother by using different excuses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother also gave in to the Child’s requests to change the Mother’s care and control period. The requests could be made during festive seasons or for other excuses (e.g. to attend Buddhism class or to visit the Father’s mother).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The order in the Interim Judgment requiring the Father to pay the Mother $500 per month as child maintenance was made by consent. When the Father stopped making those payments, the Mother did not enforce the order at that time as the Mother was concerned that doing so might damage the relationship between the Child and the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The child maintenance of $500 per month was agreed on the basis that the Mother would exercise care and control of the Child from Friday 12 pm to Sunday 5 pm, and would cover the Child’s expenses during this period. However, the Mother has been deprived of meaningful care and control time with the Child. Nevertheless, the Mother continued to give the Child cash whenever she had the opportunity to meet him. There was therefore no material change in circumstances to justify varying the order for the maintenance of the Child, as the care and control arrangements for the Child remained unchanged.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     During the hearing on 31 July 2025, I asked the parties’ counsel to address the Court on the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when did the Child stop staying with the Mother at any time from Friday to Sunday, as envisaged by the Interim Judgment (“First Issue”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     after the Child stopped staying with the Mother in the manner envisaged by the Interim Judgment, what form of provision of “accommodation, clothing, food and education” did the Mother provide the Child, and what was the period of such provision (“Second Issue”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     when did the Father stop paying the Mother maintenance for the Child (“Third Issue”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father’s counsel submitted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the First Issue, there was no specific date or point in time when the Child stopped staying with the Mother. Instead, it was gradual decrease over time. In the Interim Judgment, it was 2 nights. Slowly it became 1 night, from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning or afternoon. Eventually, it became just weekend meals with the Mother. The Father could not pinpoint a certain point when overnight access stopped. However, since August 2020, the Mother would arrange to have dinner with the Child only on Saturdays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the Second Issue, the Father’s position was that the Mother’s financial provisions for the Child were limited to paying for the Child’s meals, giving additional pocket money, and buying items when the Mother and the Child went shopping together. The Father was unable to quantify the extent of the Mother’s financial provisions for the Child. However, the Father’s counsel agreed that the Mother spends about $250 per month on the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On the Third Issue, the Father stopped making payments after January 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother’s counsel submitted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the First Issue, the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother from May 2023 onwards. This was supported by a WhatsApp message sent by the Child to the Mother on 3 April 2023, which was exhibited at page 10 of MA1. Before that, the Mother would care for the Child during the designated time from Friday to Sunday, as stated in paragraph 4 of MA1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the Second Issue, the Mother covered the Child’s expenses during the period she had care and control of the Child, as stated in paragraph 13 of MA1. The Mother gave the Child pocket money amounting to $120 per month, and spent $30 per week for other expenses for the Child, as set out in M1. The Father admitted, in paragraph 8 of his counsel’s written submissions, that the Mother had incurred “ad hoc expenses involving paying for [the Child’s] meals and buying for [the Child] items / toys when they meet, and giving [the Child] cash as additional pocket money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On the Third Issue, the Father stopped paying child maintenance in February 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">FC/OADV 78/2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) requires each parent of a child to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of the child, whether the child is in the parent’s custody or the custody of any other person, either by providing the child with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable, having regard to the parent’s means and station in life, or by paying the cost thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Paragraph 3(a), (e) and (f) of the Interim Judgment contained consent orders that envisaged that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     both parties would have joint custody, and shared care and control, of the Child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Father would have care and control of the Child from Sunday 8 pm to Friday 12 noon, with reasonable access to the Mother;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Mother would have care and control of the Child from Friday 12 noon to Sunday 8 pm, with reasonable access to the Father;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Father would pay the Mother $500 per month as maintenance for the Child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     in addition, the Father would bear all of the Child’s school fees, medical expenses, dental expenses and educational related expenses up to tertiary level.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Interim Judgment recognised the differences between the means of the Father (who was earning a monthly gross income of $8,540 when I heard the applications) and the Mother (who was earning a monthly gross income of $2,100 when I heard the applications). Therefore, paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment required the Father to contribute $500 each month to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child during the periods in that month when the Mother had care and control of the Child, while paragraph 3(f) of the Interim Judgment required the Father to bear all of the Child’s school fees, medical expenses, dental expenses and educational related expenses up to tertiary level.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Under paragraph 3(a)(ii) of the Interim Judgment, the Mother was to have care and control of the Child from Friday 12 noon to Sunday 8 pm. As this order contemplated that the Child would stay overnight with the Mother, the Mother’s duty under section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 extended to providing the Child with suitable accommodation while the Mother had care and control of the Child. The cost of renting premises that can accommodate both the Mother and the Child does not vary according to the number of days in a month that the Child stays overnight with the Mother. Therefore, so long as the Child continued to stay overnight with the Mother at any time in a month:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Mother’s duty to maintain the Child extended to providing the Child with suitable accommodation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother would have to incur the costs of providing such accommodation, regardless of the number of days when the Child stayed overnight with the Mother; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     there was no reason to reduce the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child merely on account of the Child staying overnight with the Mother on fewer days per month than contemplated under paragraph 3(a)(ii) of the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     There is some evidence that the Child was still staying overnight with the Mother until 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The following exchange of WhatsApp messages between the Child and the Mother on 3 April 2023 (reproduced from page 10 of MA1) suggests that as at 3 April 2023, the Father had agreed that Child would stay overnight with the Mother from Friday, 7 April 2023 (which was Good Friday in 2023) to Saturday, 8 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <u>Child</u>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Mummy, daddy say friday go your house then saturday come back [19:27]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Are you free on firday?

These exchanges also supported the Mother’s claim that the Father dictated when the Child could stay overnight with the Mother, and prevented the Mother from exercising care and control of the Child to the full extent of the Mother’s entitlement under the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother admitted through her counsel that from May 2023 onwards, the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother. Thereafter, the Mother’s only expenses in relation to maintaining the Child comprised pocket money of $120 per month and miscellaneous expenses of $30 per week (or approximately $130 per month, calculated from $30 per week times 52 weeks per year divided by 12 months). By the Mother’s own admission, the amount that she now spends per month on the Child amounts to no more than $250. While there is evidence suggesting that the Father had prevented the Mother from exercising care and control of the Child to the full extent of the Mother’s entitlement under the Interim Judgment, this did not change the fact that over time, there was an actual reduction in the amount incurred by the Mother in maintaining the Child. This constituted a change in the circumstances sufficient to justify reducing the amount of the maintenance contributed monthly by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother is also liable to contribute to the maintenance of the Child. On the evidence, the Father’s monthly gross income is $8,540, while the Mother’s monthly gross income is approximately $2,100. As the Father’s monthly gross income is slightly more than 4 times the Mother’s monthly gross income, in line with the parties’ relative earning capacities, I decided that the Father should bear 80% of the amount of $250 that the Mother pays each month for the maintenance of the Child. I therefore reduced the amount of the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 per month to $200 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I then considered whether the variation in the amount of maintenance should be backdated. As the Mother admitted that the Child stopped staying overnight with her from May 2023 onwards, it would not be fair to require the Father to contribute $500 per month to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child after May 2023. I therefore backdated the variation in the amount of maintenance to 1 June 2023, and ordered that the amount payable by the Father to the Mother as maintenance for the Child under paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment be reduced to $200 per month with effect from 1 June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">MSS 2631/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is not disputed that the Father stopped contributing to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from February 2014. There is inconsistency in the Father’s evidence as to whether the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother from August 2017<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> or August 2020<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. Regardless of the position adopted by the Father, there is evidence, including from the Father’s affidavits,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that the Child continued to stay overnight with the Mother in 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During the period from February 2014 to the time the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother, the Child continued to receive at least accommodation and food from the Mother. Therefore, there was no reason to reduce the Father’s liability for the agreed maintenance during that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Although the Father (by his own admission) has been in arrears since February 2014, the Mother only claimed maintenance arrears of $18,000 as at 28 November 2024. Simple arithmetic will show that the Mother did not claim the full amount of maintenance that the Father had denied the Mother, based on the Father’s admission of when he stopped paying maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Both parties assumed that section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 applied to this case. Section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Maintenance arrears are not recoverable in any proceedings (whether commenced before, on or after the date of commencement of section 24 of the Family Justice Reform Act 2023) from the defaulter if the amount accrued due more than 3 years before the commencement of the proceedings, unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    other proceedings to recover the amount from the defaulter had previously been commenced within 3 years (or any longer period that the court in those proceedings may have allowed) after the amount accrued due; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The predecessor of section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 is section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 as in force immediately before 16 January 2025, which has a different ambit, and states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Section 91R of the Women’s Charter 1961 is contained in the present Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961. When section 91R, and the rest of the present Part 9, of the Women’s Charter 1961 came into operation on 16 January 2025, they only applied to certain classes of maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961 was replaced by section 24 of the Family Justice Reform Act 2023 (Act 18 of 2023) (the “FJRA”). Section 121 of the Women’s Charter 1961 was deleted by section 25 of the FJRA. Section 45(13) to (15) of the FJRA sets out the saving and transitional provisions for sections 24 and 25 of the FJRA in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(13)  Subject to regulations made under subsection (15), despite sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(<em>b</em>), sections 69, 71, 71A, 71B, 71C, 74, 75, 76, 77, 121, 121G(2) and Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before the date of commencement of sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(<em>b</em>), continue to apply as if sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(<em>b</em>) had not been enacted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(14)  Subsection (13) ceases to apply to any class of maintenance orders, and in the circumstances, as may from time to time be prescribed under subsection (15).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(15)  The Minister charged with the responsibility for law may, by regulations prescribe —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    the classes of maintenance orders and circumstances for the purposes of subsection (14); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    such provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the regulations made under paragraph (<em>a</em>) as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     By virtue of section 45(13) of the FJRA, Part 9 and section 121 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before 16 January 2025, continue to apply to the enforcement of maintenance orders as if sections 24 and 25 of the FJRA had not been enacted. However, the Minister for Law may make regulations under section 45(15) of the FJRA to prescribe a class of maintenance orders to which, and the circumstances in which, section 45(13) of the FJRA would cease to apply. Where the Minister for Law has made such regulations, then by virtue of section 45(14) of the FJRA, section 45(13) of the FJRA would cease to apply to the prescribed class of maintenance orders, and consequently, the present Part 9 (including section 91R) of the Women’s Charter 1961 will apply to that class of maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The regulations made by the Minister for Law under section 45(15) of the FJRA were the Family Justice Reform Act 2023 (Cessation of Application of Section 45(13)) Regulations 2024 (G.N. No. S 994/2024) (the “Cessation Regulations”). When the Cessation Regulations came into operation on 16 January 2025, regulation 3 of those Regulations provided for the cessation of the application of section 45(13) of the FJRA in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Cessation of application of section 45(13) of Act</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    For the purposes of section 45(14) of the Act, section 45(13) of the Act ceases to apply on or after 16 January 2025 to any relevant maintenance order in respect of which —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    there is at least one concluded maintenance enforcement application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    there is no pending maintenance enforcement application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     MSS 2631/2024 was commenced on 28 November 2024. When section 24 of the FJRA (and consequently, the present Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961) came into operation on 16 January 2025, the version of the Cessation Regulations that applied to MSS 2631/2024 was the version as in force on 16 January 2025. Although the maintenance order that the Mother sought to enforce in MSS 2631/2024 (namely, paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment) was a “relevant maintenance order” (as defined in regulation 2(1) of the Cessation Regulations), there was no previous maintenance enforcement application made in respect of that maintenance order. Therefore, section 45(13) of the FJRA did not cease to apply to paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment. Consequently, by virtue of section 45(13) of the FJRA:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the present Part 9 (including section 91R) of the Women’s Charter 1961, which came into operation on 16 January 2025, did not apply to MSS 2631/2024; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before 16 January 2025, continued to apply to MSS 2631/2024, as if the present Part 9 (including section 91R) of the Women’s Charter 1961 had not been enacted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The version of the Cessation Regulations as in force on 16 January 2025 continued to apply until immediately before 1 October 2025. As such, section 91R of the Women’s Charter 1961 did not apply to MSS 2631/2024 when the matter was heard on 31 July 2025. As the Mother only claimed arrears of $18.000, but the total amount of maintenance that the Father had failed to pay under paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment was significantly more than that, I assessed the amount of maintenance arrears as at 28 November 2024 to be $18,000 (calculated from $500 times 12 months times 3 years). To be clear, even after taking into account the reduction in the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 to $200 with effect from 1 June 2023, the total amount that the Father failed to contribute towards the Mother’s maintenance of the Child in the 4-year period from December 2020 to November 2024 would have exceeded $18,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The parties did not submit on whether section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (as in force immediately before 16 January 2025) might apply to MSS 2631/2024 in place of section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Even if section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (or section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 as in force immediately before 16 January 2025) had applied to MSS 2631/2024, I was of the view that there were special circumstances, under section 91R(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (or section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 as in force immediately before 16 January 2025), for the Court to allow the Mother to recover $18,000 of maintenance arrears from the Father. The amount of $18,000 would have represented 3 years of arrears, if the Court had not reduced the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 to $200 with effect from 1 June 2023. Given the Father’s egregious failure to comply with paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment since February 2014, despite the Father’s ability to contribute to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child, it would not be fair to reduce the amount of arrears that the Mother would otherwise have been entitled to recover under paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment, had the Court not reduced the Father’s liability for maintenance. Further, even after taking into account the reduction in the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 to $200 with effect from 1 June 2023:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the amount of $18,000 was less than the amount that the Father would have been liable to pay in the 4-year period from December 2020 to November 2024; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the $18,000 of maintenance arrears that the Court allowed the Mother to recover from the Father would have represented amounts that accrued due no more than 4 years before the commencement of MSS 2631/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     After I assessed the amount of maintenance arrears as at 28 November 2024 to be $18,000, the Father’s counsel proposed that the Father pay $500 per month towards the maintenance arrears, in addition to the $200 per month that will be payable as maintenance moving forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I therefore ordered the Father to pay the maintenance arrears of $18,000 (as at 28 November 2024) in 36 monthly instalments of $500 per month, with the first payment to be paid by 15 August 2025, and with subsequent payments to be made by the 15th day of each subsequent month. I also ordered the Father to show proof of payment of the arrears for 3 months starting in August 2025, given that the Father had failed to contribute to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child since February 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Both parties’ counsel proposed that each party should bear his or her own costs for both applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As each party had succeeded in the application taken out by that party but failed in the application taken out by the other party, I agreed with the position on costs proposed by both parties’ counsel. I therefore ordered each party to bear his or her own costs for both applications.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See FA1 paragraph 7, and FA3 paragraphs 8 and 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See FA1 paragraph 8, and FA3 paragraph 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See FA1 paragraph 9, FA2 paragraph 12, and FA3 first paragraph 17.

He submitted that this was a breach of confidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father claimed that his understanding was that proceedings before the Family Court are confidential. In making this argument, he cited section 10 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (“<b>FJA</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, counsel for the Mother made the following submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father had not shown what was the confidential information the Mother had circulated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother had only sent her written submissions to her current husband. In this regard, the Father had not shown the basis for which confidentiality attaches to the Mother’s own written submissions. The Father did not cite any case law for why an injunction should be issued in a case where a person has forwarded documents to her current spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother referred to <em>VLI v VLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24986-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 77</a> at [15] (“<b><em>VLI</em></b>”) that set out the principles governing the grant of interim injunctions and claimed that the Father failed to establish a basis for his application. She claimed he had not shown that there is any serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience did not favour the grant of the manifestly excessive injunctive order sought by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father’s claim, as he had framed it, is premised on him establishing an action for breach of confidence, in order for him to obtain the injunctive relief sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     A preliminary issue that would therefore arise is whether an action for breach of confidence falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The issue of whether an action for breach of confidence falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court was considered by in the case of <em>UQZ v URA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22699-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 2</a> (“<b><em>UQZ</em></b>”) at [23] to [24]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“23    The law of confidence is based on the court’s equitable jurisdiction to restrain breaches of confidence.

The Family Court’s jurisdiction is contained in s 26 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (No. 27 of 2014) (“FJA”).

The CA allowed the husband’s appeal and granted an interlocutory injunction in terms.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(Emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     From the above case, the following principles are clear:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An action for breach of confidence does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Family Court and a party would not be able to avail himself/herself of remedies premised on the said cause of action; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If a party wishes to pursue an action for breach of confidence, it is open to that party to commence separate civil proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Jurisdiction of the Family Court </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     After considering the Father’s submissions, I was not satisfied that the Father had established that an action for breach of confidence fell within the jurisdiction of the Family Court. As such, the Father did not establish that he could avail himself of the remedies premised on the said cause of action, based on the facts of the present application in SUM 3101.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father failed to point to express wording in any written law vesting jurisdiction in the Family Court to hear actions for breach of confidence or the remedies premised on the said cause of action (including restraining the use of confidential information through the grant of an injunction). I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Family Court’s jurisdiction to hear applications is found in section 26 of the FJA. In this regard, section 26(2)(a) of the FJA, <em>inter alia</em>, provides that a Family Court has all the jurisdiction of the General Division of the High Court (“<b>GDHC</b>”) mentioned in section 22(1)(a) and (b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Section 22 of the FJA clarifies that the part of the civil jurisdiction of the GDHC which is exercised through the Family Division consists of:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_a\"></a>a.       The jurisdiction conferred on the GDHC by sections 17(1)(a), (d), (e) and (f) and 17A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (“<b>SCJA</b>”) whereby:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_a-p4_i\"></a>i.       Section 17(1)(a), (d), (e) and (f) of the SCJA, <em>inter alia</em>, specifies that the civil jurisdiction of the GDHC includes jurisdiction under any law relating to divorce or matrimonial causes, to appoint and control guardians of infants, to grant probate of wills and testaments, letters of administration;</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_a-p4_ii\"></a>ii.       Section 17A relates to concurrent jurisdiction with the Syariah Court in certain matters; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_b\"></a>b.       Such other jurisdiction relating to family proceedings as is vested or conferred on the GDHC by any written law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the above, the relevant sub-sections of section 17 of the SCJA do <em>not</em> specify that actions for breach of confidence fall within the jurisdiction of the GDHC (and consequently, the Family Court). On this basis, the Father failed to establish that an action for breach of confidence fell within the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I had also considered that the Father had also implicitly referred to section 10 of the FJA (which was not cited in his prayers or written submissions) as his basis for his argument that matters before the Family Court are confidential. In brief, section 10 of the FJA provides that all matters and proceedings in a Family Justice Court must be heard in private. Having reviewed the said section, the Father did not demonstrate how section 10 of the FJA expressly provides that an action for breach of confidence falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     From the above, I was unable to find that the Father had shown that the Family Court had the jurisdiction to hear an action for breach of confidence and the power to grant any remedies in relation thereto.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Specifically, the Father failed to demonstrate that he would be able to avail himself of the remedies premised on an action for breach of confidence, insofar as his prayers had been framed to relate specifically to the said cause of action, such as restraining the Mother from disseminating confidential documents or further documents disclosed to her in circumstances imparting a duty of confidence (see paragraph 8(a) above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In addition, as the Father did not show that the Family Court had the jurisdiction to hear an action for breach of confidence , he did not show why orders should be made for the Mother to disclose documents “<em>evidencing any breaches of confidence</em>” or provide interrogatory answers in relation thereto (see paragraphs 8(b) and 8(c) above). For completeness, the Father also did not demonstrate why making further orders for discovery or interrogatories were necessary or relevant, bearing in mind that the Father already had filed various applications for discovery and interrogatories, to which orders had already been made (including the Discovery Order), whereby the Mother had filed a compliance affidavit of more than 1000 pages on 14 October 2024 (“<b>Discovery Affidavit</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Furthermore, I did not find any basis to grant the Father's prayers seeking orders for the Mother to deliver any electronic devices on which “<em>the confidential information… may have been stored</em>” or for an independent third party to take the Mother’s electronic devices into possession to “<em>carry out the terms of the injunction sought</em>” and to review the Mother’s electronic devices to identify any evidence of the dissemination of any confidential (see paragraph 8(d)), insofar as this was premised on an action of breach of confidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For completeness, I had considered that the Father had, in any event, not shown that there was a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that he sought based on the facts and circumstances of this particular case. For ease of reference, the principles on interim injunctions, as summarised in the case of <em>VLI</em> at [15] to [16] have been reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“15    As stated by the High Court in the recent case of <em>Challenger Technologies Ltd v Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17823-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 218</a> (“<b><em>Challenger Technologies</em></b>”) at [13], the principles governing whether an interim injunction should be granted were laid down by the House of Lords in the case of <em>American Cyanamid Company v Ethicon Limited</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/66816-E-M.xml')\">[1975] AC 396</a> (“<b><em>American Cyanamid</em></b>”) and the requirements, in brief, are two-fold:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that there is a serious question to be tried; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting an injunction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16    I will first deal with the first issue of whether there was a serious question to be tried under the Originating Summons. As was succinctly set out by the High Court in <em>Challenger Technologies</em> at [15] to [17]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">[15]   The test laid down in <em>American Cyanamid</em> was whether the claimant had a “real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial” (at 408). In other words, the claimant has to show that there is a serious issue to be tried. Lord Diplock relevantly said at 407:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">The use of such expressions as ‘a probability,’ ‘a prima facie case,’ or ‘a strong prima facie case’ in the context of the exercise of a discretionary power to grant an interlocutory injunction leads to confusion as to the object sought to be achieved by this form of temporary relief. <em>The court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious, in other words, that there is a serious issue to be tried.</em> [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">[16]   This limb was expounded upon by A P Rajah J in <em>Hong Kong Vegetable Oil Co Ltd v Wicker</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1977-1978] SLR(R) 0065.xml')\">[1977–1978] SLR(R) 65</a> at [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Principle 1 ‘provided that the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried, there is no rule that the party seeking an interlocutory injunction must show a prima facie case’. I interpreted this principle to mean that once the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried then the court is not to follow the previous practice of requiring a plaintiff to show a prima facie case before granting him an interim injunction. Therefore, in the instant case I was of the view that I had first to decide whether there is in fact and in law a serious question to be tried and again in my view implicit in ‘a serious question to be tried’ is the question whether the action is properly conceived and whether all the proper, necessary and/or interested parties are before the court so that any order made by the court can properly and effectively be implemented. In my judgment, if these elements or any of them are not present then, because of non-compliance with this principle alone, the motion should stand dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">[17]   The prospects of the plaintiff’s success are to be investigated only to a limited extent: Singapore Civil Procedure 2015 Vol I (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell, 2015) (“<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</em>”) at para 29/1/12. As is clear from the preceding passages, this is a low threshold and all that has to be seen is whether the plaintiff has prospects of success, which, in substance and reality, exist.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As set out above, the Father’s position was that the Mother was in breach of confidence. Having considered the above, the Father had not clearly shown that there was a serious question to be tried with regards to his claim relating to an action for breach of confidence (of which the Family Court had, in any event, no jurisdiction to hear). The Father’s prayer in SUM 3101 was broadly framed and related to “<em>any confidential documents disclosed and/or filed in Case No. D 2524/2014, or disseminating any further documents disclosed to the Defendant in circumstances imparting a duty of confidence”.</em> Based on this prayer, it was difficult to assess which of the documents imported a quality of confidence, bearing the context in mind that this is a dispute between a former husband and wife on issues relating to jointly owned properties and their Children’s maintenance. The Father mentioned that the Mother had disclosed her written submissions to her current husband. However, he did not demonstrate the “<em>quality of confidence</em>” of such information (particularly the Mother’s own submissions) and why the Mother sending her current husband her submissions was a breach of confidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Moreover, the Father also did not provide sufficient reasons as to why the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting the interlocutory relief that he sought against the Mother. It ought to be reiterated that the manner in which the Father had framed his prayers were broad and lacked precision. For example, the Father’s prayers were vague as to what the “<em>confidential documents disclosed and/or filed in Case No. D 2524/2014”</em> specifically referred to and it was also broad in nature, covering “<em>any electronic devices on or from which the confidential information… and evidence relating thereto, may have been stored and/or disseminated within the possession or control</em>” of the Mother. In the absence of clear reasons from the Father, I could not find that the Father had shown why the balance of convenience lay in favour of the Court granting the interim injunctions sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In view of the foregoing, I dismissed the application in SUM 3101.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 3409</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father referred to his application in SUM 3409 as his “<em>Compliance Application</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Based on his summons, the Father applied for the following orders, which are reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>i</em>.     <em>“1.

The Mother’s counsel stressed that the Mother had already produced the documents within her possession and the Father’s application was an abuse of process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If the Father had an issue with the Mother’s documents, he could make the necessary submissions for the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Mother or file committal proceedings against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Father then made the following claims:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father agreed that the matters pursuant to the Discovery Order were <em>res judicata</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He then cited rule 75 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR 2014</b>”) for the proposition that the Court may make such order as it thinks just if any party fails to comply with an order for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father also made references to the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016. However, he subsequently indicated during the relevant hearing that he was <em>not</em> asking for the Mother to be found in contempt of Court and that he was not expressing an intention to file committal proceedings against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Mother’s counsel then claimed that, while the Father had cited rule 75 of the FJR 2014, he did not show how this had been applied by the Court or how this related to the orders that had been made. The Mother’s counsel also submitted that the Father did not show how the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Rule 75(1) of the FJR 2014, states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>“75.</b>—(1)    If any party fails to comply with any provision in rules 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 and 74, or with any order made under those rules, or both, as the case may be, then, without prejudice to rule 66(1), the Court may make such order as it thinks just.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The central issue in SUM 3409 is whether the Court should make orders for the Mother to comply with the Discovery Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Court should make orders for the Mother to comply with the Discovery Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As a starting point, a plain reading of rule 75(1) of the FJR 2014 states that “<em>the Court may make such order that it thinks just</em>”. In the present case, I was not satisfied that the Father had established why the Court should exercise its discretion to make the orders that he had sought, including orders for the Mother to comply with the Discovery Order, or that it would be “<em>just</em>” for the Court to do so. I elaborate on this below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Father did not establish why the Court should make orders for the Mother to “<em>comply fully</em>” with the Discovery Order under his first prayer. In this regard, the Discovery Order had not been rescinded or set aside. Neither party had filed any appeal against the said Discovery Order. Consequently, such a court order must be complied with. Further orders to declare that the Mother shall comply with the Discovery Order “<em>fully</em>” (as the Father had sought under his first prayer) would be superfluous as she is already compelled under the existing Discovery Order to do so. As such, no further orders would be made as to the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Insofar as the Discovery Order was not the subject of an appeal, and it had not been set aside or rescinded, it would also likewise be superfluous for the Court to make a duplicate order for the Mother to file a further affidavit in compliance with the Discovery Order under his second prayer. In consideration of the Mother’s filing of the Discovery Affidavit, the Father did not demonstrate why the Court ought to make a finding that it would be “<em>just</em>” to make a further order for the Mother to file another affidavit to disclose documents in accordance with the Discovery Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, I had considered the Father’s claim that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order. I observed that although the Father was of the position that the Mother did not comply with the Discovery Order, and the Mother maintained that she had complied with the same, neither party had sought clarifications from the learned Assistant Registrar who had made the Discovery Order on the said Order. As no clarifications had been sought, the plain wording of the Discovery Order made would stand. Based on the plain wording of the Discovery Order, I was unable to make any definitive findings that the Father had clearly established that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order, as demonstrated through the examples that have been set out in table below for illustrative purposes.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"10.82%\"><col width=\"19.82%\"><col width=\"21.62%\"><col width=\"27.02%\"><col width=\"20.72%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/No.</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Schedule of Discovery Order</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Brief Summary of Father’s Schedule of “Missing Documents” at Appendix 1A of his affidavit dated 23 October 2024</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Brief Summary of Mother’s Response based on affidavit affirmed on 15 January 2025 / Reference to Mother’s Discovery Affidavit</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court’s Comments</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2 (Table 1): Complete copy of the notification from KF dated 10 November 2023, with attachments. </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father claimed that the Mother did not disclose the Singapore Land Authority (“<b>SLA</b>”) Form referred to in the email dated 29 February 2024 and the attachments. </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Mother had stated in paragraph 18 of her Discovery Affidavit and exhibited at TAB 2, TAB 3 and TAB 10 all the documents and correspondence exchanged with SLA in relation to the procure of the XX Road Tenancy.

In particular, under the Father’s third prayer, the Father prayed that, if the Mother “<em>be in default of this Further Order without good cause being shown</em>”, the following would apply, including that SUM 1993 shall be stayed, the Court shall impose fines on the Mother, costs shall be paid to the Father and the Mother shall be held to be in contempt of Court. Insofar was the Father’s third prayer was <em>contingent</em> on the Court making further orders under SUM 3409, I did not find that the Father had established a clear legal basis for the Court to grant his third prayer. This is further elaborated upon below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the Father’s prayer that the variation application filed by the Mother in SUM 1993 should be stayed, the Father did not demonstrate the legal basis upon which the Court should make orders such that SUM 1993 should be stayed in relation to the present application, particularly since the Father had not established that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order and no orders were made under SUM 3409.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father also did not establish why the Court ought to impose a fine on the Mother for the purposes of the present application in SUM 3409, insofar as the Father had failed to demonstrate that the Mother had not complied with the Discovery Order or such “<em>Further Order</em>”, given that no further orders were made pursuant to SUM 3409.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As for the Father’s claim that costs arising out of or in connection with the Mother’s failure to comply with the Discovery Order shall be paid to him on an indemnity basis, no orders were made as to the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Furthermore, as for the Father’s prayer that the Mother shall be held to be in contempt of Court, I note that the Father had indicated in his submissions that he was <em>not</em> asking for the Mother to be found in contempt of Court (which appeared to be contrary to the position that he took in the relevant summons he had filed in SUM 3409). In any event, the Father had not established that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order. No orders were made in relation to the same. As such, I did not find any clear basis to make any finding that the Mother shall be held to be in contempt of Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Finally, the Father sought in his fourth prayer that he shall not be required to file an affidavit in response to SUM 1993 pending the Mother’s compliance with the Discovery Order and the “<em>Further Order”</em>. I did not find a clear basis to make any orders in relation to the Father’s fourth prayer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In view of the above, I dismissed the Father’s application in SUM 3409.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Having considered the cost submissions of both parties, the number of affidavits filed by the Father and the Mother, the complexity of the issues raised in SUM 3101 and SUM 3409, the number of contested issues, the length of the arguments made by the parties, the written submissions filed, the number of court attendances by the parties (including the attendances of the Mother’s solicitors on record during the relevant hearings), as well as the overall conduct of the parties, the following orders are made in respect of the following applications based on the facts and circumstances of the above matter(s):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     in respect of SUM 3101, the Father is to pay the Mother costs of $1,500 (all-in); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     in respect of SUM 3409, the Father is to pay the Mother costs of $1,500 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I acknowledge that parties are not on the best terms and I sincerely hope that both parties make concerted efforts or explore counselling to rebuild and repair their relationship as co-parents for the welfare of their Children.

The Wife opposed the stay application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After considering the matter, I dismissed the application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties married in France in September 2015. One month later, the Wife came to Singapore to work here. (She was pregnant with the second child at the material time.) In December 2015, the Husband and the first child joined her in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       From the start of the marriage, the Wife had been the sole breadwinner, while the Husband took care of the children and the household. This arrangement continued until about 2021, when the Husband started to work. He became unemployed in May 2025. According to the Husband, it was difficult for him to find work here because (a) he was a foreigner and (b) his diploma certificate was not widely recognised here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In February 2025, the Wife commenced divorce proceeding in Singapore (“<b>Singapore proceeding</b>”). About two to three months later,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Husband commenced divorce proceeding in France (“<b>French proceeding</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At the time of this judgement –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife and the children are residing in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is in Singapore on an employment pass.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The children have dependant passes and are studying at the French International School.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband had left Singapore permanently for France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In May 2025, the Husband applied to stay the Singapore proceeding.

According to the Husband, this is evidenced by the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       They were not Singapore permanent residents (“<b>PR</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       They had been living in rental apartments throughout their entire stay in Singapore and did not own any immovable assets here.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The children were enrolled in the International French School under the French curriculum. This was to enable them to assimilate more smoothly into the French educational system when they eventually return to France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Wife had joined a social security scheme which included a retirement pension in France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The only connection between the Wife and the children to Singapore was her employment here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       If her employment pass were to be terminated, they would have to leave Singapore within 30 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Her employer was an internal design agency with operations in other countries.

This is because Singapore is the country of domicile for the children and her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> She relied on the following to support her contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties and the children had been residing in Singapore since 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the past 10 years, the Wife had been on a local employment contract (as opposed to an expatriate contract) with no end date for the employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     She had subscribed to a 20-year local retirement plan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The children had been attending school in Singapore. Their welfare, healthcare, educational, spiritual and other needs would be better served here than in France. Singapore has a relatively large French community. The first child has two more years before he completes his international baccalaureate programme in Singapore. The Wife had no intention “presently” to move any of the children to France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     It would be more convenient and cheaper to have the divorce and ancillary matters heard in Singapore given that the evidence is here.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s applications to admit further evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     During the hearing, the Wife made two applications to admit further evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">SUM 1884/2025 (“SUM 1884”) – Affidavit on Foreign Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In August 2025, the Wife applied to admit an Affidavit on Foreign Law by her French solicitor, Sabrine Cazorla (“<b>Ms Sabrine</b>”). The affidavit contained the following legal opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>French divorce laws</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There are three stages to divorce proceedings in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Stage 1: The court will determine whether it has jurisdiction over the matter. If it does, the court will order provisional measures aimed at ensuring stability of the spouses and children pending the conclusion of the divorce proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Stage 2: The court may dissolve the marriage after considering the pleadings and evidence. If appropriate, it will also make orders relating to spousal maintenance and child arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Stage 3: The matrimonial assets will be distributed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Divorce proceedings can take about 28 months (without appeal) and up to seven to 10 years (in the most contested cases) to conclude. Where parties reside abroad, the duration is likely to be even longer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husbands can seek spousal maintenance. The duty to maintain a spouse ceases when the divorce is made final. Additionally, a spouse may be ordered to pay “compensatory allowance / maintenance” to the other spouse to offset the disparity in living standards arising from the divorce.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Parents are obliged to maintain their children after the divorce.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether French courts could exercise jurisdiction over the divorce</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In the present case, the French courts have jurisdiction to rule on the issues of (i) divorce, (ii) maintenance, (iii) division of matrimonial assets, and (iv) arrangements regarding their children. This is because the Wife and the Husband are both French citizens.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f\"></a>(f)     That said, the French courts might stay the French proceeding – or even decline to exercise jurisdiction altogether. This is because the Singapore proceeding was initiated – and the divorce papers were properly served on the Husband – <em>before</em> the French proceeding commenced. In accordance with the French “rule of chronological priority”, the Singapore proceeding takes precedence over the French proceeding.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Husband’s decision to commence the French proceeding could be viewed as an attempt at forum shopping given that (i) the Wife had already commenced the Singapore proceeding, (ii) the parties’ entire family had been habitually resident in Singapore for over 10 years, and (iii) the family’s connection with France was confined to their nationality.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_h\"></a>(h)     At the date of this judgement, the Wife had applied to the French courts to “withdraw” or “stay” the French proceeding on the basis that the subject of the litigation there was already pending before the Singapore courts. The hearing into that application had been adjourned to 15 November 2025 – to allow the Singapore courts to determine whether the divorce and ancillary matters ought to be heard in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>If French courts were to exercise jurisdiction</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_i\"></a>(i)     There would be several implications if the parties’ divorce and ancillary matters were to be adjudicated in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_j\"></a>(j)      <em>First</em>, French courts would be legally obliged to apply Singapore law in relation to (1) the divorce,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> (2) the award of spousal maintenance,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> (3) the division of matrimonial assets,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and (4) the children’s arrangements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The French courts would face “practical and legal difficulties” in applying Singapore law as it is foreign to them. The fact that legal experts and affidavits on Singapore family law would have to be secured for the French proceeding can increase the complexity and costs of the proceeding.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_k\"></a>(k)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband is likely to obtain a better financial outcome. This is because unlike the fact-centric nature in which matrimonial assets are divided under Singapore law, there is a presumption of equal division of such assets under French law. This presumption may be displaced if there is a contrary agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s objection</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband opposed the admission of Ms Sabrine’s affidavit. He gave the following reasons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had contended that she would be prejudiced in the French proceeding because the Husband could – unlike Singapore – claim for spousal maintenance under French law. This did not constitute sufficient basis for opposing the stay application. She should contest the Husband’s claim for spousal maintenance before the French courts – and not before the Singapore courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any event, based on Ms Sabrine’s opinion, the French Courts could choose to determine the ancillary matters based on Singapore law. If so, the Wife would not be prejudiced in the French proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">SUM 2290/2025 (“SUM 2290”) – Further Documents</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In September 2025, the Wife made a further application to admit the following documents (“<b>Further Documents</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s papers before the French courts to stay the French proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>According to the Wife, these papers are critical in showing that the French proceeding is not at a more advanced stage than the Singapore proceeding and that it will be a substantial period before these courts render a decision on the parties’ divorce and ancillary matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A letter dated 17 February 2025 from the Wife’s employers regarding their Long-Term Incentive Plan (“<b>LTIP</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>According to the Wife, the purpose of admitting this document is to support her contention that she had joined the board / management / leadership team of her employer and thus her intention to remain in Singapore together with her children for the long term.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Information relating to the Wife’s savings account and retirement scheme in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>According to her, it is necessary to admit these documents to rebut the Husband’s bare assertions that she planned to retire in France. They show that (i) the savings account was started long before the parties came to Singapore and is modest, and (ii) the retirement scheme may be discontinued in the future.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s objections</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband objected to the Wife’s application, submitting that the Further Documents were not relevant and/or necessary for the determination of the stay proceeding. Further, the evidence in these documents were not new and had been addressed in her reply affidavit earlier.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The principles regarding when a party may adduce further evidence during a hearing is well settled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, a party has the general right to bring all available evidence <em>relevant</em> to his/her case to the attention of the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, this right is subject to limits. For instance, the evidence must be <em>necessary</em> to the disposal of the issues before the court. Its admission should also be in accordance with the rules of procedure and the Objectives set out in P1, r 4 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 (“<b>Rules</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the ultimate question is whether admission of the evidence will serve the interests of justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, given that grave consequences might flow from the wrongful exclusion of evidence, it is usually both prudent and just to err in favour of admission rather than exclusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>See e.g., P 1 r 5(2) and 8 r 1(1)(b) of the Rules; <em>Basil Anthony Herman v Premier Security Co-operative Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 3 SLR 0110.xml')\">[2010] 3 SLR 110</a> at [24] to [26]; <em>XAD v XAE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31851-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 54</a> at [16] to [20]; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [16] and [17]; <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [4] to [7].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Applying these principles, I allowed the Wife’s applications to admit further evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>SUM 1884 –</em> Ms Sabrine’s affidavit touched on issues that are material to the stay proceedings. These included whether and how French law would apply to the parties’ divorce and ancillary matters. The relevance of such evidence was acknowledged by the Husband’s counsel during the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>SUM 2290 –</em> The Wife’s papers before the French courts and affidavit were necessary to show the status of the French proceeding. Further, it would be fair to allow her to admit the letter from the Wife’s employers regarding their LTIP and the financial documents so that she could respond to the Husband’s claims that she did not intend to be domiciled in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, the admission of the documents in SUM 1884 and SUM 2290 did not prejudice the Husband. These documents were largely objective and factual in nature. Furthermore, he had the opportunity to respond to the contents of Ms Sabrine’s affidavit and the Further Documents at the hearing, and did in fact do so in his submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Stay of proceeding – Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I shall now turn to the main issue in this case – i.e., should the Singapore proceeding be stayed?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Two-stage analysis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     To answer this issue, I considered the following well-established two-stage analysis in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<b><em>Spiliada</em></b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Stage 1 – The applicant must show that another forum is “<em>clearly or distinctly</em> more appropriate” than Singapore to determine the divorce and ancillary matters. The inquiry is directed at identifying the jurisdiction with which the matter has the most real and substantial connection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Stage 2 – If the court is satisfied that another forum is clearly more appropriate, then the burden shifts to the respondent to show that there are <em>“special reasons”</em> for requiring the matter to be tried in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Let me elaborate on how our courts have applied the above analysis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Stage 1 – Whether another jurisdiction is clearly more suitable</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">High threshold</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Under Stage 1, the applicant has the burden to prove that a foreign court is “<em>clearly or distinctly</em> more appropriate” than a Singapore court to determine the parties divorce and ancillary matters. There are several reasons for this high threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, a stay application invites the Singapore court to abstain from exercising a jurisdiction that it otherwise possesses. Such an abstention – in favour of a foreign court – must therefore rest on compelling reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, granting a stay may deprive the respondent of access to the Singapore courts for relief. Persons who have resided and integrated in Singapore should not be required to litigate abroad – incurring additional expense and inconvenience – unless the connecting factors, on balance, clearly points elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Connecting factors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In assessing whether another jurisdiction is clearly more suitable, courts will consider the strength of the factors that connect the parties to the jurisdiction. These factors can be broadly classified into two categories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Personal connecting factors.</em> These include nationality, domicile, and habitual residence of the parties and their children. The place of marriage is ordinarily a neutral factor: <em>XPI v XPJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33602-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 77</a> (“<b><em>XPI</em></b>”) at [14]; <em>XFS v XFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32700-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 1</a> (“<b><em>XFS</em></b>”) at [43] to [45]; <em>TPH v TPI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19030-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGFC 72</a> (“<b><em>TPH</em></b>”) at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>General connecting factors.</em> These include the location of third-party witnesses, evidence, and matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Connecting factors carry different weight</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The assessment of whether to allow a stay application is not a mathematical exercise – i.e., the assessment is not to be done by simply comparing the <em>number</em> of connecting factors in favour of Singapore and the other jurisdiction. This is because these factors do not carry the same weight in family proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As a general overview, an analysis of the precedents where at least one party to a divorce proceeding is a foreign citizen reveals the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The personal connecting factors typically carry greater weight than the general connecting factors. In most cases, the latter plays a secondary role in the assessment of stay applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Among the personal connecting factors –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Nationality is typically viewed as the weakest indicator of connection to a jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Courts tend to give more weight to the party’s place of current habitual residence than to his/her place of domicile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I will now elaborate on the above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Nationality </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nationality is ordinarily considered to be the weakest of the personal connecting factors: <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> (“<b><em>BDA</em></b>”) at [29]. There are various reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, global mobility has eroded the value of nationality to signify a party’s attachment to a country. In a world of transnational employment and marriages, a party’s nationality often bears little relationship to where his/her family life is centred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, dual or multiple citizenships are increasingly common: <em>BDA</em> at [29].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the weakness of nationality as a connecting factor is also evident from the fact that the Women’s Charter 1960 (“<b>Charter</b>”) does not list it as a jurisdictional basis for divorce. Instead, the Charter stipulates domicile and habitual residence as the grounds for exercising jurisdiction. The Charter further provides that “a person who is a <em>citizen</em> of Singapore is deemed, until the contrary is proved, to be <em>domiciled</em> in Singapore” (emphasis added): see s 93(1) and s 3(5) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Domicile </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Domicile refers to the country that a party treats as his/her permanent home. It may be one of (a) origin (i.e., acquired at birth based on his/her father’s or mother’s domicile), (b) dependence (this usually applies to minors who take on the domicile of the person that they depend on), or (c) choice: <em>Peters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0381.xml')\">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 381</a> (“<b><em>Peters Roger May</em></b>”) at [15] to [25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     To establish a domicile of choice, a party must show both (a) actual residence in a country and (b) an intention to reside there permanently or indefinitely: <em>XPI</em> at [14]; <em>XFS</em> at [43] to [45]; <em>TPH</em> at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     At this juncture, I digress to make the following observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, evidence showing whether a party had applied for PR status in Singapore – as well as the explanation for making/not making the application – is a relevant, though not conclusive, indicator of whether he/she has the requisite intention. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       An application for PR may indicate a wish to settle long term. On the other hand, there may also be other motivations for the application – e.g., for convenience to facilitate employment, schooling, or property ownership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The decision not to apply for PR may stem from practical considerations, e.g., the party does not want to go through the inconvenience of the application. Thus, the failure to apply for PR does not necessarily negate the intention to settle in Singapore indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, domicile can be a less reliable indicator of the most appropriate forum to hear a divorce application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>Evidential</em>. Intention to reside permanently is subjective and must be inferred from conduct and statements. Such evidence is often equivocal or self-serving. Further, intentions can also shift rapidly with changing and unexpected circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Practical.</em> It is settled law that domicile of origin is retained until displaced. This may lead to artificial results. A person may have lived and worked in Singapore for many years yet remain legally domiciled elsewhere simply because the intention to remain indefinitely cannot be proved to a high degree of certainty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Conceptual.</em> Domicile looks backward to a party’s attachment to a place <em>historically</em> (domicile by origin) or in the <em>distant future</em> (domicile of choice). This analysis is conceptually difficult to apply when dealing with stay applications which require an assessment of where that party’s family life is centred <em>presently</em> and in the <em>foreseeable future</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Habitual residence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Next, I turn to habitual residence. A person is habitually resident in a place if he/she has voluntarily and continuously lived there for one or more “settled purposes” such as employment, education, or family life: <em>Lee Mei-Chih v Chang Kuo-Yuan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 1115.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 1115</a> (“<b><em>Lee Mei-Chih</em></b>”) at [6] to [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The indicators of a “settled purpose” include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Immigration status</em>. The fact that a person is applying for PR status, long-term visit pass, or employment pass indicates his/her legal intention to continue living in Singapore for a sustained duration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Employment</em>. A stable, ongoing source of livelihood in Singapore is a strong indicator of habitual residence. Conversely, short-term consultancy work, remote overseas postings, or roles tied to a fixed project timeline indicate transience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Family.</em> When a person’s immediate family – particularly his/her spouse and children – are settled in Singapore, this can be a powerful indicator of habitual residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Education.</em> Other factors that can indicate whether a party intends to remain in Singapore for some time include his/her <em>choice</em> of school for the children (e.g., whether they are enrolled in a local school or an international school). His/her <em>reasons</em> for the choice – e.g., enrolling the children an international school because of his/her distrust in local pedagogy, desire to reflect a certain socio-economic status, or lack of priority in a local school – is also a relevant consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Housing.</em> The fact that a party has secured long-term housing arrangements – whether ownership or extended leases – can also indicate a desire for sustained residence in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     At this stage, the following points bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is important to distinguish between the assessment of whether a party is habitually resident in Singapore for the purpose of determining (1) stay applications and (2) divorce applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The former scenario involves a forward-centric inquiry – i.e., whether the party is likely to continue residing in Singapore <em>in the future</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The latter scenario, on the other hand, is a backward-centric inquiry. In marriages where both parties are foreign citizens, Singapore courts will have jurisdiction to hear divorce applications only if either of them has been “habitually resident in Singapore for a period of 3 years <em>immediately preceding</em> the commencement of the proceedings”: s 93(1)(b) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, unlike domicile, habitual residence does not require proof of an intention to stay permanently. Residence may be “habitual” even if intended for a fixed term: <em>Lee Mei-Chih</em> at [6] to [8]. Thus, a person may be said to be habitually residing in Singapore even if he/she (i) intends to return to his/her country of origin after the employment here ends, or (ii) has not obtained Singapore PR status: <em>WJK v WJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29118-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 85</a> at [26] to [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, in the context of stay applications, the jurisdiction where the parties’ children are located <em>currently and in the future</em> is clearly better suited to deal with issues relating to their custody, care, control, access, and maintenance. This is because that jurisdiction –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Will have a better understanding of the social norms and environmental factors in the children’s upbringing and what is in their best interests and welfare: <em>XLV v XLW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33343-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 35</a> (“<b><em>XLV</em></b>”) at [46]; <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 991 (“<b><em>Low Wing Hong</em></b>”) at [20]; <em>USE v USF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22723-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 8</a> (“<b><em>USE</em></b>”) at [12]; <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4206-M.xml')\">[2002] SGHC 60</a> at [4]; <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> (“<b><em>TDX</em></b>”) at [15]; <em>WYZ v WZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32014-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 68</a> at [17], and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Can also obtain evidence directly and expeditiously from the children to deal with his/her care, control and other issues. This may be contrasted with the case where the children are in another jurisdiction. In the latter case, there may be a need to seek the permission and assistance of that jurisdiction to conduct a child interview or prepare a child evaluation report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Habitual residence carries greater weight</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given [28] and [31(c)] above, a party’s place of habitual residence clearly has advantages – when compared to domicile – as a consideration for assessing stay applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Indeed, Singapore courts have <em>recognised habitual residence</em> to be a significant factor in assessing stay applications: see, e.g., <em>Lee Mei-Chih</em> at [5] and [6]; <em>XLV</em> at [37] to [40]; <em>Helen Diane Womersley v Nigel Maurice Womersley</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22316-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 186</a> (“<b><em>Womersley</em></b>”) at [11]. The precedents suggests that where habitual residence and domicile conflict, the former tends to carry greater weight in determining stay applications: <b><u>Annex A</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">General connecting factors </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I now turn to the general connecting factors. By themselves, these factors are seldom decisive in determining a stay application: see e.g., <em>VXK v VXL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26750-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 117</a> (“<b><em>VXK</em></b>”) at [22]. These are the reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Location of third-party witnesses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The fact that third-party witnesses are overseas is often a neutral factor because the parties can often rely on documentary evidence – instead of testimonial evidence from such witnesses – to establish their case. Even if testimonial evidence from overseas witnesses is needed, such evidence can frequently be adduced via teleconferencing technology: <em>Peters Roger May</em> at [26] and [39]; <em>CIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinworth Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0543.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 543</a> at [69]; <em>TED v TEE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17648-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 90</a> at [25]; <em>TAR v TAS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17691-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 23</a> (“<b><em>TAR</em></b>”) at [27] and [28]; <em>XPI</em> at [12]; <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a> (“<b><em>WFU</em></b>”) at [77].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Location of evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A party can apply for discovery and interrogatories to obtain evidence that is located overseas. If the other party fails to disclose material evidence, an adverse inference may be drawn against him/her: <em>XLV</em> at [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Location of matrimonial assets</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, the fact that matrimonial assets are located overseas have not precluded from Singapore courts in exercising their power to divide such assets: <em>XLV</em> at [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Stage 2 – Whether there are special reasons for denying a stay</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I now turn to Stage 2 of the <em>Spiliada</em> analysis. At this stage, the burden shifts to the respondent to show that substantial justice requires that the proceedings remain in Singapore even if another forum appears more appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In assessing whether the requirement in Stage 2 is met, the following bear emphasis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the mere fact that a respondent may lose a juridical or procedural advantage if a stay is granted does not amount to a denial of justice: <em>Rappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20731-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 265</a> (“<b><em>Rappo</em></b>”) at [109]. For examples where this principle has been applied, see the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where Singapore law allows child maintenance until age 21, whereas the foreign law limits it to age 18: <em>TGT v TGU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18086-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 10</a> (“<b><em>TGT</em></b>”) at [54], [58] and [59].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where a particular remedy is available in Singapore but not abroad: <em>Rappo</em> at [109] to [111].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Where discovery and cross-examination procedures exist in Singapore but not in the foreign forum: <em>Best Soar Ltd v Praxis Energy Agents Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21479-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 423</a> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Where proceedings may be concluded more quickly in Singapore: <em>Mala Shukla v Jayant Amritanand Shukla</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0920.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</a> (“<b><em>Mala Shukla</em></b>”) at [60]; <em>Sanjeev Sharma s/o Shri Sarvjeet Sharma v Surbhi Ahuja d/o Sh Virendra Kumar Ahuja</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17594-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 1056</a> (“<b><em>Sanjeev Sharma</em></b>”) at [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a-p3_v\"></a>(v)       Where a party may face arrest in the foreign jurisdiction: <em>Sanjeev Sharma</em> at [51] to [53].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       Where the party must expend time, effort, or expense to commence fresh proceedings overseas: at <em>WFU</em> at [86].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, in keeping with the principle of international comity, Singapore courts will be slow to find that a respondent will be denied substantial justice in the foreign jurisdiction. This is especially so if that jurisdiction operates a well-established and reputable legal system: <em>Rappo</em> at [110]; <em>The “Reecon Wolf”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0289.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 289</a> at [54]; <em>TGT</em> at [58] to [61].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having summarised the principles, I shall apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Place of domicile </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To re-cap –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s stay application rested primarily on the parties’ domicile. He submitted that because both parties are French citizens, France was their domicile of origin. This domicile has not been displaced, and French courts were therefore the more appropriate forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife argued that France was no longer her domicile of origin as Singapore was her domicile of choice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife is residing in Singapore</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     To establish a domicile of choice, the Wife must prove two elements: (a) that her residence in Singapore is not temporary or transitory, and (b) that she intends to make Singapore her home permanently or indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The first element is clearly satisfied. The Wife had resided continuously in Singapore for the past ten years and remains here at the date of this judgment. Her employment, residence, and family life are all based in Singapore.

I find the evidence on this to be equivocal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The most significant evidence supporting an intention to reside in Singapore permanently is the Wife’s purchase of a Manulife endowment and retirement plan (“<b>Manulife Plan</b>”) in 2021. Under this plan, she undertook to pay premiums for ten years and to receive payouts in Singapore dollars from age 60 for a twenty-year period (2042–2062).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The weight of the Manulife Plan is however weakened by the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband contended that the Wife had purchased the Manulife Plan only because a similar product was unavailable in France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       It is not disputed that the Wife can receive payouts under the plan even if she were to return to France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Wife continues to contribute to a French social-security scheme that includes a retirement pension.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This can suggest that she intends to retire in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The children are enrolled in the International French School under the French curriculum. The Husband claimed, without rebuttal by the Wife, that this is to facilitate the children’s reintegration into the French educational system if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       The Wife did not apply for PR status in Singapore,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> claiming that she would accept PR “if offered”.

This is because home ownership in Singapore is costly and subject to eligibility restrictions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife explained that she had been saving to purchase an apartment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Her explanation has not been contradicted by evidence to the contrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Place of habitual residence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Next, I considered whether the Wife and the children are habitually resident in Singapore for the purpose of the stay application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In this regard, it is common ground that the parties and their children have been habitually resident in Singapore for the past 10 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The issue is whether the Wife and the children are likely to continue to be habitually resident in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband contended that the answer is “no” because the family’s continued residence in Singapore depends on the Wife’s employment, and the employment “can cease at any time”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I am unable to accept the Husband’s contention. In my view, a party may be found to be habitually resident in Singapore even if his/her right to remain here is conditional on employment that may, in theory, be terminated. Let me elaborate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s contention effectively means that a foreigner can be said to be habitually resident in Singapore only if there is no risk of him/her being terminated whatsoever. I find this to be unreasonable and contrary to case law. To establish habitual residence, the law requires only that the party intends to remain in a place for one or more settled purposes. Such a purpose includes employment: see [30(b)] above. There is <em>no additional requirement</em> that the person must also possess a legal right to remain permanently. Indeed, under Art 13 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, only Singapore citizens enjoy an absolute right of abode.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the mere possibility of job termination is sufficient to negate habitual residence, then no foreigner can ever be said to be habitually resident in Singapore, however settled his life in this country may be. That outcome is both unrealistic and contrary to established jurisprudence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, the evidence clearly shows that the lives of the Wife and the children will remain to be centred in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>The Wife</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife currently holds a well-paying job and is in a senior management position. There is no evidence of her having an intention to resign. Neither is there any evidence that she will be transferred to the sister company in France: see [8(c)(ii)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife had subscribed to the Manulife Plan in 2021. Under the plan, she undertook to pay premiums for ten years. She has done so for the past four years and remains bound for another six. This long-term financial commitment, denominated in Singapore dollars, reflects an intention to remain anchored here for a significant period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>The children</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, it is unlikely that the Wife will uproot the children and relocate them to France anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The children are schooling in Singapore. Their education is likely to anchor both them and the Wife in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       This is especially so for the older child, aged 16, who is currently enrolled in the international baccalaureate programme. He will complete the programme only until 2027.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Finally, it is also unlikely that the children will relocate to France to live with the Husband. He has only recently resettled in there and is still seeking stable employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     To sum-up, on the totality of the evidence, I find that the Wife and the children will continue to be habitually resident in Singapore for the next several years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether France is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Given my finding in [47] and [48], as well as the considerations in [28] and [31] to [33] above, I am of the view that the Husband has failed to demonstrate that France is <em>clearly or distinctly more appropriate</em> than Singapore to determine the divorce and ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     This view is reinforced by the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, a key part of the divorce hearing will involve looking into issues such as the children’s needs as well as how the parties will be able to care for and maintain them. The parties’ employment and financial circumstances will be important factors in this regard. Three of the four persons who can provide material evidence on these issues – the Wife and the two children – are residing in Singapore. This is a consideration that can further tip the balance in favour of the Singapore courts determining the divorce issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, Ms Sabrine’s opinion is that even if the French courts were to hear the divorce, they would be obliged to apply Singapore law: see [11(j)] above. The Husband did not dispute this opinion.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Given the above, it is plainly counter-intuitive to stay the Singapore proceeding. At risk of stating the obvious, Singapore courts are better placed to apply Singapore laws.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, if the Singapore proceeding is stayed, both parties will have to adduce expert evidence on Singapore law before the French courts. This will increase costs and prolong the proceedings there. This is not in either party’s interest. This is especially so for the Husband, as it is unclear whether he can afford such costs given that he is still seeking stable employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other points</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     For completeness, I will address two other points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52      <em>First</em>, I found that the location of matrimonial assets is a neutral factor in this case. It is undisputed that the parties do not own immovable property in either Singapore or France. Additionally, the mere fact that the parties held savings plans and a life insurance policy in France<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> does not, on its own, establish that the French courts is the more appropriate forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Husband has not explained why the Singapore courts will be unable to deal with such assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53      <em>Second</em>, the Husband submitted that France is the more appropriate forum because enforcement of maintenance orders would be easier there, since his income and assets are in that jurisdiction. To support his submission, he cited from <em>BDA</em> where – according to the Husband – the High Court “placed significant weight on where the payer-husband was residing and working at the material time (i.e. Singapore)”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I am not persuaded by the Husband’s submission. <em>One</em>, it is speculative what form of maintenance order, if any, will ultimately be made against the Husband. <em>Two</em>, the Husband’s reliance on <em>BDA</em> is unmeritorious.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There is nothing in the judgement to show that the High Court there had set aside the stay application imposed by the district court because the husband was working and resident in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In fact, it appears from [33] of its judgement that a key reason why the High Court had set aside the stay application is that the wife and the son <em>had been residing</em> in Singapore and <em>intended to return to live in Singapore</em>. (She was apparently in India at the time of the hearing.) This supports the view that the place of habitual residence is an important consideration on whether to stay a divorce proceeding. In the present case, the evidence shows that the Wife and the children will be staying in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     For the above reasons, I find that the Husband had failed to prove that France is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” than Singapore to adjudicate the parties’ divorce and ancillary matters. The Wife should not be denied access to the Singapore courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Given the above finding, there is no need for me to proceed to Stage 2 of the <em>Spiliada</em> analysis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Accordingly, I dismissed the Husband’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>______________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u><font style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">annex a</font></u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><font style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Habitual Residence and Stay Applications</font></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1_1\"></a>1       Examples where the care-giver parent and children were <em>habitually resident</em> in Singapore at the time of the judgement – Stay application dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>TAR</em> – The wife (Indian citizen) and her six-year-old child (British citizen) had been residing in Singapore for about four years.

District Judge Eugene Tay:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is the Defendant husband’s appeal against my decision to grant a judgment of judicial separation for the Plaintiff wife on 28 August 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts and proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties were married on 25 January 2004 in India. There are no children to the marriage. At the time of the hearing, parties were both 49 years of age, and the Plaintiff was residing in Singapore while the Defendant was residing in the United States of America (“US”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 29 April 2024, the Plaintiff filed an application for judicial separation on the basis that the marriage has irretrievably broken down in that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 9 July 2024, the Defendant filed an application for stay of the proceedings on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in FC/SUM 2145/2024 (“SUM 2145”) on the basis that India is the more appropriate forum to determine the dissolution of the marriage. SUM 2145 was subsequently dismissed on 18 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Thereafter, the Defendant filed his Defence on 2 December 2024, and the Plaintiff filed her reply on 16 December 2024. Parties subsequently filed their respective Affidavits-of-Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) on 4 March 2025, and the matter was fixed for trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The trial took place on 14 May 2025. Apart from parties’ respective AEICs, the Plaintiff relied on an additional set of documents of 306 pages containing parties’ chat history (“PS1”), which the Defendant did not object to. After the trial, parties were directed to file and serve written submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 28 August 2025, I delivered my decision and granted a judgment of judicial separation. After hearing parties on costs, I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs of the trial fixed at $8,000.00 (all-in). I also directed parties to file and exchange their respective Affidavits of Assets and Means (“AOM”) by 9 October 2025, with a window period until 11 September 2025 for parties to correspond with each other on whether to attend mediation and/or for the AOMs to be held in abeyance, and for the matter to be fixed for a case conference for parties to seek the necessary directions from the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 11 September 2025, the Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal against the whole of my decision. The grounds for my decision are set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Plaintiff’s Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the Plaintiff’s AEIC, she summarised the incidents where she claimed the Defendant had behaved unreasonably, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>a.     His failure to appreciate her efforts and sacrifices in the marriage and led to her feeling undervalued and neglected;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>b.     His denial of her repeated requests for physical intimacy and affection;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>c.     His deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from her; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>d.     His secretive behaviour which led to mistrust between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions, the Plaintiff stated that her case for the Court to grant the judgment for judicial separation is based on the Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>a.     The lack of physical intimacy in the marriage, due to his refusal to respond to her repeated requests for intimacy and affection;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>b.     His failure to prioritise spending time with her which caused her to feel hurt and unwanted;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>c.     His deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from her; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>d.     His secretive behaviour towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Plaintiff also submitted that the Defendant’s overall conduct throughout this case demonstrates how he consistently misled her into believing that their marriage remained intact, when to his mind, he considered parties to have been separated in November 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Defendant’s Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Defendant denied the Plaintiff’s allegations and submitted that she had not proven her case. While he agreed that the marriage has broken down, he denied that it was due to his unreasonable behaviour. He claimed that she is making false allegations of his unreasonable behaviour to gain a tactical advantage in the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The main thrust of the Defendant’s defence is that parties have been separated since 2018, and this serves as an important backdrop to the state of parties’ relationship from then onwards. He claimed that parties have been separated since 2018 and no longer behaved as a married couple since. As such, it is understandable that their relationship and interactions with each other since 2018 would not be one that is typical for a married couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under section 101(1) of the Women’s Charter (“WC”), either party to a marriage may apply for judicial separation on the ground and circumstances set out in then-section 95(3) of the WC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, and then-section 95 of the WC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> applies (with the necessary modifications) in relation to an application for judicial separation as they apply to an application for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The main issue in this case is whether the Plaintiff has proven on balance of probabilities that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Case authorities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> have established that the question whether the Plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the Defendant must be answered subjectively, and in dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the Plaintiff can reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant. It is for the Court to answer this, using an objective test, having regard to the personalities of the individuals before it. The Court must also look at behaviour by taking into account the cumulative effect of the behaviour, and any conduct, active or passive constitutes behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> by Leong Wai Kum (“<em>Elements</em>”), the learned author suggested that the understanding of whether the marriage has irretrievably broken down need not be as rigorous for an application for judicial separation since the relief does not involve the termination of the marriage with finality, as compared with a divorce which terminates the marital relationship with finality<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Family Court case of <em>USC v USD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22740-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 6</a> (“<em>USC</em>”), the Court adopted the aforesaid approach proposed in <em>Elements</em>, and took the view that there should be greater allowances for a judgment of judicial separation (compared to divorce) as a judicial separation is, loosely speaking, a step below divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The Court in <em>USC</em> also took the view that adopting a less stringent threshold meant doing so in terms of the impact of the alleged unreasonable behaviour, and that once the Court is satisfied that a plaintiff’s contentions are established, the Court should be more inclined to grant a plaintiff’s application for judicial separation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Finally, under sections 139E and 139F of the WC, the Court is to consider the possibility of reconciliation between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether parties had separated since 2018 and lived separate lives</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I first deal with the Defendant’s claim that parties have been separated since 2018, which is the main thrust of his Defence, as this will have a bearing on how the Court should view incidents and/or the Defendant’s alleged behaviour in determining whether he has behaved in such a way that it is unreasonable for the Plaintiff to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Defendant cited various factors<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> to refute the Plaintiff’s assertion given during the trial that parties had gradually reconciled after a trial separation period starting from June 2018 and had behaved like a normal couple. These factors included the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>a.     Parties selling the matrimonial home and decoupling their assets in 2019;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>b.     Living under a pretence towards the Plaintiff’s family in India in 2021;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>c.     Lack of holidays between 2019 to 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>d.     Discussion about lawyers and parents in 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>e.     No celebration of anniversary in 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_f\"></a>f.     The Defendant’s declaration to his employer in the US in December 2022 that he was single, and that the Plaintiff knew about this declaration;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_g\"></a>g.     That the Plaintiff (allegedly) had no intention to live with him in the US; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_h\"></a>h.     The Defendant’s romantic relationship with others between 2018 to 2023 (which the Plaintiff is aware of).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Defendant also submitted that the chatlogs from 2020 to 2023 (in PS1) containing the communication between parties showed that their relationship was a platonic one, more akin to friends than a married couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff submitted that the nature and frequency of parties’ exchanges and ongoing interactions goes far beyond casual or obligatory communication and reflects the engagement and familiarity in an active relationship, rather than a couple on the path to separation. She also submitted that while it is undisputed that parties have been living separately, the evidence suggests a lack of clear intention from either party to formally separate; on the contrary, their actions and interactions indicate an ongoing connection that does not align with a definitive separation up until December 2023. She also stated that even after January 2023, parties continued to update each other on their lives and communicated on random and mundane things on a regular basis, which went beyond minimal or necessary communication for a couple who had allegedly separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     From the evidence, the manner in which parties had conducted themselves and treated and communicated with each other since the initial trial separation in June 2018 gave rise to questions and ambiguity whether they had remained separate and no longer regarded each other as spouses, or whether they had after the trial separation reconciled and carried on their relationship as a married couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Having considered the evidence, my findings are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>a.     It is firstly undisputed that parties have been living separately;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>b.     It is also not disputed that parties decided to have a 3-month trial separation starting from June 2018;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>c.     The frequency, nature and contents of parties’ contacts and communication (as can be seen from the history of messages between parties in PS1) would go beyond mere platonic friendship, and would instead be more consistent with and indicative of the fact that parties were still interacting and functioning as a married couple after the trial separation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>d.     The Plaintiff is aware that the Defendant is seeing and living with another woman during the period of alleged separation and seemed quite prepared to accept this, so long as she (the Plaintiff) remained and retained her status as his wife. The fact that the Defendant was seeing someone else during this period does not necessarily mean (at least in the Plaintiff’s mind) that parties are formally separated and no longer regarded or conducted themselves as husband and wife;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_e\"></a>e.     Even if the Defendant believed in his mind that parties had separated and were only platonic friends, the regularity, frequency and nature of his interactions and communications with the Plaintiff and his failure to draw clear boundaries and/or clarify the status of their relationship would have led to her having the belief and be under the impression that their relationship after the trial separation had resumed as husband and wife. For example, he did not correct her on at least three (3) separate occasions on 17 January 2022, 28 September 2022 and 2 October 2022 when she referred to herself as “wife”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. He also did not correct her on 28 May 2021 when she told him that he was the beneficiary for her ICICI account and that it was wrongly written “wife” and that he should be “husband”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Finally, the Defendant also testified during the trial that even after November 2018, parties (according to him) were moving towards a separate relationship even in 2020, 2021 and 2022. This is inconsistent with his claim that parties were separated by November 2018 and there was no marital relationship. His subsequent attempt to explain that this was a reinforcement of the separation in 2018 was unconvincing and somewhat contrived. All it did was to weaken his claim that parties were separated after November 2018. If indeed parties were already separated by November 2018, there would have been no need to “move towards” a separate relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Overall, on balance, I found that after the trial separation in 2018, parties had thereafter behaved and conducted themselves and treated each other in a manner more consistent as spouses in an existing marriage, instead of individuals who had separated and were merely platonic friends. I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that while it is undisputed that parties have been living separately, the evidence suggests a lack of clear intention from either party to formally separate. Following from this, I found that parties were not actually separated after the trial separation, and still behaved and interacted and conducted themselves as spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In light of this finding, I now move on to deal with the Plaintiff’s specific allegations of the Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Lack of physical intimacy due to the Defendant’s refusal to respond to the Plaintiff’s repeated requests</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had refused her requests for physical intimacy since 2012. However, there is lack of evidence to support her claims that she had repeatedly requested physical intimacy from the Defendant and that he had repeatedly denied her requests, in particular from 2012 to 2014. In addition, the Plaintiff acknowledged during the trial that there were little opportunities for parties to be intimate since they lived in different countries since 2014. She also testified that parties did not show much romantic behaviour after marriage, as they were not “that kind of people”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Overall, I found the Plaintiff’s allegation that she had made repeated requests for the Defendant for physical intimacy and that he had repeatedly denied her requests to be unproven. I did not think that lack of physical intimacy between parties could be attributed solely to the Defendant, let alone that this would constitute unreasonable behaviour on his part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s failure to prioritise spending time with the Plaintiff, causing her to feel hurt and unwanted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to prioritise spending time with her, causing her to feel hurt and unwanted. She cited two (2) incidents in in support of her allegation. The first is the Defendant’s refusal to make a brief stop-over in Singapore during his trip to India in April 2022 to visit his mother on his way back to Japan (“First Incident”). The second is the Defendant not meeting the Plaintiff in the Philippines in September 2022 (“Second Incident”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For the First Incident, the Whatsapp messages the Plaintiff had relied on<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> were only extracts and did not show a more complete picture of parties’ communication at the material time. In particular, there were no messages exhibited showing when the Plaintiff had requested the Defendant to make a detour to Singapore on his way back to Japan after visiting his mother in India. The extract of the messages only provided a brief screenshot of the Defendant informing the Plaintiff of his travel schedule from 8 April 2022 to 3 May 2022, and the Plaintiff acknowledging that he would not come back to Singapore on his way back. If the Defendant had already booked his flights prior to the Plaintiff making the request for him to make a detour to Singapore, I did not think he can be faulted for not acceding to her request. Further, it is not clear from the messages that the Plaintiff had communicated her feelings and/or expressed her disappointment to the Defendant of his failure to visit her in Singapore in April 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For the Second Incident, while the Plaintiff may have felt disappointed, suffice to say it appeared from the Whatsapp messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> that the fact that parties did not meet in the end was essentially due to miscommunication and scheduling, instead of the Defendant not prioritising spending time with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Insofar as the Plaintiff relied on these two (2) incidents in April 2022 and September 2022 of the Defendant not meeting her, it is insufficient for me to arrive at the conclusion that he had failed to prioritise spending time with her by not meeting her in those two (2) occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     At this juncture, I pause to note what the Plaintiff had testified in Court when asked why it took her so many years to file the present application when the marriage has not been really good since 2009. She had testified that the issues that happened since 2009 onwards were “ups and downs of marital life” and were “not enough to warrant a divorce”, and that it was in “2023, 2024 when things escalated out of hand”. Pertinently she admitted that if the 2023, 2024 incidents did not happen, it was possible she might not have filed this application. She further stated that the 2023 incident is the Defendant refusing to apply for a US dependent pass visa for her and deceived her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In my view, it can be inferred that the incidents and the Defendant’s behaviour prior to the issue relating to the US visa application in 2023 would not by themselves have been behaviour that had affected the Plaintiff such that it would compel her to apply for judicial separation or divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from the Plaintiff </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Plaintiff’s allegation of the Defendant’s deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from her essentially relates to his refusal to have her join him in the US in 2023, specifically not proceeding to apply for US dependent pass visa for her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I noted the Defendant did not outrightly refuse the Plaintiff’s request for him to apply for a US visa for her by telling her that they are separated and no longer considered husband and wife. Rather, he gave various reasons, including settling accommodation, buying a car and catching up with work. It was apparent that from January 2023 to June 2023, he did not explicitly make it clear to the Plaintiff that he was not going to support her visa application. When asked during the trial if he agreed that he never told the Plaintiff from January 2023 to June 2023 that he was not going to support her application, the Defendant responded by saying he did not explicitly say that, and that parties were already separated, and he did not believe in a paper marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     However, it was telling that the Defendant admitted under cross-examination that even in August 2023, he was giving the Plaintiff the impression that both of them were working on the method to get the Plaintiff a US visa. He also admitted that after he had filed for divorce in India on 5 August 2023, he continued to engage the Plaintiff about trying to apply for the US visa for her, and did not inform her of the divorce he had filed in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In my view, the aforesaid behaviour by the Defendant would have led the Plaintiff to have the belief and expectation that parties were planning for her relocation to the US as a married couple and that the Defendant would apply for US dependent pass visa for her, when in fact, he did not have the sincere or genuine intention to do so. As such, I considered the Defendant to have misled the Plaintiff as regards his real reasons for not applying for US visa for her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I should state that I did not see the Defendant’s actions and behaviour as regards the US visa application primarily as deliberately excluding or removing himself from the Plaintiff per se. Rather, I saw this as the Defendant misleading and giving the Plaintiff false expectation and hope that she would be able to relocate to the US to be with him and that parties (him in particular) were working on this. This continued until as late as early August 2023 when the Defendant filed for divorce in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Ultimately, I accepted that the Defendant’s actions and behaviour in this regard would have undermined the Plaintiff’s trust in him and led to a sense of betrayal in her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s secretive behaviour towards the Plaintiff </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     On the Plaintiff’s allegations of the Defendant’s secretive behaviour towards her, I was of the view that his actions with regard to the US visa application for the Plaintiff as discussed earlier can also be considered secretive behaviour, in that the Defendant had misled her and (up till August 2023) concealed his genuine intentions from her, giving her the impression that this was still in the works while, unbeknownst to her, he had planned and subsequently filed for divorce in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant was secretive by not disclosing his address in the US to her. The Defendant took the position that it was not unreasonable for him not to disclose his US address to the Plaintiff if parties have been separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I would agree that if parties were still separated and the Plaintiff was aware of the same, then there is some basis for the Defendant’s position. However, given my earlier findings that the evidence suggests lack of clear intention from either party to formally separate, and that parties had behaved and conducted themselves and treated each other in a manner more consistent as spouses in an existing marriage, I did not think the Plaintiff can be faulted for perceiving that the Defendant was being secretive to her by not disclosing his address in the US.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For completeness, I did not consider the Defendant choosing to designate his secretary as emergency contact (instead of the Plaintiff) as being secretive behaviour as alleged by the Plaintiff, since the Defendant had informed the Plaintiff of this. I also did not consider the Defendant terminating his life insurance policy (in which the Plaintiff was the beneficiary) without informing the Plaintiff as secretive behaviour, since he was the policy holder and has the discretion to deal with the policy as he deems fit (which the Plaintiff had admitted).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Prospect of reconciliation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, I considered the prospect of reconciliation between parties. Suffice to say that give the current state of the relationship between parties, and taking into account the Defendant himself had filed for divorce in India, I did not see any reasonable prospect of reconciliation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summary of findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Overall, while I did not think the Plaintiff has proven all her allegations against the Defendant, I found that the Defendant’s actions with regard to him giving the Plaintiff false expectation and hope of relocating to the US to reunite with him, misleading her on the US visa application and concealing and being secretive of his true intentions would cumulatively amount to behaviour on his part such that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to continue to live with him. I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant’s actions would have undermine her trust, emotional stability and sense of security in the relationship, and there is no longer any affection and trust or meaningful communication between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Finally, I did not think the Defendant has substantiated or proven his claim that the Plaintiff had made false allegations of his unreasonable behaviour to gain a tactical advantage in the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In conclusion, I found that the Plaintiff has proven that the marriage has broken down irretrievably in that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having noted and applied the less rigorous and stringent approach to viewing alleged unreasonable behaviour as suggested in <em>Elements</em> and adopted in <em>USC</em> at [17] and [18] above, I was satisfied that a judgment of judicial separation on the Plaintiff’s claim should be granted, and I therefore so ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On the issue of costs, the Plaintiff’s solicitors submitted that costs should follow the event and sought costs at $15,000.00 (including disbursements). The Plaintiff’s solicitors informed the Court that there was an Offer to Settle (“OTS”) issued to the Defendant on 26 March 2025 proposing that judicial separation be granted on the Plaintiff’s claim with an offer for the Defendant to file his counter-claim, which the Defendant did not take up. Parties had therefore go through a one (1) day trial and file closing submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Defendant’s solicitors disagreed on the Plaintiff’s quantum for costs and pointed out that the OTS was issued after parties’ AEICs were exchanged, and that work done after the OTS was issued on 26 March 2025 was mainly for the trial. The Defendant’s solicitors submitted that costs should be around $4,000.00 to $5,000.00, taking into account the OTS as well as last minute work that had to be done because of the 11<sup>th</sup> hour submission of messages (in PS1) before the trial which was not objected to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     After hearing counsel, I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs of the trial fixed at $8,000.00 all-in.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Now section 95A</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Now sections 95 and 95A</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><em>Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0323.xml')\">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 323</a> at [8] and [13]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup><em>Elements</em> at [6.020]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><em>USC</em> at [54]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup><em>USC</em> at [55]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 15 of the Defendant’s Written Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Page 55 (17/01/2022, 22:27), page 56 (17/01/2022, 22:37), page 120 (28/09/2022, 07:07) and page 124 (02/10/2022, 22:13) of PS1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Page 283 (28/05/2021, 22:35) of PS1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 173 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Page 121 of PS1</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Divorce","Family Law – Grounds for divorce – Behaviour"],"date":"2025-10-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 6185 of 2023","title":"XSP v XSQ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 107","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34007-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gloria James-Civetta, Chong Xin Yi (Liesel), Sheryl Keith Sandhu (Gloria James-Civetta & Co.) for the Plaintiff","Hoon Shu Mei, Beverly Goh (Drew & Napier LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-11-04T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Edmund Chew","html":"<root><head><title>XSP v XSQ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSP <em>v</em> XSQ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34007-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 107</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

There were various companies incorporated resulting from this family business, and the key point to note was that the companies used the acronym “ABC”, after the children’s names. This was before the 4<sup>th</sup> child was born in March 2009.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Arising from various unhappiness, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 20 December 2023, claiming that the marriage has broken down irretrievably, relying on s. 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>Women’s Charter</b>”),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> viz., the fact that the Husband has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties over the course of 6 days and dismissed the Wife’s claim for divorce on 24 March 2025. The Wife thereafter sought an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal against my decision and was granted permission on 10 July 2025 by the Family Division of the High Court. The Wife then filed her Notice of Appeal on 11 July 2025 against the whole of my decision given on 24 March 2025. I now provide the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       A total of 5 affidavits were filed and 3 witnesses were called, in addition to both parties.

To prove this ground of the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage, parties can rely on one of 5 facts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> This is clear from the statutory language of s. 95 of the Women’s Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Irretrievable breakdown of marriage to be sole ground for divorce</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">95.—(1)    Either party to a marriage may file a writ for divorce on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court hearing such proceedings shall, so far as it reasonably can, inquire into the facts alleged as causing or leading to the breakdown of the marriage and, if satisfied that the circumstances make it just and reasonable to do so, grant a judgment for its dissolution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the defendant has committed adultery and the plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the defendant;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    that the defendant has deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ and the defendant consents to a judgment being granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this case, the Wife has relied solely on the fact in s. 95(3)(b). This fact is commonly referred to as “unreasonable behaviour”. While this is a practical and useful shorthand term, it bears repeating that the unreasonableness analysis is not of the defendant’s behaviour, but the expectation that the plaintiff continues to live with the defendant. In other words, the Wife must prove that the Husband has behaved in such a way that it is unreasonable to expect her to live with him. The Wife bears the burden of proof, and the standard of proof is one on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It is trite law that the test for “unreasonable behaviour” comprises a subjective component and an objective component. The test is summarised in <em>VTP v VTO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26717-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 36</a> as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The first step is to assess whether the wife found it intolerable to live with the husband. This is subjective. Next, the court should consider whether the wife can reasonably be expected to live with the husband. That is an objective test, but the court may take into account the personalities of the parties in assessing the impact of the behaviour on the other spouse. The husband’s behaviour not only towards the wife, but also in relation to the marriage, is relevant in this inquiry: Castello Ana Paula Costa Fusillier v Lobo Carlos Manuel Rosado <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 4 SLR(R) 0331.xml')\">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 331</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In <em>Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0323.xml')\">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 323</a> (“<b><em>Wong Siew Boey</em></b>”), the Court stated thus<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether the respondent’s behaviour has been such that the petitioner can no longer reasonably be expected to live with him is essentially a finding of fact and the courts have avoided categorising conduct as guilty or blameless in the abstract. <b><em>The question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively</em></b>: whether his attitude is reasonable is irrelevant. <b><em>In dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the court, and not the petitioner, to answer it.

The Husband was the sole breadwinner responsible for bringing in the necessary income to support the parties’ and household expenses, while the Wife was the full-time homemaker responsible for taking care of matters at home and the children, even if this was with the help of helpers. The Wife had conceded this under cross-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> She re-affirmed this under re-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Even though the Wife had pleaded in her SOP that the Husband “did not have to lift a finger to help in the household and family matters” and “was busy with his work”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> this did not appear to me to be an instance of behaviour that made it unreasonable to expect her to continue living with the Husband. This was the arrangement parties had and the Wife conceded under cross-examination that she “[did] not expect him” to help in these matters and was also “not blaming him”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> She does not deny that the Husband has been a good father and also shares a strong relationship with all 4 children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> While she explains that what she meant was that the Husband did not lift a finger in terms of “physical work”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> she was “not unhappy for him not doing anything”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and it was enough for her as the Husband did care for the children in his own ways. Even after parties moved to Singapore, I found that this arrangement continued, albeit the Wife expected the Husband to get involved more in the family matters and she conceded that he was indeed very involved.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> In line with this mutual understanding of their roles, it appeared that the Husband similarly managed all the household expenses and finances. It was not disputed that the Husband does check the household transactions, including those of the children, and the Wife was not always unhappy about this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Against this backdrop, I also found that for the large part of the marriage, and in fact even up to the time the Wife decided to divorce the Husband, it was clear to me that the Wife had always been content to leave all financial matters to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While the Wife had also pleaded that the Husband was financially controlling of her and monitored and frequently her credit card spending, it was not disputed that she had only provided 1 example of such control in her evidence before me.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> This was a text message which the Husband sent to the Wife with a photograph of the parties’ joint bank account. In the screenshot, the Husband circled the expense of $4,000 incurred on 22 July 2020 and sent the Wife a message containing just “???”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> The Wife explained that this was for a spa package for her mother and herself, and the Husband then asked if this was going to be a regular monthly expense. After the Wife answered in the negative, the parties did not continue the conversation further. In this regard, I read this episode as an example of how the Husband was fulfilling his role as the financial steward of the family, ensuring that the expenses were properly accounted for. The Husband did not ask the Wife to cancel the package, nor did he say that it was unreasonable to incur such an expense. The Wife explained that this was “all text message not conversational” and her understanding was that the Husband was displeased at her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> However, the objective evidence did not bear this out. The conversation simply ended after the Wife gave her explanation. If this was the only example given and the Wife was asking me to draw an inference that this way of responding to text messages was the Husband’s way of questioning and controlling her expenses, that was not an inference I was prepared to draw without any further supporting evidence. The sum incurred would appear to be an out-of-the-ordinary household expense and it was not reasonable for a clarification to be sought as to this expense. The Wife explained that due to the passage of time, she was unfortunately unable to locate the relevant documents to corroborate the other instances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> However, as she was the plaintiff in this case and bore the burden of proof, without any other examples or evidence before me, I could only assess her allegation based on this example. As I have explained above, I did not see how this was unreasonable of the Husband, nor how this made it unreasonable to expect the Wife to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As a further example of how the Husband had controlled the Wife’s finances, the Wife stated that the Husband had refused to extend a loan of $6,000 to her mother and a loan of $50,000 to her father. This must be read against the background and context within which such requests were made. There was some confusion as to when these loans were requested, and in relation to the loan of $50,000, it was unclear whether it was the Wife’s mother who asked for the monies, the Wife’s father who asked for the monies, or whether it was the Wife’s father who asked through the Wife’s mother. However, it was not disputed that when this loan was requested, the parties did not know that it was because the Wife’s father had suffered a stroke.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The parties only knew about the stroke sometime in 2019. Prior to the request for such loans, the parties had previously extended a loan of $6,000-$7,000 to the Wife’s brother. It was not disputed that the loan remains unpaid and the Husband had also never chased the Wife nor the Wife’s brother for the repayment of this sum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Therefore, when a further loan of a much higher sum was sought, and with parties not knowing the reason behind such a request, it was not unreasonable for the Husband to have expressed reservations and concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife also gave examples of how the Defendant controlled her spending by imposing certain limits on her credit cards and the amounts she could withdraw.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s evidence was that he had not expected her to ask for permission before spending the money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also raised that she was restricted in her ability to make purchases according to her own preferences and timing. In my view, it was clear that the Husband did not in fact impose such limits nor restrictions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the Wife did not provide any evidence to show that these limits were <em>imposed by the Husband</em>. On the stand, the Wife admitted that she had only recently found out that <em>the bank</em> actually sets default limits,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> and she had always believed that it was the Husband who had put in the limits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> As such, I found that she simply assumed and believed that it was the Husband who imposed these limits, from the mere fact of the existence of such limits. There was no evidence led to prove that the Husband had in fact lowered the default limit imposed by the banks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the Wife conceded that the Husband would pay the credit bills when the Wife needed to purchase an item after the credit card limit had been reached.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> In such cases, when the card was declined at the point of purchase, the Wife stated that she would “call him, and then he will increase”. By this, it cannot be said that the Husband imposed a limit as the Husband was prepared to simply pay up the outstanding credit card transaction charges so that the Wife could continue using the card <em>beyond</em> the limit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, the Wife did not try to change any of the default limits; in fact, it appeared that she never knew she could.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> She also did not communicate to the Husband to do so, and her answer as to why she did not do so was simply that she was afraid and dared not do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Picking up on this recurrent refrain of fear, I had asked the Wife to clarify why she had responded that she “dare not” do certain things.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Having observed the Wife on the stand, I did not find her answer to be very convincing. She appeared to be tentative and hesitant in her response to my clarification, which was a stark contrast to how she conducted her response while under cross-examination by the Husband’s Counsel. I therefore found that there was no reason as to why she did not actually communicate this with the Husband and she was trying hard to put together some semblance of a reason in direct response to my question. In the circumstances, I agreed with the Husband’s submissions that the concerns raised by the Wife about her spending limits appeared to be an afterthought raised in the context of divorce proceedings, instead of being a real concern during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the round, I found that the Husband had not acted unreasonably in the way he conducted himself over the parties’ financial affairs. I found that the Husband not behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged increasing exclusion of the Wife from the family business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As I have explained above, I found that the parties were content to organise themselves in a certain way, <em>i.e.</em>, the Husband will run the financial matters while the Wife will take care of the household. I found that this was also the case for the family business, if not even more so. The Wife had herself stated that she “trusted the [Husband] fully in the family finances and family businesses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> She also did not deny that the Husband “has experience in property business in terms of financial/numbers matters, with the [Husband] having invested in residential and commercial properties in Hong Kong”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Against this backdrop, the parties had always conducted themselves in a way where the Husband would be in charge of running the family business. In fact, it was not disputed that this was how things were since the start of the business. The Wife was “not privy to the financial standing of the companies from the beginning until most recently when she instructed her lawyers to purchase the financial statements available on ACRA bizfile”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> At first blush, the fact that the Wife was not privy to the financial standing of the companies from the beginning may appear to be unreasonable as it suggested that the Husband had deliberately sought to exclude the Wife from the family business. However, when one considered the context and history of how parties have conducted themselves from the start of the marriage, it would be immediately apparent that far from being unreasonable, this was in fact how parties had operated based on a mutual understanding. The Wife was content to leave all financial matters to the Husband because he was financially savvy, was an accountant by training, and had managed various investments. From the very beginning, the Husband had been running the family business without needing to consult the Wife on business decisions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Therefore, in a sense, the Wife had always been excluded from the financial matters in the family business but this was not because the Husband had unreasonably, nefariously nor maliciously sought to do so. On the contrary, this was how parties had decided to divide the labour between them: the Husband would focus on the family business, the Wife would leave the Husband to run the business while she focused on the family and did whatever was needed of her in the business. This was also consistent as to how the parties would manage their household finances, as I had found above. The Wife conceded she had no idea of the financials of the various companies she was a director of, that she simply signed whatever she was asked to sign, that she did not understand any of the commercial documents, and that she chose to trust and did in fact trust the Husband that he would do whatever was best for the company.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> It was all the more telling, as the Husband puts it in the Husband’s Submissions, that when questioned about the family business, the Wife admitted that she only took issue with the Husband’s decisions in relation to the family business <em>after</em> she decided to divorce him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In my view, having assessed the parties’ evidence in their affidavits as well as having had the opportunity to observe their testimony on the stand, I found that there was a certain understanding between the parties that this was how they would operate vis-à-vis the family business, <em>i.e.</em>, that at the end of the day, it was for the Husband to decide how the business ought to be run, and what decisions ought to be made. The Wife had no issues with this arrangement, until such time she decided that she wanted to divorce the Husband. That was when she decided to take issue with how things had always been, and, in my view, retrospectively viewed the Husband’s conduct as unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the exclusion of the Wife with the introduction of the parties’ eldest daughter Amanda into the family business, it was the Wife’s own evidence on the stand that it could not be unreasonable for the Husband to pass the business down to Amanda, given that it was always the plan to pass the business down to her eventually.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> Therefore, involving Amanda in business decisions rather than the Wife did not appear to me to be unreasonable in any way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Further, the Wife stated that she had “contributed in other necessary aspects, for eg the advertising / marketing, design, or publishing of the properties”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> This was not disputed by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> The evidence of AKC showed that there were some discussions between the Wife and AKC. The evidence of CNH also showed that there was some involvement by the Wife in a certain project. At this point, I would pause to note that I found the evidence of CNH largely irrelevant. Having observed him on the stand, I found that CNH was clearly trying to downplay the Wife’s involvement and repeatedly reiterated that he only dealt with the Husband and not the Wife. Nonetheless, it was clear from the evidence that the Wife was involved in some aspects of the project, but this involvement was on a limited scale. All major decisions were still made by the Husband, which was in line with the parties’ arrangement as to the division of labour as I have outlined above. This point therefore did not assist the Wife very much.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In the round, I found that the Husband had not acted unreasonably in the way he conducted himself over his treatment of the Wife in the family business. The way parties operated was in line with the tacit understanding they had about their respective roles. In any event, the Wife did not take issue with this only until she contemplated the divorce, at which time she then decided that the Husband’s conduct was retrospectively unreasonable. I therefore found that the Husband had not behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged disregard and disrespect for the Wife in his conduct towards her</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Finally, I turn to the third broad category raised by the Wife regarding the Husband’s disregard and disrespect towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The first incident mentioned in the Wife’s Submissions was that at her grandmother’s funeral in August 2002, she had one of her feet caught in a pothole and the Husband did not extend his hand to help her out but instead shouted at her. In my view, this incident did not assist much. The Wife explained that she was carrying her then 2-year-old son Caleb, her feet was stuck, she could not see anything, all she could see was the wheel of the hearse moving towards her, and that the Husband was shouting at her to stand up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> The Wife conceded that she did not know the Husband was busy watching over the 2 older children and did not know what else he could be doing. First, the evidence and details of this event were rather sketchy as it was not clear what the Husband was doing. For example, if the Husband was just standing right next to the Wife and did not extend his hand to help, that could well have been unreasonable. However, if the Husband was a distance away and was in fact taking care of the other two children, then it may not have been unreasonable for him to react the way he did. In any case, without any evidence, it was not clear to me what actually happened. Even if I were to take the Wife’s evidence at face value, I did not think it was unreasonable, during a busy funeral procession where the Husband was managing the 2 other children, for the Husband to shout at the Wife to stand up and quickly get out of the way in view of the moving procession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As for how the Husband did not treat her as a business partner, I have detailed my findings in the previous section regarding the parties’ arrangement vis-à-vis their financial matters and family business. As I mentioned earlier, it was my assessment that the Wife had been content to leave these decisions to the Husband. For her to now say she was upset about the Husband making these decisions without first consulting her, appears to me to be an afterthought to clothe the Husband’s behaviour with unreasonableness so as to bring them within the test in s. 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter. In addition, if the Wife had decided, abruptly in 2019 after so many years, that the Husband’s past conduct was unacceptable to her and that she found it unreasonable, it was incumbent on her to communicate this change in her preference to the Husband. If the Husband had continued acting just as how parties have ordered their affairs in line with their understanding all these years, he could not have known that the Wife now finds it unreasonable. Communication is a two-way street. I did not see how the Husband can be faulted for continuing to do what he has always done all these years without receiving any complaint from the Wife. The Husband had stated on the stand that had he known, he would be prepared to engage the Wife and have better communication. Having seen parties on the stand, I had no reasons to doubt the Husband. Now that the Husband is made aware of this preference, I can only hope and urge that parties find a way to communicate and interact moving forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Before I leave this point on communication, the Wife had also mentioned that the Husband commented on her choice of friends and was unhappy with guests staying over at their matrimonial property. There were scant details given in the Wife’s P1 on how the Husband was unhappy and what transpired during these episodes. On the stand, the Wife also conceded that there was no evidence provided in support of this allegation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> As such, with just a single bare assertion, it was not clear what these “comments” were and how the Husband was “unhappy” or what he did to express such unhappiness. I was therefore unable to make any meaningful finding as to what actually happened or whether the Husband has acted in a way that made it unreasonable to expect the Wife to continue living with him. At this point, I would also reiterate that the Wife did not communicate her own unhappiness about the Husband’s conduct to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Lastly, I turn to the conduct of the Husband in relation to a certain café business. The parties were cross-examined extensively on this issue. It was not disputed that the Husband had initially funded the start of this café and that the Husband managed the finances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> Again, this was in line with my assessment that all major decisions, especially financial matters and in relation to the family business, were made by the Husband. While the Wife initially stated that the Husband had assured her that there was “no need to make money”, she eventually said that the Husband had told her that “any profit earned in later years may be used to offset the previous year’s losses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The bottom-line was that there was no agreement to keep the café open at all cost, even if the café was making a loss. Unfortunately, this was exactly what happened as the café sustained millions in losses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> The Husband therefore made the decision to close the café. The Wife was upset that the Husband did not consult her in this decision and explained that as his wife, the Husband never discussed this with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> However, this being a business decision, I did not see how it would be unreasonable for the Husband to make such a decision, given how parties have been conducting themselves in relation to the family business. The Wife also agreed that it was reasonable for the Husband to make the financial decision to stop funding the café business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Although the Wife was not aware of the financial health and status of the café, it was undisputed that she managed the operations of the café. It was for this reason that the Wife felt some attachment to the café.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> In my view, her chief complaint about the closure of the café business was how it was communicated to her. The Wife felt that the decision was made and imposed on her without room for discussion, with the Husband simply telling her to close the café as he had found a tenant for the space.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> On this, the Wife first said that the Husband told her to close down the cafe in 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, the parties then had another discussion in 2019 about the closure of the café. While the Wife may have been in “shock” in 2017,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> the topic of the closure of the café would no longer have been new in 2019. There was therefore sufficient time for the Wife to make the necessary arrangements for the closure, or to have further discussions with the Husband, had she intended to, given that the closure of the café was subsequently deferred for 2 years. In fact, the Wife pointed out some exchange of messages and discussions in 2019 regarding the discussions of the closure. The closure of the café was therefore not as sudden given that the writing would have been on the wall for some time by then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In March 2019, the Wife had a discussion with the Husband, wherein she had intended to ask the Husband for another 6 months to try running the café.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> The Wife stated that in that conversation, the Husband told her that she would make him bankrupt. The Husband’s account was that he did not tell her she would make him bankrupt, but that an ordinary person, who ran the café in this manner sustaining losses in the millions, would have been bankrupt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> The Wife did not adduce any contemporaneous evidence of such a comment, given that this was a verbal discussion. On this, having observed the parties on the stand, I preferred the Husband’s version of events. I found that the Wife’s account of this episode tended to focus on the word “bankrupt” and while emotionally charged, I had doubts as to whether her interpretation and recall was accurate. I had no doubt that the word “bankrupt” was used, but I had reservations as to whether the words as uttered by the Husband was what the Wife had recounted. On the other hand, the Husband’s answers were clear and reasonable, which accorded with financial considerations given his role in managing the finances of the family business and cohered with the financial health situation of the business. That said, I considered that the Husband’s comment of how an ordinary person would have been bankrupt would have made the Wife upset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Whilst the Husband’s handling of the closure of the café business could have engaged the Wife more while using more neutral language, given that she had a major role in running the operations of the café, this was but one incident which I was able to point to in the entire course of marriage which the Wife was justifiably upset. The closure of the café was surely not a small decision, as it meant a lot to the Wife. However, bearing in mind that at the end of the day, this was a financial decision in relation to the family business, and given my finding that the parties were operating along an arrangement where the Husband made all the major decisions, I still found that the closure of the café could not be said to be an unreasonable decision. Perhaps the way the Husband handled this could have been better, but that does not mean that he had acted unreasonably. In a marriage, there are bound to be disagreements and differences where one party would be upset at the other. This is not unexpected but a party being upset does not mean that it would be grounds for a divorce. In any event, even if for the sake of argument that the Husband’s conduct on this closure was found to be unreasonable, I did not think that overall, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the test in <em>Wong Siew Boey</em>, this single episode in the entire course of marriage, given how parties have been living their lives, can be said to amount to behaviour which made it unreasonable to expect the Wife to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In the round, I therefore found that the Husband did not treat the Wife with disregard and disrespect which amounted to unreasonable behaviour. I found that the Husband had not behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Having found that the Wife did not prove that the Husband has behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband, I therefore dismissed the Wife’s claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Husband sought costs of $28,000 given that the trial took place over 5 days and an additional half-day was spent on submissions and arguments. Furthermore, the affidavits filed were voluminous and multiple witnesses were called. The SOP was fairly lengthy and spanned across 10 pages, so while the case eventually centred on 3 particular categories, time was still spent on canvassing each and every assertion made by the Wife. In support, the Husband relied on <em>WBA v WBB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27249-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 24</a> (“<b><em>WBA</em></b>”) for the proposition that for contested divorce trials, the range of $3,000 to $5,000 for the first day of trial was the norm. As this was a matter which spanned multiple days and in view of the voluminous evidence canvassed at trial, the Husband sought costs of $28,000. The Husband also relied on <em>VGT v VGU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24332-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 32</a> wherein the Court fixed costs at $11,000 for a trial which lasted two full days and two half days, and costs should therefore be higher in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Wife argued that costs should be fixed at $12,000, as the costs for contested divorce hearings typically ranged from $2,000 to $12,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As costs follows the event, the Husband is entitled to costs as he has successfully defended against the Wife’s claim. After hearing the parties’ submissions, I fixed costs at $12,000 payable by the Wife to the Husband. Much of the morning on the first day of trial was spent giving parties time to negotiate and work out a settlement on amicable resolution. Therefore, the trial proper took place for only slightly more than half a day on Day 1. For Day 4 of the trial, the trial did not take the whole day and ended about halfway through the afternoon. Considering the length of the trial, the case of <em>WBA</em> did not assist the Husband very much. In that case, the Court eventually ordered costs of $10,000 (all-in), where the evidence was heard over 4.5 days of trial, and a further half day decision hearing. Therefore, in terms of trial duration, this was similar to <em>WBA</em> and costs would have been at a similar range and not as high as $28,000 as sought by the Husband. I have nonetheless ordered more than the $10,000 in <em>WBA</em> because the affidavits in this case were voluminous, as a result of the Wife’s lengthy pleadings going into events dating back to more than 20 years ago. I also noted that in terms of the number of witnesses, there were 3 additional witnesses called, although they did not take up much time and did not add very much to the length of the trial. The affidavits filed by the witnesses were also rather short and not much time were taken on the stand. In my view, a sum of $12,000 for costs was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In summary, I dismissed the Wife’s claim and fixed costs at $12,000.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>In this judgment, all the children’s names are pseudonyms.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Para 2 of the Statement of Particulars (<b>SOP</b>) and para 2.3 of the Defence.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Para 3.f of the SOP and para 2.5.1 of the Defence.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>This version referred to is that in force as of 20 December 2023.

The parties have 3 children to the marriage; all of them were adults when D 3951 was filed by the Wife. The grounds relied on by the Wife in obtaining divorce was that the parties had separated for more than 4 years prior to the filing of D 3951. The Husband himself acknowledges that he had effectively left the parties’ Singapore matrimonial home – <em>ie.</em> Blk [XX1] (“Matrimonial Flat”) – some eleven (11) years earlier as he was working predominantly in Malaysia, although he claims to have returned to Singapore on several occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       When D 3951 was commenced by the Wife, it was filed as simplified divorce proceeding given that <em>prima facie</em> both parties had executed all the necessary documents – including a draft copy of the IJ (“Draft IJ”)– setting out the agreed terms of the divorce on 26 August 2024. IJ was thus granted on an uncontested basis, with final judgment for divorce obtained not long thereafter on 13 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For present purpose, the main term of the IJ which is central to the present applications is paragraph 3a. of the IJ, which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“a. That the Defendant's rights, title and interest in the HDB matrimonial flat at Apt [Blk XX1] shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Plaintiff within six (6) months of the date of grant of the Interim Judgment in full and final settlement of all her entitlements in ancillary matters. No CPF refunds are to be made to the Defendant's CPF account(s) for the purchase of the matrimonial flat in joint names. The Plaintiff is to bear the cost and expenses of the transfer.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife’s application, <em>vide.</em> FC/OADV 251/2025 (“OADV 251”), seeks an order <em>extending</em> the timeframe for the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat as the six-month period under the aforesaid order has since expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband, on the other hand, filed FC/OADV 465/2025 (“OADV 465”) to set-aside completely the IJ (including paragraph 3a therein) on the basis that the Wife had committed fraud and/or had taken advantage of his poor health condition when obtaining his consent to the terms of the IJ back in August 2024. She then filed D 3951 without the Husband’s knowledge and had obtained the IJ improperly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In essence, the Husband claims that the terms of the IJ are unfair and would leave him “destitute”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He says that he does not have a place to stay in Singapore and that a fair outcome would have been for the Matrimonial Flat to be sold and the proceeds therefrom divided between the parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For completeness, the Husband’s counsel acknowledged in his written submissions that if the Husband’s application is not granted, then the Husband <em>concedes</em> that he has no grounds to contest the Wife’s application to extend the time for the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In light of the parties’ respective submissions in OADV 251 and OADV 465, the followings issues have to be determined by this Court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Does the Court have the power to revoke (or set-aside) the IJ on account of the fraud perpetuated by the Wife or that she had taken advantage of the Husband’s poor health condition when the Draft IJ was executed?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Has the Husband satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify revoking the IJ in its entirety?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     If not, then whether the Wife’s application for an extension of time to complete the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat should be granted?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I will discuss each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Basis For Revoking Or Varying Consent Orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The starting point of any discussion of the applicable legal principles relevant to the present application would be the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), given that the IJ was granted in a divorce application filed under Part 10 of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Section 112(4) of the WC specifically allows the court to “<em>extend, vary, revoke or discharge</em>” any orders made under s 112(1) of the WC (that is, the just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets consequent on their divorce). Section 112(4) would thus be the operative statutory provision under which this Court considers the parties’ application as this provision is juridical source of the Court’s power to change or revoke the terms of the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In this regard, the Husband’s counsel had, in their oral and written submissions, referred to P. 1, r. 5(10) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. I am of the view that the scope and purpose of those provisions address an entirely <em>different</em> subject matter, <em>ie.</em> the Court’s overarching (and inherent) power to “<em>ensure justice is done or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and would not be applicable to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     To the extent that the considerations overlap – for eg. whether there was any alleged fraud or misrepresentation in the Wife obtaining the IJ – such considerations would already have been taken into account in the context of s 112(4) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Returning to the ambit of s 112(4) of the WC, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM</em>”) explained that in considering whether to exercise the court’s power to vary or revoke an order, the court is concerned with whether the original order was unworkable, or has become unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Additionally, where the court is faced with an application relating to a <em>consent</em> order, the Court of Appeal recognised fraud and the lack of full and frank disclosure as possible bases to vary or set-aside the said order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     What then about other vitiating factors which can be relied on to set-aside a consent order? In <em>XDN v XDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32296-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 88</a> (“<em>XDN</em>”), this Court had the occasion to consider these issues and noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Apart from fraud and material non-disclosure, other vitiating factors (applicable in the context of civil or commercial contracts) such as misrepresentation and duress may operate to unravel an otherwise binding consent division order between the parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, the High Court in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46305-M.xml')\">[2004] SGHC 275</a> (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”) has held that in determining whether to exercise the power to vary or revoke a consent order under s 112(4) of the WC, the court should be alert to whether “<em>one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms</em> [of the consent order]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Subsequent cases have understood this to mean that a consent order may be varied or set-aside if one party had taken an “unfair advantage” over the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The doctrine of unconscionability may be another possible basis to set aside a consent order. This is an intensely fact-sensitive enquiry which requires the party seeking to set-aside the order to show that: (i) he was suffering from an infirmity; (ii) such infirmity must have been, or ought to have been, evident to the other party procuring the transaction; (iii) that the other party exploited in procuring the transaction. Upon the satisfaction of this requirement, the burden is on the defending party to demonstrate that the transaction was fair, just and reasonable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     One of the key focus of this inquiry, similar to the legal test applicable to declare a commercial contract voidable due to one contracting party’s incapacity, is that the other contracting party must have known, or ought to have known ,that first party was mentally disordered and had no contractual capacity at the time of contract.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     At the commencement of the hearing for the present proceedings, I had sought clarification from the Husband’s counsel which <em>specific</em> basis the Husband is relying on to support his claim that the IJ ought to be set-aside. For context, counsel’s written submissions made vague references to the Wife’s conduct amounting to “<em>fraud and/or such other conduct that the IJ ought to be set-aside</em>”. What exactly is the alleged “<em>other conduct</em>”?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Counsel for the Husband confirmed that they are relying principally on the Wife’s alleged fraudulent misrepresentation as the main basis for the Husband’s application in OADV 465. Counsel also pointed out that the overall suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the Draft IJ and the one-sided nature of the IJ’s terms supported the Husband’s claim of fraud, as well as evidence of him being taken advantage of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As only these specific grounds for setting-aside are relied on by the Husband, I will focus only on these assertions. To be clear, I note that the allegation of his mental <em>incapacity</em> was also raised in the Husband’s affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, counsel acknowledged that a claim of mental incapacity is a <em>legally</em> different claim as compared to fraudulent misrepresentation, and that the Husband’s focus is on the latter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the Husband’s counsel’s confirmation, I will proceed to apply the relevant legal principles to the facts of the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Wife commit “fraud” or did she take advantage of the Husband?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I start by addressing the allegation of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To begin with, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em> had noted that “<em>standard of proof for fraud is a very high one and is, ex hypothesi, not easy to satisfy</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In this regard, the Husband’s counsel accepts (and I agree) that what needs to be proven in the context of a fraud claim to set-aside the IJ is similar to that applicable for the tort of deceit (or more commonly referred to as tort of fraudulent misrepresentation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As such, the burden fell on the Husband to show <em>inter alia</em> that (i) the Wife has made a false representation of fact; (ii) it was made with the intention of being acted upon by the Husband; (iii) the Husband did act upon the false statement; and (iv) that the Wife made the fraudulent representation knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly (in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true): see <em>Chan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet (alias Wen Haojie)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32098-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 893</a> at [66] – [67] on the elements applicable to a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In my view, the Husband has not met any of these legal requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To being with, the Husband did not clearly identify – whether in his affidavit or his counsel’s submissions – <em>what</em> was the specific false statement or representation of fact which the Wife had made to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Husband made passing reference to the fact that the Wife had allegedly told him (<em>ie.</em> an oral, as opposed to written, representation) that obtaining a divorce would increase his chances in obtaining government subsidies. Yet, these assertions were made with reference to certain paragraphs contained in the <em>Wife’s</em> affidavits filed in these proceedings and not to the actual words supposedly uttered by the Wife on 8 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In fact, in the Husband’s initial reply affidavit to the Wife’s application in OADV 251 (“First Affidavit”), he made no reference to any specific representations made by the Wife at all. Instead, he made a <em>generalised</em> averment that he was not aware of what he had signed on a different date, <em>ie.</em> 26 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> As I had noted above, not being aware of what he had signed is a substantively <em>different</em> averment than a fraudulent oral representation by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Upon clarification with counsel, it would appear that the Husband’s case is that he had simply trusted the Wife and the family who had asked him to sign documents (without any specific reference as to what it had contained). To me, that is not a sufficiently particularised allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In any event, I find the Husband’s overall evidence to be wanting and, in many respects, contradictory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As I had alluded to above, the Husband made no mention of any discussions with the Wife on 8 August 2024 in his First Affidavit (filed in May 2025), choosing instead to only mention what had allegedly occurred on 26 August 2024, including the fact that his daughter and the Wife had asked “two women” (one of whom was a “lawyer”) to meet him at the hospital where he was staying to sign certain documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It was only <em>after</em> the Wife had filed another affidavit in July 2025 that the Husband claims, in a subsequent affidavit filed for OADV 465 (“Second Affidavit”), that he recalls certain conversations he had with the Wife on 8 August 2024 regarding the topic of divorce, and how getting a divorce may improve his eligibility for government subsidies. He says he was clear that he did not agree to any divorce or the terms thereof. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In other words, the Husband now <em>positively avers</em> that: (i) there was indeed a discussion about divorce with the Wife prior to him signing the Draft IJ (and other documents); (ii) he knew and could recall what had happened; and (iii) he had affirmatively <em>denied</em> her request for a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     To begin with, the Husband position in his Second affidavit stands in stark contrast to his First Affidavit, where he unequivocally stated that “<em>throughout all these years, we carried on in the marriage and </em><b><em>we had never spoken </em></b><em>about parting. In any case, we were both getting on in years and the marriage situation had not changed for</em> [emphasis added]”. His assertion that they “never spoke about parting” is, by his latest confirmation, evidently untrue since he now accepts that there were communications between the two parties on 8 August 2024 about divorce (several weeks prior to him signing the IJ).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Be that as it may, if what the Husband had deposed to in his Second Affidavit was true, it would have been clear to him that when he was asked to sign documents on 26 August 2024, in the presence of a “lawyer”, that this formal event must have been related to matters of a serious <em>legal</em> nature and significance, especially since the idea of divorce had been broached by the Wife a few weeks earlier. It could not be, as he had claimed in the First Affidavit, that the documents were merely meant to “<em>help</em> [him] <em>with finances and the costs associated with</em> [his] <em>hospital stay</em>”. No evidence was given as to why he would have thought that there would be a need for such documents to be signed in the presence of a lawyer if it was only for the costs of a hospital stay?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In gist, the overall tenor of the Husband’s case – as contained in the affidavits he had filed – was that he was completely clueless as to why he had signed documents on 26 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He even asserted that he “<em>did not have the mental capacity nor was</em> [he] <em>capable of understanding the contents of the documents</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> a point which he is no longer pursuing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It follows that much turns on whether the Husband was indeed as physically or mentally infirmed and/or incapacitated (as he claims to be) on 26 August 2024 such that the Court should accept his assertion that he was completely unaware of what was going on that day, despite what he now recalls had happened a few weeks earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It is on this matter which the evidence provided by Ms [C], the Commissioner for Oaths who attended at the Husband’s hospital on 26 August 2024, took on especial significance. Ms [C]’s narration of what had taken place that day was set out in her letter dated 19 May 2025 sent on the letterhead of her firm, [XX2] (“CFO Letter”). This letter was exhibited in the Husband’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 10 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     At the outset, I accept Ms [C]’s position that as an independent Commissioner for Oaths, she owed no duty to either parties and that the contents of her letter provided a clear and detailed factual account of what had transpired on 26 August 2024. I also have no reason to doubt Ms [C]’s recollection of the relevant events which she explained left her with a deep impression given that it was her first time carrying out a commissioning appointment at a hospital.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Neither the Husband nor his counsel could point to any factual or legal basis for me to doubt Ms [C]’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In the CFO Letter, Ms [C] – in no uncertain terms – explained that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     she disagreed with the Husband’s claim that he was “very ill” or that he could not understand what was happening;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Husband was “<em>alert, sitting up in bed</em>” when she met him</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     she checked with the Husband whether he could speak, read and understand the English language. The Husband replied her <em>in English</em> that he could, and then all subsequent interaction between them was conducted in English;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     she had <em>told</em> the Husband that she understood that the Wife and him had agreed to an uncontested divorce and she was here to witness his signature, to which the Husband answered in the affirmative;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     she told the Husband that he could “<em>seek independent legal advice</em>” and the Husband said it was not necessary as he was aware of what he was signing; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_f\"></a>(f)     he then read the Draft IJ twice and expressed his readiness to proceed to execute the documents by affixing his thumb print. He did so without assistance, and willingly. Ms [C] then affixed her Commissioner for Oath seal to the document, and signed it as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Ms [C]’s evidence puts to rest <em>any</em> claim by the Husband that he had been labouring under any mental incapacity or infirmity, had been unaware of what he was signing, or that he did not know that he had agreed to an uncontested divorce with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I therefore find that there was no fraudulent misrepresentation made by the Wife to the Husband on 26 August 2024, or any other date. The Husband was neither unaware nor was he mislead by the Wife as to the contents of the Draft IJ when he executed the said documents on 26 August 2024. I find him to be fully aware of what he had executed that day. His belated attempt to set-aside the IJ via OADV 465 is, in my view, an attempt to renege on what he now believes to be a “bad bargain”, and not because he had been lied to by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     For the same reasons – including but not limited to Ms [C]’s evidence – I find that the Wife had not taken advantage of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     He was fully aware of the terms of the Draft IJ, had been extended an opportunity to take independent legal advice (even being reminded of this right in the presence of an independent Commissioner for Oaths) but chose not to do so as he was satisfied with the terms contained therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Indeed, I find the Husband’s case on this matter wanting in one important aspect – why would the Wife, having allegedly planned to take advantage of the Husband for some time and having laid out a detailed scheme to take over the Matrimonial Flat and leave the Husband destitute, take the risk of appointing an independent Commissioner for Oaths to attend at the hospital, allow her to verify the Husband’s understanding of the terms, and explain to him his right to counsel to the Husband (and thus take apart her furtive plans)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Further, as the Wife’s counsel had pointed out – armed with an allegedly unfair IJ and an improperly obtained Power of Attorney granting their daughter the right to act in place of the Husband, why did the Wife not proceed to unilaterally carry out the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat to consummate her nefarious plan? Instead, she took the unnecessary step of contacting the Husband to carry out the property transfer through the usual means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Wife’s actions run counter to someone who is trying to take advantage of the Husband’s vulnerabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     For completeness, in reaching the above conclusions, I make the following additional observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Fraudulent Misrepresentation</b>. The Husband’s claim for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation also fails because <em>inter alia</em> he has not clearly pointed to the allegedly false representation which the Wife had made to him which induced him to sign the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I did not take into account the parties’ 8 August 2024 conversations since neither the Husband, nor his counsel relied on the events of this date. In any event, what was discussed could at best be statement as to the Wife’s <em>belief</em> that a divorce may improve the chances of obtaining financial subsidies (even if it was indeed made) and not a statement of fact, nor has the Husband shown that the Wife had no genuine belief as to its truth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Insofar as the Husband is relying on something spoken or said on 26 August 2024, he has adduced no objective evidence to support his case. Given Ms [C]’s evidence, the Husband simply has not passed the high threshold required to support a finding of fraud.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>Unconscionability / Unfair Advantage</b>. Insofar as any claim of unconscionability (or unfair advantage) is concerned, a critical element of this claim is proof that the Wife <em>was aware</em> of the Husband’s incapacity or infirmity, and she had then <em>taken advantage of, or exploited</em> the same. The mere presence of a mental infirmity on the Husband alone would not suffice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In my view, I find that the Husband would have failed in his claim <em>regardless</em> of whether he was indeed infirmed at the material time. This is because the Wife had arranged for an independent Commissioner for Oaths to facilitate and assist with the execution of the IJ, and the IJ was not signed in her or their daughter’s presence. Ms [C] had explained that the Husband was given ample opportunity to consider the terms of the IJ, and had been told of his right to seek legal advice. He then executed the IJ having expressed his understanding of its terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Under these circumstances, there was no reason for the Wife to know (or even suspect) that the Husband was labouring under any infirmity or incapacity which affected his ability to provide his consent to the terms of the IJ on 26 August 2024. As such, the Wife could not be said to have taken advantage of any infirmity or incapacity suffered by the Husband, which she had been aware of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged medical condition</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although my findings above are sufficient to dispose of OADV 465, I will, for completeness, set out my views on the Husband’s alleged incapacity or mental infirmity because of his medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my view, having considered the evidence produced by the Husband, I find that he has not proven that had been suffering from <em>any</em> mental incapacity or infirmity on 26 August 2024 which affected his ability to understand, comprehend and thereafter provide his consent (and assent) to the terms of the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As I had outlined above, the detailed narration provided by Ms [C] strongly supports (and corroborates) the Wife’s description of the Husband’s physical condition and mental acuity on 26 August 2024 (set out in her affidavit filed in relation to OADV 465,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> and in her reply affidavit for OADV 251).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As against the Wife’s and Ms [C]’s evidence, the Husband principally relies on his bare recollection (as contained in his affidavits) and a medical report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 28 March 2025 (“TTSH Report”). authored by one Dr [DT] (a senior resident at the Department of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As alluded to above, I placed little weight on the Husband’s alleged recollection in his affidavits which, in my view, was not entirely consistent or clear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     With respect to the TTSH Report, I am of the view that the Husband has placed undue reliance on what appears to be a <em>general</em> medical report of his hospital stay and medical history. The TTSH Report is not an <em>expert</em> report from a psychiatric or mental health expert witness giving his or her assessment or opinion of the Husband’s mental capacity or acuity on 26 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Indeed, the TTSH Report itself does not indicate any mental capacity assessment was done on the Husband on 26 August 2024, or even within the same month. Even on the Husband’s own case, he submits that an assessment was done by an occupational therapist <em>after</em> his admission to the hospital on 11 September 2024 where he was noted to have “cognitive impairment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Even if that was true, this would have been <em>after</em> the Draft IJ had been executed. It would be an inferential leap for the Court – in the absence of clear and credible expert evidence – to assume that the Husband had been suffering the same “cognitive impairment” one month earlier. I do not agree with counsel that there is basis to suspect what the Husband’s condition was weeks earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     What is more important, however, is that the Court should not make assumptions as to what “<em>cognitive impairment</em>” may mean in relation to the Husband, and how it may have affected him on 26 August 2024. The thrust of the Husband’s case appears to be that simply because when he was screened under the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, he had been given a particular score associated with cognitive impairment, it follows <em>ipso facto</em> that he had no capacity (or at the least, no mental ability) to understand to the Draft IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     With respect, that is an assumption which cannot be made in the absence of proper expert evidence. I also do not agree with the Husband’s counsel that this is a matter which the Court can simply take “judicial notice” of. Judicial notice can only be resorted to when the issue in question falls within one of the recognised categories in s 59 of the Evidence Act 1893, or if relates to a matter which is of clear notoriety, or which is capable of being immediately and accurate shown to exist by authoritative sources.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The effect of the alleged “cognitive impairment” suffered by the Husband does not fall under any of these categories. In my view, it can only be answered by a person skilled in the relevant science.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Overall, I find that the Husband has not discharged his burden to demonstrate that he was labouring under any mental infirmity or incapacity at the material time such that he was unable to understand what was contained in the IJ, or to give his consent to the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It follows therefore that he has not shown how the Wife had taken advantage of, or had misled, him to execute the IJ. That being the case, there is no need for the Court to consider whether the terms of the IJ reflected a just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As Choo Han Teck J had held in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (some twenty years ago) and more recently, in <em>WWQ v WWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32765-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 3</a>, “[a] <em>court will not lightly vary the terms of a settlement agreement simply because in the court’s view such revision would lead to a more equitable result. The court has to respect the fact that the parties would have had their own private reasons for agreeing to the settlement</em>…”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s application should be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In light of my decision set out above, the final question I have to consider is whether to <em>vary</em> paragraph 3a. of the IJ in the manner sought by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     To recapitulate, the Wife had filed OADV 251 seeking an extension of time for the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat as the original timeframe for the same had expired in April 2025 (<em>ie.</em> 6 months after the IJ was granted). As noted earlier, the Husband accepts that if his application was not granted, there is no basis for him to contest OADV 251.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I agree with the Wife that a further extension of time ought to be granted. In my view, the original timeframe had lapsed due to the Husband’s refusal (perhaps due to his belief that the IJ was not properly obtained, an argument which I have rejected) and the original terms of the IJ have become unworkable as a result.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I will therefore grant the extension of time sought by the Wife as this variation would enable the original intention of the IJ , <em>viz.</em> the transfer of the Husband’s rights and interests in the Matrimonial Flat to the Wife, would be implemented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In conclusion, I grant an Order-in-terms of Prayers 1 to 3 of OADV 251, and dismiss OADV 465 in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     I will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit dd 10.07.25 filed for OADV 465 (“RA2”) at [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><em>Ibid</em> at [9]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions dd 26.09.25 (“RS”) at [40]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>A similar set of powers is set out in the Rules of Court 2021 in relation to civil proceedings.

The Son alleged that the Father had inflicted family violence on him. He thus filed the present application, in SSP 1220/2025 (“SSP 1220”), for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against his Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of this matter, as well as oral submissions from both Father and Son on 26 September 2025. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The law, as is contained in the family violence provisions found in the Women’s Charter 1961, makes it clear that the Son must, in order to obtain a PPO, establish the following two elements on a balance of probabilities: Section 60A of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The first, is that the Father had committed family violence on him, or that the Father was likely to do so. The second, is that it is necessary for the court to order a PPO for his personal safety or protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Son had, in his complaint form, cited numerous incidents of family violence that the Father had allegedly committed. These incidents arose because the Father did not approve of his Son’s living habits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       For example, the Son complained of a scuffle with the Father on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2025. The Son says that the Father had tried to close his bedroom door. The Son resisted. In this scuffle, the Son had tried to use his foot to prevent the Father from closing the door. The Father had allegedly tried to use a lighter to burn his foot. The Father had also stomped on his foot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In his testimony, the Father admitted to stomping on his Son’s foot. The Father also admitted to using a lighter to try to scare the Son, though he says that the lighter was never lit, nor did he burn his Son’s foot in the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The second example was this incident which had taken place on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2024. There was an argument over the Son using a wall socket to charge his laptop. The Son alleges that, in the ensuing quarrel, the Father had scolded him, slapped his left cheek, shoved his head backwards and pulled his hair. The Son also says the Father had spit on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In his testimony, the Father admitted to slapping his Son, pushing him, pulling his hair, grabbing his phone and spitting on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The third example was an incident which had taken place on 26 August 2024. The Son had fallen asleep on the sofa in the living room. The Father had, upon discovering the Son fast asleep on the sofa, poured water over him. The day before this incident, the Father had also discovered the Son asleep on the sofa. In an attempt to wake the Son, the Father shot him in the face with a rubber band.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In his testimony, the Father candidly admitted to what he had done. He said he had poured water on the Son. He also said he had used a rubber band to hit him. His reason was that if his Son wanted to sleep, then he should have gone to sleep in his own bedroom.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I find that the Father had, in these three incidents cited above, committed family violence on the Son. His acts of threatening to burn his Son’s foot with a lighter, slapping him, and pulling his hair, all fall within the definition of physical abuse (see Section 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961). While the Father alluded to disciplining his Son as justification for his acts, he cannot avail himself of the “correction exception” set out in s 58B(2)(c)(ii) of the Women’s Charter 1961. That is because the Son is above 18 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In this connection, I also find that it is necessary to order the PPO for the Son’s personal safety or protection. These incidents had arisen because the Son continued to live in the same flat as the Father. It appears that this living arrangement would continue for the foreseeable future – the Son testified that he would continue to live in the same flat, until he had the resources to move out on his own.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Then there is also the Father’s method of expressing his disapproval of his Son’s living habits. I had asked the Father if he had realised that his manner of communicating with his son might not be productive. The Father had told me that he had tried to tell his Son nicely, but his words fell on deaf ears, and the Son stubbornly refused to change his behaviour. The Father also told me that if the Son continued to behave in this way, he would not be able to tolerate it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The inference I draw from this is that the Father is becoming increasingly frustrated and irritated with his Son’s living habits. Further, and on the Father’s own evidence, it appears to me that when the Father realised that his words had no effect on his Son, he resorted to physical violence, thinking that this would cause the Son to change his behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I thus conclude that a PPO should be granted in the Son’s favour. This PPO, however, shall be limited for a period of three years: Section 60A(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. It is clear that the conflict between Father and Son had arisen because both share a common space. That being said, the Son had spoken of his intention to move out and find his own accommodation once he had graduated and found a job. In this vein, the Son had given evidence that he was likely to find gainful employment when he graduated in two years’ time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Given this, I deemed it appropriate to limit the validity of the PPO for the aforementioned period (meaning that the PPO shall be valid till the 21<sup>st</sup> of October 2028).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As a final point, it was not lost on me that despite their quarrels and hostility towards each other, both the Father and the Son, deep down, longed for the love, acknowledgement and affection of the other. During the course of their respective testimonies, the both of them did express, with a tinge of sadness, that the other had never truly acknowledged their relationship as father and son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I am therefore ordering that both the Father and Son go for counselling, in the hopes that they would learn how to better manage their conflict, and in time, rebuild the father-son relationship.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript at p 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript at p 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript at p 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript at p 36.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at pp 13 and 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript at p 7, 21, 30.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – enforcement of maintenance order – arrears accrued more than three years as of time of application under section 121(3) of Women’s Charter – whether special circumstances exist","Family law – enforcement of maintenance order – onus on Respondent to show ‘good cause’ not mere cause – whether social welfare benefits amount to showing good cause for non-payment of maintenance","Family law – variation of maintenance order – special needs child – whether social welfare benefits amount to change in circumstances – assessing reasonable expenses where special needs child is concerned – whether social welfare benefits absolve a parent from paying maintenance"],"date":"2025-10-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 454 and 1672 of 2024","title":"XTG v XTH","citation":"[2025] SGFC 112","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33996-SSP.xml","counsel":["Applicant in person","Alfred Dodwell (Dodwell& Co LLC) for the Respondent"],"timestamp":"2025-10-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kathryn Thong","html":"<root><head><title>XTG v XTH</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XTG <em>v</em> XTH </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33996-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 112</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

They are largely non-verbal and need help with daily living. The offspring of the mother, (“M”), a South African national and the Father, (“F”), a French national working in Singapore since 2015, the twins presently reside in France with the M.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In 2018, while the family was still residing in Singapore, the M obtained a maintenance order (“MO”) in favour of the twins. The MO provided for a monthly maintenance sum of $1,600 in total for both children. In addition, the F was to bear all school related expenses as well as a sum of $1,500 as accommodation/rental expenses. Eventually, the M would move to France with the twins shortly after the MO was issued while the F remained in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In February 2024, the M filed for enforcement of the said MO <em>vide</em> MSS 454/2024, alleging to have received only one payment thereunder, and sought to enforce arrears from May 2018 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       A few months later in July 2024, the F applied for variation of the MO to ‘zero’, <em>vide</em> MSS 1672/2024 and for the variation to be backdated to 2018 when the children started living in France as they were enjoying government benefits which presumably exceeded their needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Eventually I found that the M was entitled to arrears of <b>$105,600</b> from 2020 onwards. As for the F’s application, I ordered that he pay a reduced amount of maintenance of $1,091 from July 2025 onwards and rejected his request for backdated variation to 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       These grounds of decision set out the court’s views on how social welfare benefits may be considered in the context of applications for enforcement and variation, and in particular whether they can amount to showing good cause for a payer defaulting in his maintenance obligations, and merit a reduction in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It also suggests general considerations in assessing reasonable expenses for a special needs child and seeks to elucidate the threshold of the legal burden on respondents in enforcement proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The names of the children in these grounds of decision are pseudonyms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Parties had resided in Singapore from 2015 onwards when the F’s work brought him here from France. Unfortunately, parties’ relationship broke down. In 2018, when the twins, Madeline and Antonio were three years old, the M applied for maintenance and obtained the MO on 6 April 2018. A few days later on 11 April 2018, parties entered into a consent order in an application launched by the F under the Guardianship of Infants Act (“the OSG orders”). Under the latter, parties had joint custody of the twins, and the M was allowed to relocate to France with the children while the F would be allowed to visit them annually.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Shortly after the OSG orders were granted, the M went to Cameroon to work and the children were cared for by her mother. Here and there, she got some financial support from her family members as the F did not send her maintenance. In the enforcement proceedings, the F would explain he had refused to do so as his payments into the designated bank account stated in the MO had bounced in September 2018, and he did not trust the alternative bank account number the M later personally furnished him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The twins were only diagnosed with autism sometime in 2019-2020. As the health authorities in Cameroon were unable to care for the twins, the M moved to France where the children could receive the necessary interventions and social welfare benefits. In the meantime, her request to the F to pay the maintenance into her French bank account was ignored. Between seeking government assistance for early intervention for the children and searching for appropriate school placements, the M would state that claiming maintenance arrears from the F was not her top priority.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In 2020, the M informed the F via Whatsapp that the children had severe special needs that required intervention. Her message was, according to the F, a bolt from the blue. In his own words<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[35]  Eventually, I received a Whatsapp message from [the M] saying that she had relocated to France with the children and that I should continue transferring the monies to a new bank account in France. I did not adhere to this as this was not what was in the said order. I was also not sure whose [account] this was as [the M] was only informing me about the account at that time. Following this, [the M] stopped communicating with me and she refused to give me details about her and the children’s whereabouts and deprived me from accessing or communicating with the children once again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[36]  Then suddenly in 2020, when the children were about 5 years old, [the M] sent me many photographs of the children and was sharing with me contacts from their school in France. I contacted the school shared by [the M] and a specialist in the school informed me that both the children, Madeline and Antonio were exhibiting verbal autism, with serious developmental delays. I was devastated upon receiving the said information and it made me wonder what [the M]’s intention was, for her to get the school to share this information with me at this point in time. <b>I was emotionally drained and eventually, I stopped communicating with [the M] and blocked her on Whatsapp and I was also trying to focus on my life and my employment here in Singapore.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<b>37</b>]   <b>Since then she did not communicate with me nor update me about the children. For the reasons as set out in the narrative above, I did not contact her and she did not contact me and we just proceeded with life.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>[own emphasis]</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     This appeared to be the general state of affairs between parties until the M filed for enforcement. The F then appointed a registered French lawyer practising in a firm in Singapore, who attempted negotiations with the M to no avail. The said counsel then rendered an expert opinion on the benefits the M was potentially receiving in France. Suffice to say, parties were unable to resolve both applications out of court and both matters were fixed for hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The court’s findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter apply and if so, were there special circumstances?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     A preliminary issue was whether the M was entitled to enforce more than three years’ worth of maintenance given the restriction under section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter (“the Charter”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit <b>unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>[own emphasis]</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Women’s Charter (“Charter”) does not specify what qualifies as “special circumstances” under section 121(3). Generally, these are circumstances which are sufficiently persuasive in themselves that to ignore them would do great injustice to the party receiving maintenance (see <em>Koay Guat Kooi (mw) v Eddie Yeo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6511-M.xml')\">[1997] SGHC 197</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The purpose of the time bar is to ensure that a respondent is not blindsided by a sudden and large amount of arrears that might cause hardship to him. This however, must be balanced against the hardship the applicant suffers if the time bar were to apply, and the principle that a respondent should not be permitted to profit from his/her own wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I find that there were special circumstances in the present case. Taking care of a pair of young, non-verbal autistic twins on her own while also desperately seeking intervention for them, it was understandable that enforcing maintenance was not the M’s priority. This is especially given the opportunity cost of having to fly to Singapore or appointing Singapore lawyer(s) to take out the necessary legal proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     That said, I only allowed the M to claim unpaid maintenance from 2020 onwards. I accepted that there had been poor to almost no communication between the parties and insofar as the F’s reason for defaulting was because he was unaware of the children’s whereabouts, by 2020 it would have been patently clear to him that the children were residing in France when the M messaged him over Whatsapp and shared with him a list of specialists in Singapore he could reach out to in order to secure intervention for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     From January 2020 till June 2025 (the month of the hearings), this was a period of 66 months. The arrears for this period came up to $105,600 based on the fixed monthly maintenance of $1,600. I disallowed the M’s claim for arrears in relation to the children’s therapy and related expenses as I agreed with counsel for the F, Mr Dodwell, that these fell outside the scope of the MO as they did not appear to be required by the children’s school. The court can only enforce what an order provides for. Arrears for accommodation expenses were also excluded from enforcement at the M’s request – she candidly pointed out that her accommodation was being paid for by the French government.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has the F ‘shown good cause’ for failing to pay maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having established the quantum of arrears that was enforceable under section 71 of the Charter, the next inquiry was whether the F had furnished good reasons at law, for failing to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">To ‘show cause’ and ‘show good cause’</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Section 71 enforcement proceedings are commonly known as ‘show cause’ proceedings. In <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [10], it was held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is the opportunity that is made available to the Respondent to “show cause” (which is the term found in the summons that is served on Respondents generally…)…or in simple language, “show reason” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full…or in part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, P.3, r.15(3) provides that if the enforcement court intends to impose a sentence of imprisonment for arrears owing as of the time of the enforcement application, the court must, before imposing the sentence of imprisonment, require the respondent’s personal attendance in court and -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    give the respondent the opportunity –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the respondent has made the payment or payments required to be made under a maintenance order; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   to <b>show cause</b> for the respondent’s failure to make the payment or payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In <em>Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></em>, the learned author observes that the expression “show cause”:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… does not imply that a mere opportunity of submitting an explanation is enough. It implies that adequate opportunity of leading evidence in support of the contentions raised against his [<em>sic</em>] must be given and where necessary, opportunity of cross-examining witness of the other side and of addressing arguments be afforded. <em>Shyamlal v State of UP</em> AIR 1954 All 235 at 234.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     From the above definitions of ‘show cause’, it can be gleaned that it is an important <em>procedure</em> where a respondent explains his/her default and to that end, the respondent is to be allowed to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     That the term ‘show cause’ in the context of maintenance enforcement proceedings has historically been used in subsidiary legislation rather than primary legislation, may give rise to the perception that ‘show cause’ is primarily a matter of procedure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     But ‘show cause’ also has a substantive dimension to it, which is that the respondent’s explanation must persuade the court that there was good reason for his/her conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     This requirement for the explanation to satisfy the court is rather implicit and it may not be readily apparent to parties in enforcement proceedings what the content of the burden to ‘show cause’ consists of. Indeed, if the casual excuses respondents in enforcement proceedings often give are any indication, some exposition on the content of this obligation could be helpful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the case of <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a>, the court listed some examples where the court found that a respondent had shown cause, and I gratefully reproduce [21] of the judgment here:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    where the parties had mutually agreed to a reduction of the amount payable pursuant to maintenance order or where there was an understanding (whether implicit or explicit) between the parties not to require strict compliance with the terms of the said order (see for eg.,<em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [15], <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [24] – [28] and <em>VAM v VAN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23625-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 96</a>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    where the respondent had went over and beyond what was required under the maintenance order and/or had provided additional support to the complainant even though the payment modality may not have been exactly in accordance with the terms of the maintenance order (see <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a> at [22] – [27]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    where a complainant had used monies belonging to the respondent to pay for expenses which were within the scope of the maintenance order such that the respondent should be treated as having paid for those expenses (see for eg. <em>TXY v TXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 21</a>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    where a respondent had a good track record of payment but is facing genuine financial difficulties in keeping up with the payments (see for eg.<em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, a case involving financial difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is not difficult to appreciate in the scenarios outlined above why the court found that the respondent had shown good reasons for not paying maintenance. Less intuitive for respondents though, is why the court refuses to accept a lack of a respondent’s access to his/her child, or a respondent’s unilateral deduction from the fixed maintenance sum expenses which the respondent incurred for the child on his/her own volition (and without the care and control parent’s consent or knowledge), as amounting to ‘showing cause’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Why do such reasons not amount to ‘showing cause’? It is this court’s view that how enforcement proceedings have proceeded in the courts thus far is for the respondent to show ‘<em>good</em> cause’ that would excuse his default in paying maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The term ‘good cause’ appears in section 72 of the Charter, which sets out the threshold for the rescission and variation of a maintenance order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>72.</b>—(1)    On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay monthly sums under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, or that person’s wife, incapacitated husband or child, <b>or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court</b>, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Section 91O of the recently amended Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> also requires a respondent to “show good cause” as to why he defaulted on his maintenance obligations under a show payment order, failing which, the default term of imprisonment takes effect:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">91O.—(1)    Where a court has specified a term of imprisonment under section 81(2)(d) or (4)(a)(ii) in respect of a respondent, the court may sentence the respondent to imprisonment if —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the respondent fails to prove to the satisfaction of the court, by any date specified under section 81(2)(c) or (4)(a)(i) in respect of an amount to be paid, that the respondent has paid that amount by the date specified in the order under section 81(2)(b) or (4)(a)(i)(A) (as the case may be) for payment of that amount; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the court is satisfied that the respondent has shown no good cause for his or her failure mentioned in paragraph (a).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     While not defined in the Charter, ‘good cause’ is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (12<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2014)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A legally sufficient reason. <b>Good cause is often the burden placed on a litigant (usu. by court rule or order) to show why a request should be granted or an action excused</b>…Also termed good cause shown; just cause; lawful cause; sufficient cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is: “Reason which is found to be adequate or proper and justified by a court or a competent authority dealing with the matter.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (2002 ed) defines ‘good cause’ as: “a cause or reason sufficient in law, or that is based on equity or justice or that would motivate a reasonable man under all the circumstances.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     If ‘good cause’ is required before a maintenance order can be varied or rescinded, and to avoid imprisonment for breaching a show payment order, then it seems only logical that the same threshold be imposed when there has been a default in maintenance. Indeed, the intrinsic importance of maintenance demands as such. It is not enough for a respondent to simply “show reason” – he/she must “show good reason” that satisfies the Court. As Sachs LJ put in <em>Jones v Jones</em> [1970] 3 All ER 47 at 55:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…‘good cause’ …is a phrased adopted by Lord Denning MR both in Baker v Bowkett’s Cakes Ltd [1966] 2 All ER 290…’[g]ood reason’ is a phrase used by Lord Goddard in Battersby v Anglo-American Oil Co Ltd [1944] 2 All ER 387; [1945] KB 23. For my part, I would prefer that <b>no gloss be put on these two phrases, which have a precisely similar meaning.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     A respondent in enforcement proceedings needs to proffer good reasons that are established at law or founded in equity, buttressed by sufficient and cogent evidence, as to why he or she should be excused from the default in maintenance. This is the burden of proof the respondent bears.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Whereas the traditional term of ‘show cause’ may appear to litigants to refer primarily to the procedure of allowing a respondent to provide an explanation for his default and to challenge opposing arguments and evidence made against him, the phrase ‘show good cause’ renders it expressly clear that the respondent also produces legally sufficient reasons for his request in order that his conduct is excused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     So while an enforcement application may often be referred to as a ‘show cause’ proceeding, it is this Court’s view that the burden is really for a respondent to ‘show good cause’. This is consistent with the prevailing practice in the Family Justice Courts and aligns with the burden of proof in the Charter for variation proceedings, and a respondent explaining his default under a show payment order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s reasons for defaulting on the maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The F in his affidavit spoke of how the M had not given him access to the twins and how he was unable to see the children despite having joint custody of them. I found that even if this were true, it was irrelevant. A child’s basic needs require no articulation – it is a matter of common sense that a child needs food, shelter, clothing and education provided for them because they are unable to provide for themselves. As the High Court in <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23233-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 12</a> remarked at [48]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A parent ought to be aware that provision for basic needs would be required, whether or not a specific request for basic needs has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     While the Court’s remarks above were in the context of an application for a maintenance order, the same reasoning applies equally in enforcement proceedings. Every child needs to be maintained regardless of whether there is an order in force, and whether the parent has access to the child. Such is the duty of a parent enshrined under section 68 of the Charter – it exists independently of an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Where a maintenance order has been made, it is expected to be complied with regardless of a parent’s subjective feelings. It is worth iterating that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All court orders must be complied with. A litigant is entitled to receive what he or she is entitled to under a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(at [15] of <em>UNE v UNF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22373-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 15</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The F’s alleged lack of access even if it were proven, was irrelevant to the F’s liability to pay. It was not a reason that can be sustained at law or equity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For completeness, I add that if the F genuinely had concerns over access, it was always open to him to take out proceedings in Singapore where he is based, or in France, for access to the children. After all, he appeared to have easy access to French counsel and affordability of counsel was not an issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     It appeared that the F’s alleged difficulties with access was a smokescreen - he simply did not want to maintain the twins. This as much was clear when he stated that he blocked the M when she reached out to him in 2020 about the children’s condition. Instead, he “just wanted to focus on his life in Singapore (see [12] above).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     It is this court’s view that the F had wilfully shut his eyes towards the needs of his children and his maintenance obligations under the MO. He appeared to have accepted that the children were living in France when he blocked the M on Whatsapp in 2020, yet he refused to pay the maintenance into a French bank account which details the M had provided back in 2018. His basis for not doing so because it was a different account number from that in the MO was with respect, rich. On one hand he was expecting of the M a fastidious adherence to the MO down to a technical detail of a bank account number, yet on the other hand, he was blatantly breaching the MO by refusing to pay maintenance despite the M herself providing an alternative bank account. Clearly, he was contravening the spirit and substance of the MO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Another ground the F had relied on to preclude enforcement, was that the children were being maintained in France and receiving generous benefits from the government. The M was receiving the following benefits based on her own evidence:</p> <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col

foregoing, the F submitted that the MO not be enforced against him, especially since it had been made in the context of Singapore’s standard of living as reflected in the judge’s brief grounds of decision when it issued the MO. Mr Dodwell stated in his submissions, “the order was contextually and geographically specific, reflecting the financial demands of raising children in Singapore without state support.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The F submitted that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the relocation of the Mother and children to France combined with their access to comprehensive, ongoing, and state-funded support under the French social welfare system renders the continued enforcement of [the MO] unnecessary, unjustified, and inequitable. The French government, through the Caisse d’Allocations Familiales (“CAF”), provides a robust system of family-related welfare benefits, including monthly cash transfers and subsidies covering housing, education, childcare, and healthcare.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The family’s eligibility for these entitlements is directly linked to the Father’s nationality and status.

When the F ceased to pay maintenance, he was unaware of the specific benefits the children and the M were receiving. He simply was not interested in maintaining the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Would the M be “profiting” if the MO was enforced?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     But leaving aside the F’s subjective basis for not paying maintenance, objectively speaking, should the fact that the French government was financially supporting the children during the period of default amount to good cause for not paying the maintenance? Would the fact that the children had received government benefits since 2020 mean that the M will be receiving a windfall or profiting somewhat should the MO be enforced against the F, a point alluded to in the F’s submissions?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     There are three considerations at play in this context. The first is that court orders are to be adhered to unless and until varied or discharged by law. In <em>Madison Pacific Trust Limited and ors v PT Dewata Wibawa</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24926-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 184</a> at [73] the High Court cited Mark S W Hoyle, <em>Freezing and Search Orders </em>(Informa, 4th Ed, 2006) at para 9.17 (cited with approval in <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0518.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518</a> at [82]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is no defence to contempt proceedings to allege that the order should not have been made, or has been discharged. <b>An order of the court must be obeyed while it stands</b>, and a breach is still contempt even if, at a later stage, the order is in fact discharged. <b>The same principle applies if the original order was wrongly made; the defendant’s remedy is to apply for its immediate discharge while keeping to its terms.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Court orders are to be obeyed, until varied or discharged at law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Second, the law does not assist the indolent. The F has been based in Singapore since 2018 and has had access to local lawyers. In fact, he was legally represented in the maintenance proceedings and could have easily obtained legal advice on his ongoing maintenance obligations. This he could have done as early as September 2018 when his transfers to the M’s Cameroon bank account bounced and she had furnished him her French bank account details, or in 2020, when he received the M’s Whatsapp messages of the children suffering from severe autism and being in France. The F could have then taken out an application to vary or rescind the MO to cease his maintenance obligations owing to the benefits the children were receiving from the French government. He did none of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Last but not least, it is to be emphasised that “A litigant is entitled to receive what he or she is entitled to under a court order” (see [15] of <em>UNE v UNF</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the principles outlined above, it is my view that the M having received government benefits on behalf of the children, whether they were equal to or even exceeded her entitlement under the MO during the period of default, did not amount to good cause as to why the MO ought not to be enforced against the F. And on this note, I rejected the submission that any variation of the MO be backdated to 2018 for the same reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For completeness, I add that I find it unlikely that the M would be “profiting” from the enforcement of the MO. She explained having to refund the French government the Family Support Allowance once the F pays up the arrears. This was also alluded to by the F’s own French lawyer, who prepared an expert opinion on the benefits the M was likely receiving in France. Therein, the said French lawyer mentioned that a recovery claim may be filed against the debtor (the missing/defaulting parent). This would not be inconsistent with the M’s claim that the government can claw back such monies from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Second, the M testified (and this was undisputed) how she would be out of pocket for the utilities by some 322 euros each month and additionally, how she has paid for therapeutic interventions for the children (which she has not been allowed to claim as arrears in these enforcement proceedings). Ultimately, it was apparent that the M has been out of pocket for the children’s expenses all these years, and the enforcement monies will go some way towards addressing this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders made on the enforcement application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The arrears from January 2020 to date (including June 2025) stood at $105,600. The aggregate amount appears staggering, but is only so because of the long period of default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The F’s nett pay exceeded $20,000 per month and based on his latest notice of assessment, his average monthly income was some $30,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Taking these figures into account, the long period of default, and the large amount of arrears, I ordered that the arrears be paid off in monthly instalments as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 October 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 November 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     Sum of $10,000 by 20 December 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_v\"></a>(v)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 January 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 February 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The F was ordered to show payment online for each of these payments. The remaining arrears were to be paid off in monthly instalments of $5,000 with effect from 20 March 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The variation application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ respective positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As adverted to earlier, the F had applied for the MO to be varied to ‘zero’ and such variation to be backdated to when the children started residing in France and started receiving government benefits. Mr Dodwell submitted that the “children’s welfare is adequately provided for without reliance on contributions from the Father.” Additionally, he pointed out a “financial surplus” for them as they were being maintained at a standard of living that is “comparable, if not superior, to what was envisaged when [the MO] was originally made in the context of Singapore.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Counsel also contended that there was no financial hardship demonstrated by the M in relation to the children’s upkeep. Imposing maintenance on the F would thus be “an unnecessary and duplicative financial obligation, which is inconsistent with the principles of proportionality and equity underpinning Singapore’s family law regime.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The M on the other hand stated that at the time the MO was made, the children were not yet diagnosed with autism, and that the F’s variation application was a red-herring designed to confuse. It would be unjust if the F was allowed to escape his maintenance obligations by applying for backdated variation. He also ought not to rely on the French government for the children’s maintenance when he was more than capable of supporting them as their father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The M thus asked that the current clauses in the MO remain, save for the clause pertaining to accommodation as this was provided by the French government. She submitted having to pay for the children’s food, specialists, clothes, toys and holidays, and their needs can be expected to evolve as they grow up. She also has to top up 322 euros for utilities each month. She was unable to work as she needed to care for them and ferry them to their various therapies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has there been a change in circumstances or good cause to vary the maintenance order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Section 72 empowers the court to vary a maintenance where there has been a change in circumstances or good cause to do so. There was indeed a change in circumstances, given that at the time the MO was made, the children were undiagnosed and parties were residing in Singapore with the judge stating that her determination on the MO was “premised on the children remaining in Singapore and incurring expenses in Singapore.” Now that the M is residing in France and receiving benefits, this also amounts to a change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The F’s objections to the children’s expenses </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Some of the twins’ needs were disputed by the F as seen

desire for the children. In particular, it was the various therapies and intervention that the F objected to, because he had not been consulted and there was no proof that these were medically necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">‘Reasonable maintenance’– an objective-subjective approach and its application to ‘special needs’ children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In assessing reasonable maintenance for a child, the court is largely concerned with the reasonableness of the nature and quantum of such expenses (<em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23233-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 12</a>). This is largely an objective exercise, but concurrently one that requires a value judgment of the court as to what is reasonable against all the circumstances of the case. Hence, the High Court observed at [47]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Suppose, hypothetically, the mother of a child does not consult the father about enrolling the child in horseback-riding classes that cost $1,500 a month. The father is of the view that their family of five, with a monthly household income of $9,000, cannot afford such an expense, and such expenses are in any case not the more common ones such as those arising from academic tuition classes or music and swimming enrichment classes. If the father refuses to pay for the horseback-riding classes, can he be said to have refused to provide reasonable maintenance? Another hypothetical example is where a mother purchases a car for their 19-year-old child and requests the father to pay for the car, being the child’s “transport expenses”. Some disagreement or resistance to less common and reasonable expenses is not inevitably a refusal to provide maintenance. <b>Naturally, this assessment of reasonableness is dependent on all the facts and circumstances of the case including the standard of living enjoyed by the child and the family.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     There is thus in my view, an objective-subjective approach that the court adopts when assessing what <em>type</em> of expense is reasonable for a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Likewise, with the quantum of expenses, there is similarly an objective-subjective approach. Hence, the court does not require receipts to assess what a reasonable quantum for groceries would be for an average Singaporean household – the universal, shared experience or knowledge of how much bread, milk costs etcetera is needed by an average family and how it is necessary for daily living – means that receipts are not strictly required:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. ([13] of <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     However, where the family in question enjoys a higher standard of living than the average Singaporean family, then for the same type of expense, it can be contemplated that a higher quantum may be reasonable to align with or approximate towards the family’s standard of living, insofar as this is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. There is thus the element of subjectivity that still hews to the requirement of reasonableness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Hence, where more extraordinary expenses are concerned, these should be proven. Even so, the court may find that while such expenses are being incurred, they do not necessarily fall within the ambit of reasonableness. In <em>WLE v WLE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a>, the High Court remarked at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The fact that an item of expenditure has been paid for does not necessarily mean that it is a reasonable expense for which maintenance must be ordered under the Charter: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [9]. Moreover, these payments were made post-divorce and the decision to incur this expenditure is, in my opinion, a unilateral decision of the Husband based on his parenting style. The law does not hold back the Husband from indulging the daughter, but it also cannot compel the Wife to contribute to such indulgence. In the unfortunate breakdown of a family, the question of maintenance is limited Version No 2: 05 Apr 2023 (17:15 hrs) <em>WLE v WLF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a> 15 to a test of reasonableness. Accordingly, the court will only order divorcing parties to pay what is reasonable for the child, and no more. The reasonable expenses of the daughter, as calculated, is $1,941.67 but I will round it to $2,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In the present case, the children’s expenses were certainly not run-of-the mill. The F submitted that the intervention and therapy were not proven to be medically necessary and hence he ought not to pay on them (aside from the fact that he was not consulted).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     While indeed there were no reports produced by the M stating the medical necessity of these interventions, what was available however, were reports speaking of the twins benefitting from such therapy and intervention and the positive progress they had made. The F did not challenge the veracity of such reports nor produce any expert report rebutting the utility of such intervention and therapy for the twins.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The High Court at [67] of <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> observed, a care and control parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">...is in a far better position than [the access parent] to know what will best promote the children’s welfare at any point in time, both in the short-term and for the long-term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The F’s objection grounded on the lack of consultation would have held more sway had he not chosen to deliberately distance himself from the children. Indeed, it appeared that he was determinedly uninvolved in the children’s lives since the consent order in the OSG proceedings was entered into on 10 April 2018 where it had merely provided that the F, a France national, “shall endeavour to visit [the children in France] on an <em>annual</em> basis and have reasonable access” to them. During the proceedings, it emerged that it was the M who had insisted on this clause to ensure he could be involved in the children’s lives. Yet, there was no evidence in the proceedings or rebuttal of the M’s account, that the F had never carried out this thin obligation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Further, no response was forthcoming from the F when the M wrote him a letter seeking specialist intervention for the twins and furnishing him the contact details of various specialists in Singapore; he had also blocked the M on Whatsapp in 2020 to focus on his life in Singapore despite his claim that he was heartbroken upon hearing their diagnosis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The F’s actions – and inaction – made it patently clear that he wanted nothing to do with the twins. In my view, his deliberate failure to exercise his custodial rights means he cannot now rely on those same rights to insist on being consulted on the children’s therapy and intervention before he is made to pay on them. While this Court will not go so far as to suggest there is an estoppel by conduct, it is hard to see how the ends of justice would be served if the M, the sole caregiver of special needs twins, was to be penalised for giving up on engaging the F.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Pertinently, for the F to now raise objections to the children’s therapy, means that if such objections are allowed, the M will have to alter the children’s routines and lifestyles after having single-handedly raised them for the last seven years, devoid of the F’s input. This would indubitably be detrimental to the children’s interests, especially when they have made progress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     All this said, it would be desirable for the F to consider playing a more active role in the children’s lives as he remains their father and the children can only benefit from his care and concern of them. If he had been an absent father before, he can choose to be an active one today which the M stressed she was always desirous of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     Where special needs children are concerned, it is this Court’s view that the element of subjectivity may necessarily have to be take on a broader role while still being subject to the touchstone of reasonableness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     There is no universal definition of ‘special needs’, though the OCED (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) has described this as “…a term used in many education systems to characterise the broad array of needs of students who are affected by disabilities or disorders that affect their learning and development. There is a wide range of policy responses to provide support to students with special education needs.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Indeed, with special needs children, their needs can be varied and multifarious, particularly in terms of the intervention and therapies required. In assessing what is reasonable for a special needs child, it is this Court’s view that the Court can accord <em>greater latitude</em> to the care and control parent in deciding the type of care and therapy the child receives because <em>generally</em>, it will be the care and control parent who is most uniquely placed to understand the child’s needs. This already is the general position (see [77] above) and must apply with greater force where special needs children are concerned, especially where they are uncommunicative or have certain dispositions which only their caregiver understands. The experience of caring for special needs children is less amenable to generalisation and there should be some leeway afforded to the care and control parent’s assessment which may have to take into account even the child’s own subjective preferences and predilections.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     How would this play out? Suppose the following hypothetical. Parties are residing in Singapore and the care and control parent seeks to secure intervention in the UK for their 8-year-old son who is autistic. Objectively speaking, the nature of the intervention and the quantum of the expenses involved would unlikely be reasonable. This is because local intervention is quite readily available.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     What if however, the parties had relocated from the UK to Singapore six months ago and the child had already been undergoing intervention before the family arrived in Singapore whereupon parties’ marriage immediately broke down? The stress of the divorce proceedings has adversely impacted the child and the care and control parent strongly believes that their son needs a familiar environment. Progress in Singapore has also been much slower than in the UK. In these circumstances, the care and control parent’s claim for the expenses incurred in flying the child to the UK for intervention, does not appear <em>wholly</em> unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Of course, the court will also have to consider parties’ financial positions against the total expenses for such intervention, amongst other factors. After all, section 69(4) of the Charter provides that the court “shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In another hypothetical, what if a care and control parent seeks out an experimental therapy or intervention for a condition with no medical opinion evidence of its benefits? In this regard, the court may have to assess the reasonableness of the parent’s belief that the intervention is likely to work on the child and to this end, subjective considerations may be taken into account such as the child’s proclivities and behavioural traits. While an experimental therapy unbacked by clinical trial results may sound like claptrap to one, if a special needs child is refusing conventional therapy and the untested therapy represents a sliver of hope of successful intervention, is it wholly unreasonable to give it a try?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The assessment of what is reasonable for special needs children thus cannot be viewed through a simple, singular lens of whether a particular expense is objectively reasonable in nature or its quantum – what is <em>un</em>reasonable for an average child may be reasonable for a special needs child. For instance, it may be reasonable for a special needs child who is non-verbal or devoid of social skills to undergo animal-assisted therapy. This may not, <em>without more</em>, be reasonable for children who do not have special needs, and the court may be slow to allow for animal-assisted therapy if conventional therapy is available.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     And even as there is the requirement of reasonableness, it should not be forgotten that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The paramount consideration in all proceedings involving children is the welfare of the child. This principle is the “golden thread” that runs through all proceedings directly affecting the interests of children</b>: <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> at [19]). The welfare principle ensures that the children’s interests are not side-lined while their parents litigate over their various disputes. Parental responsibility is crucial in upholding the welfare principle and is a serious<em> legal</em> obligation not to be taken lightly. (at [1] of <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31008-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 1</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     All this said, in assessing the reasonableness of the type of intervention, there must be a modicum of evidence that: (a) such intervention is required; (b) is ongoing and benefitting the child, or (c) has not yet commenced but is likely to benefit the child. Where there is little objective evidence suggesting an intervention’s utility or benefit, the Court may have to be more circumspect in allowing such expenses to be claimed, whilst being sensitive to the fact that the care and control parent is likely to have more insight into what the child requires. The absence or lack of evidence does not necessarily mean the intervention or therapy is unreasonable; its presence <em>generally</em> militates towards its reasonableness, unless the other parent can prove otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     At this juncture, it is apposite to address a frequent contention often raised by payers of maintenance, which is that the care and control parent is artificially inflating expenses. This often rears its head in maintenance, variation and sometimes, enforcement proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Certainly, it is not uncommon for expenses to be inflated and exaggerated in such proceedings. However, to cynically run such an argument in relation to therapy and intervention expenses for a special needs child, ignores the realities of raising and caring for a special needs child and is rather affronting to the care and control parent. Most such parents act in good faith; they genuinely believe in the need for intervention and are anxious for early and successful intervention. Almost always, the care and control parent also bears part of the costs of the intervention and therapy. Such intervention thus comes at a personal cost as well – there is no pecuniary gain from this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     At the same time, it is recognised that there is a wide spectrum of ‘special needs’ in terms of type and severity and one cannot discount the <em>possibility</em> of the care and control parent being overzealous in “diagnosing” or “labelling” their child. That said, an official diagnosis may take too long to obtain and the care and control parent may be acting on little more than one’s parental instincts. The parent should not be prejudiced simply for not producing an official report or memo, but each case ultimately turns on its unique facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     Ultimately, the burden still rests on a parent claiming maintenance (or seeking a variation or enforcement as the case may be) to prove the reasonableness of such expenses and there is no presumption that any therapy or intervention a parent <em>unilaterally</em> decides upon is reasonable for the purpose of claiming or enforcing maintenance for a special needs child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">To what extent should state benefits be considered in assessing maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The benefits received by the M are a financial resource for the M and should be factored into the calculation of maintenance that is needed. However, I do not imagine state supported schemes or benefits to be munificent in the same way that parents themselves can be expected to be with their children. Social welfare benefits usually cater for a baseline standard of living – this is apparent from how <em>none</em> of the state benefits the children receive appear to be dedicated towards therapy or intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     If the benefits the M and the children are receiving appear to be on the high end, this underscores the severity of the children’s disabilities and the M’s predicament as a single mother who is the twins’ sole caregiver. Put another way, it is the unenviability of their situation that allows them to claim this amount of benefits, not that they are enjoying a “comparable or superior standard of living, to what was envisaged by the MO”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     Maintenance is a fundamental, parental responsibility. Government benefits, like any other financial resource (eg. savings, inheritance, donations, sponsorship), do not and should not absolve a parent altogether from paying maintenance. The Court has repeatedly iterated the “equal but differentiated responsibilities” of parents, and the fact that one parent is able to fully financially support a child does not mean that the other parent is then allowed to abdicate his/her responsibility to maintain the child – see <em>AUA v ATZ</em> [2016] 4 SLR 690 at [41] and [45]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[41]  Section 68 states that a parent’s duty is to provide what is “reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life”. This is buttressed by s 69(4) of the Charter, which specifically directs the court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case”, including, among other things, the income and earning capacities of the wife and child in deciding what sum to order in maintenance. Undergirding these provisions is the principle which we would, to borrow an expression from another area of the law, call the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: <b>both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities</b> (see <em>TIT v TIU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> at [61]). The Charter clearly contemplates that parents may contribute in different ways and to different extents in the discharge of their common duty to provide for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[45]  …the welfare of the child was best advanced if both parents played an active role in the upbringing of the child, even if they might not continue to live together. We affirm this principle and we hold that it applies with equal force to the area of material provision<b>. Even if one parent were fully capable of providing for the child’s material needs, it would still be in the best interests of the child, and consistent with the scheme of the Charter as a whole, that the law recognises and enforces the joint responsibility of both parents to maintain the child. This is I keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities</b>…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Court is not the child’s parent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. Neither is any government. To suggest that the government is fully supporting a child and hence maintenance need not be paid, makes a mockery of one’s parental duty and responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Eventual variation of the maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    Given that it was only after the making of the MO that the children were diagnosed with autism, the order ought to be varied such that their special needs can be catered for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The children’s basic living expenses are provided for by the government benefits. The therapy and interventions are the main source of divergence in parties’ estimates. After factoring in the state benefits the M was receiving, the M had a deficit of 738.18 euros according to her estimates, while the F’s estimates yielded a surplus of 1060.56 euros.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    In the present case, it was evident that the therapy the children had been attending was benefitting them. Given the circumstances of the case and how they had been raised by the M single-handedly, I saw no reason to vary the maintenance order to ‘zero’, which would effectively exclude the therapy and intervention expenses, finding that to do so would be inimical to the twin’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Instead, the sum of $1,600 in the MO should be replaced with the sum of $1,091 in total for both children – this is the equivalent of 738.18 euros based on the exchange rate stated on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s website as of 18 June 2025 ($1.4776 to 1 euro). This was to take effect from 25 July 2025 onwards. By addressing this deficit through a reduced sum of maintenance, this ensures that the children’s needs are not compromised whilst at the same time sufficiently taking into consideration the benefits the children are already receiving. I had considered the high-income earning capacity of the F and the children’s standard of living which was adverted to by the judge who issued the MO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I further varied the order to provide for a clause that allows for therapy/intervention options not covered under the MO or by insurance, to be discussed between parties. This was to promote the F’s right as a joint custodial parent. The M readily agreed to such a clause and this was welcomed by Mr Dodwell as well. The F would not be liable to pay on such expenses if he was not consulted but if he was and there was no agreement, he would bear 50% of such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Costs of $1,000 was ordered to be paid by the F to the M for the enforcement application and each party was to bear their own costs for the variation application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Despite their geographical distance and emotional baggage, I hope the F and the M can find a way to coparent and for the F to be involved in his children’s lives.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[35] – [37] of the F’s affidavit of evidence in chief, affirmed on 30 September 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Anandan Krishnan, <em>Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined</em>, Vol. 8, (2008 Ed, Lexis Nexis), p 664.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Charter as of 16 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Black’s Law Dictionary, Chief Editor Bryan A.

In some cases, the parties use incorporated legal entities to carry out the business, while some maintain unincorporated business structures or organisations, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       While the use of the business structures during the marriage is often up to the spouses’ choice (which could be motivated by personal or commercial reasons), how these businesses were dealt with in the context of the ancillary proceedings following the spouses’ divorce may bring about some interesting legal questions, including what parts of these businesses constitutes matrimonial assets and how they ought to be valued. Indeed, these questions may be further complicated when both spouses treated the ownership of the family business informally throughout the marriage. These were some of the issues which the Court had to address when determining the ancillary matters (“AM”) for FC/D 3654/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The present case involves a marriage of approximately 21 years. The Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Wife”) have one daughter, [E], born in 2014. Interim judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was granted to the parties on 7 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the AM proceedings on 24 July 2025 (“AM Hearing”), during which, both parties’ counsel confirmed that the following AM issues were disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the division of matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the maintenance payable to the Wife and [E], post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>There were no live disputes in relation to the [E]’s custody and/or care arrangements as a consent order was recorded as part of the IJ (“Child Care Orders”), and these matters were <em>not</em> adjourned to be determined as part of the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In these grounds of decision, I will first address the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, followed by the Wife’s claim for maintenance for both herself and [E].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial Asset Pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I start by considering the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets (“Matrimonial Pool”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As I had alluded to above, this issue took on some significance in the present proceedings given the manner in which the parties’ managed the family’s business. In particular, the parties had disagreed over the treatment of several key assets, including what the Wife referred to as the Husband’s “Fruit &amp; Vegetable Business”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This is, in fact, a reference to the sole proprietorship business, <em>viz.</em>[EFVT] (“Business”), currently registered in the Husband’s name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It arose, in the course of the AM hearing, that the nature, and valuation, of the Business was a serious point of contention between the parties. At the Wife’s counsel’s request, I directed both counsel to file further written submissions on these matters.

It remained in the Husband’s possession as at the IJ date, and was only sold thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In fairness, the Husband did not challenge the fact that the vehicle was part of the Matrimonial Pool. Instead, the parties mainly disagreed on the value to be ascribed to the said vehicle. The Wife’s case was that a value of “<em>at the very least $100,000</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> should be used, whereas the Husband asked that the vehicle’s actual sale price of $60,000 be adopted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s principal point was that this asset was sold by the Husband at an undervalue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> To substantiate her case, she exhibited screenshots of online car sales listings and websites showing similar vehicle models (ie. Mercedes-Benz GLC 250) where the asking price exceeded $100,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, the asking price for a vehicle as listed on these websites do not necessarily reflect its actual value. Different considerations and factors affect the value of a motor vehicle, including the condition of the vehicle, its detailed technical specifications, and its mileage. The use of screenshots of online platforms as a means of valuation was thus too speculative. I therefore could not agree with the Wife’s arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On the Husband’s part, he provided a sale and purchase agreement with one “RJ Leasing” showing that the car was <em>in fact</em> sold for the sum of $60,000. In the absence of any evidence showing any impropriety with the transaction, I accepted that the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle represented its market value at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For completeness, the Wife also alleged that the Husband had failed to “account” for the sale proceeds was a separate matter he had received. In my view this was a separate matter and was not relevant to question of the asset’s value. In any case, the Husband had clearly indicated that he was prepared to “split” the proceeds with the Wife as part of the division of their matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The question of accountability did not arise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I thus added the amount of $60,000 back into the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Luxury Watches</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The next dispute pertained to the parties’ luxury watches. Their dispute was two-fold: (i) they disagreed on who was holding on to these watches. The Wife claimed that the Husband was holding on to several watches, while the Husband argued that it was the Wife who had held on to them; and (ii) they disagreed at to the value to be ascribed to these watches.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I begin by answering the more important <em>anterior</em> question – <em>ie.</em> how many watches there were in the first place. The parties each took a different position – the Husband claimed that there were two such watches whereas the Wife claimed that there were four. To answer this question, I am ultimately guided by what was in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To support his claim, the Husband provided the sales invoices for two watches purchased from one “[J] Boutique” in December 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These invoices were separately addressed to the Husband and Wife, with the total cost being $34,500 for both watches. The Wife, on the other hand, provided no evidence as to when the other two watches were purchased to substantiate her assertion that there were four watches in total.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the above reason, I found that only two luxury watches (<em>ie.</em> those purchased in 2020) would be part of the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Next, I valued these timepieces at their purchase prices. I did so as there was a lack of clear evidence by both parties as to the watches’ current market value. The only alternative offered by the Wife was to ascribe what she called a “conservative” value of $15,000 per watch.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>However, I declined to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even on its face, the Wife’s approach did not satisfactorily explain why her own watch (purchased for $10,500) would have increased in value by $42%, while the Husband’s watch’s value (purchased at $24,000) would have decreased by 40%, in the same period. As no evidence was tendered to buttress these claims, the Wife’s approach was both speculative and arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Finally, insofar as the possession of the watches was concerned, I am prepared to accept the Wife’s case that, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband had possession of the watches. It was not disputed that the Wife had left the Matrimonial Flat to stay in a shelter in June 2023, and that a personal protection order as well as a CPS safety plan were made to ensure the Wife’s and the Child’s safety shortly thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     During this time, the Husband had sole occupation of the Matrimonial Flat but there was no documented claim that he had lost his Rolex watch until August 2023 (through his solicitors’ letter).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><sup></sup></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Accordingly, given the surrounding circumstances and the inference drawn from the Husband’s contemporaneous conduct at the material time, I found it more likely that the Husband had kept the watches in his possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Cash on Hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife next alleged that the Husband had a habit of keeping a significant amount of cash at home (up to $100,000), in light of the cash-dependent nature of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Her counsel submitted that I should infer that the Husband likely had such an amount of money kept at home at any one time, which ten should be added to the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Having considered the evidence, I was not prepared to find that the Husband had a sum of $100,000 in cash stashed at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife supported her claim by reference to a message sent on 19 September 2022 where reference was made to existence of monies kept at home. In my view, the actual reference in the 19 September 2022 message was vague and unhelpful. The Wife merely mentioned in her message that “[e]<em>ven though you said that whatever amount I wanted, it’s in the drawer, but I know these are hard-earned money…</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> There was no specific description of where the “drawer” was located, nor was there any indication of the amount of money present therein. Importantly, there was also no written response from the Husband to the Wife’s assertion in her message.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Wife submitted that since the Husband did not actively deny this statement <em>made by her</em>, it meant that he acknowledged the truth of her statement. With respect, I am not persuaded that she had discharged her burden to prove this asset’s existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In any case, even if that was true that there was some money in a “drawer” at home <em>in 2022</em>, there was insufficient evidence to justify the Court making an assumption that there was, as at the IJ date (2 years later), the same sum of $100,000 lying at home. It is trite law that what falls within the Matrimonial Pool ought to be determined as at the IJ date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties’ Business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I turn now to address the nature, and relevance, of the Business and its impact on the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     On its face, the parties’ dispute appeared to be over the value which ought to be ascribed to the Business. The Wife claimed that the Business was worth at least $200,000,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>while the Husband submitted there was no market value to the Business whatsoever (although he acknowledged that the Business’ net profits for 2023 were $35,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> She also submitted that the Business must have been a valuable one as a third-party had previously offered to purchase the Business for $150,000 some years earlier.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As noted at [8] above, I had raised my concern to counsel that in light of the Business being a sole proprietorship, it would have had no separate legal personality from the Husband. In such a situation, how did the Wife envisage this “asset” to be divided between the parties?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To put matters in context, the present situation was unlike cases where the spouses’ business vehicle an incorporated entity (such as a private limited company) where what was to be divided in the divorce were the shares they held in the said company. In such cases, the question before the court would be the value <em>of these shares</em> (which are clearly assets they own).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In contrast, as the Business in the present case was a sole proprietorship, the Business’ assets (<em>eg.</em> cash, bank account monies, inventory, etc.) would have already been accounted for as part of the Husband’s <em>personal</em> assets since the Business had no distinct legal personality from the Husband, nor was it capable of holding assets in its own name. It was therefore unclear what the “valuation” which the Wife claimed should be attached to the Business relate to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In response to the Court’s concerns, the Wife’s counsel sought leave for the parties to file further written submissions to address the same. In the Wife’s supplemental submissions, she recrafted her case and argued that the Business would include a measure “goodwill”. The existence of such “goodwill” meant that the Business had some form of intrinsic value, making it an asset divisible pursuant to s 112 of the WC,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> despite being a sole proprietorship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Having considered her counsel’s submissions, I was unable to agree with the Wife’s position. In my view, the Business <em>in the present case</em> was not an independent matrimonial asset which the Court could divide. I will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Distinction between “value” and “asset”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     At the outset, I found it important to draw a conceptual distinction between valuing something (<em>ie</em>. ascribing something with a monetary value) on the one hand, and describing a thing as an asset (in the proprietary sense) on the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     While values can be ascribed to many types of properties or assets, not everything capable of being valued is an “asset” divisible in a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Take, for example, a painter’s ability to paint a picture. Someone may pay a lot of money to commission him to paint, but his painting ability is not an asset in the proprietary sense. <em>If he produces a painting</em>, then it is the painting which is the asset, not his ability to paint. Both can be ascribed a monetary value, but only the painting can be divided as a matrimonial asset in a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As such, while it may be that the Husband’s Business was capable of being valued, in the sense that it is possible for someone (such as the accountant engaged by the Wife) to ascribe a value to this business undertaking, it did not necessarily follow that the Business was <em>ipso facto</em> a type divisible matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In support of her case, the Wife’s counsel cited the High Court (Family Division)’s decision in <em>XEB v XEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32323-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 37</a> (“<em>XEB</em>”) as an example of a case where the court had accepted a sole proprietorship as being an “asset”, and subsequently divided the same between the divorced parties. However, I did not understand the High Court’s judgment in <em>XEB</em> to stand for the legal proposition advanced by the Wife, <em>ie.</em> that a sole proprietorship was by its nature a divisible asset in divorce proceedings. Indeed, the nature of a sole proprietorship as a type of matrimonial asset was not an issue which arose in that case, nor did the High Court specifically discuss the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Moreover, it was not clear from the judgment whether the High Court’s reference to a “sole proprietorship” was a reference to specific assets and properties owned by the sole proprietorship in that case, or to the underlying business itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     If a sole proprietorship owned tangible and/or physical assets, it would not be controversial that these assets could be matrimonial assets capable of division. That, however, was not what the Wife sought to argue here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Goodwill and intangible properties. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     To be clear, it is also uncontroversial that a business can own various types of <em>intangible</em> assets. Some common ones include intellectual property rights, digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies), or even choses in action (such as licensing rights, monies held in bank accounts, etc.). These are assets which <em>can</em> be sold, transferred, disposed-of and thus divisible between the divorcing parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     If a business owns these assets through an incorporated entity (such as a private limited company), then the value of these assets may be taken into account when valuing the shares in the incorporated entity. If such assets are owned by an unincorporated association (such as a sole proprietor), then these asset would have been held in the business owner’s own name and therefore divided as part of that person’s personal assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     “<em>Goodwill</em>” in a business is, arguably, a type of intangible asset since it is a form of property and is capable of being assigned: see <em>New Ping Ping Pauline v Eng’s Noodles House Pte Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26592-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 1317</a> at [127]. For present purposes, I shall assume (without deciding) that a business’ goodwill is capable of being a matrimonial asset although I express some reservations as to how such goodwill may be “divided” in AM proceedings. For example, such an asset would not be capable of any <em>in specie</em> distribution unlike most other forms of matrimonial assets (such as cash, real property, or shares in a company). To avoid doubt, for reasons I will come to at [54(c)] below, the goodwill I am referring to here is the type of goodwill which is attached to (and synonymous with) the <em>business</em>, and not the proprietor running it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On a related note, the Wife’s counsel referred in their written submissions, albeit briefly, to the existence of “<em>repeat clientele, and a proven capacity for profit</em>” as something owned by the Business in the present case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It was not clear whether the Wife was referring to something different from the goodwill of the Business. Be that as it may, no authority or precedent were cited to suggest that these would amount to independent assets of a sole proprietorship which are divisible in a divorce. In my view, these matters – by their nature – would not be capable of being treated as a freestanding asset belonging to the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s arguments, even if accepted, lacked evidential basis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The upshot of the above discussion is that there remains some uncertainty as to whether a business (carried out as a sole proprietorship) is capable of being considered a freestanding asset divisible under s 112(10), WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Nevertheless, even if I was prepared (at least at a conceptual level) to accept that unincorporated businesses may themselves be divisible matrimonial assets so long as they comprise intangible assets (such as goodwill) which are independent from their proprietor’s personal assets and/or property, this would still not bring the Wife’s case very far on the facts of the present case. That is because the Wife had failed to show that the Business, <em>ie.</em> [EFVT], actually owned any such asset for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>First</u>, all the Wife had shown – through her accountant’s affidavit – was that the Business generated sales revenue, profits and loss in the past.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> However, these, in and of themselves, were not assets capable of being divided unless they were traceable to monies contained in the Business’ bank account (which have already been accounted for).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Second</u>, despite making submissions on the relevance of “goodwill” in the Business, the Wife did not provide any actual professional and/or expert report which ascribed a <em>value</em> to the Business’ goodwill specifically. The Business’ estimated net profit was clearly not the same as its goodwill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Indeed, I was doubtful whether the Wife could point to what exactly was the so-called “goodwill” in question given the very nature of the Business (<em>ie.</em> the wholesale of vegetable and fruits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>). The Business had no registered intellectual property rights and/or branding, and there being no evidence to suggest that the Business’ brand or name was what was responsible for generating sales or revenue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The nature of the Husband’s Business was unlike the sort mentioned in the UK Tax Tribunal case of <em>Richard Villar v. The Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs</em> [2019] UKFTT 117 (TC) (<em>“Richard Villar</em>”), a cited by the Wife’s counsel.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In <em>Richard Villar</em>, the appellant doctor had sold his medical practice and the issue before the tax tribunal was whether the sale proceeds therefrom should be considered as a form of capital gain, or it should be considered as taxable income. In reaching its decision, the Tribunal found that Dr Villar had built a practice unlike that of many other surgeons, and that the name <em>“Richard Villar</em>” was capable of attracting customers notwithstanding the fact that not all medical services were provided by Dr Villar himself. There was thus goodwill in the <em>name</em> of the medical practice. That was <em>not</em> the situation in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_f\"></a>(f)     For completeness, I note that in some foreign jurisdictions, a distinction is drawn between the concept of “enterprise goodwill” (which attaches to an entity) and “personal goodwill” (which is associated with a person), with the latter not being capable of division in divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_g\"></a>(g)      <u>Third</u>, the Wife had advanced a case where she characterised herself as was one of the two “bosses” who had built the Business;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> she was well acquainted with the Business having “<em>communicated with customers, suppliers, and the landlord, and personally handled the withdrawal and deposit of funds for business purposes</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This meant that any goodwill associated with the Business may well have vested in her as a form of personal goodwill. How then does one account for what she had brought to the Business over the years?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_h\"></a>(h)      <u>Fourth</u>, the fact that there was an alleged third-party who offered to “purchase” the Business in 2023 was, in my view, of little assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The terms of this alleged offer were not put before the Court and it was unclear what this offer entailed? Did it include the assignment or transfer of rights/liabilities? Would there be any restrictive covenants which the Husband had to give, or was he required to provide his knowhow? These were all important considerations and factors which would affect what was being sold, and the price offered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_i\"></a>(i)     In the absence of any concluded sale and purchase agreement, the Wife’s case that the existence of a previous offer meant that the sole proprietorship was itself an “asset” was too speculative</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In the circumstances, I was not persuaded that a separate value should be ascribed to the Business, other than the Husband’s personal assets which were disclosed and which already formed part of the parties’ Matrimonial Pool (including the Business’ corporate bank account).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     To be clear, that does not mean that the Husband’s knowhow, and his ability to bring in sales and revenue in the fruit and vegetable wholesale business, were wholly irrelevant. These were matters which may be considered as part of the Wife’s maintenance claims, but they do not amount to an asset that was divisible in the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Accordingly, my determination of the parties’ Matrimonial Pool is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 3 – Matrimonial Pool

to discuss the appropriate ratio of division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In this regard, the Wife’s counsel submitted that the structured approach recognised in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (<em>“ANJ</em> approach”) should be used as the Wife was an active income-earner during the marriage, having assisted with the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s counsel, on the other hand, submitted that the trends-based approach (based on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a>) should be applied instead. The Husband argued that this was a long single-income marriage with him being the sole-breadwinner.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The present case was unusual in that throughout the marriage (which spanned some 21 years), most of the parties’ income, wealth and assets came from the Business. In the Husband’s written submissions, he asserted that the Wife was only working “part-time” in the earlier part of the marriage, prior to the birth of their child in 2011.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Insofar as the Business was concerned, I found the following changes to its ownership and structure to be relevant to my assessment as to the nature of the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 19 November 2010, the Business was first registered <em>in the Wife’s</em> name only. This meant she was its sole proprietor at that time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was subsequently added as an owner on 4 May 2012. The Business thus became an unincorporated <em>partnership</em> between the two spouses, and continued to be so until 24 August 2016 when the Husband withdrew from the partnership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From that point, the Wife was, once again, the Business’ sole proprietor until 31 January 2021 when she too withdrew from the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, the Husband was then registered as its sole proprietor/owner on 1 February 2021, and continued to be its proprietor ever since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The above information was clearly set out in the business profile search provided by the Wife. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In light of the above and for the reasons set out at [65] and [80] below, I found the present case to have been a dual-income marriage from 2003 to 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In other words, for a period of 13 years (out of the parties’ 21 years of marriage), the Wife had been working. This included the period of 7 years (from 2003 to 2011) when she worked part-time (based on the Husband’s own submission).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It may be that the parties had their own reasons as to why the Husband was added to and/or withdrawn from the Business over the same period, but given that the parties’ income and wealth came primarily from the Business, and that – in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary – the income from the Business would be attributable to its owner, I agree with the Wife that the <em>ANJ</em> approach ought to be used as the parties were both working and earning from the Business, during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The <em>ANJ</em> approach focuses on giving value to the financial and non-financial contributions made by each of the spouses towards the accumulation of marital wealth, as was the case here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I should add that the Wife’s description of her contributions to the Business in her affidavit,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> including providing accounting and manpower management support, was not challenged by the Husband (who elected <em>not</em> to file any reply affidavit).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To recapitulate, under the <em>ANJ</em> approach, the Court undertakes the following analytical steps:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>first</em>, ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s <u>direct contributions</u> having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>second</em>, ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s <u>indirect contribution</u> to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>third</em>, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court derives each party’s <u>average</u> percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)     make further adjustments (if needed) to the parties’ average percentage contributions to take into account <em>inter alia</em> any issues of adverse inference, or the other facts enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     As neither party had asked the Court to adopt any other methodology to classify the matrimonial assets, I used the “global assessment” methodology (as noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>NK v NL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0743.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743</a>) where a single division ratio applies to all of the parties’ matrimonial assets globally.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Financial Contribution Ratio </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I will now address the ratio of the parties’ direct financial contribution (“DFC”) in the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In this regard, the Wife urged this Court to assign a 50:50 apportionment to the parties’ DFC. This was on account of her view that the “<em>parties’ assets are all acquired using the</em> [Business’] <em>monies”.</em> I did not agree with her argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For reasons personal to themselves, the parties chose to have certain assets vested in each of their own names during the marriage. There was no clear evidence as to which asset was purchased by which spouse during which period of the marriage. The Wife acknowledged, in her own affidavit, that the Husband had kept the cash profit from the business. This would include the periods when she was the registered sole proprietor or partner of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In my view, it would not be appropriate for the Wife – having herself advocated the use of the <em>ANJ</em> approach – to then seek a determination of the parties’ DFC ratio through the use of broad-based assertions which disregarded the <em>actual</em> direct contributions or payments each party had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Accordingly, each party’s sole-named assets (such as bank account/CPF monies, etc.) would be used as a proxy for his or her respective direct contributions to the marriage: see <em>WFE v WFF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/30302-SSP.xml')\">[2023] 1 SLR 1524</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     As regards the Matrimonial Flat, it was undisputed that the said property was fully paid up through monies from the parties’ CPF accounts and in cash. The parties’ respective CPF-based payments and/or transfers towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat were set out in the Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and these were <em>not</em> challenged by the Wife in her reply affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     With regard to the parties’ cash contributions, I agreed with the Wife that, in the absence of any clear evidence provided by the Husband, the cash payments over the years – amounting to $152,404.15 – would have been paid out from the profits of the Business. Given that the Wife remained an owner of the Business at the material time, this amount should be apportioned equally between the two spouses in recognition of the work she would have done for the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Overall, the parties’ direct contributions to the Matrimonial Flat would be as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 4 – Matrimonial Flat</u></b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"29.1741651669666%\"><col width=\"22.9154169166167%\"><col width=\"20.8358328334333%\"><col width=\"27.0745850829834%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Asset</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CPF Monies</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$207,675.85 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$59,920.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">DA1 at [9] and [21]</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Cash</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$76,202.08</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$76,202.07</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$152,404.15, apportioned 50:50</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Sub-total</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$283,877.93</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$136,122.07</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total purchase price of $420,000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Ratio</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>67.59%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>32.41%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>This ratio would then be used to apportion the Matrimonial Flat’s current value (of $605,000) between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In ascertaining the parties’ contributions paid using CPF monies, I used the <em>principal</em> amount withdrawn, and not the total refundable amount.

id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Having determined the parties’ DFC, I now move on to consider their indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect Contribution Ratio (“IDC”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     When determining the parties’ IDC, the case law is clear that the Court does “<em>not</em> [indulge] <em>in a rigid and mechanistic calculation exercise</em>” and would instead adopt what is often referred to as a “broad-brush” approach.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> This means that the Court focuses on “<em>broad factual indicators such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> rather than going into the minute aspects of the parties’ family life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> This is especially so given that the parties’ marriage here spanned more than 2 decades.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In broad terms, I accepted the Wife’s claim that the parties’ respective roles were that the Husband would be the principal (although not sole) breadwinner through his knowledge and expertise in the fruit and vegetable wholesale industry. The main business vehicle they had used to earn the family’s income is the Business. The Wife, on the other hand, took on more home-making and childcare responsibilities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> while continuing to provide accounting, manpower and customer-related support services in furtherance of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> This was the arrangement for a significant period of the marriage up until 2023 (which was after the breakdown of the marriage due to the Wife’s discovery of the Husband’s latest extra-marital affair).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Overall, while the Husband’s indirect contributions were mainly financial in nature, the Wife made significantly more indirect non-financial contributions. I also took into account the Wife’s contributions and efforts in conceiving (through difficult procedures such as <em>in-vitro</em> fertilisation),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> raising, and caring for their daughter, [E].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     For completeness, I did not accept the Wife’s argument that the Husband’s conduct had risen to the level where a <em>negative</em> contribution value ought to be ascribed to him. The precedents cited by her counsel – such as <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17048-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 195</a> – involved far more egregious conduct. The Wife’s own submissions recognised the high bar before a negative contribution would be ascribed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> I found that the Wife’s allegations, founded on the Husband’s philandering and other behaviour, did not meet the requisite threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     However, I did not disregard the Wife’s steadfast and stoic tolerance of the Husband’s unsavoury behaviour, and her continued care of the home and their child in difficult circumstances. Instead, I factored these considerations in when assessing the appropriate IDC ratio.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Overall, adopting a broad-brush approach, I found it reasonable to ascribe an indirect contribution ratio of 70:30, in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adverse Inference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     I move on now to the issue of adverse inference. The Wife submitted that a 5% adjustment (or “uplift”) should be made to account for the adverse inference which should be drawn against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Wife’s main point was that the Husband had been less than candid with his assets, and had concealed the true extent of his wealth. According to the Wife, the Husband’s claim that he was merely an <em>employee</em> of one [JS] Pte Ltd (“JSPL”) should not be believed, and that, in truth, he was using JSPL as a means to divert matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Her assertions and claims were set out in her counsel’s written submissions. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     I agreed with the Wife’s counsel that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband. In addition to the points raised in the Wife’s submissions (which I broadly accepted), I make the following observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found the overall tenor of the Husband’s case (and arguments he advanced) to be inconsistent with what the evidence showed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Husband claimed to be a vegetable seller (earning an income of $2,500 per month) and a delivery driver (earning another $1,400 per month), I agreed with the Wife that his expenditures and the amount of money he had deposited into his bank accounts were not consonant with a person earning only $3,900 per month. Despite the alleged modest income, the Husband was able to purchase and drive a car (of a luxury make and model), purchase expensive luxury watches, and indeed, fully paid off his property several years after its purchase, while at the same time, claimed to be main person responsible for paying all of the family’s finances. None of these would have been possible if he had only earned $3,900 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_c\"></a>(c)     More importantly, it was highly suspicious that his alleged employer, JSPL, was wholly owned by one [WY],<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> whom the Wife alleged that [WY] was the Husband’s romantic partner. What was more concerning (and telling) was that the documents showed that [WY] <em>was also the Husband’s employee.</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s affidavit disclosed CPF records showing the Business paying CPF contributions for its “employees”, one of whom was [WY].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_d\"></a>(d)     This entire corporate structure/arrangement was thus highly suspicious to say the least. Moreover, the monetary transactions between the Husband and JSPL were also highly questionable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For example, the Husband received a sum of $15,000 on 29 April 2024 which he claimed to be payment for the supply of vegetables to his client.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> But this so-called “client” was shown to be JSPL, which the Husband declared was his alleged <em>employer</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_f\"></a>(f)     How did the Husband’s employer end up becoming his client? The Husband failed to provide any clear explanation for this highly anomalous situation. Moreover, JSPL’s listed business activities in its business registration were for “<em>general cleaning services</em>” which would have ostensibly nothing to do with the Husband’s Business, involving the supply and purchase of vegetables.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_g\"></a>(g)     All these suspicious circumstances and transactions put together supported the Wife’s claim that there was a <em>prima facie</em> case of concealment of assets for which the Husband did not provide any reasonable justification for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I therefore found that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband, and would thus include a 5% uplift (under the uplift method recognised in <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a>) in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     For completeness, 5% of the parties’ matrimonial assets amount to approximately $49,000. This sum was approximately equivalent to 1 year of the Husband’s declared salary of $3,900 per month. I found this to be a reasonable estimate of the amount which would have been concealed by the Husband between 2023 (when the Wife remained involved, albeit tangentially with the Business,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> and the IJ date of 7 February 2024)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In the circumstances,

70% of the parties’ total assets. Although I did not award her that proportion, I nevertheless gave her an opportunity to retain the property upon payment of the Husband’s share of the assets by making the appropriate orders for her to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the Wife and Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     I now move on to the next area of contention, <em>ie.</em> whether the Wife was entitled to claim from the Husband maintenance for herself, post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     In this regard, it is trite law that the power to order maintenance for an ex-wife is supplementary to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> and the Court will consider how much each party will receive from the division of their matrimonial assets as one relevant factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     In the present case, the Wife would be receiving a significant proportion (approx. 56%) of the parties’ matrimonial assets under my division orders. It was also not disputed that the Wife was gainfully employed as an office worker earning a salary of approx. $1,550.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     While this amount appears low compared to the standard of living which she was accustomed to during the marriage, it is well established law that a post-divorce maintenance order is not meant to provide a “meal ticket for life” nor should it create a life-long dependency.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Ultimately, the Wife is expected to exert herself, and to earn as much as reasonably possible.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> It was for this reason that I did not accept the Wife’s argument that the appropriate maintenance order in the present case should be “<em>forward-looking, calibrated to ensure the wife’s long-term financial security…</em>”, nor should the order provide a “<em>buffer for retirement planning and contingencies</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> These factors were, in my view, <em><u>not</u></em> the purpose of a post-divorce maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Overall, I found it appropriate to order the Husband to provide a sum of $500 per month for a period of 3 years (or $18,000 in total).

expenses, the focus was on the appropriate budget to be provided: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [10] and [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Further, in <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a> (at [50] of its judgment), the High Court (Family Division) aptly noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">50    In my view, <b>a child’s reasonable needs are not determined solely by the financial capabilities of its parents</b>. The focus of the enquiry should be on whether the expense itself is needed for each child. <b>Although wealthy parents may indulge their children beyond what they reasonably need, they can expend the largesse at their pleasure</b>. The court is only concerned with what a child in the circumstances reasonably needs. In this connection, the full expenses of a tertiary education at an overseas institution are not reasonable expenses that parents should be mandated to pay for — simply on the basis that they can afford it. Instead, they are luxury expenses that parents can choose to indulge their children in. A much more reasonable expense is the costs related to tertiary education at a local university or a portion thereof. Furthermore, there is no reason why children who wish to pursue an overseas education cannot take on some responsibility for their decision, for instance by either off-setting some of their unnecessary expenses, obtaining scholarships, grants, and student loans, or contributing to their own expenses by working part-time. Children should not simply expect their parents to provide for every desire.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    Accordingly, when considering [E]’s expenses, I made the following adjustments to the Wife’s claim:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found the amounts provisioned by the Wife for [E]’s school allowance, eating out, public transport, and clothing to be very high, and possibly duplicative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For example, school allowance at $440 per month would translate to $22 per school day (<em>ie.</em> 5 school days a week) for a 11-year-old child. Yet, there was an <em>additional amount</em> of $500 per month provisioned for “eating out”. I thus scaled down these expenses to what would be reasonable amounts having regard to [E]’s age and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_c\"></a>(c)     [E]’s transport costs were similarly exorbitant. The claim of $100 per month puts her costs at the same quantum as the Wife’s own transport claim. It was apparent from the Wife’s own summary, that her claim was for “<em>Public transport (Ez-link/SimplyGo)</em>”. These were references to the stored value and/or transport cards used for public trains and buses in Singapore. However, as a school student, [E] would be eligible for concession fares on these modes of transportation. These would cost a fraction of what the Wife has claimed. There was no reason why the Wife should not take steps to use these cheaper means of transportation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I move on to the claim for Tuition classes, which represented the largest claim by quantum (<em>ie.</em> $1,580 per month). The Wife, in her counsel’s submissions, argued that [E]’s expenses were “<em>supported by itemised tables and receipts</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> That, in itself, meant little. As the High Court (Family Division) held in <em>WBU v WBT</em> [2023] SGHCF, “[t]<em>he mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render such expenses reasonable expenses for the purposes of determining maintenance.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_e\"></a>(e)     I was not persuaded that the Wife had justified these tuition expenses. There was no evidence provided as to [E]’s grades in school, any report on how she was doing, and whether she required tuition to help with her learning and development objectives. It was not enough to simply claim that there were tuition expenses. The <em>need</em> for these expenses had to be established. Moreover, even based on the actual payment vouchers exhibited, it was not clear that entire sum of $1,580 <em>per month</em> had been shown to be incurred.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> For example, the Math, English and Chinese tuition classes for May 2024 added up to only $670 based on the receipts provided. That was significantly less than the amount claimed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Overall, I allocated a <em>budget</em> of $500 per month, which the Wife (as the care parent) could make use of to match and assess [E]’s educational needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Finally, for holiday expenses, I found this item to be a purely item of luxury given that it was meant to be holidays to visit the Wife’s family members in Malaysia. Moreover, a sum of $400 <em>per month</em> was clearly an excessive amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Overall, I found [E]’s reasonable expenses (including her share of the household expenditure) to be approximately $2,000 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    I thus ordered the Husband to contribute a sum of <u>$1,600 per month</u> as the [E]’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In reaching this amount, I took into account the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I did not accept that the Husband’s actual monthly income and earning capacity to be only $3,900 as he had alleged. For the reasons set out above, I found that he was able to earn at least <em>twice</em> that amount from the Business (including the control and influence he wields over JSPL). I had alluded to the Husband’s earning capacity and his know-how and abilities at [56] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This meant that his income/earning capacity would make up approximately 80% of the parties’ combined income. I thus found it reasonable to apportion [E]’s expenses in proportion to the parties’ income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    Finally, I decided not to make any orders in relation to the reimbursement of [E]’s medical fees or for a blanket order relating to her future university education. I found neither to be necessary at this stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    I had already provisioned a monthly budget for medical and dental expenses. There was no evidence that [E] suffered from any specific long-term or special medical condition which necessitated an <em>ad hoc</em> medical expenses reimbursement order. As for university education, I found that claim to be wholly speculative at the present juncture. There is still almost one decade more before [E] enters university, and that is a matter which can be addressed through subsequent applications, if the need arises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In the premises, I set out below a summary of my final AM orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of Matrimonial Flat</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I gave the Wife the option to acquire the Husband’s share of the parties’ Matrimonial Flat by giving him written notice within 1 month from the date of my order. If the Wife chose to do so, she should pay the Husband an amount of $169,939.81 (equivalent to 28% of the market value of the Matrimonial Flat), and the Husband would have to transfer her his interests in the Matrimonial Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Alternatively, if the Wife elected not to purchase the Husband’s share, then the parties shall have joint conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat in the open market within 6 months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment, at or above the sale price of $605,000, (or such other price as the parties may agree in writing).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The proceeds of sale of the Matrimonial Flat should then be divided in the proportion of 72 (Wife): 28 (Husband), after paying all the relevant payments, costs and expenses required by the relevant authorities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I also included additional orders to address the parties’ obligation to make refunds to their CPF accounts, and what to do if there were shortfall in the amount refunded, or where one party receives more refunds than what he or she was entitled to under the division order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of Other Matrimonial Assets</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Each party shall retain all the other assets in their sole name and possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Maintenance for the Plaintiff</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband must pay to the Wife lump-sum maintenance in the sum of $18,000. I gave the Husband the option of paying this amount in $500 monthly instalments for a period of 36 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Maintenance for the Child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Husband shall pay to the Wife maintenance for the child of the marriage, [E], in the sum of $1,600 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Other Orders</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_h\"></a>(h)     I also included a Registrar’s empowerment clause to allow the Registrar and/or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts to execute or sign documents should either party fail to do.

A unique feature of this matter lay in the applicant’s pursuit of the fullest possible extent of backdated maintenance for the two children, despite the respondent’s assertions that he had no knowledge of being their biological father until <em>after</em> a paternity test – commissioned after the commencement of the child maintenance proceedings – put the issue to bed. The issue of the respondent’s prior knowledge was therefore relevant to the question of just <em>when</em> his neglect to provide reasonable maintenance for the children properly arose, and in any event, whether on the facts of the case, the Court ought to order maintenance for the children on a backdated basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I first set out some brief facts. The applicant worked as a regional sales manager. The respondent was a businessman who ran corporate interests in Singapore and Malaysia, and who was married with two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The applicant had started working in the respondent’s company in 2011. In the subsequent years, the parties had a relationship. During this period, the applicant gave birth to two children, who were born in Oct 2016 and May 2022 (“the children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties’ relationship ended in 2023. It was undisputed that the applicant left the respondent’s company in June 2023, although their accounts differed as to why – he said it was because she had diverted business away. She said it was because of her finding out about his affair with another colleague.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In February 2024, it was alleged that the applicant contacted the respondent’s wife, informing her that she had had two children with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 28 March 2024, the applicant commenced her application for child maintenance for the two children. To clarify the issue of paternity, the parties underwent paternity testing, which confirmed on 23 August 2024 that the respondent was the biological father of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The matter went through a somewhat lengthy pre-trial stage involving discussions over the paternity testing and several rounds of voluntary disclosure. By the time of the trial, the key issue to be addressed pertained only to whether an order of maintenance should be made and if so, the nature of that order. In this regard, the applicant had sought the maximum amount of backdated maintenance in relation to both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Another issue was on reimbursement for the cost of the paternity testing. The applicant’s position was for the respondent to bear the entire cost of the paternity test as he had challenged paternity in the first place. On the other hand, the respondent sought for the costs to be shared regardless of the outcome, on the basis that both parties equally required the results.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Children’s Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I started with the issue of maintenance for the children. The applicant sought $6,000 per month as maintenance for both children. Further, she sought for the Court to backdate the maintenance payments: for the elder child (“the daughter”), the backdating was to start from 1 April 2021, being the maximum period of three years prior to the time of the application; for the younger child (“the son”), the backdating was to start from May 2022, being the period from the son’s birth to the time of application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The respondent did not dispute that he should pay maintenance. However, his final proposal was to pay $2,517.34 to $2,936.89 a month for the children, and for the backdating to start only from March 2024, when the application was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The relevant provision, being section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter, provides that the Court may make an order for reasonable maintenance where there is due proof that a respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for a child. In making such an order, the Court must first be satisfied that the applicant has discharged the burden of proving that the respondent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. To determine if this legal threshold is satisfied, the Court must first determine what the monetary amount of “reasonable maintenance” is, on the facts of the case. The Court takes a “practical approach” to assess if the parties had reasonably provided such maintenance (<em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [44]-[45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Leaving aside my consideration of the parties’ respective means and incomes for the time being, I considered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The amount that would constitute reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether there was neglect or refusal to provide such reasonable maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The amount of maintenance that should be ordered for the respondent to pay, including the question of backdated maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasonable Maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I first set out my assessment of the reasonable expenses of the children in the tables below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 1: Children’s monthly reasonable

The applicant’s counsel submitted that this was “commonly known as the <em>Browne v Dunn</em> rule”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The rule in <em>Browne and Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 is a common rule of evidence from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was true that the respondent’s counsel had not cross-examined the applicant on her estimated figures for most of the line items in her list of expenses, and of the estimates pertaining to the children’s expenses. However, this did not lead to the ineluctable conclusion that the applicant’s estimates should be adopted by the Court as incontrovertible. Ultimately, the Court must come to its own view on what was a reasonable expense for each line item, based on all the circumstances. In a related vein, it is trite that even if the applicant’s expenses were undisputed, or proven to be actual expenses, this did not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that they were necessarily reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In any event, the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> is rooted in fairness at trial. The stringency of application must surely depend on the context. This case occurred in the context of maintenance – specifically, during the exercise of ascertaining the monthly expenses based on parties’ reasonable estimates of various line items. In this context, there had been joinder in relation to most of the line items; the issue was what the value for each line item should be. The aim of the exercise was to assist the Court in ascertaining the reasonable expense to be assigned to a given line item, and it was clear to all concerned that both parties had come to trial with their respective estimates, of which some were accepted but others of which were disputed. The fact that the applicant’s estimates were not contested by the respondent’s counsel at trial, would not mean, without more, that the respondent’s estimates on the same line items ought then to be rejected in favour of the applicant’s estimates. Indeed, the applicant’s counsel went on to cross-examine the respondent on his competing estimates of the same line items. In the circumstances, I did not think there was any unfairness at trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I would also explain that in arriving at the Court’s assessment of the children’s reasonable expenses, I had, where appropriate, given more weight to the applicant’s estimates, for the simple reason that she was in a better position to understand the children’s expenses – it was undisputed that the respondent had never lived with her and the children. The applicant had also provided some receipts for various expenses. That being said, the law does not require every specific item of expense to be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise (see <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> at [13]). It followed that even if every item of expense was somehow proved, “the mere fact that one party shows that such expenditure was made does not automatically render that expenditure reasonable in the context of determining maintenance”: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On the whole, I found that some estimates of the applicant were higher than what would have been reasonable in the circumstances, and I had pared them down in exercising my discretion. On the applicant’s own case, she had had limited means – to the extent of having to borrow to make ends meet. Her evidence was that she took home about $2,400 a month, but the total of her estimated personal expenses and the children’s expenses was hitting $14,000 a month – close to six times more. In this regard, the Court heard that the applicant’s own evidence was that her personal financial circumstances had worsened, such that she was taking loans from her credit line “to finance her monthly expenses”, and obtaining money from friends and even the respondent’s relatives, who she was apparently acquainted with and had given her “some money”. Given that this apparently parlous situation had existed, on her own evidence, for some years, she would have been spending beyond her means, the implication being that there should be, or should have been, room for more sustainable budgeting. As explained below, I did find that the applicant’s means was probably higher than what her income from her full-time job would have suggested. Even then, I still found that her estimated expenses were too high in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In considering the standard of living that the children should reasonably enjoy, I gave some consideration to the principle that that parties were to bear their own expenses when spending on luxuries (see <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a>). This was especially the case where the respondent had never lived with the applicant and the children, and on the evidence of both parties, maintenance had never been given by him for the children’s upkeep, which would therefore have had been solely based on the applicant’s efforts. Having heard the evidence, I did accept that the respondent was a <em>potential</em> provider of some means, but he was neither a <em>past</em> nor <em>present</em> provider. Intuitively, there was some resonance to the suggestion that a father ought to maintain the children similarly to how he had been maintaining the children from his marriage. However, direct comparisons with the expenses of his own family could only go so far, as every family situation was different, and the ages and stages of life of the children were also different.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Neglect to make reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having established the reasonable expenses of the children as $5,165.46, the question was whether there had been neglect or refusal to pay reasonable maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The applicant bore the burden to prove neglect. As the applicant’s counsel pointed out, on the respondent’s own case, he had never paid maintenance for the children. It was also the applicant’s position that the respondent had never maintained the children. In the premises, I agreed with the applicant’s submission that whatever the amount of reasonable maintenance, the respondent would have neglected to make that amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the respondent knew he was the biological parent before the application was made in March 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     However, the question in this case was precisely <em>when</em> the neglect arose. This implicated the question of when the respondent knew that he was the father to the children – was it before the application was made in March 2024?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The duty of parents to maintain their children is clearly set out in section 68 of the Women’s Charter. The duty of a parent to maintain a child is rooted in biological fact – a parent should, without more, care for his or her own flesh and blood, where the child is unable to fend for himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, knowledge is nevertheless relevant in deciding the question of whether there had been neglect of the duty to maintain the child under section 69. The elements of “neglect” or “refusal” suggests that some species of knowledge or intention is necessary in the omission to provide reasonable maintenance, and it would seem unreasonable to hold a parent as liable for neglect if he had not even been aware that he was the parent of a child. The touchstone for the conduct of the parties is reasonableness: <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [58]. Where it is unclear if a parent had knowledge of his status as a biological parent, it might not be reasonable to hold that he had neglected to make reasonable maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In this regard, the applicant had adduced various pieces of evidence. I had examined them. Whether taken alone or together, they did not lead to the finding that on the balance of probabilities, the respondent possessed the requisite knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     First, there were some photographs of the respondent with the daughter, and one photo with the son. On the photographs with the daughter, these included the respondent posing with her at a hotpot restaurant on her birthday, ostensibly in Oct 2022, and images of the respondent carrying her in a mall, and accompanying her to the zoo. In my view, those photographs were at the highest, piecemeal indications that the respondent had held himself out as a parent. It should be noted that the parties were in a relationship until June 2023, and it would not have been unusual for him to tend to the children as part and parcel of his relationship with the applicant, especially when they were going out. There appeared to be no photographs after the parties’ relationship ended in June 2023. While the respondent might have suspected that he was a parent to the daughter, that would not rise to the requisite level of knowledge that he was the biological parent. In short, multiple inferences might be drawn from the photographs, of which the inference that the respondent had acknowledged the daughter as his biological daughter was only one of them. It was the same analysis for the lone photograph of the respondent with the infant son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I next turned to the exchange of text messages in June 2023 – when the parties’ relationship was on the rocks. This was arguably stronger evidence in support of the applicant’s case. As the applicant’s counsel pointed out, the applicant had asked the respondent to “please ensure the transfer of the child’s expenses of $3,000 to my account on time every 1<sup>st</sup> of the month. You have not done so for this month – please do so quickly!” The respondent’s response was simply to ask the applicant not to be so “extreme”. There was no denial. This would appear to be suggestive that the respondent had at least assumed responsibility as the parent to at least one of the children. As the applicant’s counsel highlighted, the respondent’s explanations of the exchange of messages were dubious – I attached no weight to them and found that the explanations in fact damaged his general credibility as a witness. However, there remained the question of which child was being referred to in the message, and whether that meant that the status of the other child was in question. Moreover, at trial, the parties were content with the position that the respondent had never provided maintenance for the children in the first place – this limited the inferences that might have been drawn from that message.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Critically, there was also evidence that pointed the other way. The most significant of this evidence was the statutory declaration that had been made by the applicant. In this case, the applicant had made a statement in 2016 that the daughter’s “biological father who is of Malaysia Nationality is no longer in contact with me. His name and whereabouts are unknown”. Given that a statutory declaration is a statement made to declare something to be true, absent any proof that the applicant had lied in the statutory declaration, it must be assumed that the applicant was stating the truth in the statutory declaration, which she tendered to HDB in 2020 as part of her request to buy a resale flat while retaining two private residential properties in Malaysia. This declaration was known to the respondent at the material time. It should also be noted that it was undisputed between the parties that the applicant did have a Malaysian boyfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     For completeness, I had also considered evidence such as the respondent having passed an “ang pow” to the daughter in June 2023, and the respondent forwarding information on direct school admissions in May 2023 to the applicant. But whether taken singly or together, having weighed the totality of the evidence, I found that the burden of proof had not been crossed insofar as proving that the applicant had the requisite level of knowledge that he was the biological father of both children. By extension, the applicant had not proven that there had been neglect to provide reasonable maintenance in the period preceding the application. It was likely that the applicant had suspected that he was the parent to one or even both children, but that was in any event not tantamount to actually having knowledge or positively acknowledging that he was their father, with all the attendant responsibilities of providing of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In any event, I also found that there was insufficient evidence of reasonable communication, which was necessary to establish neglect. One way that the Court can consider “reasonableness” is whether one party had reasonably communicated the child’s needs or expenses to the other part. In this regard, the courts have held that the alleged non-paying party “must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses” (<em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [48]). Consonant with the finding that there was insufficient evidence of knowledge on the respondent’s part that he was the parent to the children, there was insufficient evidence of reasonable communication from the applicant to the respondent in relation to maintenance required for the children’s purported expenses, whether basic or otherwise. In her testimony, the applicant had said: “Over the past 9 years, he did not give us any amount allowance (<em>sic</em>).” Against this rather lengthy period, there was a paucity of evidence that requests for maintenance had been made. As mentioned above, while there was an exchange of text messages on the applicant purportedly asking the respondent to pay $3,000 a month for the child, there was a limit to the conclusions that might be drawn from that isolated exchange. In the event that I were wrong, I had taken the view that any backdating of maintenance should only be as far back as the time of filing the application – this will be discussed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having found that the respondent had neglected to pay reasonable maintenance from the time of application, the question remained as to the quantum that the respondent ought to be ordered to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The law is clear that both parties have an equal responsibility to provide for the children although their precise obligations may differ based on their means and capacities: <em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [36].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In this regard, I had reviewed the evidence and submissions of the parties’ respective income, means and assets. The respondent’s take-home salary was $5,438. In terms of the respondent, the respondent’s counsel submitted that as a company director, the respondent’s salary was “heavily dependent” on the company’s performance – and the company was loss-making. Further, the respondent had had to resort to borrowing from the banks and friends to fund his business expenditures and living expenses, with over $250,000 in debt to friends and family, and total debts and liabilities of over $2.3m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Nevertheless, I agreed with the applicant’s counsel’s submission that the respondent was a man of means, notwithstanding the purportedly poor financial state of his businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, and his apparent debts. He had higher financial means than what his income suggested. For example, while the respondent had claimed that he had taken various loans, some of them appeared to be friendly loans, in the sense that he was not subject to strict repayment timelines and other terms. An example would be a purported loan from the respondent’s wife, and another loan from his mother-in-law. It followed that the respondent’s financial situation was not as precipitous as he had suggested. While I was persuaded that he did have certain formal liabilities with financial institutions, the preponderance of the evidence suggested that the respondent had enjoyed a significant degree of free play and flexibility in managing his incomings and outgoings, through his ability to access both his personal and corporate accounts. It followed that even if he was in a net negative position, he was more likely than not, able to raise and rustle up sums of monies when the need occasioned. He had a demonstrated ability to finance his not-inconsiderable expenditure, whether through borrowings or otherwise. I therefore accepted the submission of the applicant’s counsel that “notwithstanding the alleged shortfall in his income to meet his expenses, and the alleged loans taken out… he has been able to pay down the alleged loans as and when he needed to”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The respondent’s counsel submitted that the respondent had been “struggling to make ends meet without sacrificing the lifestyle enjoyed by his family”. I accepted that the respondent had two older children from his marriage in their mid-teens, who were likely to incur more expenses as they progressed to tertiary education in the coming years. However, I based my findings on current finances. In any event, he had a duty to maintain <em>all</em> his biological children. Even if he had to make further changes to his lifestyle to support the maintenance payments, he would need to do so. Moreover, in relation to his family, the respondent had stated on affidavit that he had seven people living in his residence, and the expenses were borne by both him and his wife. This at least suggested that his wife was able to bear some of his financial load insofar as this pertained to the financial aspects of his married life. It did not appear that his in-laws were totally bereft of financial means as well, such that they required his full support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In relation to the applicant, the Court heard that the applicant’s financial situation had worsened over the past several years, suffering two distinct drops in salary to the present amount of $3,000 a month (take-home $2,399). Further, the applicant’s counsel submitted that unlike the respondent, the applicant did not have other sources of income from which she could draw from as and when necessary. While the applicant had set up a sole proprietorship, the applicant’s counsel submitted that any additional income was “ad hoc”, and not sufficient, stable, nor predictable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I found that the applicant was of a weaker financial standing than the respondent. However, I was of the view that the applicant’s financial means was likely to be more than her income suggested. The respondent’s counsel pointed out that her personal bank account showed inflows and outflows of money to the tune of thousands of dollars every month. What I noted was that the applicant, at the relatively younger age of 39, had significant earning capacity. Besides running a business on top of her salaried employment, she appeared to have – or had – properties in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. And while her tenant broke lease in September 2023, she might be able to rent out a room for more income. Based on the statements from her Business Growth Account, while the applicant said that the transfers made to her personal account were withdrawn in cash for payment to suppliers, it appeared that that was not always the case, as there appeared to have been withdrawals made at a toy shop and eateries. In any event, the applicant had also confirmed that she could be flexible with her personal expenses as long as the children were provided for – suggesting that she had some free play and flexibility as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Bearing in mind all the above considerations, I decided to use a rough and ready proxy for apportionment, as based on the stated monthly incomes – at 70:30 as between the respondent and the applicant. The figures had been adjusted slightly from about 69:31. I thought this would be fair. With the reasonable maintenance being $5,165.46, and applying the ratio, the respondent ought to be paying $3,616 a month (rounded down to $3,600). Having reviewed the expenses of both the respondent and the applicant, I was of the view that this apportionment would fall within their respective means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Backdated maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As mentioned above, in terms of backdating maintenance, I backdated only as far back as the time of the application in March 2024. The parties relied on <em>Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor</em> [2014] SGHC 185, where the High Court set out a list of factors to be considered in determining of backdated maintenance. There are overlaps in terms of the intent behind these factors, and I considered these factors in the light of the facts and circumstances. The applicant did not file for maintenance until March 2024, even though the daughter and the son were born in 2016 and 2022 respectively. Why she did not do so was therefore of critical importance. In this regard, among other explanations, the applicant’s counsel submitted that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, when the applicant was earning $10,000 to $12,000 at the respondent’s company, she was in a position to pay for the children’s expenses singlehandedly, and therefore did not need the assistance of the respondent. However, she subsequently suffered drops in salaries and changes of circumstances, such that she had to make the present application. The applicant’s counsel highlighted that the timeframe for backdated maintenance – for up to three years prior to March 2024 – aligned with the timeframe of the applicant’s first drop in salary, from $10,000 to $12,000, to $5,000 to $6,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I did not discount the struggles of a single mother having to bring up two children. However, having reviewed the evidence, it did not appear that she was in that tight of a financial bind between March 2021 and March 2024, compared to the period thereafter. For the most part, save for nine months between June 2023 and March 2024, her salary was still at $5,000 to $6,000 a month. The son was not born until May 2022, so her financial burden would not have had significantly increased until then. It appeared that the applicant’s financial situation became much more of an issue only from the time her relationship with the respondent ended, culminating in her departure from his company in June 2023. Indeed, it was telling that her request to the respondent for $3,000 for the child took place then – the Court had not seen evidence of earlier requests of such money. The applicant was unemployed from June to October 2023, but she nevertheless had the benefit of a lease until September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     However, I did find that her financial needs continued to worsen thereafter – this was supported by evidence that she had taken out loans more recently. For example, she claimed to have borrowed $1,500 from her friend to repay her car loan in June 2024. The applicant’s counsel also highlighted her bank loans, which were reflected in the DBS Cashline statements from 2024. On the whole, it appeared that the need for child maintenance became more acute from the time that she left the respondent’s company in June 2023. This would have eventually prompted her to make the application in March 2024. Her sole proprietorship was also set up in June 2023 – while this might be seen as a new revenue source, it might also be inferred that she saw the need to seek avenues to shore up her financial situation at or around that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I was minded for the payments for maintenance to start from August 2024, when the paternity results were known. However, I found that the balance was better struck by ordering that the backdated maintenance was to be paid from the time of application in March 2024. As mentioned above, this was independent of my finding that there had been no neglect on the part of the respondent to maintain the children prior to March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The order for maintenance was therefore that the respondent was to pay $3,600, being $1,800 for each of the two children, in monthly maintenance. Payment was to start from September 2025. The respondent was to pay backdated maintenance from 28 March 2024, the month when the application was filed – for a total of 18 months. This amount was to be paid in instalments of $1,200. The payment was to be made at the end of every month to the applicant’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I noted that this amount ought not to be crushing for the respondent, as on his own submission, he was able to make payments of close to $5,000 a month – with his suggested $2,936.89 for monthly maintenance and request to pay maintenance arrears through $2,000 in monthly instalments. At the same time, with the maintenance, the applicant should have sufficient funds with which to bring up her children, while she continued to strengthen her financial footing. Of course, parties were at liberty to seek variations in the event of material change or other good cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Cost of paternity testing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Ahead of hearing parties on costs, I dealt with the residual issue of who ought to bear the cost of paternity testing. The applicant’s counsel cited the recent case of <em>XIB v XIA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33441-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 40</a> in support of his contention that the respondent ought to bear the full costs. That case stood on stronger facts that militated in favour of an order for the father to bear the costs of the DNA test. The parties in that case had been married, with the child concerned conceived about eight years into the union. Given the facts of that case, it was patently unreasonable for the father to cast unsubstantiated aspersions on the paternity of the child. In the present case, the parties had never been married to each other. They had other partners. There were two children, who were both born out of wedlock. Moreover, as mentioned above, the applicant had stated through a statutory declaration that the respondent was not the biological father of the daughter. Despite that, while I had found that the respondent did not have the requisite level of knowledge for the purpose of finding neglect to maintain the children, I was of the view that he had at least been happy to go along with the <em>status quo</em>, even going out and posing with the children for photographs, until the parties ended their relationship in June 2023. While he would have at least suspected or wondered about the paternity, he did not issue a flat-out denial when the applicant sought $3,000 for the child via text message – at the terminal stage of the parties’ relationship. In the circumstances, I did not think that it would be unreasonable for the respondent to foot the full cost of paternity testing. The request to definitively resolve the paternity question only arose after the receipt of the application for child maintenance, in which the applicant had already taken the position that the respondent was the biological father. At that juncture in the life of the case, it could even be said that the respondent needed to know the result more. As the applicant had initially paid for a half-share of the costs of the paternity test, on the basis that the Court would eventually determine where the costs should fall, that sum was to be reimbursed to her by the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having heard counsel on costs, I made no order as to costs, save for ordering the respondent to pay $500 to the applicant for the adjournment of an earlier trial date in April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     My orders were therefore summarised as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Respondent is to pay $3,600, being $1,800 for each of the two children, in monthly maintenance. Payment will start from September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The payment will be made on or by the end of every month to the applicant’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The respondent is to pay backdated maintenance from March 2024 in the sum of $64,800 (being 18 months x $3,600). This sum is to be paid in monthly instalments of $1,200 per month, on or by the end of every month commencing in September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The respondent is to reimburse the sum of $1,376.13 incurred by the applicant, being half of the costs of the paternity test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Costs of $500 to be paid to the applicant.</p> </div></content></root>"}]
