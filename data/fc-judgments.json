The mother is a foreigner on a long-term visit pass (“<b>LTVP</b>”) in Singapore. The pass will expire soon, and it is unclear whether it will be renewed by the authorities. Are such factors conclusive in showing that the Singaporean father ought to have sole care and control of the child? This issue – which has thus far eluded judicial comment – arose in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff is a Singaporean (“<b>Husband</b>”). The Defendant is a Filipino on LTVP in Singapore (“<b>Wife</b>”). They were married in June 2011 and have a 10-year-old son (D.O.B. XX September 2014) (“<b>Son</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After 12 years of marriage, the Husband commenced divorce proceedings in June 2023. Interim judgement was granted in August of the same year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       This matter came before me to determine the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child custody, care and control, and access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I begin with the issues relating to the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The parties have agreed to have joint custody of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Each of them however wishes to have sole care and control of the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Given the parties’ position, I will have to determine which of them is a <em>more suitable parent</em> to care for the Son. This requires me to consider which parent can better (a) attend to the child’s emotional, developmental, and material needs, (b) provide for his daily care, and (c) make day-to-day decisions for him: see e.g., <em>XDZ v XEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a> (“<b><em>XDZ</em></b>”) at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In making such a determination, courts have generally considered the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>The parents’ past and present interactions with the child</em>. For instance, which parent has shown greater concern, interest and responsibility for the child? Which parent has been the child’s primary caregiver? Which parent has a stronger bond with the child? See <em>XDZ</em> at [14(a)] to [14(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>The parents’ future caregiving arrangements</em>. For instance, which parent can provide better care for the child? Which parent can provide a more secure and stable home environment for the child? Which parent is more willing to promote a healthy relationship between the child and the other parent? What are the child’s wishes? See <em>XDZ</em> at [14(e)] to [14(g)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Adverse considerations</em>. For instance, does any of the parent have an unhealthy lifestyle or outlook which may affect his/her ability to make rational decisions for the child? Has any of the parent acted in a way to intentionally or knowingly harm the child’s interest? See <em>XDZ</em> at [15].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Other considerations.</em> When making orders of care and control, courts are mindful, for instance, that the continuity of the child’s living arrangements is an important factor for his/her emotional well-being. Courts are also slow to separate siblings from one another. See <em>XDZ</em> at [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Care and control – Considerations </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Applying the above considerations to the present case, I make the following findings.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"6.48%\"><col width=\"27.74%\"><col width=\"65.78%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Considerations</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Findings</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Past and present interactions</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Which parent has shown greater concern, interest and responsibility for the Son?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – The Wife</em> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i) The <b>Wife</b> has shown concern, interest and responsibility for the Son.

To support this submission, she referred to WhatsApp messages from the Husband where he had stated that <em>“[The Son] will be send to children home …”, “You can ask any lawyer he’s life gone”</em>, and “<em>This mrg I talk to Adrian he too say the same thing. [The Son] will be send to children home. Think carefully 3 of our life gone</em>”. I am not exactly sure what is the context in which these messages were sent – e.g., whether they were threats (as alleged by the Wife) or warnings about the consequences of the Wife seeking a divorce and persuading her not to take that path. As such, I do not give much weight to these messages. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(v) For clarity, the observations in (ii) to (iv) above is <em>not</em> a finding that the Husband does not care for the Son. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Which parent has been the Son’s primary caregiver?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – The Wife</em> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i) The <b>Wife</b> is the Son’s primary caregiver.

Her LTVP expires on 2 April 2025 (i.e., about two weeks after this judgement). It is unclear whether she can renew her LTVP thereafter. This is because she needs a Singapore citizen or permanent resident to sponsor her LTVP renewal application. The evidence suggests that the Husband is unwilling to continue to be her sponsor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     If her LTVP is not renewed, the Wife will have to leave Singapore. This can lead to (a) application by the Wife to relocate the Son overseas (so as to be with her) and (b) application by the Husband for the child to remain in Singapore and be placed under his care instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Does uncertainty regarding the renewal of the Wife’s LTVP, as well as the possibility that she may denied continued stay in Singapore, mean that sole care and control of the Son must be awarded to the Husband? In my view, the answer is no. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In deciding in whose care and control the Son should be placed, the <em>paramount consideration is his welfare</em>: s 125 Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Wife will be allowed to remain in Singapore is a relevant factor in deciding whether she should have care and control of the Son. This is because it goes towards the issue of whether she can provide a continuity of his living arrangements in the long term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That said, it is settled law that the continuity of a child’s living arrangements is <em>just one of the many factors</em> that must be considered on the issue of care and control. A court must <em>consider and balance all</em> the relevant factors: <em>XDZ</em> at [14] to [16]. If the <em>mere possibility</em> that the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“<b>ICA</b>”) may not renew the Wife’s LTVP means that care and control of the Son must be awarded to the Husband, this is tantamount to (i) placing undue weight to the continuity factor and (ii) rendering the other factors in [9] and [10] above redundant when deciding on care and control issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, I agree with the Wife that it will be wrong in principle for me to let ICA’s decision (on whether to renew the Wife’s LTVP) dictate my decision on which parent should have care and control of the Son. This is because the ICA decision is based on immigration policy considerations, whereas my decision is to be based solely on the Son’s welfare and interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To be clear – the foregoing should not be understood to mean that the non-renewal of a parent’s LTVP is an irrelevant consideration altogether: see [14(b)] above. Rather, the issue is what <em>weight</em> ought to be placed on this factor. In this regard, much depends on the circumstances of each case. For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If the factors in [9] are finely balanced, then the possibility that the LTVP may not be renewed can tip the balance in favor of awarding care and control to the Singaporean parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, a child’s <em>age</em> – e.g., whether it is (i) a baby, (ii) schooling, (iii) approaching the age for national service enlistment (in the case of males), <em>or</em> (iv) on the cusp of adulthood – can also affect the weight to be placed on the possibility that a parent’s LTVP may not be renewed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I am mindful that the scenarios in [13] above can be severely disruptive for the Son. In my view, this does not displace the clear evidence that the Wife is better able (than the Husband) to care for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Son is still young – only about 10 years’ age – and in his formative years. The Wife (i) has been his primary caregiver since birth, (ii) shares a stronger bond with him, and (iii) is a more caring parent: see [10(a)] to [10(d)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the Son is placed in the Husband’s care and control, the child is likely to have a difficult time bonding with his father (given the latter’s work routine and their wide age gap). The Son may also end up feeling like an “abandoned child” if he were passed around from relative to relative to be looked after when the Husband is not free to take care of him. (I note that the Husband did not designate any particular relative who will be responsible for helping to look after the Son if the need arises.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     For completeness, I wish to address one other point. The Husband has submitted that the Wife is seeking care and control of the Son for an ulterior motive – to remain in Singapore. I am unable to accept this submission. The Wife’s life will not be easy if she remains in Singapore and have to look after the Son. This is because she will effectively be a single mother who must juggle between (a) caring for her growing child and (b) holding a full-time job. She will probably be doing this without a helper’s assistance: see [10(d)(iii)] above. This hardship will persist for a long time – as it will be a decade before the Son reaches adulthood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     After considering all the factors wholistically, I decide to award the Wife sole care and control of the Son.

This is because (i) a substantial portion of them came from 33 years of CPF contributions which he had made <em>before</em> marriage (since 1978 when he started working at age 20), and (ii) the contributions that he had made <em>during</em> the marriage form only a small portion of these funds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife submitted that the CPF funds should be included in the matrimonial pool. According to her, the Husband had failed to prove how much of these funds were contributed before and after marriage. In the circumstances, it would be pure speculation for him to claim that all the funds were acquired before marriage. Furthermore, in accordance with CPF’s usual policy, the Husband would have used up <em>all</em> the funds in his Ordinary Account when he paid for the Flat. This means that the funds currently in this account must have been acquired after such payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     My findings are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I accept the Wife’s submission (i) that the Husband has the burden of proof, and (ii) that he is likely to have used up most of the funds in his Ordinary Account to pay for the Flat’s downpayment ($59,200). I would add that the Husband is also likely to have thereafter used the monthly contributions into his Ordinary Account to settle the Flat’s monthly mortgage payments. This means that the funds currently in his Ordinary Account – $145.75 – is likely to have been acquired <em>after</em> the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for the funds in the other accounts, i.e., the Medisave Account, Special Account, and Retirement Account, I find that most of them are likely to have come from contributions that the Husband had made <em>before</em> the marriage. This is because the circumstances in which funds may be withdrawn from these accounts are very limited. In other words, the CPF contributions which the Husband had made since the start of his working life (in 1978) are likely to have remained largely intact in these accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I note that the Husband has been working for about 45 years as of 2023 (when the marriage ended). Of this period, he was married for about 12 years (i.e., about ¼ of his working life).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Taking a broadbrush approach, I find that ¼ of the CPF funds in [24(e)] should be added to the matrimonial pool. This amount comes to <b>$30,704.17.</b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Funds in the Husband’s POSB account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Next, I turn to the funds in the Husband’s POSB account ($10,602.37). According to the Husband, these funds should be excluded because they represent his savings from the time he started working in 1978.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I am unable to accept the Husband’s case. Over the past 45 years, there would have been funds flowing into and out of the account – including payments for big ticket items such as renovations and furnishings of the Flat ($114,645): see [34(a)(iii)].

The Wife made the following allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><em>The force-feeding.</em></b> At the material time, the Daughter was crying in the master-bedroom (occupied by the Husband). On opening the door, the Wife saw the Husband force-feeding the child with a milk bottle to pacify her and to stop her crying. The Daughter choked and the parties took the child to the toilet to clean up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><em>The threat.</em></b> While attending to the child, the Husband repeatedly shouted at the Wife, “Go away, don’t come near me. … <em>If you continue, I won’t let you see her again</em>”. The Wife felt threatened by these words.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b><em>The shove and injury.</em></b> At one point, the Husband placed the Daughter down on the bed. When the Wife tried to console the child, he shoved the Wife aside to remove her from the child. As a result, the Wife lost her balance, tipped over, and hit her right knee against a desk in the bedroom. This caused her to suffer a bruise on the knee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband denied the above allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I find that the Wife had failed to prove her allegations. My reasons for this finding are as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>First</em>, the Husband had tendered a video which shows the events in the master-bedroom on 18 February 2024 from 9.05 pm to 9.14 pm. This video <em>materially contradicts</em> the Wife’s allegations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><em>The force-feeding.</em></b> The video does not show the Husband force-feeding the Daughter. Instead, it shows him being very gentle with the child, calling her “<em>Sayang</em>” repeatedly, and trying to pacify her for about 10 mins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><em>The threat.</em></b> Additionally, the video does not show the Husband repeatedly telling the Wife that he would not let her see the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Instead, the video shows him simply telling the Wife to go away and to leave the child alone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Admittedly, the Husband had raised his voice towards the Wife. In my view, this does not constitute family violence in the nature of “continual harassment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It bears highlighting that at the material time, the parties (being concerned parents) must have been distressed by the child’s vomiting and incessant crying. From the video, the Husband appears to be unhappy with the Wife for interfering in his attempts to pacify the Daughter. The Husband’s remarks and tone of voice to the Wife should be seen against this situational backdrop.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The video also shows that despite having been asked to “go away”, the Wife had remained with the child throughout, and the Husband did not remove her from the bedroom. This shows that the Husband’s remarks were uttered in the heat of the moment and that the Wife was not in fear of him at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b><em>The shove and injury.</em></b> Finally, the video does not show the Husband shoving the Wife aside to remove her from the child. Neither does it show the Wife losing her balance and hitting her right knee against a desk.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Instead, the video shows that after the Daughter had been cleaned up and resting on the bed, the Wife left the bedroom voluntarily without any incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12      <em>Second</em>, the Wife had <em>failed to give a reasonable explanation</em> for the material contradictions between her allegations and the video evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     When confronted with the material discrepancies, the Wife claimed that the “missing” events had occurred <em>before 9.05 pm</em> – i.e., before the video recording started.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I am unable to accept this claim. The <em>events</em> in the video and the <em>sequence</em> in which they had occurred – e.g., (i) the Daughter crying, (ii) the Wife entering the bedroom, (iii) the parties bringing the child to the toilet to clean up, (iv) the Husband asking the Wife to go away, and (v) the child being placed on the bed to rest – mirror the Wife’s account of what had happened during the incident. For the Wife’s claim to make sense, the <em>same</em> events would need to have occurred <em>twice</em> – i.e., the first time at <em>before</em> 9.05 pm – and then again for the second time <em>after</em> 9.05 pm. However, the Wife did not testify that the events had occurred twice. Even if she did, I would have found such evidence to be incredible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Finally</em>, the Wife’s claim – that the Husband had shoved her and had thus caused her to lose her balance, hit a desk, and injure her right knee – has critical gaps and is internally inconsistent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife did not make the same claim in a <em>police report</em> which she had filed on 19 February 2024 – less than 24 hours after the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> During cross-examination, the Wife conceded that if she had been injured as claimed, this is a material fact which she would have stated in her police report.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In her <em>PPO application</em>, the Wife had also failed to mention that she had been shoved and had thus injured her knee during the 18 February incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During re-examination, the Wife further contradicted herself by alleging that she had in fact suffered the knee injury on 21 April 2024 – <em>not 18 February 2024</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">21 April 2024 – Snatching of the Daughter and using force on the Wife </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Next, I turn to the 21 April incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     According to the Wife, she was in her bedroom interacting with the Daughter at the material time. On seeing this, the Husband snatched the child away by forcefully pushing the Wife and slapping her hand. This caused the Wife’s shoulder and forearm to be bruised. The Husband’s actions had also caused the Daughter to cry. He eventually left the crying child on the floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     According to the Wife, after the alleged incident, she left the Flat with the child on the same day to reside at the Parents’ Home. She submitted that there is no “plausible reason” for her to leave the Flat on that day but for the Husband’s aggressive conduct.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I am not persuaded by the Wife’s submission. I find that she had failed to prove her allegation that the Husband had used force on her. I have come to this finding because there are material omissions and discrepancies between (a) her pre-trial statements, (b) her affidavit, and (c) her testimony regarding the said allegation.

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I now come to the next incident. It is not disputed that on the same day that the Wife left the Flat (i.e., 21 April 2024), the Husband and some of his relatives went to the Parents’ Home at about 9.30 pm to look for the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     According to the Wife, the Husband had caused harassment to her during the visit. <em>First</em>, by “shouting very loudly and threateningly demanding to be let inside the home for him to see the child”, and <em>second</em>, when his demands were denied, by lingering with his relatives at a street across the Parents’ Home for about two hours before finally leaving the area.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Husband denied having committed family violence. According to him, he had merely attempted to see the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I find that the Wife has failed to prove her allegations regarding the 21 April incident. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     This is a case involving the Wife’s bare claims against the Husband’s bare denials. Apart from the parties’ police reports<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> (such reports can be self-serving), there is no other evidence to show whose evidence is more credible and reliable. In the circumstances, I am unable to find that the Wife’s account of the 21 April incident is more probable than the Husband’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, based on the Wife’s account, I find that the Husband’s actions do not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Wife failed to prove that the Husband had committed the relevant acts <em>with intent to cause or knowing</em> that they are likely to cause anguish to her: see limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” under s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, I accept the Husband’s evidence that he had gone to the Parents’ Home simply to see the Daughter – and not for the purpose of harassing the Wife. It is not disputed that the Wife’s decision for the Daughter to stay at the Parents’ Home came as a <em>surprise</em> to the Husband. (This is evident from the exchange of messages between the parties at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, it is also not disputed that the Husband had sought police assistance and filed an online police complaint <em>before</em> arriving at the Parents’ Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Such actions are more consistent with those of a father who had resorted to legal means to see his child than one who was seeking to cause trouble or harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">26 April 2024 – Commotion at the Daughter’s playschool </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I now come to the 26 April incident. It is not disputed that the Husband and his father had gone to the Daughter’s playschool on that day to see the child. It is also not disputed that the Husband was denied entry into the premises because the Wife had informed the school authorities that he was not “authorised” to see the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     According to the Wife, the Husband had created a commotion and shouted at the school authorities after being disallowed to see the Daughter. As a result, the Wife – who was a staff at the playschool – was asked by the school management to resolve the situation. Eventually, a compromise was reached – the Wife allowed the Husband to see the Daughter briefly from outside the school premises through a glass door. Soon thereafter, the Husband and his father left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Husband denied having created a commotion at the playschool. He highlighted the fact – which is undisputed – that he had waited outside the school premises to catch a glimpse of the Daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In this case, the dispute centres on two issues. <em>First</em>, did the Husband create a commotion at the playschool. <em>Second</em>, if he did, then do his actions constitute family violence. On both issues, the Wife has the burden to prove that the answers are in the affirmative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     To discharge her burden of proof, the Wife drew my attention to the fact that when asked whether he was aware that there was a school protocol for visitors, the Husband had responded, “<em>I believe I don’t have to follow any protocols because I am the legal parent of [the Daughter]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Wife submitted that the Husband’s response “[indicated] his <em>intention</em> to create a commotion at [her workplace]” at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I disagree. I find the link that the Wife sought to draw – i.e., between the Husband’s response above and his purported intent to harass her – to be tenuous. The evidence does not prove that the Husband had gone to the playschool to harass the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on the Wife’s own evidence, the Husband had allegedly created a commotion at the playschool <em>only after</em> learning that he was not allowed to see the Daughter. This shows that the alleged commotion was more likely to be the Husband’s <em>spontaneous reaction</em> to being denied access to his child than a deliberate act to harass the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such a spontaneous reaction by the Husband is understandable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is not disputed that the Husband had gone to the playschool to see the Daughter. It bears highlighting that at the material time, he did not have physical access to her <em>for about five days</em> already – i.e., since the day that the Wife left the Flat with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       As a father, it is reasonable for the Husband to believe that he had a right to see his Daughter at the playschool. At the material time, there was no court order denying him access to his child. (The Husband’s response in [27] above ought to be understood in this context.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Finally, the Husband came to know that he was not “authorised” to see the Daughter only after he had arrived at the playschool. This revelation must have come as a shock to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After being informed of the conditions for seeing the Daughter, the Husband had dutifully complied with them. He did not enter the school premises. As required by the Wife, he waited outside the school to catch a brief glimpse of his child through the glass door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After seeing the Daughter, the Husband’s objective for the visit had been met – he left the playschool. He did not, for instance, linger at the school to cause trouble for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">26 April 2024 incident – Showing explicit photo to the Wife’s aunt </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is not disputed that after leaving the playschool, the Husband and his father went to the home of the Wife’s aunt. After the visit, the aunt sent WhatsApp messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> to the Wife requesting to speak to her on the phone urgently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife alleged that during the phone call, the aunt told her that the Husband had showed her explicit photos of the Wife. This caused the Wife to feel anxious and humiliated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband denied the Wife’s allegations. According to him, he had visited the aunt just to let her know that the Wife had denied him physical access to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I find that the Wife had failed to prove her allegation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s case is based entirely on what the aunt had allegedly told her. The aunt did not testify at the hearing. In the circumstances, the Wife’s case is based on hearsay evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband – who was a party to the meeting with the aunt – had denied showing any explicit photo of the Wife during the meeting. The Wife is unable to rebut this denial given that she did not call the aunt to testify at the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife submitted that I should accept her case on the basis that the Husband (i) had failed to call his father (who was also present at the meeting) to testify and (ii) had failed to produce a CCTV recording from the aunt’s premises of the meeting. In my view, the Husband’s failure to adduce such evidence does not in any way assist the Wife to discharge her own burden of proof. Her case is inherently weak as it is based on hearsay evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">24 May 2024 incident – Commotion at the Daughter’s playschool </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I now come to the next incident. On 24 May 2024, the Husband again visited the Daughter’s playschool. It is not disputed that on this occasion, <em>five</em> of his relatives had also gone to the school at about the same time as him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     According to the Wife, from around 2.45 pm to 4.00 pm,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> the Husband and his relatives began arriving at the school separately. They demanded to see the Daughter. Because of the commotion created, members of the school management, including its director (“<b>Director</b>”), had to intervene to manage the situation. Staff had also to be mobilised to prevent the Husband and his relatives from entering the children’s rooms. According to the Wife, she experienced “extreme fear and panic” at the material time. The Husband and his relatives eventually vacated the premises only after the school management threatened to call the police if they insisted on remaining in the premises and behaving aggressively.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband denied that his group had created a commotion at the playschool. According to him, he had remained outside the school premises, his sister and aunt were allowed to sit in the reception area, and the Wife was the one who had been shouting (at his sister and aunt) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <b><em>Wife’s account more credible</em></b>. I find the Wife’s account of the 24 May incident to be more credible than the Husband’s. Given the following, the situation at the material time must have been chaotic and the Wife must have felt harassed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is not disputed that a significant number of persons (the Husband and his five relatives) had all wanted to see and speak to Daughter at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is also not disputed that the Husband and his relatives did not give prior notice to the playschool before their arrival. The school (i) would have been surprised by their visit and (ii) would not have had sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, it bears highlighting that by 24 May 2024, the Husband had not physically interacted with the Daughter for more than one month. The Husband and his relatives must have felt frustrated with the Wife and the school for continuing to deny them access to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the fact that tensions were high during the visit is evident in a conversation between the Husband and the Director on 27 May 2024, i.e., three days after the visit. (A transcript of this conversation was adduced at the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>) For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At two points during the conversation, the Director told the Husband that he could not “<em>have an entire gin gang of people coming here saying ... I want to see this girl</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> He told the Husband that such actions would affect the school’s operations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> It is clear from the Director’s remarks that the visit on 24 May 2024 by the Husband and his relatives had been chaotic and disruptive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband’s frustration with the Director continued to persist – and this is evident from the conversation. When the Director tried to explain to the Husband why the latter could not take unilateral actions, the Husband threatened him, “<em>I feel like you and my wife are having an affair now. So I can also bring that up to court. Do you want me to do that?</em>” In addition to making threats, the Husband had repeatedly accused the Director of being biased in favour of the Wife because she was his employee. This is despite the fact that on several occasions, the Director had repeatedly emphasised that he was not stopping the Husband from visiting the Daughter – but that such visits must be done in accordance with school protocol. Despite this, the Husband refused to accept what the Director had to say. The Husband kept dominating the conversation and interrupting the Director when the latter tried to explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37      <b><em>Husband complicit in the group visit.</em></b> I have no doubt that the Husband was complicit in what had happened on 24 May 2024. It could not have been a sheer coincidence that five different relatives – including his grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister – had all somehow (a) known where the Daughter’s <em>new</em> playschool was (she was enrolled in another playschool until 21 April 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> (b) wanted to see the child on the same day, and (c) descended at the school at about the same time as the Husband. The visit to the playschool by the Husband and his relatives must have been coordinated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38      <b><em>Husband’s motive.</em></b> In my view, the Husband had committed family violence on 24 May 2024. Having failed to see his Daughter on 26 April 2024 at the playschool, I accept the Wife’s evidence that he had intended to intimidate her with the size of his group and to pressure her into surrendering to his demands to see his child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> For more than an hour, the Husband – acting alone and with the complicity of his relatives – had continually harassed the Wife directly and indirectly through the school management. In behaving in a thuggish manner, the Husband must have intended to cause or known that his actions were likely to cause the Wife anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17 June 2024 – Circulation of the Wife’s explicit photo </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I now come to the final incident relied by the Wife for her PPO application. Regarding the 17 June incident, the following is not disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     17 June 2024 was Hari Raya Haji. On that day, the Husband’s mother had shared in a group chat an explicit photo of the Wife with another man. The members of the group chat are the Wife’s parents, the Husband and his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The photo was recorded by a CCTV camera installed in the Flat’s master-bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Apart from the Wife, the Husband was the only person who had access to the CCTV recording.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Wife believed that the Husband (a) had forwarded the photo to his mother and (b) had caused the photo to be circulated on the group chat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband denied having shared the photo to his mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> He also denied being involved in the photo’s circulation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I agree with the Wife that the Husband was probably behind the circulation of the photo.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there were only two persons who had access to the CCTV recording that contained the photo – the Husband and the Wife. It is inconceivable that the Wife had provided the embarrassing photo of herself to the Husband’s mother. The only other person who could have done so is the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband had reasons to circulate the photo to the Wife and her parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At the material time, he was angry with the Wife for having committed adultery, and had no qualms about exposing the adultery to humiliate her. For instance, on 27 May 2024 (i.e., less than a month before the photo was circulated), the Husband had repeatedly offered to show “graphic evidence” to the Director to discredit the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> On 11 June 2024 (i.e., less than a week before the photo was circulated), the Husband’s lawyers had also written to the Wife’s lawyers to threaten to show “<em>the CCTV footage of [her] sordid conduct, as evidence, at the appropriate juncture</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Importantly, at the time of the photo’s circulation, the Husband had not physically interacted with the Daughter for about two months. This is alluded to in the following message which accompanied the circulation of the photo: “... <em>It’s been almost 2 months since we have seen our g</em>...”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Husband did not disapprove his mother’s act of circulating the photo.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my view, the Husband had probably caused his mother to circulate the photo. He had done so to embarrass the Wife and to compel her to grant him physical access to the Daughter. By circulating the photo during the festive occasion of Hari Raya, the intention is clearly to cause maximum distress to the Wife and her parents. Such conduct is malicious and highly reprehensible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing up</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence has been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     To sum up, I find that the Husband had committed family violence against the Wife on two occasions – (a) 24 May 2024 and (b) 17 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While a father’s anxiety and desire to see his daughter is understandable, what the Husband had done during these two incidents have crossed the line. These incidents show that he has no qualms in employing reprehensible means – such as mob tactics and circulating explicit photo – to harass and pressure the Wife into giving in to his demand to see his child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I wish to emphasize one thing. <em>Legal rights must be enforced through legal means – not through the commission of family violence</em>. I find it particularly deplorable that the Husband and his relatives had seen it fit to cause a commotion at a playschool – which is supposed to be a safe place for young children. They have done so with blatant disregard for the alarm that their actions might cause to these children.

It is not disputed that on that day, the Wife was recorded on CCTV to have been vaping in the bedroom with the Daughter lying next to her. The child was about 1½ years old at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     According to the Husband, the Wife had shown a “callous disregard” for the Daughter’s well-being by vaping in her presence. The Wife had continued her vaping habit even after leaving the Flat on 21 April 2024. To support this claim, the Husband relied on the undisputed fact that Health Sciences Authority (“<b>HSA</b>”) had found the Wife to be in possession of vaping devices on 18 May 2024 at the Parents’ Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> He is concerned that the Wife will continue to vape in the child’s presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     According to the Wife –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She was not aware that vaping besides the Daughter would be harmful to the child’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any event, she had since stopped the vaping habit and had surrendered all the paraphernalia to HSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband had reported her vaping habit to the Ministry of Social and Family Development. Following the complaint, officers from the Child Protection Services (“<b>CPS</b>”) had visited her at her Parents’ Home on 23 May 2024. On 27 May 2024, CPS informed her that they had closed the matter without the need for a safety plan to be implemented.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     During the hearing, the issue of whether the Wife’s act of vaping in the Daughter’s presence was harmful to the child was hotly contested. Both parties however did not produce clear and unequivocal expert evidence on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Assuming that the issue is answered in the affirmative, I find that there is no necessity for a PPO to be issued against the Wife over her vaping habit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband had produced evidence of <em>only one instance</em> where the Wife had vaped in the child’s presence. That incident occurred about 18 months ago. There is no other evidence that the Wife had vaped in the Daughter’s presence on other occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the parties have been living apart since April 2024. As such, the Husband has no evidential basis to contend that the Wife “is still in possession of vaping devices or could easily purchase them online and use them in [the Daughter’s] presence”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> Such a contention is based on pure conjecture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, I note that following the Husband’s complaint about the Wife’s vaping habit, CPS had visited the Parents’ Home, interviewed the Wife, and examined the Daughter’s living environment. CPS had assessed that it is not necessary to take any further action to protect the child. There is no basis for me to reject this assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11 September 2023 – Throwing the Daughter on the bed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Next, I turn to the 11 September incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Husband’s claim that the Wife had committed family violence is based on a recording from his CCTV camera in a bedroom in the Flat. (The Husband was not at home at the material time.) According to him, the recording shows that at about 12.50 pm, the Wife had handled the Daughter in a rough manner – by “throwing” her on the bed and thus causing her to “bounce” backward on the bed and to land on her head.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Wife denied having intentionally or knowingly caused hurt to the Daughter. According to the Wife, she was merely engaging in horseplay with the child at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I find that the Wife did not commit family violence as alleged by the Husband. The following is clear from the recording –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife did not throw the Daughter on the bed. She had simply placed the child in the middle of the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There were two pillows on the bed. They had been positioned to form a layer of protection around the child. This suggests that the Wife had taken steps to ensure the Daughter’s safety while the latter was on the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After being placed on the bed, the Daughter bent her body backwards <em>on her own.</em> She did not “bounce” backwards from the impact of being forcefully placed on the bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After bending backwards, the Daughter’s head and part of her upper body landed on a pillow. There is no evidence that she was hurt or had cried at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">12 September 2023 – Pulling the Daughter’s legs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I now turn to the next incident which is also based on a CCTV recording. The incident occurred in the bedroom on 12 September 2023. Similarly, the Husband was not at home at the material time. The recording shows the Wife and the Daughter on the bed, and the latter crying.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     According to the Husband, the Daughter was crying because the Wife had exerted excessive force on the child by pulling her legs back and forth.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Wife denied the Husband’s allegations. According to her, the Daughter was crying due to discomfort from constipation. The Wife explained that she was “rotating” the child’s legs – a home remedy – at the material time to relieve the child of her discomfort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Husband has the burden to prove that the Wife had intentionally or knowingly caused hurt to the Daughter by pulling or rotating the child’s legs. In my view, the Husband had failed to discharge his burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife’s evidence that the Daughter was crying due to discomfort from constipation – and not from her moving the child’ legs – is plausible. This is because the Husband had confirmed that the Daughter had constipation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> He was not at home during the incident. As such, he has no basis to dispute the Wife’s evidence that the child was suffering from constipation at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife’s explanation that she was trying to relieve the child of her discomfort from constipation is consistent with the evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In the video recording (exhibit R3), the Wife can be seen <em>calmly</em> massaging the child’s stomach and <em>patiently</em> moving her legs at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Husband had confirmed that to relieve the Daughter of constipation, he would practice home remedies such as “<em>rotating the legs</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> and “<em>massaging the stomach</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Even when the Daughter was struggling and pushing against the Wife, the latter was not rough with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The recording does not show the Wife to be angry or frustrated with the Daughter at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, if the Wife had wanted to cause hurt to the Daughter, she would have done so in a more direct way, e.g., by pinching or hitting the child. There is no evidence of this in the recording.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11 April 2024 – Mark on the Daughter’s leg</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I now come to the final incident relied by the Husband for his PPO application. This concerns a mark found on the Daughter’s leg at around 7.30 pm on 11 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     According to the Husband, the mark was not on the Daughter’s leg earlier that day. He had noticed it only after the child spent the day with the Wife. When questioned, the Wife explained that it was an insect bite. The Husband decided to apply some cream over the mark. The next day, the condition of the mark had worsened. According to the Husband, it became filled with pus and blood was oozing out. When he brought the Daughter to a doctor on 13 April 2024, the Daughter kept mentioning the words “pain” and “fire”. The Husband suspected that the mark was a burn mark and caused by the Wife’s smoking and vaping habit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife denied having caused the mark on the Daughter’s leg. She had discovered the mark, which looked like an insect bite, when changing the child’s diapers in the morning of 11 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> According to the Wife, the words “fire” and “pain” were beyond the vocabulary of the Daughter, who was about two years old at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     To succeed in his PPO application, the Husband must prove the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the mark on the Daughter’s leg – as shown in the Wife’s affidavit dated 3 July 2024 (in relation to SS 879/2024) at page 52 (“<b>11 April photo</b>”) – was not caused by an insect bite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the mark must have been a burn mark caused by the Wife from her smoking or vaping.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the Wife must have caused the mark intentionally or knowingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That a PPO is necessary to prevent the Wife from causing further physical harm to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In my view, the Husband has failed to prove the above on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is no medical opinion on whether the mark found on the Daughter’s leg on 11 April 2024 was caused by an insect bite or a burn mark. All that is stated in the doctor’s memo is that the child had a 1 cm x 1 cm erosion with surrounding 2 cm skin induration that was erythematous. The memo also stated that there was no pus or discharge at the time of examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, I have no basis to find that the mark was not caused by an insect bite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Looking at the 11 April photo, the mark is consistent with an insect bite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       According to the Wife, it was “<em>pretty normal</em>” for the Daughter to be bitten by insects.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Husband did not dispute this piece of evidence during the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Wife had proactively alerted the Husband to the mark on 11 April 2024. It is unlikely that she would have done so if she had burnt the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Further</em>, the Husband has failed to show why the Wife would want to intentionally or knowingly burn the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Finally</em>, assuming that the Daughter did utter the words “fire” and “pain” (this is hotly contested by the Wife), this does not prove that the Wife had burnt the child’s leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       It is conceivable that the child might have been describing how the pain <em>felt</em> – i.e., like being burned – instead of stating that “fire” was the <em>cause</em> of the pain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       It also bears highlighting that the Daughter had allegedly mentioned the words “fire” and “pain” at the doctor’s office on 13 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> This is two days after the discovery of the mark. In the time between the discovery of the mark and the visit to the doctor’s office, both the Husband and the Wife had applied medicinal cream to the mark. According to the Husband, one day after he had applied the cream, pus and blood started oozing from it. In the circumstances, I cannot exclude the possibility that the <em>medicinal cream</em> and the <em>subsequent</em> worsening of the condition of the mark had caused the Daughter to feel the sensation of fire on her leg.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     To sum up – I find that the Husband has failed to prove that the Wife had committed family violence against the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     For the above reasons, I granted the Wife’s application for a PPO for herself and dismissed the rest of the PPO applications by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I order that the Husband is not to use family violence in any form against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_69-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The PPO shall take immediate effect and shall last until the Daughter turns 21. In other words, the order will expire one day before XX March 2043.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_69-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In determining the duration of the PPO, I have considered (i) the applicable principles (see <em>XEF v XEG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32457-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 92</a> at [43]) and (ii) the fact that child-related issues were the trigger for the Husband’s commission of family violence. Such issues are likely to persist so long as the parties can exercise parental rights over the Daughter: see [47(c)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_69-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I wish to emphasise to the Husband a few things. <em>First</em>, it is an offence to contravene the order that I have made. <em>Second</em>, if the Husband were to intentionally contravene the order, he can be arrested and be punished with a fine and/or imprisonment. <em>Finally</em>, for the sake of his Daughter, I urge the Husband to resolve any future disagreement that he may have with the Wife calmly and through legal means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Finally, I come to the issue of costs. The Wife has succeeded in one of her PPO applications while the Husband has failed in his. In my view, a costs order of $3,000 in favour of the Wife is proportionate to the amount of work and effort expended on litigating the family violence committed on 26 April 2024 and 17 June 2024. I make this cost order accordingly.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s affidavit dated 3 July 2024 (in relation to SS 806/2024) at [29] to [41].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit dated 29 August 2024 at [16] to [19]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 17 October 2024 at page 6 (line 27) to page 7 (line 8).

District Judge Phang Hsiao Chung:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is an application by a former husband (the “Husband”) against his former wife (the “Wife”) for:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Certificate of Final Judgment (Divorce) in FC/D 1265/2024 (the “Certificate of Final Judgment”) to be set

class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Husband and the Wife are both professionals in the same industry. The Husband holds a senior appointment in a multinational corporation, where he manages around 70 personnel, and with them collectively generate an annual revenue of about US$39 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties have 2 sons (collectively, the “children”), who were born in 2007 and 2010.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In FC/D 1265/2024, the Wife was granted an Interim Judgment on 4 April 2024 on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down by reason that the Husband has behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband. The Interim Judgment was made final when the Certificate of Final Judgment was issued on 8 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Clauses 3(c) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment were orders on divorce ancillary matters that were made by consent. Clause 3(c) relates to the division of the matrimonial home. Clause 3(d) relates to the division of other matrimonial assets, including a property in Singapore, 2 properties in London, monies standing to the credit of the parties in their Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts, monies in various bank accounts, stocks and shares held by the parties in their sole names, and monies from Treasury Bills and fixed deposits. Clause 3(e) relates to spousal maintenance for the Wife, and the giving to the Wife of 50% of the bonus and shares allocated to the Husband for his performance in 2023. Clause 3(f) relates to maintenance for the children, annual contributions by the Husband to the Wife’s joint account with the children, and the nomination of the children as beneficiaries of the parties’ life insurance policies and CPF monies. Clause 3(g) relates to the following matters: (a) payment by the Husband to the Wife of a monthly sum for household expenses; (b) the parties’ agreed mechanism for varying the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance, and household expenses, if there is a “permanent change” of the Husband’s employment; (c) the provision of a 3.5% “inflationary adjustment” every year for the amount of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses; (d) the repayment by the Husband to the Wife of an amount withdrawn from the parties’ joint account; and (e) the Husband’s sole liability for all personal loans taken in his own name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under the consent orders, the Husband agreed to pay the Wife spousal maintenance of $7,500 every month from January 2024 to January 2034 (or until the Husband’s official retirement, whichever is later), $3,400 every month for the maintenance of the children from January 2024 until the children completed their university education, and $3,800 every month for household expenses from January 2024 to January 2032, with these amounts to increase by 3.5% every year (unless otherwise agreed between the parties). In addition, the Husband agreed to make an annual contribution of $100,000 to the Wife’s joint account with the children for 5 years, from 2024 to 2028 (both years inclusive).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband’s case is set out in detail in his affidavit filed in support of the application, and summarised in his oral submissions. The Husband seeks to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment, and clauses 3(c) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment, on the ground that “the clauses impose unfair and unjust terms that have a negative impact on [him], which [he] did not fully understand at the point of consenting, due to the pressure put on [him] by the [Wife] to sign the divorce papers”. The Husband added that he “did not have the benefit of legal advice at the material time” as he was “self-representing / acting in person”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       According to the Husband, throughout the marriage, he had been the “primary financial contributor to the family” and “paid for most of the family’s expenses”. His current job was fast paced, with long hours and significant responsibilities that often left him feeling overwhelmed by work commitments. The Wife took on “familial duties”, including “managing [the Husband’s] salary / income”, which the Husband paid into the parties’ joint bank account, and “using [the Husband’s] monies to pay for the family’s expenses and to make investments”. The Husband was given about $2,000 every month to pay for his personal expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband claimed that he signed the draft consent order on divorce ancillary matters “without seeking legal help or advice” due to pressure from the Wife and “overwhelming stress ... at work”. According to the Husband, the Wife “pushed [him] to sign the documents in a rushed manner”, despite the Husband informing her many times that he needed more time to review them and come to a decision, especially with his heavy workload and stress. Due to pressure and threats by the Wife, the Husband “only focused on the key aspects, such as the Joint Custody of [the] children and the access [he] had with them”. As for the other orders, the Husband “did not have sufficient time and / or the capacity to fully understand what [he] was signing”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband provided the following elaboration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     When the Husband consented to the terms of the draft consent order, he was “extremely affected by the fact that the marriage was ending on a bad note”, and was “extremely worried and concerned about the impact this would have on the Children”. He wanted to resolve the matter amicably without involving lawyers, and trusted the Wife to be cooperative, fair and reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife had “made threats during the negotiations that, if [the Husband] did not agree to her terms, she would go on to expose the Third Party and name / involve the Third Party in the Divorce proceedings”. This “Third Party”, with whom the Husband had an extramarital affair, was a woman “of a certain seniority” in his industry. The Husband was concerned that the Wife’s exposure of the Third Party would “cause major reputational loss” to the Third Party and to him. To ensure that the Third Party “does not get pulled into [the parties’] divorce proceedings”, and that the jobs of the Husband and the Third Party “don’t end up being at stake”, the Husband signed the draft consent order “despite not completely agreeing to its terms and without fully understanding the implications it will have on [him]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife also threatened to deny the Husband access to the children, when he made counterproposals during the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband was “under tremendous pressure at work and felt overwhelmed”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Collectively, these issues “weighed heavily on [the Husband’s] mind and clouded [his] judgment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband also claimed that “due to [his] lack of expertise in the management of the funds used for the family expenses, [he] was unaware of the various costs associated with living on [his] own”, and underestimated his living expenses. The Husband claimed that after paying off his monthly expenses and the amounts payable to the Wife pursuant to the Interim Judgment, the Husband was “in a deficit” and “financially drained”. The Husband also stated that he had “little to no savings” to allocate towards commitments such as purchasing a home, saving for retirement and managing his health, despite working long hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband claimed that the consent orders were unfair to him, having regard to his larger direct financial contributions to the matrimonial assets. He also claimed that the Respondent was a capable and well-paid individual who earned close to $300,000 a year, and therefore did not require the the amount of spousal maintenance that she demanded. He wanted the Wife to bear part of the children’s maintenance and household expenses. He also stated that the yearly inflationary adjustment was not sustainable, as he was reaching the ceiling of his career and was unlikely to have any significant salary increments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the Wife’s affidavit in reply, the Wife gave details of the breakdown of the marriage and the negotiations that followed. The Wife claimed that the negotiations were fair, and that she had acted reasonably in the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     However, the Wife also admitted to intentionally making things difficult for the Husband by suggesting that she would name the Third Party as a co-defendant in the divorce. It was clear from the Wife’s evidence on the negotiations that the Wife knew of the Husband’s desire to keep the Third Party out of the divorce proceedings, and the Wife used this to her advantage in the negotiations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Wife denied withholding access to the children, or using the children as a bargaining tool. She explained that the discussion relied on by the Husband took place when she “was still trying to recover and heal, and [she] genuinely could not bring [herself] to communicate with him about the children”. I think there is some truth to this statement, as the Husband did not raise any issue in relation to the consent orders in the Interim Judgment on custody, care and control of, and access to, the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In relation to the Husband’s suggestion that he could not afford the monthly payments for maintenance and household expenses, the Wife claimed that the Husband’s monthly income was between $30,000 and $40,000, and his annual income (presumably including bonuses) was between $600,000 and $700,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Husband’s application to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment was bound to fail. As observed by Choo Han Teck J in <em>VQB v VQC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25713-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 5</a> at [14] and [16]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In a divorce case, the Final Judgment dissolves the marriage, and the status of the parties as a married couple is brought to a permanent and unsalvageable end. Once the Final Judgment is made, the marriage is at a permanent end and cannot be reinstated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Women’s Charter 1961 makes no provision for setting aside a Final Judgment. The only conceivable exception is when the Final Judgment was obtained by fraud; but even then, it may have to be a fraud that taints the Final Judgment itself, such as a forgery of the order of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Setting up the Interim Judgment for attack is futile once the Final Judgment is made. To hold that a Final Judgment may be rescinded if the Interim Judgment was flawed is to create a legal fiction. The reliefs and remedies for obtaining a flawed Interim Judgment lie elsewhere than to pretend that the Final Judgment has no effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In any case, the Husband’s complaint lies not with the granting of the divorce, but with the terms of the consent order on divorce ancillary matters. The Husband affirmed the Interim Judgment for divorce by asking for a Case Conference to be fixed for directions to be given to the parties to file and exchange their affidavits of assets and means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment were consent orders dealing with the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Section 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 deals with the power of the court to order the division of matrimonial assets. Under section 112(4), the court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under section 112, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGCA 0068.xml')\">[2012] SGCA 68</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a>, the Court of Appeal made the following observations at [11], [12], [15], [22], [23], [25] and [27] to [30]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Section 112(4) does not furnish the court with a <em>carte blanche</em> to vary an order on division of matrimonial assets. There must be exceptional reasons before such variation can be effected. There must be some finality once the matrimonial assets have been divided between the parties. Section 112(4) must have a limited operation only, especially when the order of court made under section 112 is premised upon a consent order entered into between the parties themselves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Once the order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets has been completely implemented or spent (inasmuch as everything that is required to be done has been effected and the assets concerned have in fact been distributed to the parties concerned), the court does not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. Section 112(4) was included to give administrative flexibility to the court so long as the order it has made has not been completely effected or implemented. The court would make the necessary variations to an order for the division of matrimonial assets only where the order was unworkable or has become unworkable (before it has been fully effected or implemented).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where an order becomes unworkable (in that it is a matter of practical impossibility to implement it), it is fair and reasonable that the court is empowered under section 112(4) to make the necessary variations. There will also be (albeit extremely limited) circumstances in which unworkability, understood in a substantive as well as purposive sense, will justify a variation of the order by the court. Where new circumstances have emerged since the order was made, which so radically change the situation so that to implement the order as originally made would be to implement something that is radically different from what was originally intended, this would amount to unworkability, and the court would make the necessary variations to deal with such unworkability. Another instance of a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability may arise after the court makes an order under section 112 that is of a continuing nature. Where there has been a change in circumstances invalidating the very basis on which the court made a continuing order, this amounts to a radical change in circumstances amounting to unworkability, and the court will be empowered to make the necessary variation (or indeed, extension, revocation or discharge) under section 112(4) to deal with such a change. The view that a material change in the circumstances would suffice to trigger a variation under section 112(4) sets too low a threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Section 112(4) may also be invoked to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets where such order was unworkable to begin with. Any <em>ab initio</em> substantive unworkability must be a result of a fundamental misunderstanding apparent on the face of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>(e)     One other situation that might justify varying an order for the division of matrimonial assets, even after the order concerned has been implemented, is fraud. The standard of proof for fraud is a very high one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Court of Appeal provided the following elaboration on the fraud exception in <em>BMI v BMJ and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20978-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGCA 63</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21291-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 43</a> at [3] and [5]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As the court has no power to vary an order for the division of matrimonial assets that has been fully implemented, except in the limited case of fraud, any non-disclosure that was not fraudulent would not furnish a basis to set aside a consent order for the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The fact that the consent order has been fully implemented and the subsequent lapse of time are not factors which would, by themselves, prevent the court from intervening on the basis of section 112(4) if there was cogent evidence of fraudulent and material non-disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The threshold for establishing fraud is a high one which will not be met unless there is cogent and compelling evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     None of the reasons given by the Husband for seeking to set aside clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment fell within the ambit of section 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961, as explained by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> and in <em>BMI v BMJ and another matter</em>. The consent orders for division of matrimonial assets were clearly workable. In fact, at the time of the hearing, some of those orders had already been implemented, while others were in the process of being implemented. There was no evidence of fraud or fraudulent non-disclosure by the Wife in relation to the obtaining of the consent orders. While the Husband’s desire to keep the Third Party out of the divorce proceedings, and the pressures experienced by the Husband at work, may have given the Wife an upper hand in the negotiation of the terms of the consent orders, those matters did not in any way affect the validity of those consent orders. It follows that the Husband’s application to set aside clauses 3(c) and 3(d) of the Interim Judgment must be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside clauses 3(e) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Clauses 3(e) and 3(f) of the Interim Judgment were consent orders dealing with maintenance for the Wife and maintenance for the children, respectively. Clause 3(g)(i), (ii) and (iii) was a consent order that provided for, among other things, the following matters: (a) payment by the Husband to the Wife of a monthly sum for household expenses; (b) the parties’ agreed mechanism for varying the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, if there is a “permanent change” of the Husband’s employment; and (c) the provision of a 3.5% “inflationary adjustment” every year for the amount of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Section 118 of the Women’s Charter 1961 provides for the power of the court to vary (or rescind) an order for spousal maintenance granted during matrimonial proceedings. Under section 118, the court may at any time vary or rescind any such order for spousal maintenance “where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Sections 72 and 127(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961, read together, provide for the power of the court to rescind or vary an order for child maintenance granted during matrimonial proceedings. Under those provisions, the court may rescind or vary the order for child maintenance “on proof of a change in the circumstances” of the parent ordered to pay the maintenance, or of the child receiving the maintenance, or “for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court”. In considering any such application, the court may take into consideration any change in the general cost of living which may have occurred between the date of the making of the order sought to be varied and the date of the hearing of the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I begin with the following preliminary observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The order for payment by the Husband to the Wife of a monthly sum for household expenses may be construed as a supplementary order for a combination of spousal maintenance and child maintenance. It is open to the parties to agree to supplement the primary orders for spousal maintenance and child maintenance with an order for the payment of the whole or a part of the household expenses that would have been incurred for the maintenance of the Wife and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Although the parties may have agreed on a mechanism for varying the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, that agreement did not oust the application of the relevant statutory provisions on spousal maintenance and child maintenance. Clause 3(g)(ii) of the Interim Judgment only applies in a case where there is a “permanent change” of the Husband’s employment. It did not prevent the Husband from applying to vary the amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, in reliance on section 118, and section 72 read with section 127(2), of the Women’s Charter 1961, in any other case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Husband did not point to any specific misrepresentation by the Wife, or any mistake of fact (whether by himself, by the Wife or by both of them), that would justify a recission or variation of the consent order on spousal maintenance. There was also no evidence of any material change in the circumstances (whether of the Husband, the Wife or the children), between the date of the Interim Judgment (4 April 2024) and the date of the hearing of the Husband’s application (28 February 2025), that would justify a variation in the agreed amounts of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses. As mentioned in the context of the Husband’s unsuccessful attempt to set aside the consent orders on the division of matrimonial assets, while the Husband’s desire to keep the Third Party out of the divorce proceedings, and the pressures experienced by the Husband at work, may have given the Wife an upper hand in the negotiation of the terms of the consent orders, those matters did not in any way affect the validity of those consent orders. It follows that the Husband’s application to set aside clauses 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g)(i), (ii) and (iii) of the Interim Judgment must likewise be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Clause 3(g)(iv) and (v) of the Interim Judgment were consent orders for: (a) the repayment by the Husband to the Wife of an amount withdrawn from the parties’ joint account; and (b) the Husband to be solely liable for all personal loans taken in his own name. None of the parties’ submissions were directed at clause 3(g)(iv) and (v). As there did not appear to be any basis to set aside clause 3(g)(iv) and (v), the Husband’s application to set aside clause 3(g)(iv) and (v) of the Interim Judgment is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     While I have declined to set aside the consent orders in relation to the payment of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses, I do not discount the possibility that the amounts payable for those matters, when increased by 3.5% each year, may at some time in the future be unsustainable on the Husband’s income. To illustrate how this may happen, in 2024, the total amount payable by the Husband each month under clause 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g)(i) of the Interim Judgment was $14,700 (comprising $7,500 for spousal maintenance, $3,400 for child maintenance and $3,800 for household expenses). This will increase to $15,214.50 per month in 2025, $15,747.01 per month in 2026, $16,298.15 per month in 2027, and 16,868.59 per month in 2028. I therefore clarify that if the monthly payments become so large as to be unsustainable on the Husband’s income, or there is any other material change in the circumstances of the Husband, the Wife or the children or any other good cause, my dismissal of the Husband’s application to set aside clauses 3(e), 3(f) and 3(g)(i) of the Interim Judgment does not preclude the Husband from applying, under the relevant statutory provisions, to vary the consent orders for payment of spousal maintenance, child maintenance and household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the circumstances, the Husband’s application is dismissed. As a consequence of the dismissal of the Husband’s applications to set aside the Certificate of Final Judgment and clauses 3(c) to 3(g) of the Interim Judgment, the Husband’s remaining prayers for the fixing of a Case Conference and for costs are also dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife’s solicitor sought costs of $5,000 all in, inclusive of filing fees totalling $303.90. The Husband’s 59 page affidavit had 20 pages of text, while the Wife’s 127 page affidavit had 22 pages of text. The hearing of the Originating Application lasted about an hour. All things considered, I order the Husband to pay the Wife costs of the application fixed at $1,800 (all in).</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Matrimonial Assets – Division","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife","Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2025-03-12","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1582 of 2023","title":"XJS v XJT","citation":"[2025] SGFC 27","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32975-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Lee Mong Jen and Mr Yeo Yang (LMJ Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Mr Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran (Prestige Legal LLP) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-03-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>XJS v XJT</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XJS <em>v</em> XJT </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32975-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 27</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1582 of 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">12 March 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kenneth Yap </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Lee Mong Jen and Mr Yeo Yang (LMJ Law Corporation) for the plaintiff; Mr Gopalakrishnan Dinagaran (Prestige Legal LLP) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XJS — XJT </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial Assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wife</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">12 March 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kenneth Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       These are my brief grounds of decision for the ancillary matters (“AM”) in D 1582/2023.

The Husband’s argument that the HUS Invest Funds should be excluded because the Wife had received and spent her entitlements under the Connect Plan (a reward scheme for teachers under the Ministry of Education) is not legally valid. The HUS Invest Funds are a chose in action and therefore have an asset worth which can be valued at the ancillary hearing. The latest valuation provided by the Husband is as at 1 April 2024, in the sum of $202,047.82. The Wife sought to extrapolate the estimated increase in value as at January 2025. I instead directed the Husband to provide the latest statement to adopt the most accurate value, which was provided during the hearing as <b><u>$219,799.83</u></b>, based on a statement dated September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Second, the Husband makes a further argument that the Wife’s Connect Plan received payments over the years have been dissipated by her, and that the correct treatment should be the return of such funds to the matrimonial pool. However, I agree with counsel for the Wife that there is no legal basis for alleging dissipation when the divorce was not imminent. The divorce application was filed on 6 April 2023, and the Wife had explained that the monies had been spent over the years on family expenses and the purchase of the matrimonial home. I would not therefore require the Wife to refund any component of the spent monies to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Third, regarding bank balances, as these should be valued at the time of the interim judgment, the Husband’s transfers of $8,000 to his sister’s bank account on 16 October and 15 November 2023 respectively should not be taken into account, as it is stated by his sister that the sums are for expenses incurred from October 2023 to February 2025, which are expenses post-interim judgment. Accordingly, the valuation of the Husband’s bank accounts should be taken at the time of interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Fourth, with regard to insurance policies, the Wife claims that there were three insurance policies taken out by the Husband for the benefit of the children which had matured during the marriage but were not accounted, and which should be added back into the asset pool. The details of these three policies are as follows:</p> <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.0898179635927%\"><col width=\"32.0664132826565%\"><col width=\"18.8437687537507%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Policies (Child)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Matured Value Amount</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>As at date</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">LXXXX0975 (KS) </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$ 4,141.87 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21-Jan-20 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">LXXXX0991 (KS) </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$ 4,942.88 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">22-Jan-21 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">PruEduSave XXXX6162 (PTK) </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$15,831.50 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">12-Sep-22 </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Total</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$ 24,916.25</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     At the hearing, parties agreed that these three policies in the Husband’s name that were received by him would be paid out to the children accordingly, and that the Wife’s policy AIA Smart Growth 18 LXXXXX4480, which is still being paid for by her and which has not yet matured, would be paid out to PTK at maturity. Parties also agreed that the insurance policies paid to PTK would be utilised towards her outstanding student loan incurred in the sum of $34,500 as at September 2024. The total payout from the Husband’s PruEduSave Policy No XXXX6162 ($15,831.50) and the Wife’s AIA Smart Growth 18 LXXXXX4480 policy ($21,745 at present) would approximately cover the outstanding student loan with interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In addition, the Wife seeks the return of the monies paid out under the Wife’s Prudential Policy No. XXXX6964 on 14 November 2022 of $1,000 into their joint account, which was withdrawn by the Husband. She claims that the divorce was imminent at this point, and that substantive sums withdrawn from the asset pool should be returned (per <em>TNL v TNK</em> [2017 1 SLR 609 at [24]]. It was agreed at the first hearing that the Husband would repay the Wife separately for this, and this consent agreement would be reflected for good order in the ancillary hearing orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Fifth, parties dispute the valuation of the matrimonial home at [address redacted], an executive condominium. The Wife values it as <b>$1,796,000</b>, a figure taken from the average of three similar sized mid floor units using URA Resale Transacted prices (PAM-1 at page 157). The Husband seeks to adopt a valuation of $2,052,500.00 based on a latest transaction on 3 October 2024, which was found in the PropNex report dated 10 January 2025 (see the Defendant’s Written Submissions at Tab A). I found it more reliable to rely on the most recent estimated sale price of <b><u>$2,052.500</u></b>, and adopted this figure for the purposes of computation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As regards the housing loan for the matrimonial home, the Wife estimates this to be $584,459.20 as at January 2025 (extrapolated from the last statement entered into evidence as at 27 March 2024), whereas the Husband provided in submissions the latest statement as at 27 December 2024, which puts the sum as <u>$585,509.49</u><b>.</b> The Husband’s figure will be adopted as it is the most reliable valuation nearest to the AM date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Accordingly, the matrimonial pool is computed as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\"

These included consistent and significant contribution to the matrimonial properties throughout the marriage, which including taking out two staff renovation loans (which she repaid monthly), along with town council charges and utility bills. She also purchased household equipment which benefited the household, took on personal credit loans to meet the family’s needs, and stepped in as guarantor to her daughter’s university study loan. Finally, she also covered much of the daily household expenses, including service charges, utilities, groceries, dining out, cultural and festive expenses, children’s expenses such as pocket money, food, groceries, medical consultation and treatments, and the salary as well as agent fees for the family’s domestic helper. The Wife also points out that although a Joint Account had been set up since 2018, into which the parties deposited $1,500 monthly, she alleges that the Husband would reimburse himself from that account for bills that he paid, thereby draining out monies from their joint account and keeping the balance to a minimum, which in turn rendered it insufficient to cover daily costs. With regard to KS’s overseas education in Gold Coast, Australia, the Wife stated that she had financed the travel to Australia to facilitate her son’s settlement into the university, paying for part of the air tickets, car rental charges, Airbnb accommodation, and food expenses incurred by KS and herself during the trip, which amounted to a sum of $3,227.96. She also paid for other holiday trips and travel expenses during the course of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband set out in paragraph 18 of DAM-3, at Tabs A-F, the sums which he claimed to pay for. Over the period of 2017 to 2023, he claimed to have paid $240,301.81 in total as indirect financial contributions towards family expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Wife submits that that even based on the figures provided by the Husband, his monthly contribution to household expenses was low.

It is also plainly evident from the Wife’s calculations above that the Husband had only contributed a minority share towards the indirect financial contributions. Accordingly, I considered that a broad brush figure in the region of 65-70% would have been the approximate percentage of indirect contributions by the Wife. On balance, I awarded <b><u>68% to the Wife, and 32% to the Husband</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Average Ratio</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I made no adjustments to the average ratio as parties did not request for any adjustments to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband asked for an adverse inference to be drawn against the Wife for failing to answer questions on her assets in her response to his interrogatories on specific withdrawals. I did not find this to be justified as the questions related to relatively small line items in the Wife’s bank accounts. Accordingly, I declined to draw such an adverse inference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     On the Wife’s part, she asked for an uplift of 5% of the total pool of assets on account of the Husband’s erratic and intimidating behaviour towards her, which caused her mental distress over five years. However, I did not find the alleged conduct to be sufficiently serious to warrant such an adjustment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The parties’ respective share of the matrimonial pool are therefore computed as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.3266653330666%\"><col width=\"33.3266653330666%\"><col width=\"33.3466693338668%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>PW</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>DH</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Direct Contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">46.5%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">53.5%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Indirect Contributions</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">68%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">32%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Average Ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>57.25%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>42.75%</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total Matrimonial Assets</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$2,812,709.08</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Share of Matrimonial Pool</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$1,610, 275.95</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>$1,202,433.13</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mechanics of Division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I adjourned the hearing to allow parties to submit how best to effect an equitable division given the value and percentages ascribed above.

The Husband currently has sufficient balance in his CPF Ordinary Account to effect this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Husband’s counsel did not raise objections to this proposal, and I accordingly direct that this method of distribution be applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For the avoidance of doubt, pending completion of sale of the matrimonial home, parties should pay in equal shares all outgoings related to the property, including the housing loan, utilities, broadband services, management and sinking fund charges and property tax. Neither party should terminate services to the matrimonial home which are under their respective names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     With respect to the motor car, the Wife should have full conduct of the sale and the Husband should hand over the vehicle and keys in working condition to the Wife’s possession within two weeks of the order made in this hearing. Should the Husband elect to take over ownership of the car, he should notify the Wife within one week of the order, pay her $14,704.09 and solely discharge the outstanding hire purchase loan within two weeks of this Order. Failing which, the Husband should hand over the vehicle and car keys to the Wife as stated therein. Pending sale or transfer of the car to his name, Husband should continue paying for the hire purchase instalment and all costs related to the car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Wife submitted that at present, she provides $4,691.09 towards PTK’s monthly expenses, while the Husband provides $1,460.79. She submits that going forward, the Husband should pay <u>70%</u> of monthly expenses for PTK, which is estimated at <b>A$4,904</b> once PTK attends university in Brisbane, Australia. It was explained that the Husband should bear a higher proportion of maintenance going forward as he had under-provided during the earlier years, and the Wife also has medical issues for which she has to incur expenditure in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Wife also asks for backdated maintenance of <b>$19,449.82</b> from April 2023 to October 2024, and a monthly sum of $653.20 thereafter each month from November 2024 to the date of hearing. This is because she had to shift out to her sister’s residence, on account of the Husband’s alleged family violence, and PTK wanted to move out as well (see paragraph 139 of PAM-2). This sum was adjusted at hearing to <b>$20,749.82</b>, as counsel for the Wife had omitted to include the cost of clothes and shoes from the month of October 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the mode of payment towards PTK’s expenses, the Wife proposed that this be by way of direct transfer from the Husband to PTK, so she would not have to chase for payments. For big-ticket items for which she had paid in advance, the Wife would seek reimbursement after submitting the relevant receipt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Finally, the Wife also sought spousal maintenance for a period of 12 months to allow her to transition and get her finances in order, should the Court not be prepared to grant her backdated maintenance, as she had spent nearly all of her money paying for the family’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     With regard to backdated maintenance, the Husband disputed the sum of $4,691.09 as representative of PTK’s monthly expenses. Specifically, he disputed her half-share of household expenses in the sum of $1,172.62, and objected to the following categories of items, which he said should only be reimbursed upon provision of proof of payment:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Special Moisturizer $177.12</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Medical and Dental $175</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Computer, mobile phone and digital $150</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Scalp Treatment $156</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Entertainment $100</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_f\"></a>(f)     School-related expenses $200</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Clothes and shoes $200</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Holidays $208</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Massage recovery $340</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I did not find that the Wife’s stated household expenses of $2,345.24, for which a half share of $1,172.62 was payable on PTK’s account, to be excessive. These included groceries ($500), wet market purchases ($200), domestic helper costs ($700), water utilities ($270), electricity utilities ($270) and MCST fee ($396.76). These appear to be normal household costs which I did not find to be unreasonable. As for the specific line items that are objected to subject to proof being provided, my views are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Special Moisturizer $177.12 – Evidence is provided in paragraph 84 of the Wife’s 2nd AOM affidavit (PAM-2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Medical and Dental $175 – This is a reasonable figure and will not be adjusted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Computer, mobile phone and digital $150 – this extrapolates to $1,800 a year for all digital devices, and is not adjusted as it appears to be reasonable for a polytechnic student.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Scalp Treatment $156 – Evidence is provided in paragraph 84 of Wife’s 2nd AOM affidavit (PAM-2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Entertainment $100 – Not adjusted as this sum is reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_f\"></a>(f)     School-related expenses $200 – Not adjusted as this sum is reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Clothes and shoes $200 – <u>Adjusted downwards by $100</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Holidays $208 – this sum amounts to $2,496 a year, and is not unreasonable for expenditure on one or two holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Massage recovery $340 – The Wife explains that these treatments are needed as PTK plays netball. The rate per session is $70, per page 411 of PAM-2. Husband’s position on this is that it should be $200 per month. <u>I reduced this figure by $130 to $210 per month</u>, on the basis that it would be fair to allow three sessions per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Applying these adjustments to the figures, the reduction of $50 for the Husband’s share of clothes and shoes applies across all 19 months from April 2023 to October 2024 (i.e. a reduction of $950). The reduction of $65 per month for the Husband’s share of massage recovery services applies for six months (from April 2023 to September 2023, as thereafter the Husband paid for his share of medical and massage costs on proof of receipt), and would amount to a reduction of $390. Accordingly, the total backdated maintenance should be reduced by $1,340, to a total of $19,409.82 for April 2023 to October 2024. For the months of November and December 2024, the Wife’s initial position was that the outstanding sum per month would be $653.20, which the Husband did not dispute. A further sum of $50 representing the Husband’s share of monthly expenses on clothing and shoes was added to this monthly figure, as the Wife’s counsel explained that this line item had been accidentally omitted from the Wife’s computation (the sum of $50 being half of the adjusted figure of $100 for clothing and shoes as explained above). Hence, I added $703.20 per month for November and December 2024, rendering the total backdated maintenance to be <b><u>$20,816.22</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Turning to future maintenance, the Husband’s position was that he is willing to share PTK’s maintenance equally, subject to proof of expenditure, especially for accommodation, mobile phone and internet line, school related expenses and clothing for different seasons (see page 35 of the Husband’s Written Submissions). This was premised on his position that he retains the entirety of his HUS Invest Funds when he retires upon reaching 56 years of age (which he does so retain in view of the division of assets decided above). By contrast, as mentioned above, the Wife estimated the monthly maintenance to be A$4,904, based on a guide provided by the university as to living expenses for students in Brisbane, and asked that the Husband pay 70% of this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Having considered the parties’ positions, I apportioned the share of maintenance payable by the husband as 55%, in direct proportion to the relative nett monthly income of the Husband and the Wife ($9,779.44 vs $7,946.00). However, as the Husband would reach the retirement age applicable to the police force at 57 years (i.e. 27 December 2026), I reduced his share to 50% effective from January 2027, in recognition of the fact that he would likely earn less in a post-retirement job.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As to the quantum of monthly maintenance for PTK, I did not find the Husband’s proposal that all expenses should be accompanied by proof to be reasonable or sustainable. It would be invidious and oppressive to require the daughter to come up with receipts for every single item of expenditure. Instead, I adjourned the hearing for parties to consider what a baseline cost would be, and for larger ticket items to be resolved in the proportion decided by the court upon proof of expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     At the resumed hearing, parties updated that they agreed to the following baseline costs for PTK:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Allowance – A$400,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Laundry – A$64,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Mobile phone and internet line – A$35,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Toiletries – A$100, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_e\"></a>(e)     School related expenses – A$100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Parties disagreed on the cost of food, transport and clothing. My decision on these items is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     With regard to food, the Wife’s position was that the monthly cost should be A$1,568, as recommended by the student guide provided by the university. The Husband’s position was that this should be A$400, on the basis that breakfast is provided as part of the accommodation cost and that meals can be cooked. As breakfast is provided, I discounted the recommended monthly cost of food from A$1,578 to A$1,100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With regard to transport, the Wife’s position was that this should be A$200, while the Husband claimed it should be A$100 as the accommodation is a ten minute walk from the school. I considered that public transportation to locations other than the school would be a necessity for a student, and apportioned this sum midway between the parties’ positions at A$150.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With regard to clothing, the Husband’s position was that this should be zero as he had already purchased sufficient clothing for the daughter (he noted that her course would end in June 2026), and any specific purchase should be claimed on a reimbursement basis. The Wife took the view that A$200 is a fair sum, and pointed out that it was she who had bought much of the daughter’s clothing. I allocated A$100 a month for smaller ticket purchases, with larger ticket clothing purchases to be claimed ad-hoc on a reimbursement basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Based on what I had determined and what parties had agreed to, the baseline monthly maintenance for PTK would be A$2,049. Other larger-ticket expenditure should be specifically claimed on a reimbursement basis, such as accommodation (fixed at A$1,556 for every 4 weeks, subject to adjustment if revised), as well as clothing, school related expenses in excess of what is specified in the baseline, airfare, furniture, furnishings, purchases of digital devices, costs of opening bank account, medical and dental expenses. These large-ticket expenses should be payable directly by the parents in the proportion I had specified above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     For the avoidance of doubt, the baseline maintenance is to continue even if the daughter is in Singapore for the holidays, given that that such periods are short and variable, and it would be difficult to compute the exact quantum of costs that would accrue to the daughter over such short periods. All payments are also to be made directly to PTK’s bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Finally, no spousal maintenance is to be provided as the Wife had been working and was financially independent for the entire marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I heard parties on costs subsequent to the delivery of my brief grounds. The Wife asked for costs on an indemnity basis at $20,000, on the basis that a without prejudice offer had been made to the Husband on 4 December 2023, after mediation and exchange of financial documents, which was less favourable in terms of the division percentage than what had been granted by this court. Counsel for the Wife argued that the matter had been protracted unnecessarily by the Husband, with the hearing of these ancillary proceedings spanning three sessions, and a total of 19 affidavits filed by both parties in the course of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Counsel for the Husband strenuously objected to any costs being ordered, and contended that parties could not agree because key items were outstanding and disputed, including the valuation of the matrimonial home. He also noted that additional affidavits from the domestic helper were filed at the last minute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I considered parties’ submissions and noted that while the usual costs order in ancillary proceedings is for parties to bear their own costs, costs may nevertheless be ordered against a party who had been unreasonable and had caused delays and further costs to be incurred (<em>WRX v WRY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31799-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 22</a>, at [75]). In the present case, I took the view that the order of costs should be set at a level that would sufficiently instil discipline in proceedings and avoid unnecessary litigation. This case could have been resolved as far back as December 2023, when a more favourable without prejudice offer had been made to the Husband. Instead, the Husband chose to dispute individual line items and payments to a minutiae of detail, which added unnecessarily to the complexity and duration of these ancillary proceedings. It also bears noting that the Wife prevailed on a significantly greater number of contested issues in these proceedings than the Husband. For these reasons, I ordered the Husband to pay costs to the Wife, fixed at $10,000 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The ancillary orders are granted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Division of matrimonial assets</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    By Consent, paragraphs (a)-(d) are ordered as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a.    In relation to the payout from PruEduSave Policy No. XXXX6162, the Husband shall pay the sum of <b>S$15,831.50</b> to the designated bank account of PTK upon the commencement of her overseas education in Australia.

In this prayer, the mother sought a one-off school holiday with the children at her sole election during 2025 in lieu of her entitlement to the children for a one-off school holiday on 4 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(ii)     She appeals the orders made in favour of the father in prayers 6 and 7 of FC/SUM 3397/2024. Prayer 6 of the father’s summons deals with the same subject matter as the mother’s prayer 6 of FC/SUM 3216/2024. The father sought an order that in consideration of the mother having the children for a school holiday on 4 October 2024 and in accordance with the parties' agreement of 1 October 2024, the father would be entitled to an additional single-day school holiday at a time of his choosing (including in 2025) on giving reasonable notice to the wife. I granted an order in terms of the father’s prayer, leading to a dismissal of the mother’s prayer 6 in FC/SUM 3216/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iii)     In prayer 7 of FC/SUM 3397/2024, the father sought make up access in consideration of the fact that the children were with the mother on 31 August and 1 September 2024. He sought make up access on an additional public holiday at a time of his choosing and an additional Sunday at a time of his choosing on giving (including in 2025) reasonable notice to the mother. I granted an order in terms of this prayer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief background </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties were married on xx July 2011, and they have 2 children, a daughter who will be turning 10 years old in 2025 and a son who will turn 8 years old this year (‘the children’).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The father is about 52 and is a Barrister/Mediator/Arbitrator. The mother is about 42 years of age, and she also has a law degree as well as a master’s in law. She is currently a teacher in an international school. The parties are citizens of the United Kingdom (“UK”) with the father holding dual citizenship with Australia and the mother holding dual citizenship in Ireland.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The parties relocated to Singapore in February 2012, some 6 months after their marriage. The parties have lived in Singapore since February 2012. The parties are permanent residents of Singapore. Both children are attending local schools.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The husband filed a writ for divorce in July 2018. Interim judgment was granted on 5 March 2019. The contested ancillary matters (AM) were heard on 16 and 19 September 2019. I reserved decision and delivered the AM orders on 8 October 2019 with clarifications on 9 and 14 October 2019. Final judgement was extracted on 23 December 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The father appealed the AM orders in their entirety and the appeal was heard before the High Court Family Division. The High Court also dealt with related summonses in HCF/DCA 127/2019, HCF/SUM 289/2019, HCF/SUM 324/2019, HCF/SUM 55/2020, HCF/RAS 10/2020, HCF/SUM 163/2020, HCF/SUM 244/2020, HCF/RAS 27/2020, HCF/SUM 340/2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The High Court made orders on 11 March 2021. In rendering his decision, the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon (as he then was) made the following remarks which I set out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“141  Before concluding, I add the following remarks. Once the division of matrimonial assets and maintenance in the divorce issues are resolved, the parties should give serious consideration to becoming more accommodating towards each other in dealing with the matters concerning the Children, rather than continuously utilising their forensic skills to seek resolution in court all the time. This is especially so when the matters in dispute are administrative and not legal in nature. Moreover, as the Children grow up day by day, and enter different stages of their lives, such as beginning formal education, adjustments would necessarily have to be made to the current orders. Handling such adjustments in a more amicable way cannot be but in the best interests of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">142    When last counted, there were 26 summonses filed in D 3162, the divorce suit. There were four appeals to the High Court Family Division from decisions in the Family Court, in which a total of four summonses have been filed. There was also an originating summons filed in the Family Court concerning the permanent relocation of the Children, and an originating summons filed in the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal the decision in RAS 10. All these were filed since July 2018, less than three years ago. The Children were aged three and one then, and are now six and four years old, respectively. They will reach majority at 18 in 12 to 14 years. It is a very heavy burden for parties to bear if they continue to choose to resolve disputes for the remaining of those years in the manner and at the rate they have chosen so far. I accept that the Children are still very young and may not now understand the conflicts taking place between the parties. But they will grow up and soon discover what is taking place between their parents. The conflicts will affect them, and it is not fair to them to be made to bear the same heavy burden as well.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Notwithstanding this advice, after the conclusion of the appeal in March 2021, the parties filed 41 applications and 505 affidavits between April 2021 and December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The children were aged 3 and 1 when the divorce proceedings started. They are now turning 10 and 8 respectively. The marriage was contracted in July 2011 and ended in Interim Judgment in March 2019 subsisting some 8 years. But at the rate of the litigation parties decide to embroil in, the years they spend in litigation will soon outstrip the length of the marriage in no time. Indeed, these children have spent much of their childhood thus far with parents mired in litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     This latest appeal by the mother is a case in point. I have set out the crux of the appeal which is the mother’s dissatisfaction over what she perceived as her entitled time with the children over 3 dates: 4 October 2024, 31 August 2024 and 1 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Before setting out the reasons for my decision, I also refer parties to <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> in which the Appellate Division (the AD) gave guidance to parties that parents should, in considering their children’s changing needs, exercise grace and flexibility in co-parenting and make arrangements in the best interests of their children: [18]. The AD also referred to <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> (at [24]): Instead of litigating in the courts for the variation of orders, parents should endeavour to make adjustments by agreement to the care and access orders where necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is unfortunate that 7 years after their divorce was granted, these parties continue to be locked in acrimonious litigation over issues pertaining to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Dismissal of Prayer 6 of FC/SUM 3216/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order in terms of prayer 6 of FC/SUM 3397/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">4 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The issue pertained to with whom the children were to be with on 4 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The mother sought an order that she should be entitled to make up access on 4 October 2024 whilst the father sought an order giving effect to an express agreement between the parties with regard to an equal split of school holiday for the period 30 August to 7 September 2024. Resulting from this agreement, the children were to be with the mother on 4 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As set out, according to the mother, the parties agreed to a split of the children’s school holiday for the period 30 August to 7 September 2024. On 26 August 2024, the mother said that she spotted an alleged erroneous calculation of that school holiday period but as parties had made their respective plans with the children for their share of that period, she proceeded with the agreement. However, because of the erroneous split, she said that the alternating entitlements of the parties shifted with the result that the school holiday after the term break fell to the father and the next one (4 October 2024) to the mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The make-up time with the children she sought therefore pertained to what the mother said stemmed from the erroneous calculation of that school holiday period. As a result of this alleged erroneous calculation by the father, the mother took the view that she had been disadvantaged. She offered to keep the arrangements the parties had agreed to but sought another 1.5 days with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The husband’s position was straightforward. There was no reason to grant the order sought by the wife as the children were in fact with her on that day. This was pursuant to an express written agreement detailing how the parties were to share the time with the children. The husband said that the agreement was set out in an exchange of emails on 1 October 2024 exhibited in the husband’s affidavit filed on 25 October 2024 at pages 32 to 33.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     My decision was likewise straightforward – it was predicated on the parties’ written agreement. Notwithstanding calculations and division of days, parties are always at liberty to agree between themselves on the sharing of time with the children. I refer to paragraph 11 above. In line with co-parenting and considering the children’s needs and welfare, the parties reached an agreement. The agreement was not disputed. The mother herself said she would comply with the agreement as arrangements had been made for the children. She proceeded with her share of that school holiday period in accordance with the agreement. The time sharing of the children for that school holiday period was spent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having reached such an agreement and acting in accordance with the agreement, the mother then raised an issue with an alleged erroneous calculation. She sought to impose “penalties” on the father by claiming an extra 1.5 days with the children. When she filed the summons, it became a replacement of one day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although she did have the children with her on 4 October 2024, the mother sought a replacement one day “in lieu of her entitlement to the children for a one-off school holiday on 4 October 2024”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     From what I can surmise, the mother’s disgruntlement stemmed from the definition of school holidays and the application to that particular school holiday period. For completeness, this definition (of school holidays) was dealt with by the High Court in its decision of 11 March 2021 in which the Court defined school holidays for the parties as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[83] The Husband has asked that school holidays be defined, and the Wife has agreed to the draft definition in the AC. This draft was revised by the Husband in the Appellant's Speaking Notes ... to cover multi-day school holidays. I substitute para 16 of [the AM Orders] with the following, based on the revised draft:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">School holidays are to be equally shared between the parties. A school holiday shall, for the purposes of these Orders, be a non-teaching day as stated in the children’s school calendar (“the calendar”). In the case of a multi-day school holiday, the school holiday commences on the first non-teaching day of the holiday break as stated in the calendar and shall continue until the day before the first teaching day as stated in the calendar. In all cases, a school holiday shall run from 5:30pm on the eve of the day until 7:30pm on the day itself. ...&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     However, the point to be noted is not the definition of school holidays or whether there was an erroneous calculation <em>but</em> that parties had an agreement. They both acted on the said agreement; the school holiday period in question had lapsed and the mother had the children with her on 4 October 2024 in reliance on that agreement. Indeed, in the spirit of co-parenting, the parties have been enjoined repeatedly to agree on time sharing with their children as they are best placed to determine this. Having done so, the mother should not press on to claim a disadvantage of a loss of one day with the children with whom she has care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The mother is also not a naïve litigant in person. She is legally trained and has fired many salvos herself in the litigation arena with applications for time sharing, clarification of time sharing and the filing of many affidavits. Having agreed with the father on the holiday period in question, she should not now be permitted to backtrack and claim an additional day. There was no basis for this Court to grant the relief sought in prayer 6 of the mother's Summons and this prayer was accordingly dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Order in terms of prayer 7 of FC/SUM 3397/2024 – make up access to the father</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">31 August and 1 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The children had a mid-term break in the week of 2 to 6 September 2024. On Friday 30 August, the children did not have to attend school because it was Children's Day. 31 August was a Saturday, and this was the father’s time with the children pursuant to the AM Orders. 1 September was a Sunday and Father’s Day and meant for the father to spend time with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The parties had agreed that 30 August 2024 was a single-day school holiday and that this day was meant for the father. Father’s Day was also meant for the father. This then led to the multi-day school holiday in the week of 2 to 6 September which would include the weekend of 7 and 8 September. The parties agreed to the calculation of 7 days (2 to 8 September 2024) and the mother agreed to take the first half as this was again, an equal split. This was set out in emails in pages 35 to 36 of the father’s affidavit filed on 25 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     However, 3 days before handover to the father, the mother claimed that Children’s Day on 30 August 2024 also formed part of the multi-day school holiday starting on 2 September 2024. This led to emails being sent as referred to in pages 23 to 32 of the mother’s affidavit of 8 October 2024. The mother was only prepared to let the father have the children from Tuesday 3 September 2024. This was notwithstanding that parties had reached an agreement on time sharing as set out in paragraph 26 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Because of the mother’s change in position, again departing from an agreement at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour, the father did not see the children on 30 August 2024 (his entitlement pursuant to the definition of a single-day school holiday), Saturday which was part of his weekend access order pursuant to the AM orders and more pertinently, on Father’s Day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The parties had agreed to the arrangement with the school holidays to be divided between them from 2 to 8 September 2024. Because the mother resiled on the agreement and retained the children with her depriving the father of his single-day school holiday, his Saturday access and Father’s Day, the father was therefore entitled to the make-up access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The parties subsequently agreed to a replacement and swapped single-day school holiday which resolved the issue of replacement time for the father on 30 August 2024. The father was therefore entitled to the make-up access for his loss of access on 31 August 2024 and 1 September 2024 and I so ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Whilst the High Court had defined single-day school holidays and multi-school holidays (see paragraph 11 above), the parties have managed to agree and rework time sharing of their children considering the children’s needs and welfare as well as the parties’ own schedules. It is important for the parties to agree and resolve this time sharing of their children without the Court’s intervention; they are, after all, the children’s parents. It is also not right to agree on an arrangement and then throw it out on the 11<sup>th</sup> hour then insisting on “rights” and “claims”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The parties would do well to move away from their perceived entitled positions and think in terms of what would work best for the children with the least movement for handovers. At the crux of this matter, the issues are not legal issues. These are parenting matters, and it is unfortunate that their inability to co-parent spawned an appeal for 3 dates of access/make-up time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I have said before that these parties would benefit from the assistance of a parenting coordinator or a mediator as they are wasting precious time in drafting affidavits and filing applications ironically about time sharing with the children; time which would have been better spent with their children. I hope for the children’s sake that the parties would heed the advice of the Court as set out in paragraph 8.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Division of matrimonial assets","Family law – Custody – Access to Children","Family law – Child – Maintenance of Child"],"date":"2025-02-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 5338 of 2022","title":"WZH v WZI","citation":"[2025] SGFC 15","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32931-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Alain Abraham Johns and Ms Emira Binte Abdul Razakjr (Alain A Johns Partnership) for the Plaintiff","Mr Muhammad Hasif Bin Abdul Aziz (A.W.

The Plaintiff-Husband (“Husband”) and the Defendant-Wife (“Wife”) registered their marriage on 25 September 2018 and, although the parties were blessed with two children in their time together, the Husband filed for divorce on 17 November 2022 (shortly after the Wife’s departure from their matrimonial home a month earlier).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Interim judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was eventually granted on 13 December 2023. Thereafter, the parties spent the following year preparing for the eventual ancillary matters (“AM”) hearing which came before me in November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the AM hearing, both parties’ counsel confirmed the following to the Court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties have since agreed that both parents should share joint custody of the children of the marriage, [K] (5 years old) and [R] (3 years old) (collectively referred to as, the “Children”), with the Wife having sole care and control.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife was not seeking any maintenance post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The remaining AM issues (<em>ie.</em> the division of matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), the maintenance payable for the Children, as well as the Husband’s access arrangements) were disputed. However, counsel acknowledged that the parties’ disagreement on the issue of access were not significant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After hearing parties, I provided my brief grounds of decision to the parties via a Registrar’s Notice sent pursuant to r. 670(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I now set out below my full grounds of decision on the contested AM issues below, starting with the issue of the Children’s access arrangement (given the parties’ broad agreement on the matter).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Access to the Children of the Marriage</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As stated above, both parties agreed that the Wife should be granted care and control of the Children. Accordingly, it was also not disputed that the Husband should be allowed access to the Children. The question, however, was what the terms of the access order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       What was somewhat unusual in the present case was the Wife’s request for the Court to make orders which were, in some situations, <em>more generous</em> than what the Husband had asked for. The Court was therefore asked to decide whether it was reasonable for the Husband to be given <em>less</em> access than what was being offered by the Wife. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife asked this Court to order that the Husband be given <em>weekly</em> unsupervised overnight access from Sunday to Monday. In addition, she also asked that the Husband be given access to the Children during every public holiday, and that the Husband take overnight access on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year (“CNY”) public holiday to the 2<sup>nd</sup> day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     However, it was the Husband’s position, in his written submissions, that he only wanted access every Sunday (with no overnight stay), and that he be given overnight access <em>once a month</em> from Saturday morning to Sunday evening. He also only sought access on <em>alternate</em> public holidays, and from the CNY eve to CNY Day 1 during the CNY festive period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That said, during the AM hearing, the Husband’s counsel confirmed that the Husband was prepared to accept what the Wife had proposed with regard to public holiday and CNY access. As such, I made the relevant orders accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     What remained disputed were the weekly unsupervised access arrangements, and various additional orders relating to <em>inter alia</em> overseas access and the Children’s place of residence (the latter of which I shall come to, below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     At the outset, I wish to point out that if the Wife’s proposals were indeed borne out of her hope that the Husband spends more time with the Children – as she had claimed in her submissions – this was indicative of a positive mindset towards effective co-parenting and should be encouraged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The importance of such an approach and mindset, which in some cases means helping <em>the other parent</em> to be stronger, was highlighted by the High Court (Family Division) in <em>VXM v VXN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26996-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 42</a> (at [53]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“[i]f it is in the welfare of the children to require parents to be cooperative with the other parent, to extend grace, and even to help the other parent to be a stronger parent if needed, then these <em>needs of the children prevail over</em> the personal needs of the individual parents.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Nevertheless, the Court would be alive to the fact that while an access parent should be given ample opportunity to build a stronger bond with his or her children, the orders themselves must cater to the children’s readiness <em>and</em> to the access parent’s ability to meet the terms of the orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     After all, orders requiring an access parent to be available or present during specific timeframes and/or extended periods themselves impose a positive obligation on that parent to meet and follow the terms of such orders. Such orders – if overly extensive – may sometimes create discord between the parties, or even disappointment on the part of the children, if the access parent refuses or is otherwise unable to comply with the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It is therefore important for the Court to undertake a holistic assessment as to what orders would ultimately be in the Children’s “welfare” and best interests: see s 125(2), WC. This involves a multi-faceted and multi-factorial analysis, and which should be understood in its widest sense (see <em>IW v IX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/49688-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 135</a>). In my view, such an analysis may sometimes include <em>inter alia</em> the access parent’s personal wishes and his or her ability to meet the terms of any orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having considered the matter, I decided not to make all the orders sought by the Wife, as I do not find them to be in the Children’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Instead, I broadly agree with the Husband’s proposed orders (including those orders sought by the Wife which he was prepared to accept) which I found to be appropriate in the circumstances. I therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Subject to (b) below, the Husband shall have unsupervised access to the Children, every week from 10.30 am to 8.00 pm on Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall have unsupervised overnight access to the Children on the last Saturday of every month from 10.30 am on Saturday to Sunday 8.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With effect from the date of this Order, the Husband shall have access to the Children on every Public Holidays (excluding the CNY holidays) from 10.30 am to 8.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     During CNY public holiday period, the Husband shall have access on CNY Day 1 from 10.30 am to the CNY Day 2 at 10.30 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Subject to any agreement between the parties, the Husband shall pick up the Children from their place of residence at the beginning of access, and shall return them on or before the end of the access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Wife is to take all necessary steps to facilitate the aforesaid access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I now address the three (3) remaining disputed issues between the parties. These relate to <em>overseas</em> access, video-call access and the disclosure of the Children’s residential address.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     To begin with, I found it bizarre that the question of overseas access was raised by the Wife in her submissions when the Husband was clear that he was <em>not</em> seeking any orders for overseas access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Husband recognised that overseas access was an issue which both parties may have to revisit when the Children are ready to go overseas with him. The Husband’s position was that this should be a matter which both parents can discuss and resolve amongst themselves later on.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife, on the other hand, asked that the Court make a positive order forbidding the Husband from taking the Children for overseas access until the parties’ younger child turns 13 years old. For context, their younger child, [R], was only 3 years old (in 2024). Such an order meant that I would be effectively granting a 10-year injunction against the Husband from travelling overseas with the Children even though: (i) no order for overseas travel had even been sought by the Husband; and (ii) neither the Wife nor her counsel could provide any clear or cogent reasons why I should make such a prospective order, and for the number of years sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Having considered the matter, I decided not to make any orders relating to overseas access. Any such order would be entirely speculative (at the present juncture) and not grounded on any legitimate basis. Should the need arise, the question of overseas access should be dealt with separately and/or in subsequent proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nevertheless, I strongly encourage the Wife – given what I had mentioned above about the need to be a bigger, stronger and wiser parent – to approach this issue with the same mindset she had adopted on the issue of Husband’s weekly and public holiday access. Children thrive when their parents act as role models and demonstrate to them that disputes and differences can be resolved through calm discussion and mutual understanding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I next deal with the issue of the Husband’s video call access. The Wife’s written submissions did not address this issue directly although she did refer to an existing consent order <em>vis-à-vis</em> interim care and control and access (<em>vide.</em> FC/ORC xxx/2023) where there was provision for weekly video call access. The Husband’s position was that the existing video-call access arrangement should remain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I was of the view that video-call access, which were already part of the existing <em>consent</em> order between the parties, should continue since there was no good reason put forth by either party to change this arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For good order, as orders made in the AM proceedings were a form of <em>final</em> relief, I made the same video-call access orders (as part of my overall AM orders) so that it was clear between the parties that FC/ORC xxx/2023 has since been superseded by my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The final issue between the parties relate to whether the Wife should be made to disclose to the Husband, the Children’s residential address.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the Husband’s counsel had highlighted at the AM hearing, the Wife had steadfastly refused to disclose the Children’s and her residential address, even going as far as redacting all such reference and information in the documents she had filed in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my view, it was ancillary to, and consequential upon, the custody and access orders which were made <em>vis-a-vis</em> the Children for the Husband to also be provided with such information. I therefore agreed with the Husband that the Wife should be made to inform him of the Children’s residential address. To avoid doubt, the Court is empowered to impose such conditions as it may think fit to impose when making an order for the custody or care and control of the Children: see ss 126(1) and (2A), WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Being a joint custodial parent, I find that it was reasonable for the Husband to know where the Children live, in the event that he has to make any custodial decision and/or in the case of health emergencies. He would also need to know where he should pick up or return the Children for access. Neither party provided any evidence to suggest that the Husband was (or continues to be) a threat or danger to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In this regard, the Wife did advance some allegations regarding her personal safety. However, such concerns (if at all) relate to her <em>personal</em> safety and not the <em>Children’s</em>. In any case, these would already have been addressed by the personal protection order she had obtained against the Husband in separate proceedings. I see no reason for these concerns to justify withholding the Children’s place of residence from the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of Matrimonial Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I now move on to the address the major dispute between the parties, <em>viz.</em> the just and equitable division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Matrimonial pool of assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I start by addressing the assets within the parties’ matrimonial pool (“Matrimonial Pool”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In the present case, both parties had filed their respective Fact and Position Sheets setting out each party’s position on what fell within the Matrimonial Pool, prior to the AM hearing. The Wife’s counsel was also subsequently granted leave to file a revised version to account for some discrepancies which was highlighted during the hearing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     With regard to their matrimonial home, both counsel confirmed that the parties’ property at Ghim Moh Road (“Matrimonial Flat”) fell within the Matrimonial Pool and should be valued at the agreed figure of $435,000. After taking into account the outstanding mortgage loan, the net value of the Matrimonial Flat would be approximately $204,677.50 (<em>ie.</em> adopting the Husband’s calculations for the outstanding mortgage amount).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As regards the Wife’s assets (save for the issue of dissipation which I will address below), I make the following broad findings and/or observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties were largely in agreement <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Wife’s cash (or cash-equivalent) assets held in her sole name. Although there were some discrepancies and differences in the original Fact and Position Sheet filed by the Wife, her revised version broadly aligned with what the Husband had stated in his own Fact and Position Sheet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In total, I found the Wife to be holding assets amounting to approximately $528,970.38 (excluding the value of her motor vehicle, her branded handbag, and her cryptocurrency). For completeness, it was not disputed that the Wife had used the monies in her Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) account to purchase a “GRO Saver Flex” policy. During the AM hearing, the Husband – through his counsel – accepted the Wife’s valuation figure of $12,254.24 for this asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     With regard to the Wife’s car, the parties disagreed as to the value which should be ascribed to this asset. The Wife submitted that the value of car was only $19,926.78, while the Husband submitted that the car’s <em>purchase</em> value (<em>ie.</em> $56,273.62) should be used instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I agreed with the Husband that the car’s purchase value (and not its estimated present value) should be used. It was not disputed that the car in question was purchased <em>after</em> the commencement of the present divorce proceedings, but before IJ was granted. The Husband did not consent to this expenditure and to the Wife’s use of matrimonial funds to acquire this asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In my view, this situation fell squarely within the ambit of what is referred to as the “<em>TNL dicta”</em> (drawn from the Court of Appeal’s seminal decision in <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31659-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 437</a> (“<em>WOS</em>”), the Appellate Division of the High Court explained that the <em>TNL dicta</em> recognises that “<em>substantial sums expended during the period where divorce proceedings are imminent must be returned to the asset pool if the other spouse has at least a putative interest in it and has not consented, either expressly or impliedly, to the expenditure either before it was incurred or at any subsequent time</em>”: see <em>WOS</em> at [43].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_g\"></a>(g)     As such, the monies expended by the Wife in acquiring her car should be accounted for. If the Wife had used some $56,273.62 to acquire what she now values at less than $20,000, then this “loss” was one which the Husband should not be responsible for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_h\"></a>(h)     With regard to the Wife’s branded handbag, there was some dispute between the parties as to its value. The difference is comparatively minor – the Husband valued it at $1,500 more than the Wife. Unfortunately, I was not persuaded by the Husband’s evidence of value (which comprised internet printouts/articles regarding the value of branded ladies’ handbags<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>) which did not relate to the <em>actual</em> value of the Wife’s bag and, more importantly, did not account for its condition and re-sale value. As the Husband did not discharge his burden of proof, I adopted the Wife’s valuation of $3,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I now turn to the Wife’s cryptocurrency assets. This was a significant dispute given the <em>amount</em> involved, <em>ie.</em> $176,898.88 (being the value ascribed by the Husband) as compared to $72,947 (based on the Wife’s own declaration). As with the Wife’s car, I found it relevant to apply the <em>TNL dicta</em> to resolve this dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     To put matters in context, the Wife had liquidated approximately $103,000 worth of the parties’ cryptocurrency on the pretext that she had to use the same to pay for her and the family’s expenses. The Wife sought to provide <em>reasons</em> for her use of these funds because the principle underlying the <em>TNL dicta</em> allows for “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” expenses used for the family to be exempted from its application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Yet, as the Wife’s counsel rightly conceded during the AM hearing, the monies which the Wife was shown to have used to pay her solicitors, and her mother could not be reasonably be said to constitute “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” expenses which are exempted from the application of the <em>TNL dicta</em>. These transactions alone accounted for approximately 60% of the significant payments and/or withdrawals she had made from monies she received in 2023 from liquidating the cryptocurrency assets. The remaining withdrawals were payments to herself, or for her credit card expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Overall, I found it appropriate to return to the Matrimonial Pool the sum of $76,050, being $103,000 (which was the amount received by the Wife from the liquidation of the relevant cryptocurrencies) less $22,050 (being $2,450 x 9 months). I have allowed for the deduction of $22,050 as recognition of the household and/or the Children’s expenses which the Wife had to bear during the relevant period using the liquidated funds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I note that at [17] of District Judge Darryl Soh’s (“DJ Soh”) Oral Grounds of Judgment (“DJ Soh’s Judgment”) in FC/SUM 1827/2023 (<em>ie.</em> the Wife’s earlier interim maintenance application), DJ Soh had declined to make an order for backdated maintenance in view of the fact that the Wife had “<em>access to and used matrimonial funds to pay for her and the Children’s expenses</em>”. I therefore accept that part of proceeds from the sale of the cryptocurrencies went to sustain the family’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The figure of $2,450 I had used was consistent with the maintenance amount which DJ Soh had ordered in FC/SUM 1827/2023 (“Interim Maintenance Order”). I found this amount to be a reasonable proxy of what would have been “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” family expenses during the relevant period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Accordingly, I valued the Wife’s total sole named assets to be <u>$664,294.</u> This figure included her CPF monies, car, other cash assets, as well as the amount returned to the Matrimonial Pool arising from her liquidation of the cryptocurrency assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I now move on to the Husband’s sole named assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The parties were largely <em>ad idem</em> on most of the Husband’s assets,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> save for one significant item – the alleged dissipation of assets by the Husband. In the Wife’s revised written submissions, she submitted that I should “add-back” a total of $706,455<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> to the Matrimonial Pool because the Husband had dissipated this amount through allegedly clandestine or suspicious transfers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having carefully considered the evidence presented, I agreed with the Wife that some of the bank transactions entered into by the Husband were not “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” and should be returned to the Matrimonial Pool pursuant to the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Although not strictly necessary, I also accept the Wife’s submission that some of the Husband’s other transactions/payments were not properly explained and there was a strong suggestion that the Husband had attempted to conceal assets from her and the Court. In my view, an adverse inference can also be drawn against the Husband in respect of these transactions with the same effect that these assets should be notionally “added back” to the Matrimonial Pool for the purpose of the AM proceedings. I shall explain my findings, below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     First, I wish to make clear what <em>I did not</em> find to be suspicious transactions and/or transactions falling within the ambit of the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Contrary to the Wife’s submissions, I did not find the Husband’s withdrawals (of up to $1,000) from his OCBC and POSB bank accounts to be an attempt to dissipate assets, nor were they significant transactions falling within the <em>TNL dicta</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I accept the Husband’s submission that these were used to pay for his personal expenses, or as allowance to his parents (out of filial piety). In reaching this conclusion, I took into account the Husband’s earning capacity, and the lifestyle he was maintaining (and was entitled to maintain) at the material time. Likewise, I do not find the payment of $1,565 to one [S] (his accountant) to be inappropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Indeed, the Wife’s claim in this regard appeared to be based on her subjective belief as to what were the Husband’s attempts to dissipate assets. As the Husband’s counsel pointed out during the AM hearing, the Wife herself could have been said to be similarly “dissipating” assets since she spent monies of similar amounts. I found the Wife’s approach – which was primarily based on what she believed to be “large” transactions undertaken by the Husband post-divorce proceedings – to be too speculative. Moreover, I agreed with the Husband’s submission that some of the transactions identified by the Wife were, in fact, transactions <em>between</em> the Husband’s own bank accounts (for eg. the transaction said to have occurred in January and March 2023)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> – this reflected the speculative (and, possibly, over-inclusive) nature of the Wife’s approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I also did not agree with the Wife that the transaction involving $19,900 in November 2022 was an act of dissipation, or an instance of profligate spending. I accepted the Husband’s explanation that this was a payment for stamp duty to the tax authorities. In my view, this is supported by his bank transaction record showing payment to the commissioner for stamp duties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The only item which I found to be within the scope of the <em>TNL dicta</em> was the Husband’s withdrawal and subsequent payment of $10,000 his mother. The Husband argued that this was meant to fund his mother’s medical expenses, but I agreed with the Wife’s submission that he had not discharged his burden to explain the said expense.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> No documentary proof was adduced to support his explanation. This amount ought to be “added-back” to the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I now move on to a key aspect of the Wife’s case, <em>viz.</em> the significant monies the Husband had transferred to one [RK] in 2022 and 2023. In total, the Husband had transferred $420,000 to [RK] (out of the alleged amount $706,445 which the Wife claimed had been dissipated).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Husband did not dispute that the monies were indeed transferred to [RK]. However, his position was that these were legitimate transactions paid pursuant to contractual agreements between [RK] and him. To support his claim, he exhibited 2 “business agreements” he had signed with [RK] on two dates – <em>ie.</em> 1 November 2022 and 1 November 2023 (collectively, the “BAs”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife strenuously disputed the propriety and reliability of these 2 BAs. To buttress her arguments, the Wife pointed to the unusual timings of these contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     With regard to the 2022 BA, the Wife highlighted that the relevant $180,000 transfer to [RK] occurred on 8 December 2022, shortly after the Husband had liquidated certain time deposits from one of his investment products.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> As regards the 2023 BA, a sum of $240,000 was transferred to RK two (2) days after the Husband had received the surrender monies for his SingLife policy.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Having reviewed the evidence provided, I agreed with the Wife that the nature and circumstances surrounding the creation and/or execution of the 2 BAs to be highly suspect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Putting aside the apparent visual similarity between the 2 documents (which, as the Wife had pointed out, were identical in form using the same fonts and linguistic style), the BAs themselves were <em>digital</em> documents (in the sense that the BAs were stored in an electronic form, with the signatures appended electronically) containing almost identical clauses and terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The two BAs even contained the same errors and/or surplusage in language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For eg. the preamble of the 2022 BA, somewhat oddly, states that the “Client” (<em>ie.</em> the Husband) wanting to obtain [RK]’s “<em>professional attributions</em>” without any clear explanation of what “attributions” means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Both BAs erroneously defined a period of time (eg. the period from November 2022 to October 2023) as the “<em>Effective Date</em>”, when a period of time is clearly not a “date” <em>per se</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In any event, the phrase “<em>Effective Date</em>” is never used anywhere else in either contract thus rendering the use of a defined term entirely meaningless and superfluous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     While these visual and linguistic peculiarities, in and of themselves, do not automatically imply that the BAs were unenforceable or a sham, they operate as indicators suggesting that the BAs were, in fact, not the product of detailed negotiations nor were they prepared as part of an arms’ length deal. These features took on some importance given the significant <em>monetary value</em> involved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     What was more concerning was the <em>complete</em> lack of details and clarity in the legal terms and obligations arising from the BAs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     To begin with, the BAs were entirely silent on the <em>specific obligations</em> which each of the Husband and [RK] had actually taken on in these contracts. Other than the BAs stating – in its preamble – that the Husband wishes to obtain [RK]’s so-called “<em>professional attributions</em>” (whatever such a term meant in the 2022 BA) or “<em>professional services</em>” (in the 2023 BA), the contracts themselves say nothing as to how, when, and to whom such “attributions” or “services” were to be rendered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I should highlight that the description of the “services” to be rendered by [RK] were wholly vague – the terms used were, for eg. “<em>Administrative Support</em>”, “<em>Production Developments</em> and “<em>Life Coaching</em>”, none of which were defined or explained in either BA. The payment terms were similarly lacking in clarity and detail – it merely states a sum of money “<em>paid upfront for full 12 months contract</em>” without stating who was to pay what to whom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The <em>absence</em> of what would have been critical terms was equally telling. There was no express term on how and when [RK] was to provide his services, including whether he was entitled to any time off and/or whether he was meant to work for the Husband round the clock. There were no terms whatsoever on the issue of breach – nothing was said as to what would happen if [RK] had failed to provide the services sought, or if they were of a poor quality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     One would assume it would have been crucial for such terms to be included when parties negotiate a contract for services. Otherwise, the Husband appeared to be content to part ways with approximately a quarter of a million dollars “upfront” <em>without any recourse</em> should the counterparty later renege on his obligations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     This lack of clarity thus fortified the Wife’s allegation that it was highly unusual for the Husband to “increase” the contractual value by $60,000 (or a 30% increase from the 2022 BA’s contractual value) in the 2023 BA even though [RK] was providing the exact same work or served to the Husband. Why did the Husband decide to “pay” even more money to [RK] without any corresponding increase in any of [RK]’s obligations?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The above concerns neatly dovetailed with the <em>timing</em> of the BAs. I accept that the Wife’s point that so-called payments pursuant to the two BAs appeared too conveniently timed with when the Husband received funds through the liquidation of his other matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     I also took note of the obvious <em>inconsistency</em> between the date of the transfers and the alleged payment terms of the BAs. As observed earlier, the BAs (which were sparsely drafted) contained only 1 payment-related term, <em>ie.</em> that the full contract sum was “<em>paid upfront for full 12 months contract</em>”. Yet, it was plain from the dates of the actual transfers that the contract sum was <em>not</em> in fact “paid upfront” as envisaged under the BAs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In respect of the 2022 BA, the payment to [RK] took place <em>more than 1 month</em> after the contract was purportedly signed on 1 November 2023. The Husband provided no evidence to show that he had negotiated with [RK] any separate payment arrangement or agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In other words, either the Husband was in breach of the 2022 BA the minute it was signed, or [RK] had agreed to perform work free of charge for more than a month without any expectation to be paid. Either way, I did not find these possibilities to be persuasive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Similarly, for the 2023 BA, payment to RK was not done “upfront”, and occurred only 1 week later. This was highly unusual given that by 2023, the parties presumably would have already been in a contractual relationship for close to one year, and knowing full well that the 2022 BA would be coming to an end by 31 October 2024. If parties were desirous to extend their contractual relationship, the Husband should have known when he would be in a position to pay [RK]. Yet, the parties chose to sign an agreement where payment was stated to have been done “upfront” even though no such payment would be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Although each of the aforesaid issues – when considered individually – may possibly be explained by the Husband’s and/or [RK]’s inattention to detail as laypersons or mere oversight, the overall picture suggests a complete lack of care and/or interest in the actual enforceability or legality of the BAs. The BAs appeared to have been hastily drafted by the Husband to explain, <em>ex post facto</em>, the monies he had transferred to [RK].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I therefore conclude that the BAs were created by the Husband with the intent of giving a veil of legitimacy for the transfers he had made to [RK]. In my view, the <em>true</em> purpose of the transfers was to conceal and/or hide what would have been matrimonial assets liable for division. There was sufficient evidence and basis to support the drawing of an adverse inference against the Husband: see <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [68].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In any event, regardless of the BAs’ legitimacy, I find that the payments to [RK] were made using matrimonial monies without the Wife’s consent, and do not constitute “<em>run-of-the-mill</em>” expenses. They were also not ordinary business expenses as it was not at all clear why [RK] were paid those amounts given the nature of the services to be provided by him, and the lack of clarity as to his precise scope of work. The 30% increment paid to [RK] in 2023 was also not supported by good reason or cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In the circumstances, I found that a sum of $430,000 (being $420,000 transferred to RK, and the $10,000 transferred to the Husband’s mother) should be notionally “returned” to the Matrimonial Pool, and be subject to division in the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In light of my findings above, the parties’ Matrimonial Pool would be as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\">

Division: Appropriate Methodology &amp; Approach</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Having addressed the contents and value of the Matrimonial Pool, I now move on to discuss the appropriate ratio of division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In her submissions, the Wife’s position was that neither the structured approach recognised in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (“<em>ANJ</em> approach”) nor the trends-based approach (<em>per TNL</em>) would be entirely suitable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> According to her, the parties’ marriage and her employment status were unique in that she was working <em>for the Husband</em> during the marriage and she believed that this may result in a skewed assessment of her matrimonial contributions (particularly, in considering her indirect contributions) if the <em>ANJ</em> approach was rigidly applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Nevertheless, the Wife – having regard to the High Court (Family Division)’s recent decision of <em>WUI v WUJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31716-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 25</a> – submitted that she was prepared to adopt the <em>ANJ</em> approach. The Husband’s submissions, on the other hand, proceeded on the assumption that the <em>ANJ</em> approach would be used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In my view, the Wife’s concerns appeared to stem from a misapprehension as to how the <em>ANJ</em> approach would be applied. I do not agree with her submissions on at least 2 aspects.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, one must have regard to why the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL</em> decided that for long single-income marriages, the <em>ANJ</em> approach was unsuitable. One key factor was the Court of Appeal’s concern that the <em>ANJ</em> approach may result in the over-valuing of the breadwinner spouse’s financial contributions and, at the same time, undervaluing the non-working spouse given that in the long single-income marriage paradigm, the non-working spouse tends to have little or nothing in the way of direct financial contributions (which was an integral part of the <em>ANJ</em> approach’s analytical framework).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such a concern would not strictly apply in short marriages, and, in any event, was not a concern at all <em>in the present case</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Second, I found the Wife’s concerns to be somewhat overstated. The <em>ANJ</em> approach was, in any case, sufficiently robust and could take into account the Wife’s direct and/or indirect contributions (even if, as the Wife claimed, her indirect contributions may not be so easily discernible or explained given her unusual employment situation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Indeed, the Court of Appeal in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> itself explained the importance of the “broad brush approach” when considering the question of the spouses’ direct and indirect contributions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I am thus of the view that the <em>ANJ</em> approach should be adopted in the present case as the marriage was one involving dual-incomes, with both parties making direct and indirect contributions to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     To recapitulate, the <em>ANJ</em> approach requires the Court to:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions having regard to the amount of direct financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets; (b) ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the wellbeing of the family throughout the marriage. Thereafter, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">(see <em>TOF v TOE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26792-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 2 SLR 976</a> at [63(b)])</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I will now explain how this approach should be applied in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Just and Equitable Division: Direct Financial Contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     With respect to their respective direct financial contributions (“DFC”) to the marriage, the parties appear to largely agree on the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_a\"></a>(a)     their direct contributions towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that the assets held by a party (and which has been found to be acquired by their own effort) would be used as a “proxy” for their direct contributions to the marriage; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_c\"></a>(c)     flowing from (b) above, the Husband’s sole-named assets represented his DFC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The parties’ main disagreements principally relate to whether the SingLife Policy (ending -304) and the cryptocurrency held by the Wife should be treated as her DFC, or should part of these assets be treated as representing the Husband’s contributions because he was the person who had paid for these assets (either in part or wholly).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In my view, the Husband had not shown sufficient evidence in support of his claim that the Wife’s declared SingLife Policy was jointly purchased with his money. While he sought to explain that the policy was purchased in January 2020 through a single lump-sum payment, that assertion alone does not necessarily mean that half of this amount should be attributed to him. I was not persuaded that the Husband had shown the Wife to be totally incapable of affording the premium for this policy at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     However, as regards the Wife’s cryptocurrency asset, I was of the view that <em>half</em> of the value of the said assets should be attributed to the Husband. This amount included the notional amount I had added-back to the Matrimonial Pool as set out at [42] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In this regard, the Wife had herself repeatedly asserted that the cryptocurrency was purchased with the parties’ joint monies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> It would follow that she should recognise the Husband’s contribution to these assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Although the Husband argued that he was the one who had paid for all of the cryptocurrency assets to the tune of approximately $709,000,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> I did not find this allegation to have been sufficiently proven. Most of the Husband’s arguments were premised on inferences which he drew from what the Wife had deposed in her other affidavits apropos her income at the material time, and her ability to purchase the said asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Insofar as the Husband sought to rely on the fact that the Wife’s income/earnings ultimately came from him to show that he was the one who had “paid” for the cryptocurrency (or any other asset acquired by the Wife), I rejected this argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     As mentioned above, the broad-brush approach remains relevant even in the context of the <em>ANJ</em> approach. I did not agree with the Husband that simply because the <em>source</em> of the Wife’s salary and/or income was the Husband’s business meant that <em>all</em> of her salary or income should be treated as if they were his contributions. In paying his Wife a salary (and declaring to the authorities as such), the Husband was clearly acting <em>qua</em> employer and not as her spouse. The monies received by the Wife, at the material time, represented her wages for work done and belonged to her both legally and beneficially.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Accordingly, in respect of the Wife’s cryptocurrency assets, I only attributed a sum of $74,498.50 (being $148,997 ÷ 2) to the Husband for the purpose of assessing his DFC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     For completeness, with regard to the issue of the parties’ contributions to the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat, although parties were broadly in agreement, I found it appropriate to use the parties’ total CPF-based payments (at or around the IJ date) to derive the relevant ratio to be applied to the Matrimonial Flat’s net value, <em>ie.</em> The use of the IJ date reflects the recognition that the parties’ contributions <em>to the marriage</em> would stop after IJ has been granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The ratio to be applied to the Matrimonial Flat’s net value would be 51 (Husband) : 49 (Wife), based on the amount of CPF monies that had used to fund the said purchase.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In summary, I set out the parties’ overall DFC ratio below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 2 – DFC Ratio</u></b> </div><p></p>

(“IDC”) to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     At [75(c)] above, I alluded to the relevance of the broad-brush approach under the <em>ANJ</em> approach for both the parties’ direct and indirect contributions. I reiterate that when determining the parties’ IDC, the Court does not adopt “<em>a rigid and mechanistic calculation exercise</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> and would focus on “<em>broad factual indicators such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> rather than the minutiae of the parties’ family life during the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Although the parties’ marriage here was not a long one, they nevertheless have two (2) children to the marriage. Thus, their contributions in the realm of caretaking and raising the Children need to be accounted for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     On her part, the Wife submitted that a ratio of 60:40 in her favour should be applied.

No mathematical formula or analytical tool is capable of capturing or accommodating the diverse and myriad set of factual scenarios that may present themselves to court as to how the parties may have chosen to divide among themselves duties and responsibilities in the domestic sphere. It is in making this determination that what is known as the broad brush approach would have to come into play. What values to give to the indirect contributions of the parties is necessarily a matter of impression and judgment of the court. <b>In most homes, even in a home where both the spouses are working full time, in the absence of concrete evidence it is more likely than not that ordinarily the wife will be the party who renders greater indirect contributions</b> [...]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis in <b>bold</b> added]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     I did not find the Husband to have provided concrete evidence in support of his claim that he made greater (or, at least similar) indirect contributions in the realm of homemaking, parenting, or husbandry, so as to displace my finding that the Wife had, more likely than not, rendered greater IDC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    I found the present marriage to be one where each spouse took on slightly different roles in the marriage, even though the Wife was working for the Husband.

In support thereof, the Husband cited the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> (“<em>ATE v ATD</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    While it is well-established that the court <em>can</em> apply different weightages in the appropriate case, it is nevertheless important to understand <em>why</em> a court would do so. <em>ATE v ATD</em> itself provides a useful example.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    In that case, the Court of Appeal was considering a case involving a relatively short marriage where, for most of the marriage, the parties were childless. When the parties’ only child was born, the parties separated shortly thereafter. The Court further found the husband in that case to be calculative and stingy <em>vis-à-vis</em> the wife (who was the more financially successful party). The parties kept their finances separately throughout the marriage, and the wife never depended on the husband. The parties also had the assistance of a domestic helper and the wife’s mother in caring for the child. Under those circumstances, the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to place greater weightage on the parties’ direct contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In its subsequent decision in <em>USB v USA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“<em>USB</em>”), the Court of Appeal had occasion to further opine on when a court should adjust the weightage placed on the spouses’ direct and indirect contributions. The Court of Appeal’s following observations (at [40] – [42] of its judgment) are particularly apposite:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">40    Generally, indirect contributions are less significant in short marriages, especially those without children. The court may take this into account by ascribing a higher weightage to direct contributions. In ATE v ATD and another appeal <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a>, this court assigned the parties’ direct contributions a higher weightage in a marriage lasting about five years. Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA held at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Given that the marriage was a short one, that both Husband and Wife were working, the manner in which both Husband and Wife conducted their lives during the marriage itself, and that there was a not inconsiderable amount of assistance on the domestic scene, the appropriate ratio between direct and indirect contributions ought to be 75% and 25% respectively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">41     <b>It should be reiterated that the court has a discretion to adjust the weightage of direct and indirect contributions in a short marriage – it is not compelled to arrive at an unequal weightage. There may well be good reasons for the court to retain equal weightage between direct and indirect contributions even in a short marriage, especially if there are children</b>. Apart from short marriages, we add the important caveat that adjusting the weightage of the direct and indirect contributions should be done as an exception. This is because of the features of a long marriage as recognised by this court (ANJ v ANK ([1] supra) at [27]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… Indirect contributions in general tend to feature more prominently in long marriages … The courts also tend to give weighty consideration to homemakers who have painstakingly raised children to adulthood, especially where such efforts have entailed significant career sacrifices on their part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42    Where the court exercises its discretion to adjust the weightage, apart from in a short marriage, we are of the view that cogent reasons should be provided to explain the departure from the norm of equal weightage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>Bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The facts in the present case were markedly different from <em>ATE v ATD</em> in that the parties here have 2 children to the marriage – [K] was born in August 2019, about 1 year into the parties’ marriage, and [R] was born 2 years thereafter. Parties largely remained an intact family until late 2022, with both parties expending efforts to care for the Children (albeit with external assistance). As I had noted above, the parties took on different roles during the marriage, which each expending efforts in different areas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    I emphasise that the Court of Appeal’s clear guidance in <em>USB</em> that any adjustment of the weightage is a matter of discretion and that a court is <em>not compelled</em> to arrive at an unequal weightage just because marriage was short, especially when there are children (as is the case here). When a court does place unequal weightage on the parties’ contributions, there must be cogent reasons to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In arriving at the appropriate IDC ratio (at [96] above), I already took into account factors such as the length of the parties’ marriage and their respective roles in the raising the Children and the maintenance of the household. I also considered the fact that the Husband himself accepts that some of the “bonuses” which he had paid the Wife “<em>were either diverted back into the business or into investments</em>”, and monies were by “<em>channel</em>[ed] <em>back to</em> [him]” for such purposes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    I therefore saw no additional and/or separate reason why I should place unequal weightage on the direct and indirect contributions. Indeed, placing greater weightage on direct contributions alone (as suggested by the Husband) may create the additional effect of over-valuing the assets which are held by the Husband. I therefore maintained the norm and placed equal weightage on the parties’ DFC and IDC ratios.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Implementation and Apportionment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    Given my decision above, I set out below how the division of the Matrimonial Pool should be carried out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 5 – Apportionment of Assets</u></b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"30.8935920047031%\"><col width=\"23.9271017048795%\"><col width=\"22.5602586713698%\"><col width=\"22.6190476190476%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>ANJ</em> Final Ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">58%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">42%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Party’s share/apportionment of the Matrimonial Pool</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$1,370,558.58</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$992,473.46</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total asset pool:</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$2,363,032.04</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Less</em> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Assets in parties’ sole name</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($1,494,060.52)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($664,294.02)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Including notional amounts added back into the Matrimonial Pool</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Amount due to Party</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($123,501.36)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$328,179.86</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Percentage of sale proceeds to be transferred if Matrimonial Flat is sold</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">100%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    My detailed orders are set out at [139] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    I now move on to the final area of contention, <em>ie.</em> the amount payable by the Husband as his share of the Children’s maintenance. The Wife had confirmed that she was not seeking maintenance for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    As stated above, the Interim Maintenance Order which was in force between the parties required the Husband to pay maintenance for the Children in the sum of $2,450 per month. It is trite that that being an order for interim maintenance, the obligations therein would come to an end once I make a final maintenance order as part of the AM proceedings: see <em>AXM v AXO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0705.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 705</a> at [20] (“<em>AXM</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Court’s power to order maintenance for the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    Although the law relating to maintenance is largely uncontroversial, for conceptual clarity, I find it necessary to address a point raised in the Wife’s written submissions, <em>ie.</em> her purported reliance on s 118 of the WC and the alleged “material change” which has occurred since the making of the Interim Maintenance Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    I start by highlighting that this Court’s power to make a final order for the Children’s maintenance stems from s 127 of the WC, which provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Power of court to order maintenance for children</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">127.—(1)    During the pendency of any matrimonial proceedings or when granting or at any time subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, the court may order a parent to pay maintenance for the benefit of his or her child in such manner as the court thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    In my view, the Wife’s reference to s 118 of the WC in her written submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> was erroneous for at least two reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, s 118 does not actually apply in the present case because that provision addressed applications for the variation of <em>spousal</em> maintenance orders made under s 113 of the WC. Applications to vary a child maintenance order are governed by s 127, read with Parts 8 and 9 of the WC (in particular, s 72 of the WC).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This is not necessarily a distinction without a difference. As the Court of Appeal had noted in <em>AXM</em> (at [33]), the language of s 72 appears wider that s 118.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Second</em>, and more importantly for present purposes, regardless of whether one is referring to s 118 or s 72, it would not be correct to say that the AM court’s role is to consider whether Interim Maintenance Order ought to be “varied” as I am not bound to follow the Interim Maintenance and this Court is, strictly speaking, hearing the matter afresh: see <em>AXM</em> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_119-p2_d\"></a>(d)     This means that whether the final maintenance order should be similar to (or different from) the Interim Maintenance Order does not depend solely on whether there has been “<em>misrepresentation or mistake of fact or whether there has been any material change in the circumstances</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    Notwithstanding the above, it appeared from the parties’ submissions that they each sought to persuade me that the terms of the Interim Maintenance Order should not be replicated in its entirety in my final maintenance order because they each believe that circumstances have changed such that some (but not all) of the terms of Interim Maintenance Order should be adjusted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    Insofar as the Wife’s case used the terms of the Interim Maintenance Order as a broad “starting point”, I agreed with that approach. In my view, the Interim Maintenance Order, which was made in late 2023 after a detailed assessment of the Children’s expenses where both parties presented the relevant evidence, remained highly relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    To avoid doubt, I have considered the Husband’s submissions (including his claims that the Wife had not provided evidence of certain expenses, and/or that there was alleged double counting or excessive claims). However, as the High Court (Family Division) had noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (“<em>WBU</em>”) (at [10] and [11] of the judgment), maintenance orders are often made with a view of providing a “budget” for the care parent to use to maintain the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10    It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure. This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case. While receipts are useful as an indication of the child’s accustomed standard of living, they are not necessarily conclusive of what the child’s reasonable expenses are. It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drawing up what can be described as a ‘budget’, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category (see, for example, the table set out below at [13]). It was observed in UEB v UEC <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (at [13]): [quote omitted]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    In applying this “budget” approach to quantify maintenance, two points are worthy of note. First, the budget instils accountability between the parties in their continuing roles as co-parents, serving as a baseline financial framework for the parties in respect of their expenses concerning the child. Second, considering the categories of expenses within a “budget framework” is consistent with the notion that deciding how best to provide for the child (which includes what exactly to spend on in providing for the child) is a parenting matter. Thus, the court will not be overly prescriptive in how these budgeted monies are specifically applied to various detailed items of expenses. In drawing up the appropriate budget, parties may disagree over decisions such as what to spend on for the child’s benefit, including what the child is to eat, what enrichment classes the child should attend, and even which lifestyle habits to cultivate in the child. These are fundamentally parenting decisions involving parents’ views and aspirations for their child which are personal and unique to each set of parents. A court of law is not the most appropriate forum to resolve such parenting matters. Instead, it is a fundamental part of the parties’ parental responsibility to attempt to resolve their differences and come to a compromise for the child’s best interests. Even after a marriage has broken down, the mutual “give and take” which is the very pith and marrow of family decision-making should not cease […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    I found the Family Court’s earlier assessment that the Children’s monthly expenses amounted $9,083 (inclusive of their share of the household expenses) to be based on a reasonable and appropriate budget, having regard to the Children’s standard of living and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Changes since the Interim Maintenance Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    I now address the changes which each party has asked for in their respective AM submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    On the Wife’s part, she sought an <em>additional</em> order that the Husband be responsible for paying her for the Children’s <em>share</em> of the monthly rent she is paying for her current rented apartment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This category of expense was expressly excluded in DJ Soh’s decision as the Wife was staying with her parents when the Interim Maintenance Order was made, and there was no clear evidence that her parents had demanded rent from her (even though she claimed to be paying such “rent”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    The Wife explained that she had since taken on a lease for the sum of $3,500 per month, and therefore asked that the Husband to contribute thereto. The Husband disagreed on the basis that he had never agreed to the Wife taking on this lease.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    As I had mentioned above, the law relating to maintenance is fairly trite and one established principle is that the obligation to provide maintenance for one’s children includes the provision of reasonable accommodation expenses, especially in circumstances where it was not unreasonable for the care parent and the children to live in their own apartment, separately from the other parent after the breakdown of the marriage: see <em>VXM v VXN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27669-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 1174</a> at [17] and [19], <em>per</em> Debbie Ong J (as Her Honour then was).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    I thus found the Wife’s claim for a contribution towards the <em>Children’s share</em> of her $3,500 monthly rental expense to be reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    That said, given what she would receive from the division of the parties’ matrimonial asset (in view of my decision above), I would expect that she should take steps to acquire her own property in the long term, and she cannot assume that the Husband should be providing for this expense in perpetuity. After all, she had wanted care and control of the Children, and having been granted the same, she should take steps to procure permanent long-term accommodations for them. It was also the Wife’s position in her AM Fact and Position Sheet that she is seeking an order for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat in the open market.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    Any future changes in this respect may be addressed either by parties through mutual agreement, or by a variation of the order (if a change is justified).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    On the Husband’s part, his submissions were centred on persuading the Court that his personal financial circumstances have changed such that the approx. 83 (Husband) : 27 (Wife) apportionment ratio used by DJ Soh was no longer be appropriate since his earnings have decreased while the Wife’s income has increased since the time of the Interim Maintenance Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> He sought changes to the terms of Interim Maintenance Order on that basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Apportionment of the Children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    The use of the parties’ earnings and income as the basis for apportioning the Children’s expenses between the two parents is similarly well-established: see for eg., <em>WBU</em> at [40] – [43]. In determining the same, the Court undertakes a holistic assessment of the parties’ financial abilities, earning capacity and resources consistent with s 69(4) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    In the present case, I accept that the Wife’s income had increased from when the Interim Maintenance Order was made. By her own admission, she now earns approximately $10,000 each month. This is twice the amount which DJ Soh had assessed her income to be in November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    As regards the Husband’s earnings, his claim that his earnings had reduced appeared to be based principally on his latest income tax assessment wherein he reported an annual income of $106,117 (or approximately $8,800 per month).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    However, I agreed with the Wife that the Court’s assessment was not limited to one party’s <em>current</em> asserted income. The party’s overall <em>earning capacity</em> (which can be seen from taking a longitudinal view of his/her income over the years) was also relevant. In the Husband’s case, his current income reflected an unusual and drastic decrease from his previous years’ income, which, at its peak (in 2020), amounted to some $698,970 per year.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    Even when he filed his first AM affidavit in February 2024, he declared his income to be $25,000 per month. Considering the Husband’s historical earnings, I found the figure of $25,000 (which DJ Soh had used as a proximate for the Husband’s earning capacity) to remain fair and reasonable, even if the Husband’s declared income in his latest income tax documents was lower. In making this assessment, I considered the fact that the Husband ran his own business as well as my observations (at [68] – [70] above) <em>apropos</em> the Husband’s attempts and ability to hide/put aside assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    Accordingly, the apportionment ratio should be adjusted to 70 (Husband): 30 (Wife). This change in apportionment ratio would consequently mean that the Husband’s share of the Children’s expenses would be changed to approx. $6,360. Since he was currently paying for the Children’s school fees and insurance premiums in the sum of approx. $5,240 and should continue to do so, he should be responsible for the shortfall amount of <u>$1,120</u> per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    In addition, the Husband shall pay to the Wife the sum of $1,633, ie. 70% of $2,333 (being the Children’s share of the monthly rent).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    In the premises, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em><u>For the Children’s issues</u></em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In relation to the Children’s issues, I granted (by consent) the parties joint custody of the children of the marriage, [K] and [R], with care and control of the Children granted to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I granted the Husband unsupervised weekly access from 10.30 am to 8.00 pm on Sundays, except that on the last Saturday of every month, he can have overnight access to the Children from 10.30 am on Saturday to Sunday 8.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I also granted the Husband: (i) access to the Children on every public holiday and during the CNY period as proposed by the Wife; and (ii) video-call access 3 days each week. Consequential orders were made relating to the pick-up and return of the Children, as well as requiring the Wife to provide to the Husband the address of the Children’s place of residence (including any change thereof, if and when there is such a change).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Division of Matrimonial Assets</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_d\"></a>(d)     With regard to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, I ordered that the Wife be entitled to the sum of $328,179.86 (being her share of the parties’ matrimonial assets) and made provision for how this order was to be implemented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In essence, I gave the Husband the option of acquiring the Wife’s share in the Matrimonial Flat by paying her the aforesaid sum of money. If he chose not to do so, then the Matrimonial Flat would be sold and the net sale proceeds would be used to pay off what the Wife was entitled to (with the Husband making good any shortfall in cash).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_139-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Save as set out above, I ordered that each party shall retain the assets in their sole name and possession. I also gave both parties liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    When I delivered my decision to the parties via Registrar’s Notice, I invited both counsel to provide submissions on the issue of costs (if any) for the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    Having considered the matter, and in light of the fact that neither party could be said to have been wholly successful in these proceedings, I made no order as to costs.

The third party can also apply to intervene in the s 112 proceedings – for the sole purpose of notifying the court of his/her interest and of applying for a stay. When faced with such an application, the court ought to stay the s 112 proceedings: <em>UDA</em> at [54] and [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The mother does not intend to intervene </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the present case –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s mother had asserted that the funds in the Joint Accounts belonged to her entirely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband’s mother had however decided not to file a stay application. Neither does she intend to apply for a declaration that the funds in these accounts belong to her beneficially. She had made this decision because of her age (she is about 81 years old)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and her health condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband’s mother had expressly stated on affidavit that she is prepared for me to make a fair and just decision in the proceedings between the Husband and the Wife. According to the mother, she had submitted in evidence all the relevant documents in her possession to prove that all the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Power to make factual findings v Power to make binding orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In deciding how to proceed in this matter, I found the following guidance from <em>UDA</em> to be instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     If a court is notified of a third party’s claim to an alleged matrimonial asset but no separate legal action has been commenced, then the options available to the court will depend on the legal ownership of the property and whether the spouses seek a binding order over the property or the third party: <em>UDA</em> at [53] and [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the property is legally owned by one of the spouses who claims to hold it on trust for the third party, the court can determine whether the property is a matrimonial asset without involving the third party at all if no order is sought by or against the third party directly: <em>UDA</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     However, if an order binding the third party is sought, then a separate set of proceedings will have to be issued: <em>UDA</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Based on the above, I can determine whether the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to the Husband’s mother entirely – so long as I do not make binding orders against her. If the Wife wishes to seek such orders, then she will have to commence separate proceedings against the Husband’s mother. Presumably, the Wife will only do so if I find that the relevant funds belong entirely to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In determining to whom do the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to, I took the following approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on first principles, as a joint account holder, the Husband has a legal (and by inference, a beneficial) interest of the funds in the Joint Accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the absence of evidence to the contrary, funds in a joint account belong to the account holders in equal proportions: <em>Timing Ltd v Tay Toh Hin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26460-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 1040</a> at [18]; <em>WWM v WWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> at [14]. In other words, the Husband is presumed to be the beneficial owner of half the funds in the Joint Accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given the above, the burden of proof is thus as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband has the burden to prove <em>his case</em> that all the funds in the Joint Accounts belong to his mother and not to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Wife has the burden to prove <em>her case</em> that the Husband’s mother has no beneficial interest in the relevant funds whatsoever, and that they belong entirely to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Additionally, the Wife has the burden to prove <em>her case</em> that the Husband had dissipated the relevant funds from the Joint Accounts to avoid their division in the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Applying the above principles, I find that the Joint Accounts are not matrimonial assets and are thus not liable for division. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">POSB 027 XXX</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I find that the Husband has rebutted the inference that he has beneficial interests in the funds in POSB 027 XXX. I come to this finding based on the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is not disputed that his mother had opened the account. According to the mother, the Husband did not contribute any fund in the account. The mother’s evidence is supported by the evidence. The bank records for POSB 027 XXX show that the account had (i) $54,750 on 27 May 1994<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> and (ii) $75,436.23 on 31 December 1999.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> At the material times, the Husband was only 16 years old (1994) and 21 years old (1999). Furthermore, between 27 May 1994 to 1999, there were several deposits into, and withdrawals of funds from, the account. The largest of these involved $35,000. Given his young age and the amount of funds involved, it is unlikely that the Husband would not been the one who had conducted such transactions at the material times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the mother gave evidence that she had no intention to gift to the Husband the funds in the account during her lifetime, and that he would be entitled to them only upon her death.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> I have no reason to disbelieve this evidence. The mother is elderly and there is no evidence that she has any source of income. In the circumstances, there is no reason why she would want to gift to the Husband significant amount of funds in the account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Additionally, the Wife’s claim – that all the funds in POSB 027 XXX belong to the Husband – is based on her submission that “there is no evidence to show that the monies belong to the Husband’s Mother”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> With respect, this claim ignores the fact that (a) the account is in joint names <em>with the mother</em>, (b) funds in a joint account <em>prima facie</em> belong to the account holders in equal proportions (see [28(b)]), and (c) the Wife has the burden to prove her case that the funds belong entirely to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given that the Wife has failed to prove that all the funds in POSB 027 XXX belong to the Husband, there is no need for me to address her case that there was dissipation of funds. That said, I wish to make a few observations. The Wife relies on a withdrawal of $49,000 on 8 July 2023 for her submission that there was dissipation of funds. I am not persuaded by this submission. <em>First</em>, it is the mother evidence that she had transferred the $49,000 to her other son. <em>Second</em>, a transfer of $49,000 does not seem all that unusual for this account.

The Husband submitted that if this policy constitutes matrimonial asset, then its value should be fixed at $35,750 instead of $135,750. This is because he had yet to return the $100,000-loan to his mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife submitted that the $100,000 had come from UOB 908 XXX – a joint account between the Husband and his mother.

It is unclear whether the Husband will be able to buy/rent premises with the same level of convenience as the Flat to live with the Son. <em>Second</em>, there is a risk that the child will be spending more time on school days to commute between the Husband’s new residence and the Flat/the Son’s school.

If there is no such agreement, the parties are to write in to inform the court <b>by 31 March 2025</b>. The court will thereafter hear the parties on costs on a date to be fixed.

My decision in respect of SUM 3441 can be found in <em>XHU v ZHV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32826-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 11</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that the Husband should have to pay the Wife costs, fixed at $2000 (all-in). They say that the Husband’s application in SUM 3441 was unmeritorious and had “unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted, or added to the costs or complexity of” the divorce proceedings. They also emphasise that the Husband had not pursued his discovery request in good faith.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband, on the other hand, after having been reminded to put in his submissions on the costs of SUM 3441, stated that he did “not have any cost to claim”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Where costs are concerned, it is well-established that costs shall follow the event, though the court can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case justify doing so: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27020-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 1</a> at [9] and [10] citing Rule 852 and 854 of the Family Justice Rules 2014; <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32251-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 84</a> at [4] citing <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] – [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In the present case, the Wife is entitled to costs. That is because she had successfully resisted the Husband’s application for discovery in SUM 3441. The Husband did not manage to obtain the orders which he sought in SUM 3441.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to the quantum of such costs, that shall be fixed at $600 (all-in). In fixing the quantum of such costs, I take into account the fact that the Husband had only sought discovery in respect of two items, and that the affidavits and submissions were not particularly voluminous. While counsel for the Wife argues that his application was unmeritorious and that it was not taken out in good faith, they have not set out why this is the case, apart from pointing to the fact that this is evident from the Husband’s “haphazard application and pleadings”. In any event, I do not find that the Husband’s conduct warrants an upwards adjustment in the quantum of such costs to be awarded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is therefore ordered that the Husband shall pay the Wife the sum of $600, being the costs of SUM 3441.

In light of the issues raised by parties with respect to [T], I called for a Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) and reserved my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Having received the CER, I fixed the matter for decision on 27 December 2024, which was re-fixed to 13 January 2025 at parties’ request. Shortly before the date of decision, the Wife’s counsel wrote a letter dated 2 January 2025 to the court to “highlight the Plaintiff’s ongoing and hostile conduct”. This invited a reply dated 8 January 2025 from the Husband refuting the Wife’s allegations as “a blatant attempt to mislead the court”. The Wife responded with a rebuttal dated 10 January 2025 “to address the Plaintiff’s numerous misleading and unsubstantiated allegations”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the resumed hearing on 13 January 2025, I reminded counsel that when the court had reserved judgment as I had done in this case, no new evidence should be presented without the leave of court: see <em>VYP v VYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26994-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 40</a> (at [36]). I also reminded counsel that it was a discourtesy to the court to make further submission without seeking leave: see <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27372-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGCA 34</a> (at [9]). As these letters were presented to the court after judgment was reserved, I made it clear that I did not consider the contents of the letters in reaching my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When giving my decision, I provided brief grounds to parties and indicated that these might be elaborated on and supplemented with fuller grounds if required. As the Wife has appealed the whole of my decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 8/2025 filed on 24 January 2025, I set out below my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I begin with the Wife’s application to “set aside/vary” the Consent Order in relation to the division of matrimonial assets. The starting point is s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”), which provides that the court “may, at any time, it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband submitted that the Wife’s application was confusing as it was not entirely clear if the Wife was trying to set aside the Consent Order or vary the Consent Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I agreed that clarity was important as the thresholds for setting aside and varying a consent order in relation to the division of matrimonial assets are different. Moreover, the Wife’s application went beyond the division of matrimonial assets. It extended to the setting aside and variation of orders in relation to custody, care and control and child maintenance, for which different provisions and considerations apply. Yet, the entirety of the Wife’s submissions was premised on s 112(4) of the Charter, which is applicable only to the division of matrimonial assets. This was unsatisfactory as it obfuscated the issues that had to be determined by the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the deficiency in the Wife’s submissions, I gave careful consideration to the merits of her application in accordance with the applicable provisions and relevant case law with respect to each area of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Consent Order should be set aside</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The threshold for setting aside a consent order relating to the division of matrimonial assets was set out in <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Chew Koon</em> [2005] 1 SLR (R) 548 (“<em>Lee Min Jai</em>”) and discussed in <em>AOO v AON</em> [2011] 4 SLR1169 (at [10]) and <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM v AYL</em>”) (at [17]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As noted in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (at [6]), “[a] court would interfere with an order of court obtained by consent, only on just and equitable grounds”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Choo Han Teck J explained (at [5]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Under s 112(4) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), the court “may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made”. But this section, and the authorities referred to by Mr Chia, should not be construed as an invitation to revise the terms of a settlement merely so that they appear more equitable or will be, in fact, more equitable in the objective opinion of the court. Privately settled terms in respect of the ancillary matters in a divorce may not always appear to be fair. But divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement. What the court should be alert to, is that one party had not taken an unfair advantage over the other in the course of negotiating and settling the terms. Hence, in <em>Dean v Dean</em> [1978] 3 All ER 758, the court held (as set out in the headnote) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[W]here an agreement between the parties had been reached at arm’s length and the parties had been separately advised, the agreement itself would be prima facie evidence of the reasonableness of its terms, and formal discovery would probably be unnecessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Hence, to set aside a consent order on the division of matrimonial assets under s 112(4) of the Charter, an applicant must prove one of the vitiating factors: see <em>UMM v UML</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22258-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 13</a> (at [8]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> A vitiating factor is a contractual doctrine that includes misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence, duress, unconscionability, as well as illegality and public policy: see <em>TR v TQ</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) (at [97]). While the precise application of each of the vitiating factors to consent orders made in the matrimonial context has not been definitively decided (see <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [15])), some of the reasons that have been cited in setting-aside applications include duress, misrepresentation and undue influence: for example, see <em>UMM v UML</em> and <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> (“<em>ATZ v AUA</em>”) (at [22]). In addition, the absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties may also result in a consent order being set aside: see <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [31]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In the present case, the Wife claimed that the Consent Order was obtained through “duress, undue influence and misrepresentation” which severely compromised her ability to make a free and informed decision.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She sought to set aside the Consent Order on grounds that she categorized as follows: (a) misrepresentation; (b) duress and undue influence; and (c) emotional and psychological coercion.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having carefully considered the evidence before me, I found that the Wife did not satisfy the requisite threshold to set aside the Consent Order. I elaborate on my reasons below, adopting the categories framed by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Misrepresentation</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   False Legal representation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife alleged that the Husband had falsely claimed that the appointed lawyer was acting on behalf of both parties and yet consistently denied the Wife’s requests to communicate directly with the lawyer. This left the Wife without proper legal representation, making her vulnerable to the Husband’s exploitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> In support of her claim, she reproduced the following WhatsApp messages:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2/9/21, 6:58 PM – [H]: It’s our lawyer, basically draft based on what we agree.

You want joint account to spell out, I put in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2/9/21, 6:59 PM – [H]: Ok, then I ask them to draft, you can ask them as you are also the client.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband’s position was that there was no such false representation. The involvement of the lawyer was limited to merely drafting the terms based on the discussions between the parties themselves. The Husband said that he was not well versed in legal terminology and mistakenly believed that engaging a lawyer was to ensure the proper handling of all necessary paperwork. During the meeting at his lawyer’s office, it was explicitly stated that the lawyer represented him alone, and the clauses in the IJ were drafted pursuant to parties’ private negotiations and agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The Wife was apprised of her right to seek independent legal advice but made a personal decision not to personally engage a lawyer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Further, the Husband said that the Wife had not presented the complete WhatsApp message.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He reproduced the following extracts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[W]    I am uncomfortable with your lawyer, only acting in your benefit without any consideration for [T]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I am already giving you care and control part … all the house and car</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">who is squeezing who</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[H]    It’s our lawyer, basically draft based on what we agree.

It may operate as an important defence in the hands of a representee to vitiate a contract …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As elaborated at [80.189]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">An essential ingredient of an operative misrepresentation is that it influenced or induced the representee in his decision to enter into the contract. There would be no inducement if the representee did not know of the representation or was aware of its untruth or was not influenced by it, as where he would have entered into the contract even had he known the true facts or where he relied on his own judgment or investigations. Inducement refers to the causal relation, which is a question of fact, between the representation and action on the part of the representee to act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The WhatsApp message produced by the Wife showed that the Husband had represented to her that the lawyer was “our lawyer” and that “you are also the client”. While this was <em>prima facie</em> a misrepresentation, I found no evidence to suggest that it was fraudulently made. When the Wife attended at the lawyer’s office, she was told that the lawyer represented the Husband alone. This was evident from the acknowledgement signed by the Wife in the presence of a Commissioner for Oaths, which stated as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I acknowledge that I have considered the terms of the agreement and have also been informed of my right to seek independent legal advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Wife had considered the terms of the agreement and was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. Given these undisputed facts, the Wife could not be laboring under any misapprehension when she entered into the agreement. The misrepresentation was corrected and could not have influenced or induced her at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Moreover, there was ample evidence to show that the Wife had exercised her own judgment in her negotiations with the Husband. This was borne out by her affidavit, examples of which are reproduced below:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"20.64%\"><col width=\"79.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Para 51.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">However, when I received the first draft of the divorce documents, I noticed that my access to [T] was stated as “reasonable access”.

It was her prerogative to seek help if she needed assistance. It would be inequitable for the Wife to blame the Husband for her lack of legal representation when she could have taken reasonable steps to obtain independent legal advice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As was similarly observed by Debbie Ong J (as she then was) in <em>UMM v UML</em> (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Starting with the arguments on the Husband’s capacity to appreciate the documents before him, if the Husband genuinely did not understand the terms of the 1<sup>st</sup> DCO, he could have sought assistance or expressed that he needed more time to consider them. As noted by the DJ, the Husband is educated, and held the rank of First Warrant Officer in the Singapore Armed Forces before his retirement. I also observe that more than a year elapsed between his signing of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> DCOs. I emphasise that it is a serious matter for one to sign a legal document before a Commissioner of Oaths or before a lawyer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     More pertinently, the picture that emerged from her evidence and the contemporaneous WhatsApp messages between the parties was simply incongruous with the case she tried to make out to the court. I found her to be assertive, and she certainly did not come across as one who could be easily induced, influenced, coerced or exploited. The fact that she was able to get the Husband to concede to her demands spoke for itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Finally, it should be noted that in a WhatsApp message to the Husband, the Wife herself had acknowledged that “we had good amicable agreement”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This message was sent on 27 September 2021,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> five months after the Consent Order was recorded. It put beyond doubt that the Husband had not taken any unfair advantage over her in the course of negotiating and settling the terms, and that the agreement reached was consensual. In light of all the evidence, it seemed more likely that the Wife was seeking to take advantage of the innocent misrepresentation by the Husband to advance her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Deception in Custody/Access Matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Wife also alleged that the Husband misled her about the feasibility of shared custody and control of their child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> In support of her claim, she reproduced the following extracts:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.58%\"><col width=\"8.86%\"><col width=\"57.56%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.18 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">-</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: please change to joint care and control</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.18 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: I won’t sign</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.22 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[H]: It can’t be done</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/28/21, 9.23 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[H]: So far I am very reasonable, trying work out the best for all</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2/3/21, 12:01 PM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">–</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[W]: 2.

There was nothing to prevent her from visiting the website and verifying the information for herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Moreover, it was reasonable to infer that the Wife had some knowledge of the law, as she had specifically asked to change the term in the draft agreement to shared care and control, which is a legal construct used by the court to make arrangements to support families where the child’s parents have separated: see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> (at [10] – [12]). The Wife would have known that the court may grant both parents shared care and control as she had specifically asked to change the term in the draft agreement to “SHARED care and control”. If there was any doubt in her mind about the legal position, she could have sought independent legal advice if the issue was of concern to her. As noted in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (at [5]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… divorce is a very personal matter, and each party would have his own private reasons for demanding, or acquiescing, to any given term or condition in the ultimate settlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As the Wife was prepared, for her own private reasons, to acquiesce to sole care and control without seeking independent legal advice, it would be inequitable for her to accuse the Husband of deception, especially when she knew that he had relied on materials obtained from a legal website.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Deception in Financial Matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Wife also alleged that the Husband had concealed his personal assets and directed her attention solely towards certain shared assets, preventing her from seeing the full picture of their financial situation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> She listed the following matrimonial assets that were not included in the IJ:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>a.     Monies in parties CPF accounts</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>b.     Parties’ matrimonial car estimated value of $90,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>c.     Singapore Savings Bond of estimated $90,000 belonging to the Plaintiff and $30,000 belonging to [the Wife].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_d\"></a>d.     Cash in hand at home amounting to an estimated value of SGD$3,000 (foreign currency).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_e\"></a>e.     Plaintiff’s savings account in China bank and other savings accounts in his sole name which [the Wife] have no knowledge of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_f\"></a>f.     Plaintiff’s Multiplier account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_g\"></a>g.     Plaintiff’s insurance policies and investment accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_h\"></a>h.     Other valuables estimated to be worth $10,000 (i.e jewelleries which the Plaintiff’s mother gifted to [the Wife] during the marriage, exercise bike, piano, household appliances/furniture).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     She submitted that the absence of full and frank disclosure of material facts by one of the parties might result in a consent order being set aside by the court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In response, the Husband pointed out that the Wife had a S$85,5000 Singapore saving bond under her name<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>, a multiplier account which had approximately S$50,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and insurance policy and investment account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> and she had drawn S$3,000 annually from the family fund to either save into her Thai bank account or her relative’s bank account to keep the cash somewhere which he did not know about.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> There were no jewelleries except a wedding ring which the Wife had already taken away.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> The assets listed in the IJ were the main matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I found no merits in the Wife’s allegations. Firstly, it was contemplated in clause 3g(c) of the IJ that the parties “shall each retain all other assets in his/her own names.” It should be noted that these “other assets” included assets in her sole name, such as monies in her CPF account and bank accounts, which were within her knowledge. Hence, she could not be oblivious that there were other assets that were not expressly listed in the IJ. Indeed, the whole point of clause 3g(c) was to allow the parties to retain these “other assets” in his or her sole name. In addition, the parties had also agreed to clause 3(g)(d) which made it clear that neither party “shall have any further claim against each other”. In short, the fact that the Wife was able to produce a list of matrimonial assets that were not expressly included in the IJ was not a basis by itself to set aside the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Secondly, if the complete accounting of assets was important to her, she could have requested that parties exchange a list of assets before agreeing to clause 3g(c) of the IJ, bearing in mind that the duty of full and frank disclosure cuts both ways. If she had done so and there was non-disclosure on the part of the Husband, she would be amply justified to set aside the Consent Order. But that was not the case here. The Wife was content to accept clause 3g(c) without the need for mutual disclosure. Contrary to her submissions, there was no concealment, let alone deception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Duress and undue influence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Wife submitted that that the Husband exerted undue influence over her by repeatedly pressuring her to agree to the Consent Order, using emotional manipulation and threats. She said that the Husband had insisted that if she did not agree to give him sole care and control of their child, he might remove himself from their lives, leaving the child without a father. The Husband also pressured the Wife during her busy work hours and claimed that he might only have a few years left to live. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Husband said that in the interest of promoting the child’s wellbeing, he agreed to joint custody as requested by the Wife. However, joint custody entailed fulfilling responsibilities towards the child, which the Wife had often failed to recognise. For example, in February 2021, when he enrolled the child in a preparatory course for the Gifted Education Program and personally covered the cost of $4,846, cooperation from the Wife was extremely challenging.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband said that the Wife was well aware that granting care and control to him was in the best interests of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> The child’s wellbeing had been diligently attended to over the past three years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Husband implemented long-term plans to secure the child’s present and future needs, including relocating to a more conducive residence in preparation for the Primary School Leaving Examination, procuring property to cater to the child’s post-primary education requirements, and supplementing the joint account with additional funds to endure the child’s educational aspirations were adequately supported.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> Testimonies from school teachers during teacher seminars affirmed the child’s happiness at school and flourishing social relationships.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In <em>ATZ v AUA</em>, the court made the following observations (at [22]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it is normally the case (as in the present) that parties to a marriage would invoke the doctrines of undue influence or duress to set aside a marital agreement, given the emotionally charged circumstances in which such agreements are normally negotiated and executed. The existence of independent legal advice would normally be a strong indication of informed consent, which would undermine arguments relating to undue influence or duress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In the present case, while the Wife was not legally advised in the entry into the agreement, she was informed of her right to seek independent legal advice. In the same vein, this would undermine her arguments relating to undue influence and duress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Moreover, as noted earlier, there was ample evidence to show that the Wife had exercised her judgment independently. In her own words, “we had good amicable settlement”. This could not be the case if she had felt pressured by the Husband to enter into an agreement she did not agree to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(5)   Emotional and psychological coercion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Wife also alleged that the Husband employed coercive and manipulative tactics during the divorce process to pressure the Wife into agreeing to an unfair settlement. The Wife claimed that the Husband avoided creating written evidence of his actions by insisting on verbal communications, leaving the Wife emotionally distressed after each interaction. The Husband played on the Wife’s compassion and vulnerability by making unverified claims about his health and resorted to deception, false blame, and threats throughout the process.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The picture painted by the Wife was that of a conniving husband taking advantage of a vulnerable spouse. However, this picture did not cohere with the objective evidence. Firstly, if the Husband had wanted to avoid creating written evidence, the Wife’s affidavits could not be replete with numerous written communications of their negotiations and related matters which she had relied on extensively in support of her case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also made use of some of these statements to disparage him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Secondly, as explained earlier, I found that the Wife had exercised her judgment independently in negotiating and settling the terms of the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Thirdly, in her supporting affidavit, the Wife averred as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… The Plaintiff created the illusion that my choices were <b>voluntary</b>. However, <b>upon closer examination</b>, I <b>now realize</b> that the Plaintiff deliberately orchestrated the entire divorce “discussion” toward unfair outcome for me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     On closer examination, it would become apparent that this was an admission by the Wife that she had had entered into the agreement <em>voluntarily</em> at the material time. This is because it was only “now” and “upon closer examination” that she realised that she had been coerced. That being the case, she could not have acted under coercion when she entered into the agreement, as this would involve a diametrically opposite state of mind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Indeed, in another part of her affidavit, the Wife had also stated that it was “<em>[o]nly in hindsight</em>” that she “<em>came to realize</em>” that she was coerced into signing the agreement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> Hence, the case advanced by the Wife appeared to be an <em>ex post facto</em> attempt to conjure up a case of coercion when, based on her own admissions, none existed at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Finally, as noted earlier, the Wife had in a WhatsApp message to the Husband acknowledged that “we had good amicable settlement”. This put beyond doubt that she had acted on her free will and was not coerced into signing the agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For the reasons set out above, I found that the requisite threshold for setting aside the Consent Order was not met. To sum up this part of my grounds, the following observations of Choo Han Teck J in <em>VWQ v VWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27108-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 5</a> (at [9]) bear reiterating:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… Generally, a consent order is a contract negotiated and agreed upon by parties, and the courts would be slow to re-write their contract. Privately settled terms negotiated by the parties, especially in family matters are to be encouraged. As such, they should be respected, and not lightly changed. Otherwise, one party may lead the other to believe that obtaining a consent order would end their dispute, only to call in aid the provisions in the Women’s Charter to vary their agreement (<em>TOC v TOD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18950-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 10</a>) when they feel that the bargain was not to their liking subsequently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As also noted in <em>UMM v UML</em> (at [12]), the need for finality is a significant consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… it must not be forgotten that consent orders are the end of a process of “give-and-take” to harmoniously resolve a dispute between parties. There is another party, the Wife in this case, who has participated in negotiations towards an agreement and who has relied on the resolution process to move on from this dispute. The need for finality is a significant consideration: see <em>AYM</em> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Consent Order should be varied</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I turn next to the Wife’s application to vary the Consent Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In <em>AYM v AYL</em> (at [15] and [22]–[23]), the Court of Appeal made it clear that s 112(4) was not intended to confer upon the court a jurisdiction writ large, but a limited flexibility to adjust an order for the division of matrimonial assets already made. This would be, <em>a fortiori</em>, the case when the order of court was premised upon a consent order entered into between the parties themselves. Once the order of court with respect to the division of matrimonial assets had been completely implemented or spent inasmuch as everything that was required to be done had been effected and the assets concerned had in fact been distributed to the parties concerned, the court did not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. Where the order for the division of matrimonial assets made by the court had not been completely effected or implemented, the court would make, <em>inter alia</em>, the necessary variations to an order for division of matrimonial assets only when the order was unworkable or had become unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As the case put forward by the Wife did not show that the Consent Order was unworkable or had become unworkable, there was no basis to vary the Consent Order. Moreover, the Consent Order with respect to the division of matrimonial assets had been completely implemented.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> As such, the court did not have the power to revisit or reopen the order. On either ground, the Wife’s application to vary the Consent Order must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody, care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I turn next to the Wife’s application to set aside/vary the Consent Order in relation to the custody, care and control of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Wife alleged that the Husband had engaged in parental alienation and attempted to exclude the Wife from the child’s life while falsely accusing the Wife of being an irresponsible parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> Following the divorce, the Husband repeatedly reneged on agreed terms regarding the Wife’s access to the child and the matrimonial flat. His communication and actions became increasingly uncooperative, hostile, and abusive, including denying access to the child on public holidays, changing visitation arrangements without consent, and preventing video calls.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Wife alleged that the Husband had inflicted psychological harm on the child by coercing him to lie to the Wife about his whereabouts and activities. The Husband’s behavior, which included making unilateral decisions about the child’s schooling, health, and travel plans, significantly disrupted the co-parenting relationship and negatively impacted the child’s wellbeing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The Wife also accused the Husband of manipulating the child into referring to his new wife as “mummy” against the child’s will, using threats and punishment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> The Husband had also fed him false information and used access as a means of control, resulting in the child experiencing panic and anxiety.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife said that she had been the primary caregiver for the child since his birth and was deeply involved in his overall development, including academic preparation and various activities. Despite the Husband’s attempts to undermine the Wife’s role, the child had consistently expressed a desire to reside primarily with the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The Wife requested for care and control of the child with the supervised access to the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Husband contended that the Wife’s baseless and frivolous allegations of her being misled and misguided into letting him have care and control of the child was simply untrue and unsubstantiated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> It was agreed between parties that the Husband would have care and control of the child as he had been the primary caregiver for the child since he was born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> Since the Wife moved out from the matrimonial home in 2020, he had independently shouldered the responsibility of overseeing the child’s academic development and the child was thriving under his care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The Husband said that despite the challenges of managing this responsibility single-handedly, he devoted his limited time with the child to providing guidance and encouragement. The child had consistently demonstrated improvement in academic performance and had earned numerous achievements. In a noteworthy accomplishment, the child secured a top three position in the class award for the first time in 2022. Even amidst the ongoing court proceedings since 2023, the Husband single-handedly persevered in maintaining the child’s academic excellence, resulting in him receiving the top three in the class award once again.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> The child had numerous other academic awards and achievements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Husband said that the Wife moved out almost four years ago to pursue her own “happiness” but after learning about the Husband’s remarriage, she initiated the current lawsuit to disrupt the hard-earned stability that the child and the Husband had been enjoying.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> The Husband contended that he had dutifully facilitated her stated access terms pursuant to the Consent Order but the Wife was belatedly demanding for more access timings after she learned of the Husband’s remarriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Section 128 of the Charter provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may at any time vary or rescind any order for the custody, or the care and control, of a child on the application of any interested person, where it is satisfied that the order was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been any material change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     For the same reasons explained earlier, I found no basis to set aside the Consent Order for the custody, care and control of the child. Be that as it may, the central issue was whether there was any basis to vary the Consent Order. In practical terms, any order relating to the custody, care and control of the child would be forward-looking, as it would not be possible to undo the past, unlike the division of matrimonial assets where the order could be undone <em>ab initio</em>, and the assets redivided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The legal principles for the variation of a consent order on custody, care and control are markedly different from those applicable to the variation of a consent order on the division of matrimonial assets. This is why, as I had emphasized at [13] above, clarity of the submissions is important.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In <em>DDN v DDO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30869-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 2</a> (at [16] &amp; [17]), which concerned an application to vary the parties’ by-consent access orders, the Appellate Division (“AD”) held that the court will take a wider and more holistic approach to assess what constitutes a material change in circumstances for issues involving a child to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility to adjust orders relating to the child’s arrangements to suit the current circumstances. The AD quoted with approval, the following passage from <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> (at [32]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Relationships are dynamic. A parent who is not emotionally close to a child at the time an access order is made may, through time, build a much closer relationship with the child subsequently. For example, a young three­ year old child may have been clingy to his mother at the time the court orders care and control to the mother and limited access to the father. As the child grows older and builds a closer relationship with his father, it may be in his welfare to encourage increased access when he is, say, five years old. The child may have outgrown the phase of high dependence on and dinginess to his mother. There may not have been any one particular identifiable event that marks a material change in circumstances between the time he was three and five years old, but because relationships are dynamic, circumstances may have sufficiently changed such that a variation is warranted for his welfare. Hence, the court ought not to read s 128 of the Women's Charter too narrowly, but should take both a principled and pragmatic approach to the determination of a material change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     As noted in <em>UBQ v UBR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29508-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 10</a> (“<em>UBQ v UBR</em>”) ([at [52]), the paramount consideration in a variation application is the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     From my review of the affidavits and the CER, I was satisfied that there had been a material change in circumstances for the purposes of the variation application. I noted that [T] was an emerging adolescent capable of forming an independent view. It was clear to me that [T] shared a close relationship with the Wife and desired to spend more time with her, compared to the current care arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     As this was sufficient for invoking the court’s power to vary the Consent Order, I did not find it necessary or helpful to dwell into the parties’ allegations in my brief grounds to assign blame. Neither do I think it is necessary or helpful to do so now, bearing in mind the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and not the past conduct of the parents: see <em>UBQ v UBR</em> (at [49]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     I found that both parents cared for the child and played their respective roles in supporting him. The Husband had provided the child a stable living environment and ensured that his daily needs were adequately met. The Husband was committed in supporting the child over academic matters and had contributed significantly to the child’s academic achievement while the Wife had also been intentional in engaging the child in a wide range of activities and was attuned to the child’s emotional wellbeing. However, while both parents cared for the child and played their respective roles in supporting him, they struggled with communication and co-parenting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     [T] was an intelligent child who had been doing well academically. Although he shared a close relationship with each parent, it was clear to me that he had been exposed to prolonged parental conflict and was torn between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The parties were agreeable to continue with the joint custody order. The main dispute centred on care with control. The Wife was seeking a reversal of care and control while the Husband wanted to continue having sole care and control of [T].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Section 125(2) of the Charter provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, the paramount consideration is to be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court is to have regard —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to the wishes of the parents of the child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Given the Husband’s strength in providing the academic support, granting the Wife sole care and control would deprive the child of the support by the Husband. However, granting the Husband sole care and control would also deprive the child of the time and attention that he so desired from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     [T] was a mature individual and at an age where he was capable of greater independence and expressing an independent opinion. Given his close relationship with both parents as well as his desire to spend more time with the Wife, I found that a shared care and control arrangement where he would be able to receive the support and care from both parents would be beneficial for him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In addition, the parents would benefit from continued counselling at FAM@FSC to work on their communication and co-parenting skills. [T] would also benefit from continued counselling at FAM@FSC to support him amidst the parental conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     According, I varied the orders relating to custody, care and control as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parents be granted joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Parents be granted shared care and control of the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Husband to have care and control of the child from Saturday 8 pm to Wednesday (before school).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Wife to have care and control of the child from Wednesday (after school) to Saturday 8 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parents to share equally the school and public holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Overseas Travel</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parents are at liberty to travel overseas with the child subject to giving the other party at least two months’ notice of the duration of travel, itinerary of travel, including flight details, accommodation address and emergency contact details. The notice period may be shortened by consent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Husband shall release the child’s passport to the Wife at least 2 weeks prior to the intended date of departure or earlier if the said passport is required for travel visa application. The Wife shall return the child’s passport to the Husband when returning the child to his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Mutual Agreement</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Parties may vary the care arrangement by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Make-up parenting time</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Where a parent is denied parenting time with the child as a result of the unilateral decision of the other parent, the parent shall be entitled to make-up parenting time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Parents should endeavour to resolve any such dispute amicably before making an application to the Court for make-up parenting time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Counselling Support</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_82-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Parents and child to continue to receive counselling support at FAM@FSC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In my brief grounds, I had urged both parents to take positive steps to reduce their conflict, such as by exercising grace and flexibility in co-parenting and refraining from inflaming the situation. I reminded the parties that parental responsibility included supporting the child in having a close relationship with the other parent: see <em>VPG v VPF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26209-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 18</a> (at [10]). The parties were advised to take heed of the following observations of Debbie Ong JAD in <em>DDN v DDO</em> (at [17]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court expects parties to do their utmost to make the ordered arrangements work. This perspective is crucial to ensuring that “the child’s interests are not side-lined while his or her parents litigate over what they subjectively perceive to be their respective rights and entitlements” …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     I emphasized that parental conflict was harmful to the child and made reference to the observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31008-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 1</a> (at [40]). I also reiterated the following reminder in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [47]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Parents must <em>find the resolve</em> to overcome the difficulties in co-parenting by a strong <em>commitment to discharging their parental responsibility</em>. Litigation has harmful effects on the child – materially, because the family loses in incurring litigation expenses, and psychologically, because conflict affects the whole family in ways not easily visible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     It is hence disappointing that despite the reminders and exhortations, the Wife had decided to appeal against the shared care and control order instead of doing her utmost to make the ordered arrangement work. While it is her prerogative as a litigant to do so, it would also mean that the litigation will be protracted. This would not be in the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Finally, the Wife had also sought an order for the Husband to pay the Wife a reasonable amount of maintenance for the child. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The relevant provisions relating to the variation of maintenance for children are in ss 72 and 73 of the Charter. As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> (at [15]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Section 73 provides that any agreement relating to maintenance may be varied where the court is “satisfied that it is reasonable and for the welfare of the child to do so”. … the provision is wide enough to encompass a material change in the circumstances of the parents as <em>a</em> basis for varying the maintenance for the child. Whether or not this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is of course a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     It is trite law that both parents have a duty to maintain the child. As regards the apportionment of maintenance, it is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In the present case, I found that the variation of the care and control arrangement would constitute a material change in circumstances. However, as noted above, whether this should result in the maintenance actually being varied is a factual inquiry that depends on the circumstances of the case.

Each had brought an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against each other. SS 217 of 2024 (“SS 217”) is the Wife’s application against the Husband for a PPO. In addition, the Wife also seeks a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) to exclude the Husband from her bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 218 of 2024 (“SS 218”) is the Husband’s application against the Wife for a PPO. In addition, the Husband also seeks a DEO against the Wife to exclude her from his bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband was represented by Mr Ignatious Cha (“Mr Cha”) and Ms Pearlyn Yeo (“Ms Yeo”). The Wife was represented by Mr Leong Zhen Yang (“Mr Leong”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the trial and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law on Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is hornbook law that to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities (<em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> (“<em>XFL</em>”) at [13] – [14]; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [5] – [7]; <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [12]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the respondent had either committed family violence, or was likely to commit family violence; and that</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is necessary for the court to grant the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes family violence, the starting point is found in the definition set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”). That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In addition to ordering a PPO, a DEO may also be ordered if it is necessary for the “protection or personal safety of the applicant”. That is made clear by s 65(5)(<em>a</em>) of the Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    A protection order may, where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant, provide for such orders as the court thinks fit having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including any one or more of the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the granting of the right of exclusive occupation to any protected person of the shared residence or a specified part of the shared residence by excluding the person against whom the order is made from the shared residence or specified part thereof, regardless of whether the shared residence is solely owned or leased by the person against whom the order is made or jointly owned or leased by the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 217 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I deal first, with the Wife’s application in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents complained of in SS 217</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       These are the incidents which the Wife relies on in support of her application for a PPO and a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 11 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to the Wife, this incident took place at around 10 pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband had warned her to not show their son any YouTube videos on the projector and threatened to switch off the projector if his demands were not met.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     An argument ensued. The Husband allegedly swung his left hand towards the Wife’s face. He stopped mid-blow such that his hand brushed past her right ear forcefully. The Wife says that the Husband did want to slap her, but stopped himself because he knew that there was a CCTV installed in her bedroom. She says that Husband would have been more brazen in his use of force had there not been a CCTV installed in her room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This incident was captured on the CCTV installed in the Wife’s room. The footage was played in court. It clearly shows that the Husband had tried to slap the Wife. He had, all of a sudden, swung his hand very quickly towards the Wife’s face. The Wife recoiled and tried to shield herself. Her earbud was dislodged and fell to the ground. The Wife retaliated by slapping the Husband twice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband had, in the course of his re-examination, given an explanation for having acted in this manner:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Right. Now, earlier in relation to the 11th December 2023 incident, Mr. Leong said that you did not just move your hand, but swung forcefully such that Ms. XJB’s earpiece dropped on the floor and you said you could explain. What do you wish to explain?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Mmm. Mmm. Okay, uh, on the 11th December, uh, twenty twen---uh, 2023, um, I noticed that, uh---uh, Ms. XJB is showing the, uh, projector to the kids in their rooms. And usually, when they show the projector, then the light is off, uh, turn off and---and they just show that, uh---uh, projector on the---on the---on the wall. And this one could, uh, strain the---the child eyes and does---and then---and [inaudible] uh, screen times. And, uh, because I want to, uh, discuss this with, uh, Ms. XJB’s, um, in a manner way. And, uh, during the---during discussion I found out that she didn’t, uh, listen carefully and didn’t pay attention to it. And I found out that, um, she have ear---earbud on her---on her ear. So, um, my intention just to take out the earbud, uh, from the ear and so we can have, um---um, so she can listen and have a conversation in a manner way. Uh, this is just to take out the, uh, earbud from---from her ear. And while I---while I take out the earbud, she quickly, uh, grab my hands and that’s caused the earbud to fall on the floor. And not just that, she also, um---uh, pulled my hands and pulled my body until I, uh, until my body is pulling---pull in front. Then not---not enough with that, she also hit me twice on my body. And I have to use my hands to, um, to defend it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband had also argued, in written submissions, that he had no intention of placing the Wife in fear of hurt, or that he had intended to cause hurt to the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> He submitted that he “had simply wanted to stop the Wife from closing the door as parties h[ad] not addressed” the issue of the Wife letting their son watch YouTube videos on the projector in her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I do not accept the explanations which the Husband had offered for his actions on that day. He had indeed swung his hand very quickly. It was aimed at the Wife’s face. Up till that juncture, it was apparent that both parties were engaging in conversation that was not particularly heated in any way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The circumstances as well as the Husband’s act of swinging his hand therefore do not support his stated intention of wanting to remove the earbud from the Wife’s ear so that they could have an uninterrupted conversation. It is thus clear to me that the Husband had committed family violence in that he had, to use the language of limb (a) (see above at [6]), wilfully, knowingly, or had attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Finally, I add that insofar as the Husband alleges that the Wife had, by slapping him twice in retaliation, committed family violence, I do not find that to be the case. It is clear from the video that the Wife had been provoked by the Husband’s actions. Her two slaps appeared to have been done out of anger and frustration at how the Husband had behaved. She had also subsequently taken steps to disengage and de-escalate the conflict by closing her room door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 27 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Both the Wife and the Husband rely on this incident in support of their respective applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     This is the Wife’s account of events. She stated that she had planned to take their son to Johor Bahru.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Husband had given approval to do so. Their son, however, kicked up a fuss. The Husband construed this as their son being reluctant to go on the trip. He refused to hand over their son’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife describes the events which followed that took place at the void deck. She says that there was an argument. She said she wanted to call the police.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This was when the Husband took their son’s passport and slammed it hard onto her left shoulder and the “motion came into contact” with her cheek, “causing a bruise”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife called the police immediately. She also exhibits, in her affidavit, a copy of a discharge summary dated 28 December 2023 showing the “diagnosis of the injury as contusion on” her cheek. In the course of her testimony, the Wife also said that the Husband’s younger sister had scratched her on the cheek during this incident. When she saw the doctor, she had told him that she suffered injuries on her left shoulder and cheek. According to her, the doctor could see that “there were red marks” on her cheek, and that the doctor also examined her shoulder and told her to monitor it for a few days.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife’s case is that the Husband had, by slamming the passport into her shoulder which resulted in a bruise, committed family violence within the definition of either limbs (a) or (b) (see above at [6]) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband, on the other hand, presented a different version of events in his affidavit. According to him, that incident had taken place at 11.30 pm. He had returned to the matrimonial home with his family members in tow. They had just come back from a trip to Kuala Lumpur.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband states that he had argued with the Wife. He wanted to let their son sleep as he was exhausted. The Wife, on the other hand, refused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Both the Husband and the Wife took their quarrel to the ground floor. The Wife continued to insist that she be allowed to bring their son to Malaysia. She asked for his passport. The Husband says that because it was raining at the time, and for their son’s sake, he used his son’s passport to “tap” the Wife on her shoulder and asked that she let their son return to the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife became aggressive. She accused the Husband of punching her. She screamed loudly and told both her parents, as well as her boyfriend, that the Husband had punched her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband attempted to disengage by retreating into the lift. The Wife, however, managed to trigger the lift alarm button. The police were called and officers eventually arrived on the scene.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Having considered the evidence, I find that the Wife has established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband had hit her forcefully on her shoulder with the passport which resulted in a bruise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For one, it is not disputed that the photo, marked “W2”, was indeed of the Wife’s shoulder.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The time stamp indicates that the photograph was taken 2 days after this incident. The photograph does show what appears to be a faint bruise on the Wife’s shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Aside from the photographic evidence, there is also the Husband’s testimony. His account of events was that he had used the passport to “tap” the Wife on her shoulder. He does not dispute having made contact with the Wife’s left shoulder. This was what he had said in cross-examination:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.3%\"><col width=\"80.7%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Q:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Mr. XJC, would you therefore agree that Ms. XJB’s evidence that you slammed the passport is consistent with what you said about---in---at paragraph 8 of your affidavit?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Your Honour, if I may---uh, if I may---uh, the word, the---what the lawyer I mean, say is “slam” which is I don’t agree with the “slam” word, it’s a tap.

You can disagree.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In my judgment, the Husband’s use of the word “tap” was an attempt to downplay the force he had actually used during the incident. I find that he had slammed the passport into the Wife’s shoulder which resulted in a bruise. The Husband’s account of merely tapping the Wife on her shoulder is not consistent with the context in which the incident took place, which was amidst a quarrel. Having been showed evidence in the form of videos of other quarrels between the parties, I consider it likely that this quarrel on 27 December 2023 was also a heated one. The Husband’s account as to the amount of force he had used is therefore less plausible than the Wife’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Having found that the Husband had “slammed” the passport into the Wife’s left shoulder and caused a bruise, I also find that such an act falls squarely within limb (b) of the definition of family violence set out in s 64 of the Charter (see above at [6]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 3 February 2024 (the “Air Tag Incident”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On this date, the Wife discovered that the Husband had planted an Apple Air Tag tracker in their son’s necklace.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Wife claims that this would allow the Husband to track their whereabouts when she takes the son out. She further claims that the Husband is doing this as a means of “conducting surveillance” on her. Consequently, she feels worn out mentally, extremely vulnerable and worried.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     She made a police report about this incident. That report is also exhibited in her affidavit. The Wife’s case is that the Husband had, by planting an Apple Air Tag in their son’s bag to track her movements, committed an act of family violence within the meaning of limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter (see above at [6]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband, in the course of his testimony, did not deny placing an Apple Air tag tracker in his son’s necklace, as well as his bag.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Husband claims that he had done so to ensure his son’s safety and that he had seen the need for this after December 2023. This was because he had noticed that whenever the Wife sent their son to school, and picked him up, the Wife’s close male friend would be present.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This led the Husband to be concerned about his son’s safety. As he explained:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[A]fter the fetching the school---from the---from the school, she frequently, uh, bring the child’s together with the this---third party, and, uh---they put---they do things, uh, together like, uh, dinner together, even watch movie together, evens, uh, go to shopping malls together. Yah. So, uh, this has been repeatings and when the kids go home and---and told me that, uh, there is this, uh, that’s the---there’s another guy that involved in this. And I repeatings mention to Ms. XJB, which is my wife to say I---do not do this---uh, do not do in front of the kids. Want to do is, uh, do your own, don’t involve the kids. Yah. And she---uh, she’s just ignoring me and just keep continue doing that. Yah. So, for me, uh, there’s a third party involved and some time they reach home it’s quite late sometimes. I can see from the time here is, uh, 11:00 or some time it reach homes, uh, past midnight as well. Uh, until the kids already sleeping and when---when they reach home, the kids already sleeping. So, uh, and she didn’t tell me where they go and---and what---what they do and did they go. So, I found it as a signs of me to---to me---need to know, uh, whether or not my son is in the safety. So, I need to like at least to know, uh, where I can find my son, if need---if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It appears that the Husband may have had one other reason for placing an Apple Air Tag on the son’s belongings – that was, to find out if his Wife was having an affair, and if so, who she was having an affair with. The Husband had told me that he had first learnt about the Wife’s close male friend from their son. When he confronted the Wife about this, she mentioned that he was merely a Grab driver.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> Her story soon changed – she subsequently gave other conflicting accounts as to who this man was.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband’s decision to place an Apple Air tag in his son’s bag was likely motivated by an incident which took place on 28<sup>th</sup> November 2023. He was looking at his Wife’s phone and when he tried to make a video call on her phone, he noticed that there was already an active video call in progress. This was what he saw:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"24.66%\"><col width=\"75.34%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Witness:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Yes.

I do not find that the Husband had planted the air tags with the purpose or intention of stalking the Wife. Had he intended to do so, the air tags would have either been planted on her belongings, or cleverly concealed. This was not the case. As the Wife herself had testified:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Now, Ms. XJB, was the Apple AirTag stitched to some secret compartment of the child’s bag?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Yes, inside the compartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q:    Ms. XJB, the---the question was yes or no.

Now, for that Apple AirTag hidden in your son’s bag, you said that you disposed of it, correct?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A:    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     As a matter of law, to establish that there has been family violence as defined in limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter, it must be shown that the respondent had: a) committed harassment, b) that such harassment is continual, and c) that this had been done with the intention to, or with the knowledge that such action would, cause the applicant to suffer “anguish”: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [6(d)]; <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [37] – [38]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23569-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 104</a> at [8] (see also <em>XEN v XEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32386-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 94</a>). I do not find that the Husband’s actions of planting the Apple Air Tag in the son’s belongings constitute harassment towards the Wife, nor do I find that he had done so with the intention of causing her “anguish”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 28 November 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This incident, according to the Wife, took place at around 9.35pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> She had returned home from work. The son had not bathed. The Wife took their son to the toilet for a bath.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     During this time, the Husband entered the Wife’s room without her permission. He rummaged through her bag and checked her handphone. The Wife did not consent to this. She says at that time, the both of them were contemplating divorce. It was thus likely that the Husband was looking for evidence to “build his case for ancillary matters in the divorce”. The Wife says the Husband had, by going through her phone, violated her privacy. She also says that the Husband’s actions fall within limb (d) of the definition of family violence (see above at [6]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband’s explanation was that he had done this for the sake of their son. He explained that when he tried to text the Wife, she did not pick up. He had therefore gone into her room, picked up her phone, and used his phone to send her a message on WhatsApp to see if she could receive it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> He admitted that he had done this despite knowing that relations between himself and the Wife were not good, and that if the Wife discovered that he had been rummaging through her belongings, it would only serve to worsen matters.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Husband, however, denied that he had gone into the Wife’s room on previous occasions and rummaged through her belongings, and checked her phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I do not find this incident which the Wife complained of falls within the definition of family violence under limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter. It has not been established that the Husband had indeed, on other previous occasions, snuck into the Wife’s room, rummaged through her belongings, and checked the contents of her phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 28 January 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In this incident, the Wife was spending time with their son on the sofa in the living room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> The Husband had come and sat next to her despite knowing that she was uncomfortable being in close proximity with him. The Wife alleges that the Husband continued to harass her by moving close to their son. She believes that the Husband wanted to exploit her fear of being near him to deny her the space and freedom of being in her own home. She claims that she could no longer “enjoy or feel safe in the flat”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Wife also exhibits footage of the Husband allegedly harassing her by “coming so close” to her personal boundaries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Again, the Wife says that the Husband’s actions constituted continual harassment as defined in limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The video was played in court. It clearly shows the Husband seated next to the Wife on the couch. The Wife then stands up and moves to sit away from the Husband, putting their son in between them. In the process, a cushion was flung, presumably by the Wife, onto the seat that she had just vacated. The clip ends with the Husband kissing the son on the head.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     While the Wife may feel annoyed, frustrated, or angry at being in close physical proximity to the Husband, in my judgment, his actions do not constitute harassment. As the Husband had explained, he had joined the Wife and the son on the couch because it was their routine to watch television with their son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> I find that the Husband’s actions were not calculated at “causing anguish” to the Wife, but rather, intended to give their son a sense of normalcy as far as possible by keeping up with their Sunday routine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 2 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     This incident occurred at 11.35pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> The Husband had tried to enter the Wife’s room multiple times on the pretext that he wanted to remove the remote control to the air conditioner. What he really wanted was to remove the CCTV that the Wife had installed in her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     When the Wife saw the Husband heading towards the CCTV, she quickly pushed him out of the room. She tried to close the door. The Husband resisted and prevented her from doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     An argument ensued over the Wife’s use of the air conditioner in her room. In the course of this argument, the Husband suddenly came “very close” to the Wife and shouted in her face. The Wife says this was an act of aggression to intimidate her. She retaliated to demonstrate that she would not cower in the face of such behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     During this time, the scuffle continued, with the Wife using her body to push against her bedroom door to prevent the Husband from entering her room. The Husband, however, forcefully pushed against the door, causing the Wife to fall “backwards on[to] [her] back”. The Wife’s head hit the floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife subsequently obtained a medical report from the Accident and Emergency Department. It was exhibited in her affidavit. The primary diagnosis was a “sprain of shoulder”. The secondary diagnosis was a head injury.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife also claims that prior to this incident, both the Husband and his family had been very aggressive and had made several threats against her. Her case was that the Husband had, in this incident on 2 February 2024, caused hurt to her, and this was an act falling within limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Having watched the video footage, which was also played several times in court, it is clear to me that the Husband did not commit family violence within the definition of limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The video shows both the Husband and the Wife tussling at the door. The Husband is trying to gain entry into the Wife’s room. The Wife, on the other hand, is barring his way and trying to push him back out into the corridor. As the Husband tries, once more, to force his way in, he does not appear to be using much force. The Wife tries to stop him. In the process, she loses her balance. Her knees buckle. She reaches out to grab onto something to arrest her fall. Her hand finds the Husband’s neck and arm. The Husband is also dragged down. He falls on top of her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     That the Wife fell down, and suffered an injury to her shoulder and head, was not, in my judgment, a result of the Husband shoving her forcefully.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 20 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife cites this incident as an example of how the Husband had escalated his “harassment and aggression” towards herself as well as her mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Wife alleges that that the Husband had placed his hand very close to her face, as well as that of her mother, under the “guise of making a video recording” of the both of them. She says that the Husband did so “in order to apply physical force” on the both of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In written submissions, the Wife clarifies that her reference to this incident was merely to “show that there was an escalation of tensions between the parties”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> In any event, having reviewed the footage, I do not find that the Husband had intentionally placed his hand very close to the Wife’s face under the guise of making a video recording when his true intention was to apply physical force. Parties were, at the time, both filming each other, presumably so that they would both have evidence to present in court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other allegations of family violence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged family violence, the Wife also raises a host of other acts of family violence which she says the Husband had committed on her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     First, the Wife says that the Husband had harassed her by unlocking her room with the master key and entering without her permission or giving advance notice. This was in spite of her informing him that he needed to seek her permission before doing so given that the both of them were already living in separate rooms by that point. The Wife also says that she was, on several occasions, improperly attired when the Husband barged in.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The second instance of such harassment the Wife cites was in relation to the Husband installing CCTV cameras around the flat. She says that this has led to her living in “fear and surveillance”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> Apart from this, the Wife says that the Husband had intruded into her personal boundaries, planted an Apple Air Tag tracker on their son (see above at [x]), and threatened to ransack her room. Taken together, these were, according to the Wife, acts that constituted continuous harassment meant to cause her anguish.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Finally, the Wife accuses the Husband of abusing her mentally, and cites the following examples.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     For one, the Husband had taken away the remote control to the air conditioner, forcing her to endure “the heat with just a fan”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife also says the Husband had cut off her Wi-Fi. In addition to this, the Husband would, on or around July 2022, slam or bang on her door early in the morning simply because he was unhappy. When she opened the door, he would just stare at her and walk away. This apparently happened for a few months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The Wife also accuses the Husband of threatening her in mandarin – he would tell her: “I will want to see how you eventually die without me”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Having already addressed the specific incidences of family violence which the Wife has raised, and found that the Husband’s actions in two of those incidents did constitute family violence (above at [16] and [32]), I do not think it necessary to deal with these other allegations the Wife has levelled against the Husband. Doing so would only run the risk of increasing the acrimony between the parties who are currently in the midst of divorce proceedings. I echo the views of the court in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Apart from s 65(1), <b>there are also good reasons why, in principle, a court should not be obliged to make findings as to whether family violence has been committed for every allegation raised by the parties</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <b>The purpose of a PPO is not to punish a party for past acts of such violence</b>: <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [38]; <em>Yue Tock Him</em> at [10]; <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“<em>GFS</em>”) at [31]; <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]; <em>UMI v UMK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21871-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 53</a> at [37] to [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   Instead, a PPO is “pre-emptive” in purpose – i.e., it protects an applicant from future family violence. If there are reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is in danger of family violence, then a PPO should be issued even if such violence has not been committed on the applicant previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   Additionally, in the case of cross-complaints involving parties in a highly acrimonious relationship, <b>there is a real risk of the parties expecting the court to adjudicate on who was “right” or “wrong” regarding their past differences</b>. A PPO trial is not a forum to settle personal scores. There is little utility in expending court resources to scrutinise each allegation of family violence when it is already clear from the evidence or from a party’s conduct in court that he/she is ready to engage in escalatory “tit-for-tat” for the most minor slight perceived from the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     For completeness, however, I deal with the Wife’s argument that based on the incidents which took place on 28 November 2023 (above at [40]), 28 January 2024 (above at [44]), February 2024, 3 February 2024 (above at [33]), and the CCTVs installed in the home since 16 December 2024, it is clear that the Husband had committed family violence within the definition of limb (b) of s 64 of the Charter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I do not find that these incidents, when considered together, demonstrate that Husband had embarked on a campaign of harassment against the Wife. As I had explained above (at [38] – [39]), the Husband did have reasons for putting an air tag in the son’s bag, as well as going to sit next to the Wife on the couch. In any event, these alleged incidents took place during a time when parties’ relations were strained to the breaking point. The suspicion and mistrust that arose likely coloured the Wife’s view of these events, giving her the impression that the Husband was trying to harass her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether it is necessary to order a PPO and a DEO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Having found that the Husband had committed family violence (above at [16] – [32]), I turn now to consider the necessity of a PPO as well as a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The inquiry into whether a PPO is necessary involves a risk assessment as to the likelihood of a respondent committing family violence against an applicant in the future: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. This involves an examination of, <em>inter alia</em>, the reasons and circumstances for family violence and whether the family violence was a recent occurrence. Red flags that point to the necessity of a PPO include: a) likelihood of interactions between the parties; b) that the underlying cause for family violence remains unresolved; c) respondent specific factors (<em>ie</em>, where the respondent is deeply antagonistic towards the applicant or where the respondent has a propensity for violence): <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In addition, the necessity requirement also encapsulates an assessment of whether a PPO is necessary to <b><em>deter</em></b> family violence – as the court in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> had observed (at [23]), this is because a PPO essentially converts acts which are typically non-arrestable offences, into an arrestable offence. This is because the commission of such acts would be considered a breach of a PPO, and such a breach is an arrestable offence under s 65(11) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     I would add that the PPO regime recognises that there will be, in any relationship, some degree of conflict, and that the actions of parties could conceivably fall within the definitions of family violence as set out in the Charter. However, it is only where this conflict rises to a point where intervention is warranted that a PPO will be granted to protect the applicant from harm and/or abuse. This finds expression in the “necessity” requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the circumstances, I find that it is necessary to grant a PPO, as well as a DEO to exclude the Husband from the Wife’s bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     It is clear to me that there was no love lost between the Husband and the Wife. The videos produced in court showed the intensity of their quarrels. There are also unresolved issues that provide the kindling for further conflict – for instance, the Husband’s suspicion that the Wife had been cheating on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     It is also not the case that both the Husband and the Wife are able to completely break off ties and go their own separate ways. They are still staying in the same house. Their close physical proximity to each other has, and can only continue to, create further opportunities for conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As to the necessity of a DEO, that stems from the fact that a number of the incidents here have arisen from the Husband’s attempt to enter the Wife’s room despite her having told him, on no uncertain terms, not to do so. The DEO is necessary to ensure that the Wife has her own undisturbed space within the house and to minimise the possibility of further conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Finally, I will also order that the PPO and DEO shall only be effective for a period of 2 years from the date of this judgment (<em>ie</em>, until the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 2027). This is because the divorce proceedings between parties would, in all likelihood, have concluded by then. After the ancillary matters have been resolved, parties would have embarked on their own separate paths. Contact may well be minimal, and limited to matters concerning their son. This would greatly reduce the opportunities and avenues for conflict that necessitate my granting of the PPO and the DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     In addition to the PPO and DEO, I am also ordering that both the Husband and Wife go for counselling to equip themselves with the necessary tools to better deal with and manage their conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband’s application in SS 218 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I turn now to consider the Husband’s application for a PPO and DEO in SS 218.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents complained of in SS 218</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Husband relies on the following incidents in support of his application for a PPO and a DEO against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 13 September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The first relates to an incident on 13 September 2023 at 11.55pm. This was what the Husband had said in his affidavit:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11.    The Respondent and I have quarrelled over her claim that my parents entered her room without her consent. She has also accused my parents of bringing “black magic”-related paraphernalia into her room. Her claims are obviously trivial, frivolous, and false.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12.    She has clear anger management issues and has screamed at me and physically assaulted me by scratching my upper body which left visible scratch marks. After doing so, she called the police. When the police arrived and saw my scratches, he asked whether I would like to report abuse/violence. I had no intention of pursuing the matter back then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     In essence, the Husband’s complaint is that in this incident, the Wife had physically assaulted him by “scratching [his] upper body which left visible scratch marks”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In written submissions, the Husband had argued that because counsel for the Wife did not cross-examine the Husband on this point, it leads to the conclusion that she had accepted the Husband’s account of events.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Wife, on the other hand, argued in written submissions that the Husband’s account should not be accepted. This was because the Husband had not adduced any supporting documents. There was also an “abject lack of details” in the Husband’s AEIC.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> And even taking the Husband’s case at its highest, the Wife’s actions could not constitute family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Husband’s argument, though it does not explicitly say so, urges me to apply the rule laid down in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 (“<em>Browne</em>”). As was noted in <em>Britestone Pte Ltd v Smith &amp; Associates Far East, Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0855.xml')\">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 855</a> at [17]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 <em>prima facie</em> applied. This rule stands for the well-settled proposition that (per Colin Tapper, <em>Cross and Tapper on Evidence</em> (Butterworths, 8th Ed, 1995) at p 319, which was cited in <em>Arts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 2 SLR(R) 0936.xml')\">[1999] 2 SLR(R) 936</a> at [48]; see also M N Howard et al, <em>Phipson on Evidence</em> (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 14th Ed, 1990) at para 12-13):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Any matter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness must normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the contradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the evidence-in-chief ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The rule in <em>Browne</em>, however, is not a “rigid, technical rule”. In the words of the court in <em>Hong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 1 SLR(R) 0292.xml')\">[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292</a> (cited with approval in <em>Asnah bte Ab Rahman v Li Jianlin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18816-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 944</a> at [115]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42    Before leaving the issue of oral evidence, I should comment briefly on the effect and relevance of what is referred to as the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67. <em>Browne v Dunn</em> is a case of some vintage and it lays down a rule of fairness. The effect of that rule is that where a submission is going to be made about a witness or the evidence given by the witness which is of such a nature and of such importance that it ought fairly to have been put to the witness to give him the opportunity to meet that submission, to counter it or to explain himself, then if it has not been so put, the party concerned will not be allowed to make that submission. It is not a rigid, technical rule. Nor is it necessarily satisfied by a formulaic recitation of a party’s case to a witness, with an invitation merely to agree or disagree. In <em>Chan Emily v Kang Hock Chai Joachim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/47211-M.xml')\">[2005] 2 SLR 236</a> at [15], Choo Han Teck J noted that the rule which is derived from a case more than a century old must be applied with due regard to the realities of modern litigation and in evaluating any given objection, consideration should be given to the totality of the evidence in the case. I think that is correct. In <em>Lo Sook Ling Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina</em> [2002] 1 SLR 408 the Court of Appeal noted (at [40]) that the rule is not rigid and does not require every point to be put to the witness but this would generally be required where the submission was “at the very heart of the matter”. This was approved by the Court of Appeal in <em>Ong Jane Rebecca v Lim Lie Hoa</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/46445-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 4</a> at [49]–[50]. I approached the evidence and the submissions in this case in that light.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     That the Wife had not been cross-examined on this point does not necessarily mean that I am bound to accept the Husband’s version of events. Indeed, I do not. While the Husband has recounted this incident in his affidavit, he has not exhibited any documents to support his claim. For example, there are no pictures of the scratches which the Wife had allegedly inflicted. Further, given that the police had been called, one might expect that a police report or some other documentary evidence be exhibited, notwithstanding the fact that the Husband had stated he had “no intention of pursuing the matter back then”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I add that even accepting the Husband’s account, that the Wife had indeed scratched him, he has not established whether her actions amounted to family violence. That is because his account of events (above at [81]), does not set out fully the circumstances in which the Wife had scratched him. It also does not describe the extent and severity of the scratches allegedly inflicted upon him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Husband has therefore not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Wife had indeed committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 2<sup>nd</sup> February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The second is an incident which took place on 2 February 2024 at 11.30 pm.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also relied on this incident in support of her application for a PPO in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     The Husband’s account is that the Wife had returned to the matrimonial home and turned off the doorbell camera. When confronted by the Husband, the Wife admitted to doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Husband says that the Wife had turned off the doorbell camera out of spite and with the intention of provoking him. He says that she had done so several times previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     On this occasion, the Husband responded by informing the Wife that he would be turning off the CCTV she had installed in her room, as well as the air conditioner. He further informed her that she would have to bear part of the utilities expenses if she wanted to enjoy the comforts of air conditioning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     This sparked a quarrel. The Husband says that when the quarrel took place, he was standing outside her room and holding the door. The Wife insisted on pushing him out of the room, and in doing so, scratched him all over his body. The Husband was left with visible scratch marks. He exhibited photographs at Tab C of his affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Amidst this scuffle, the Wife tried to retreat into her room. She lost her balance and fell to the ground. The Husband denies pushing her. He says that she had lost her balance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     Having fallen down, the Wife began to “scream and cry loudly”. The Husband retreated from her room. He says that she was able to stand and walk around normally. The Husband went to the living room to wait for the police officers who arrived a few moments later.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Husband’s case is that the Wife had caused hurt to him when she scratched him, and hit him on his neck.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Having watched the video, it was clear to me that there was a scuffle between the Wife and the Husband at the entrance to the Wife’s bedroom. The Husband was trying to force his way into the Wife’s bedroom, and she was trying to resist. The video shows the Husband feinting to his left, as though he was about to disengage from the scuffle, before suddenly twisting around and trying to barge past the Wife. The Wife managed to hold her ground, and it was in this context that she had struck his neck. In my judgment, the Wife’s actions do not constitute family violence within the definition of either limb (a) or (b) of s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     As to the scratches which the Husband had allegedly sustained, he was cross-examined at length on whether the video showed that the Wife had indeed inflicted these scratches on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> He was also cross-examined on the manner in which he had described these scratches in the police he had filed a day after the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    In my judgment, the Wife had indeed scratched the Husband during this scuffle. The Husband had produced pictures of scratch marks on his body, namely his shoulder and arm. It is also clear from the video that the Wife had indeed grabbed the Husband. Taken together, it is likely that the scratches the Husband sustained were indeed caused by the Wife during the scuffle. I also note that the Husband’s evidence, in his affidavit, that the pictures of the scratch marks on his body were indeed the injuries he had suffered in the altercation with the Wife, was never challenged in cross-examination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    That being said, I do not find that this falls within the definition of family violence as set out in limb (b). These were minor scratches. It cannot be said, from the pictures of these scratches the Husband had exhibited, that the Wife had indeed caused hurt to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    Finally, I add that even if the Wife’s acts of hitting the Husband on the neck, and scratching him, were considered acts of family violence, the Wife is entitled to rely on the Self-Defence exception (see <em>XBC v XBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32020-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 63</a> at [10] – [13]). The video makes it clear the context in which the Wife had used such force on the Husband. She was trying to stop him from intruding into her personal space. She did not use excessive force in doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 27 December 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    I come now to the incident on 27 December 2023. The Wife had also relied on this same incident to support her application in SS 217.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    The Husband’s case is that in this incident, the Wife had committed family violence because she had wrongfully confined or restrained him, together with their son, as well as his elderly parents against their will in the lift.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    The Husband appears to suggest that because he was never cross-examined on his account of events<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> – that the Wife had, by asking “her boyfriend and mother to hold the lift at the ground floor” and even pressed the alarm button – his account of events should be accepted and so he has proven that the Wife had wrongfully confined or restrained him in the lift.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Even accepting the Husband’s account, I do not think that the Wife’s actions fall within the definition of family violence as set out in limb (c) of s 64 of the Charter. As the court in <em>UEJ v UEK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20636-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 90</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> had noted (at [40]), the threshold for wrongful confinement or restraint is higher than a situation where a complainant’s movements were “somewhat restricted” by a respondent for a “certain duration”, and especially where such incidents had occurred in a public place and not in a private or restricted area.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Based on the Husband’s account, the Wife had merely tried to prevent him from taking the son back up to their flat. This had occurred in a public area amidst a quarrel between both the Husband and the Wife. Given the Wife’s actions and the circumstances in which she had so acted, I do not find that her actions had crossed into the realm of family violence in that it could be said that she had “wrongfully confined” or “restrained” the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Incident on 20 April 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The Wife had also cited this incident in support of her application for a PPO (above at [57]). In written submissions, the Husband further submitted that this incident would “better support his application for a [PPO] against the Wife”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> The Husband cites the fact that the Wife had “intentionally provoked him” in this incident by “video recording him”, “knocking multiple times on his room door” and “knocking on his mother’s room door” although she had already gone to bed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The Wife raises a preliminary objection. She says that the Husband should not be allowed to make a claim based on this incident. That is because this incident was never part of the Husband’s case, and so the Wife never had an opportunity to respond to the allegation which the Husband is now levelling at her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    It is well-established that incidents which arise after an application for a PPO has been filed may be taken into account provided that the respondent: a) had not been taken by surprise, and b) had been given sufficient opportunity to respond to the evidence at the trial: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21(g)] citing <em>Teng Cheng Sin v Law Fay Yuen</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0356.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 356</a> at [19] and [20]; <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [57] – [60]; <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> at [44]-[47]; <em>VAW v VAX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25988-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 50</a> at [52] and [55]; <em>VYW v VYV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27025-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 2</a> at [32] – [39]; <em>BCY v BCZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGDC 0360.xml')\">[2012] SGDC 360</a> at [6] – [9].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In the present case, the Husband had not included this incident in his complaint form. There is also no account of it given in his affidavit. There was therefore nothing to which the Wife could respond. Given this, I will not take this incident into account in considering the Husband’s application in SS 218.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Wife is likely to commit family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    As was noted in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16], there is no need for an applicant to prove that family violence had been committed. It suffices to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence is likely to be committed against the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    An example of when the court has found that family violence is likely to be committed is the recent decision in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a>. In that case, a video tendered to court showed that both the husband and wife in that case had knowingly harassed each other. The video showed both the husband and wife recording each other during their altercation whilst accusing each other of provocation. The court also found that there was “deep and long-standing animosity” between the both of them which was evident from the numerous police reports the both of them had filed, each accusing the other of having committed family violence (<em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [12] and [14]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    In the present case, I find that the Wife is likely to commit family violence against the Husband. On the evidence put before me, it was clear that the quarrels between both the Wife and the Husband were becoming increasingly heated. That was clear to me from the videos which showed how the Wife had responded in the incident on 11 December 2023, as opposed to how she had responded in the incident on 2 February and 20 April 2024. These videos show the Wife acting in an increasingly confrontational manner towards the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    I would add that the additional video which the Husband tendered, which showed a different angle of the incident on 20 April 2024, also showed that the Wife did provoke the Husband. The Wife did not object to this video being produced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    That video shows the entirety of the quarrel between the Husband and the Wife on that day. The Husband had gone to the Wife’s room. He knocked on the door. When there was no response, he walked away and took off his shirt. He returned soon after and tried knocking on the Wife’s bedroom door again. After a few attempts, the door opened. The son ran out and into the Husband’s bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    The Wife, as well as her mother, came out of their bedroom. They went to knock on the Husband’s bedroom door. The Wife’s mother pulled out her handphone in an attempt to record the Husband’s actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Frustrated at being filmed, the Husband attempted to grab the handphone from the Wife’s mother. Witnessing this, the Wife goes and knocks on the Husband’s mother’s bedroom door. The argument escalates and the Husband’s mother is dragged into the ensuing argument. The Wife enters the room where the Husband’s mother had been sleeping in and begins shifting various objects out. I must add that unlike the Wife’s mother, who played an active role in the argument, the Husband’s mother can be seen attempting to restrain the Husband and to calm him down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    The video clearly shows that the actions of both the Wife, as well as her mother, had only served to provoke the Husband and to escalate matters in that incident. The Wife also agreed, when it was put to her in cross-examination, that she had, by her actions in this incident, intentionally provoked the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    When considered in totality, the various video clips which parties had played in court showed an escalation in tensions and aggressions between the parties. The Wife clearly had a role to play in this escalating conflict. She chose to react in a manner that was not only confrontational, but also rather aggressive at times. The manner in which she reacted in all these incidents which were captured on video spoke to the likelihood of her committing family violence against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether it is necessary to order a PPO and a DEO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    Having found that the Wife is likely to commit family violence against the Husband, it logically follows that a PPO is presumptively necessary to protect the Husband: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Leaving aside the presumption, on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that it is indeed necessary to order a PPO. Parties are still living together in the same flat. They are currently undergoing divorce proceedings. It is also apparent to me that there is a great deal of animosity between them. Given that the both of them still continue to share the same space, it is likely that they will continue to interact and come into contact with each other. This will only provide ample fuel for further conflict (see also my findings above at [75]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    In the circumstances, the Husband’s application for a PPO is allowed. This PPO shall be valid for a period of 2 years (<em>ie</em>, until the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 2027). For the same reasons which I had set out above (at [77]), I find it appropriate, in this case, to limit the PPO to a period of 2 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    However, I do not find it necessary to allow the Husband’s application for a DEO to exclude the Wife from his bedroom. The evidence before me does not show that the Wife had attempted to set foot into the Husband’s bedroom. The Husband’s application for a DEO is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    To summarise, the Wife’s application for a PPO and DEO is allowed. I am also granting the Husband’s application for a PPO, but not for a DEO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    Unless parties are able to agree, I shall hear parties on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    Finally, I conclude with some brief remarks to both the Husband and the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I have made the relevant orders against the both of you. There are consequences if it is found that you have wilfully breached those orders: s 65(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Stop fighting. You have a young son. These are his formative years. Do not let his childhood be sullied by the bitterness of your quarrels. Focus on how the both of you can work together to give your son the best possible start in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_127-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Treat the counselling sessions seriously. They are meant to help you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    It remains for me to thank Mr Cha, Ms Yeo and Mr Leong for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\"

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Lynette Yap:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was the Mother’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against the Father for herself and their three young children, [A] who is 4 years old and twins [B] and [C], who are 1 year old. The Mother also applied for a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Father in respect of the entire matrimonial flat where they resided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial over 4 days. The Mother testified and called 5 witnesses - her father, 3 domestic helpers and her aunt. The Father testified and called 4 witnesses - his mother, his aunt and 2 friends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Upon conclusion of the trial, I directed parties to file written submissions and reserved my judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Court will only grant a PPO if the following two requirements are fulfilled:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Family violence must have been committed, or there is a likelihood that family violence will be committed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO must be necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The evidential standard of proof to be applied in PPO proceedings is that of the civil standard of “on a balance of probabilities”, and not the more stringent “beyond reasonable doubt” criminal standard of proof. However, the protection conferred by a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions. Pursuant to s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”), a person who wilfully contravenes a PPO is guilty of a criminal offence and will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both. In addition, a police officer who has reason to suspect that a person has wilfully contravened a PPO may arrest the person without a warrant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. Given these criminal consequences, a PPO will not be lightly ordered<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes family violence, this is set out in s 64 of the Charter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Allegations of Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother’s case is that the Father had committed family violence against herself and the 3 children under all 4 limbs (a) to (d) in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In her opening statement, the Mother asserted that the Father had an unstable mental state, a violent disposition and was quick to anger by nature, and that even before the marriage, he had at times exhibited low mood, low self-esteem and was easily agitated. She also stated that he repeatedly acted in a verbally abusive, threatening and hostile matter towards her, especially from 2020 onwards. She asserted that over time, his unpredictable mood and frequent outbursts of anger towards her caused her to feel constant background anxiety when he was around her. She further asserted that after their eldest and then the twins were born, the Father’s abusive and violent behaviour also affected them<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In deciding this case, I considered whether family violence has been committed by the Father under the different limbs (a) to (d) in s 64 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(a) Wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Under limb (a), it is important to bear in mind that the acts of the perpetrator will not constitute family violence unless he acted with an intention to place the victim in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the victim would, by the acts, be placed in fear of hurt. These are “subjective” states of mind in that the perpetrator must have the requisite intention or knowledge<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. For example, a perpetrator might express his frustration in the presence of the victim. This act alone, without the requisite intention or knowledge, will not constitute family violence even though such expression may be inappropriate and ill-advised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> (“<em>UNQ</em>”), a mother applied for a PPO on behalf of her children against their father. She alleged, among other things, that the father had thrown things around the house including a metal coffee mug. The father denied these allegations. The Family Division of the High Court held that the act of the father in throwing a metal coffee mug could amount to family violence if there was evidence that the children were standing in the direction where the mug was flung. The Court found that the act of the father, even if true, was at worst inappropriate but did not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I will now consider the incidents relied on by the Mother to mount her case that the Father had committed family violence by wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place her and the children in fear of hurt:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1. Incident in or around August 2016</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Mother alleged that on or around 9 August 2016, shortly after parties were married, parties had an argument and the Father shouted at the Mother and tried to pin her to a cabinet. The Mother alleged that he caused her hurt and pain and bruised the back of her hand<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father’s version was that the Mother had raised her hand and tried to assault him, causing him to push her arm away out of reflex to ensure that the Mother would not hit him and as a result he came into contact with her arm<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As this was the Mother’s application, she had to prove that the incident occurred in the manner she alleged. I find that the Father’s account of the incident was more credible than that of the Mother’s and I accepted the Father’s evidence given both in his affidavit and tested during cross-examination that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. I also note that there was no contemporaneous evidence such as a police report or a medical memo that the incident occurred in the manner alleged by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Furthermore, this was an isolated incident that occurred back in 2016. No other incidents are alleged to have occurred between 2016 and 2020, and the parties continued to live together, with no evidence that the Mother had been put in fear of hurt as a result of this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On balance, I do not accept that the Mother has proven that Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2. Incident in 2020 during the Mother’s pregnancy with [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother next relied on an incident that occurred four years later in 2020, when she became pregnant with [A]. The Mother explained that [A] was conceived by way of intra-uterine insemination (“IUI”) and she underwent multiple IUI attempts in 2019 involving numerous hormonal injections over multiple months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Mother stated that she suffered from frequent bleeding and was hospitalised due to threatened abortion in her first trimester and threatened premature labour in her second and third trimesters. It is the Mother’s case that the Father had frequent outbursts and would yell at her when he visited her at the hospital. He had also said that it would be better for her to have a miscarriage. She stated that as she “feared for the safety of (herself) and the yet-unborn (child)” she moved into her parents’ home to live with them after she was discharged from the hospital. She also continued to stay with her parents after she was discharged a second time from a government hospital in July 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father denied her allegations. He stated in his affidavit that the Mother was in and out of hospitals frequently due to her difficult pregnancy. He denied telling the Mother that it would be better for her to have a miscarriage and stated instead that he had told her that in the event of a difficult birth, he would much rather she live instead of the unborn child. He stated that the parties had disagreements on whether the Mother should transfer from a private hospital to a government hospital. He further stated that the Mother needed 2 daily injections at a clinic near her parents’ home and decided it would be best for her to live at her parents’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     During cross-examination, while the Mother maintained that she moved into her parents’ place because she feared for the safety of herself and the unborn child in April 2020 after her first discharge from hospital, she was unable to identify any specific incident of alleged violence committed by the Father before April 2020 other than the incident in August 2016. On the stand, she conceded that to the best of her memory she was unable to recall<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. When probed further if she could identify any other incident of violence stated in her affidavit before April 2020, she did not refer to any specific incident but instead referred to paragraph 51 of her affidavit where she had stated generally that throughout her pregnancy, the Father would have frequent violent outbursts and shouted at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father’s alleged outbursts and shouts at the Mother will not constitute family violence unless he had the requisite “subjective” state of mind, in the sense that he must have had the intention or knowledge to place or attempt to place her in fear of hurt. The authorities are clear that a mere expression of frustration by the perpetrator in the presence of the victim made without any such intention or knowledge will not in itself constitute family violence even if such expression may be inappropriate and ill advised<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. On the whole, I do not accept that the Father’ outbursts and shouts, even if accepted, would amount to him wilfully or knowingly placing or attempting to place the Mother in fear or hurt. I will also add that the documents relied on by the Mother did not assist her in proving that she had been in fear of hurt due to the father’s actions. She had exhibited an inpatient discharge summary from a private hospital dated 13 April 2020, stating that she had been admitted since 20 February 2020 for “threatened abortion”, an inpatient discharge summary from SGH dated 14 July 2020 where she had been diagnosed for “threatened premature labor” and another inpatient discharge summary dated 2 August 2020 where she had been diagnosed with “premature or threatened labor”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. She further exhibited a memo from the Women’s Mental Wellness, KKH dated 28 August 2020 that stated that her stress levels were very high<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. None of these documents prove that the Mother’s medical conditions were caused by any specific act of family violence committed by the Father. They certainly did not show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">3. Incident in or around July 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother stated in her affidavit that the Father had come to her parents’ house where she was living after her second discharge from hospital to visit her. Both of them got into a disagreement on the preparations for the baby’s arrival and the Father shouted at her using vulgarities. The Mother alleged that he hit the wall and the bedframe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Father’s version was that the Mother had given him a number of tasks to prepare for the arrival of the baby. He had not completed all of them and the Mother made remarks such as “you’re not ready to be a father?” and “how can I trust you if you can’t even get these simple things done”. He stated that he swore in frustration at the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In my judgment, the Father’s alleged act of shouting at the Mother with vulgarities and his actions of hitting the wall and the bedframe, even if true, was at worst inappropriate and ill-advised. There was no evidence to show that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would by the acts be placed in fear of hurt, for example if there was evidence that he had aimed his punch in the direction of the Mother and had hit the wall and the bedframe instead. I am unable to conclude that the Father’s actions constituted family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">4. Incident on or around 23 August 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The next incident cited by the Mother occurred when the Mother and her parents went to the parties’ matrimonial flat where the Father was living alone to pick up some clothes. Prior to that, the Mother’s parents had ordered a baby’s cot to be shipped there and the Mother had asked the Father to assemble the cot as the Mother had hoped the both of them could live together after the baby was born. While there, the Mother found that the place was in a mess and the baby’s cot was only partially assembled and a disagreement arose between the parties. The Mother alleged that the Father shouted that she was accusing him of being a bad father, even though she had not done so, and that he yelled at her and her father to get out of the house and shouted vulgarities. He also threw the baby’s items onto the floor and punched the wall with his fists.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Father’s version was that he was living alone in the matrimonial flat. The Mother and her parents arrived and started berating him and finding fault with him and the state that the house was in for at least an hour before he raised his voice and told them to stop shouting at him. He denied that he had touched anyone or made any gesture that he would hit or use physical violence against anyone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     On the facts, I do not find that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would be placed in fear of hurt. The Mother’s allegation was that he had thrown the baby’s items onto the floor and punched the wall with his fists. It was not her case that he had thrown the baby’s items at her or that he had aimed a punch in her direction and hit the wall instead. At all times, the Mother was free to leave the matrimonial flat and disengage from the disagreement if she had truly been in fear of hurt. Furthermore, even if the Mother had indeed been in fear of hurt, I was unable to conclude from the evidence that the Father had the requisite mental element.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">5. Incident in or around December 2020 after [A] was born</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     After [A] was born, the Father moved into the home of the Mother’s parents. The Mother stated that she wanted to keep the family intact and was reassured that her parents would be physically present if things got out of hand. The Mother stated that the Father appeared to be unhealthily obsessed with [A], and “whenever someone (like me) tended to [A], (he) would get disproportionately upset…”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father denied that he had behaved in a threatening manner. He explained that his requests for permission to spend time with [A] were met with unjustified ridicule, scolding and doubts from the Mother and her parents. He felt that this was humiliating and even when he requested to take [A] downstairs around the block to walk, this request would be rejected or they would say he needed to be accompanied by the helper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In or around December 2020, the Mother alleged that she was carrying [A] in the bedroom when her parents were out. The Father came into the room and asked to take [A]. She declined as [A] was asleep and she did not want him to be disturbed. The Father then shouted at her and accused her of denying him access to [A]. He tried to snatch [A] from her and she retreated into a corner of the room to avoid the Father. She tried to get past the Father to leave the room but he came very close to her with his arms outstretched towards her and [A]. Her fear was exacerbated because she had claustrophobia which she had told the Father about before.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Mother stated that she eventually managed to get past the Father and leave the room with [A]. She went quickly to her parents’ room where her phone was and called her father. By then, the Father had left and she returned to the bedroom with [A] and locked the door<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Mother’s father gave evidence that he and his wife rushed home upon receiving the Mother’s call. He asked the Mother if the Father had beat her, and the Mother responded that she was afraid that the Father would have hurt her physically if her parents had not come home as soon as they could.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Father denied these allegations. He stated that the Mother was in a bad mood that day as he had accidentally left the fridge door open in the morning. This upset the Mother as she said that the breast milk could spoil and could kill [A] if he drank it. She commented that the Father was a danger to the baby and that the baby he would die in his care. The Father stated he had apologised profusely to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father stated that he had asked the Mother if he could spend time with [A]. Three hours after the Mother had been in the room with [A], he went in to check in on them. He denied that he had tried to snatch [A] from the Mother. He explained that when the Mother started accusing him, he did not want to leave the room for fear that the Mother was suffering from post-partum depression. His version was that the Mother pushed and punched him and dug her fingers into his arms before she called her parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. He exhibited undated photographs of injuries he claimed to have sustained on his arm. He also exhibited contemporaneous WhatsApp messages he had exchanged with his friend that day to support his version of what had transpired<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Since this is the Mother’s application for a PPO, she has to prove that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place her in fear of hurt. I have considered the evidence available before the Court and I am unable to find that the Mother was in fear of hurt. It was her case that the Father wanted access to [A], but she refused as she did not want [A] to be disturbed from his sleep. What ensued thereafter was a disagreement between parties as to who would get to spend time with [A]. Even on the Mother’s own evidence, there are no allegations of actions by the Father that could be construed to be placing or attempting to place her in fear of hurt. I did not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Father had acted with the necessary intention to place or attempt to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would by his acts be placed in fear of hurt. His actions merely showed that he wanted access to [A] which the Mother was refusing to give.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">6. Incident on or around 12 February 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Mother stated that during Chinese New Year, the parties were at the home of the Mother’s relative. The parties had planned to go for dinner at the Father’s parents’ home after that. The Mother had told the Father before they went to her relative’s home that they would only be able to leave for his parents’ home after she had finished breastfeeding [A] to avoid disrupting his feeding schedule. The Mother stated that at that time, the Father had agreed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Mother stated that while she was breastfeeding [A] in her cousin’s room, the Father came into the room and demanded that they leave for his parents’ home as they were late for dinner. She reminded him that they had agreed to leave only after [A] had finished breastfeeding. The Father began to shout and demand they leave immediately. She was shaken and in fear and called her parents over the phone. Her father came into the room and asked what happened. The Mother explained that she needed more time to feed [A], and her father told the Father to call his parents to explain that they would be late and the Father stomped out of the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Mother’s father gave evidence in his affidavit that he also left the room after the Father left and when they were outside the room, he told the Father to be more reasonable to give the Mother more time to tend to [A]’s needs. The Father became angry and started to raise his voice and banged his fists on the wall and furniture<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     After the Mother finished breastfeeding [A], parties left the relative’s place and the Mother alleged that the Father drove in a dangerous manner to his parents’ place, weaving in and out of traffic even though the Mother and [A] were in the car, and she feared for their safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father’s account was that parties were almost 2 hours late for dinner with his parents. He was frustrated that the Mother did not want to leave her relative’s home. He stated that he had hit a soft cushion on the chair but he denied punching the furniture or the wall of the relative’s home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, even if the Father had punched the furniture and the wall (which was denied by the Father), that could not amount to wilfully or knowingly placing the Mother in fear of hurt since it was not done in her presence but only after the Father had left the room she was in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any event, I do not accept that the Father had acted with an intention to place or attempt to place the Mother in fear of hurt, or with the knowledge that the Mother would be placed in fear of hurt. I will also add that despite the alleged concerns of the Mother’s relatives, all of them, including her father, had allowed the Mother to leave with the Father for his parents’ place. The Mother’s relative also confirmed at the trial that she called the Mother to ask if she had reached the Father’s parents’ place safely and the Mother confirmed this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">7. Incident in or around May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It is the Mother’s case that after a couples counselling session, the Father shouted at her during the car ride back. The impact of him shouting at her was exacerbated by her claustrophobia as she was trapped in the same space as the Father who was driving the car.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father’s case was that the Mother started accusing the Father of not informing the counsellors about an incident that took place on 8 May 2021 and the parties had a disagreement where he was upset with the Mother. The Mother requested to be dropped off near her home and he dropped her off.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     On the facts, I found that a disagreement arose between the parties while the Father was driving the vehicle and this led to the Mother being dropped off the car at her request. I do not find that there was any evidence to support the Mother’s contention that she had been in fear of hurt or that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">8. Incident on or around 6 June 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother claims that the Father had shouted at her for about an hour at her parents’ home and harassed her to move out of her parents’ home. Her parents tried to intervene and the Father shouted at them to get out of the room and continued shouting at the Mother inside the room. The Father then went on a hunger strike and refused to eat, knowing that this would cause the Mother anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father stated that he was merely discussing the matter of moving out of the home of the Mother’s parents. He denied going on a hunger strike to cause distress to the Mother and explained it was because he lost his appetite.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my judgement, even if the shouting and the alleged hunger strike had occurred, I do not find that there was sufficient evidence to show that the Mother had been in fear of hurt. In addition, there was no evidence to show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother in fear of hurt. The Mother was clearly free to refuse to move out of her parents’ home without any consequences, which was in fact what happened on 8 June 2021, when the Mother did not join the Father when he moved out of the home of the Mother’s parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">9. Incident in or around August 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     More than a year later, in or around August 2022, the Mother stated that after parties attended a marriage workshop, the Father shouted at her in public for not being a good wife and called her a “bad wife” and a “bully”. She was afraid of being near him and walked away. Parties eventually went home separately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father explained that the Mother had raised an unresolved issue from the marriage workshop, insisted that she had “reached the end of the road for this marriage” and it was she who started raising her voice at the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I do not find that the Mother was in fear of hurt. There was no evidence of any physical threat. The Mother’s own evidence was that she “walked away from (the Father) to distance (herself) from (his) shouting and public humiliation of (her)” and proceeded to “(take) the MRT back to” her parents’ home. I accept the Father’s submissions that at all material times, she was free to and did in fact disengage and leave the Father by taking public transportation to her parents’ home. I did not accept that the Mother had shown that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed her in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">10. Incidents from 7 June 2023 to 12 June 2023 while parties were overseas</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The parties went overseas in June 2023. The trip comprised 8 people: the couple, [A], the helper, the Mother’s parents, a pastor who was also a friend of the Mother’s father and the pastor’s wife. The Mother’s brother had committed suicide overseas a few years before that and the family were there to commemorate his death anniversary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     By this time, the Mother was expecting twins. [A] was then 2 years and 9 months old. The Mother asserted that during the trip, the Father would shout at [A] whenever he was “tired or emotionally dysregulated”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. She listed the following 4 incidents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">7 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Mother alleged that on 7 June 2023, while parties were in a maxicab to their Airbnb accommodation, [A] was tired as he had not slept well on the plane and was being fussy in the maxicab. The Father shouted at him to stop and threatened to beat [A]. He also threatened to leave [A] in the maxicab.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">9 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother alleged that on 9 June 2023, parties were at a playground when [A] became hungry and tired. Parties walked to a shopping street to have lunch and [A] was behaving in an unsettled manner and crying. The Mother asked the Father to carry [A] so that she could order food, but [A] did not want the Father to carry him and made a fuss. The Father pinned [A’s] arms down and forcefully carried him away from the café. The Mother asked the helper [E] to go check on [A] and after a while, [E] returned and said she was unable to make [A] calm down. The Mother left the cafe to look for the Father and [A]. She could hear [A] crying and the Father yelling and threatening to abandon [A] in the shopping street.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">10 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Mother alleged that on 10 June 2023, all 9 of them were in a maxicab, heading to a columbarium outside the city. [A] was tired and started to cry. The Father shouted at [A] saying that he would have the maxicab driver take him away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">11 June 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The Mother alleged that on 11 June 2023, as their flight back to Singapore was very late, around 11 pm, [A] was tired as it was past his bedtime. He was also restless and hungry and started to run around the airport and at times, he would get upset and cry and yell. In response, the Father shouted at [A] and threatened to leave him behind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Mother’s own evidence, at its highest, is that the Father shouted and threatened [A] when [A] was tired, fussy or crying while they were overseas. In my view, while the Father may not have acted in the most exemplary manner when dealing with a tired toddler who was crying and fussing on an overseas trip, I do not accept that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place [A] in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">11. Incident in or around August 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Mother gave birth to twins, [B] and [C] on 14 August 2023. She alleged that shortly after she returned to her parents’ home, the Father shouted at her and demanded that she pack up all her things to move to their own matrimonial flat. In her closing submissions, she submitted that she was put in fear and felt compelled to move to their matrimonial flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Father’s evidence is that he spoke firmly to the Mother and the Mother eventually agreed to move to their matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     I found it hard to accept the Mother’s submissions that she was in fear of hurt, nor was there any evidence of threat beyond that of a quarrel. This contradicted her own evidence in her affidavit that she moved to live with the Father as she was “hoping to give the marriage another chance for the children’s sake, especially the twins”. She had also stated that she “had no choice but to move into the (residence) with (the Father) as there was no space at her (parents’ flat) for the twins”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. I rejected her claim that she was in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">12. Incident in or around September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The helper, [E], engaged to care for [A], stated in her affidavit that sometime in September 2023, she was at the matrimonial flat with [A] as it was a weekend. [E] alleged that [A] woke up during his afternoon nap and cried for the Mother. The Father came into the room and yelled at [A] to stop crying, but [A] did not stop crying. The Father then took a bamboo cane and beat [A] multiple times on the leg, causing him to scream, cry even more and choke on his own saliva. [A] had difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed. [E]’s evidence was that she pleaded with the Father to stop beating [A] and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly. It was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father disputed this, stating that [A] had been crying non-stop for a good half an hour. He recalled that the Mother had been increasingly telling him to be stricter and to discipline [A] and the Mother herself had also just started using a cane to discipline [A]. He carried [A] in an attempt to soothe him, but [A] would not stop crying and [A] instead started hitting the Father. The Father told [A] to stop but he would not listen and this continued for at least another half an hour. The Father then took the cane and tried to apply the Mother’s method of physical discipline. He denied that [E] had pleaded with him to stop beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I accept the Father’s account of the incident. Apart from [E], no other witnesses, including the Mother herself, gave evidence on this incident in their affidavits. According to [E], [A] was having difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed, and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly and it was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]. Yet despite the severity of the alleged beating, breathing difficulty and nosebleed, there is no evidence that medical attention was sought for [A]. I also note that the Mother herself has given no evidence at all regarding this incident in her affidavits or on the stand, if it had indeed transpired as [E] described, despite citing numerous other incidents less serious in nature throughout her case. On balance, I preferred the Father’s account of what occurred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13. Incident in or around October or November 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     This incident was also only mentioned in [E]’s affidavit. According to [E], the Father, [A] and herself were on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor lift lobby of the matrimonial flat as the Mother was breastfeeding [B] and they wanted to keep [A] away from the Mother. [A] was crying because he wanted to be with the Mother. [E] alleged that the Father shouted at [A] and threatened to leave [A] on the 17<sup>th</sup> floor of the block, which was the highest floor of the block. [E]’s evidence was that [A] cried, then suddenly became unnaturally quiet. [E] alleged that after this incident, [A] became very afraid of entering the lift of the matrimonial flat, saying, “I don’t want, I don’t want. Don’t press the 17<sup>th</sup> floor button”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father disputed [E]’s account entirely. He stated that he was unable to recall such an incident as he had never threatened to leave [A] at the highest floor of the block. He asserted that it was the helpers and the Mother’s parents who used this threat when [A] lived with them on weekdays. He did not know if anyone had actually taken [A] to the top floor of the matrimonial flat before. He stated that [E] herself had also jokingly threatened to take [A] to the top floor if he misbehaved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I preferred the Father’s evidence over [E]’s. I found it difficult to accept that a toddler would have the concept of the 17<sup>th</sup> floor as the highest floor and become very afraid of entering the lift of the matrimonial flat, to the extent that he would say specifically “Don’t press the 17<sup>th</sup> floor button” after only 1 incident when he was threatened on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor lift lobby, which was on a completely different floor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In any event, even if the Father had threatened to leave [A] on the 17<sup>th</sup> floor of the block (which I did not accept), I do not see how this caused [A] to be in fear of hurt. I also do not see how the Father could be said to have wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place [A] in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">14. Incident on or around 17 March 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Mother exhibited an audio recording of the Father shouting at [A] in the car and threatening to beat him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The Father explained that this recording was taken 3 weeks after the Father stopped talking with the Mother and her parents. He wanted to go to church that day as he needed to pray. Before parties got into the car, [A] started claiming that he did not want the Father to go to church with them. The Father ignored this. Inside the car, [A] sat on the Mother’s lap in the front passenger seat and was holding a portable fan. [A] started hitting the Father with the portable fan while saying, “I don’t like dada, I hate dada”. The Father told him to stop being rude. [A] did not stop even after he was told by the Father to stop thrice. The Father took the portable fan away from [A] and told him that he was going to discipline him. The Father maintained that he did not hit [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The transcript of the recording showed that after the Father told [A] to “stop beating people already”, [A] stated “Later I beat you Dada. I beat”. When the Father stated, “You want me to take out the cane?”, [A’s] response was “Go Away”. In fact, [A] tells the Father 3 times to “Go away”. On the whole, I did not find that the Father’s actions were anything out of the ordinary in the normal disciplining of a child. I reject the proposition that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">15. Incident on or around 4 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Mother stated that [A] was with them at the matrimonial flat as it was a weekend. The Mother suspected that the Father had contracted Covid-19 and asked him not to go too close to the twins especially since they were born premature, making them more susceptible to illness than their peers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     [A] was helping to feed [C] in the playpen but the Father wanted to feed [C] instead. The Mother reminded the Father not to go too near [C] as the Father was unwell. The Father shouted at the Mother that she was preventing him from having access to [C]. He also shouted at [A], saying it was unfair that [A] who was sick could feed [C], when he could not. The Mother stated that [A] then cowered in fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Subsequently, the Mother, [A] and [E] (the helper who looked after [A]) went out. When they returned around 4 pm, the Father approached [A] who did not want to speak to the Father. The Father got angry and started to scold [A] for having “shit values” and that he was brought up by the Mother and her parents to be hateful. The Mother asked [A] and the helper to go up to [A]’s room to be away from the Father. She then carried [B] to the kitchen to put some distance between herself and the Father. The Father continued to yell at her and accused her of telling everyone that he was crazy and not a good father. He berated her for not being a good mother. She started to video record him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Father submitted that the video recording submitted by the Mother showed that he walked away from the Mother right after stating his points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I do not accept that the Mother or [A] was in fear of hurt. There is no evidence that the Father threatened any act of physical violence. At all times, the Mother was fully in the position to intervene and disengage, as when she told [A] and the helper to go up to [A]’s room. She was also able to go out with [A] in the afternoon. She also went freely to the kitchen to put some distance between herself and the Father. I also did not find that the Father had the necessary intent to place or attempt to place her or [A] in fear of hurt. He walked away from the Mother after stating his points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">16. Incident on or around 9 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The Mother’s version was that her mother was at the matrimonial flat that afternoon to care for the twins and her mother had a scuffle with the Father’s mother who had also come by to the matrimonial flat. The Mother rushed home from work and then texted their marriage counsellor [Y]. Subsequently, the Mother heard objects being thrown on the floor and the Father screaming expletives. He also slammed the door of the study room. She went upstairs to investigate and heard the Father shouting while he was talking with [Y] over the phone. The Mother overheard that he was shouting “cunt”, “motherfucker”, “hateful” and “go to hell”. She deduced that [Y] must have called the Father after receiving the Mother’s text message. She captured an audio recording of the Father taken from the outside the study room shouting while he was on the phone with [Y].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Shortly after, the Father opened the door of the study room and saw the Mother standing in the hallway of the second floor. He came very close to her, pointed threateningly at her and shouted at her. She started recording his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The helper who looked after [B] came up the stairs and took [B] whom the Mother was carrying. The Father turned away from the Mother and walked away and the Mother took the chance to go to the first floor. She then called the police and while waiting for the police to arrive, locked herself, the twins [B] and [C] and the 2 helpers who looked after [B] and [C] in a room. The Mother submitted a copy of a memo from her psychologist dated 10 May 2024, whom she had been visiting since August 2017 for “mental health support due to stress and emotional trauma<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father submitted that the recordings did not show that he had sworn at the Mother or that he had directed his outburst at her. He submitted that the Mother’s psychologist was not called as a witness. More importantly, the psychologist’s memo dated 10 May 2024 did not state that family violence had been committed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On the whole, even if the events had occurred as alleged by the Mother, I do not accept that the Mother had been in fear of hurt. If she was indeed fearful after hearing objects being thrown on the floor and the Father screaming expletives and slamming the door of the study room on the second floor, it is unlikely that she would choose to walk upstairs to investigate and try to hear and audio record what the Father was saying in his conversation with [Y] behind closed doors. I accepted the Father’s submission that there was also no evidence that he had wilfully or knowingly placed the Mother or the children in fear of hurt. He was expressing his frustrations in the study room with the door closed when he was speaking to [Y] over the phone. The audio recording also showed that the Father was addressing [Y] and saying that “he did not want to fight (the Mother)” and that he “will not beat her and he will not touch her”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. I also note that the Mother had admitted at the trial that she had actually not seen the psychologist whose memo she exhibited dated 10 May 2024 on both the material dates of 9 and 10 May 2024. Her psychologist had also not met the Father as well<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>. There was also nothing in the memo that supported the Mother’s contention that family violence had been committed on 9 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17. Incident on or around 22 and 23 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The Mother alleged that sometime in the middle of the night, [C] woke up and began to cry. Both the Mother and the Father went downstairs where the helper who looked after her was patting her to sleep. The Father kept asking the helper to pass [C] to him but the helper did not want to. The Father accused the Mother of instructing the helper not to hand [C] to him. He then stomped away. The Mother went back upstairs to her room to sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Mother alleged that shortly after, she was lying in bed when the Father barged in and shouted at her and accused her of preventing him from having access to [C]. She hid under her blanket and remained silent. After shouting for a while, the Father left the room. She then locked the door to prevent him from entering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The next morning, while the Mother was getting ready for work, the Father continued to accuse her of preventing him from carrying the twins. She called the police as she was concerned the Father’s behaviour would escalate. The Father shouted at her and she took her phone to record him in an attempt to deter his abusive behaviour. Instead, the Father got in her face, taunted her for recording him, grabbed her arm and shook her violently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     Before the Mother left the house, she wanted to carry [B] for a while to say goodbye. The Father who was sitting in [B]’s playpen and carrying [B] refused and asked the Mother why she needed to carry [B] and stop the Father from spending time with [B]. She told him she was not stopping the Father from spending time with [B] and she just wanted to carry [B] for a short while. She then entered the playpen to take [B] out and carried him while the Father followed her around the residence and accused him of not letting him have [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     After the Mother put [B] down and left him in his helper’s care, she went to the main door of the residence to leave for work when the Father berated her from a distance, again accusing her of not letting him have [B]. He then approached her threateningly while she was at the main door. The Mother said she feared for her safety and went towards a “safety room” where the helpers of [B] and [C] were and tried to close the door. However, the Father stuck his arm into the opening of the doorway and shouted that the Mother could not lock herself, the 2 helpers and the twins in the room as that would deny him access to the twins. He then struck the door of the room with his arm that was in the opening of the door multiple times and threatened her that he would tell the police that she had hurt him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     After a while, the Father removed his arm from the door and the helper who looked after [C] carried her out as [C] needed to feed. At the same time, the police arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Father disputed the Mother’s allegation that he had grabbed her arm and shook her while she was trying to film him. He also disputed that the room was a “safety room” and alleged that the Mother would always take the children into the room when she wanted to deny him access to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     After considering the evidence, I did not find that family violence had been committed. Despite having the CCTVs in the matrimonial flat, and having her phone recording on, the only recording submitted by the Mother of the Father allegedly shaking her violently was only 5 seconds long and did not show the Father shaking her violently<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The recording also showed that the Father did not raise his voice at her. In any event, I will add that even if the Father had grabbed the Mother’s arm and shook her, this action did not cause the Mother to be in fear of hurt. The Mother’s own evidence was that shortly after this, she chose to go to the playpen where the Father was sitting in and carrying [B] in as she wanted to spend time with [B]. If she was truly in fear of hurt, it was inexplicable that she would dare to approach the Father who was sitting in the playpen with [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     For completeness, I will add that the Mother’s evidence was that even before the police arrived, the Father had removed his arm from the door and the helper who looked after [C] carried her out as [C] needed to feed. Again, if the Mother was truly in fear of being hurt, it really did not make sense that she would allow [C] and the helper to leave as surely [C]’s need to be fed could wait till the police arrived.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">18. Incident on 25 May 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Mother alleged that on 25 May 2024, a Saturday, the Father wanted to take [C] out to a picnic with his friends. The Mother did not agree that he should take [C] out on his own without the support of the helpers. The Father threatened to take [C] out of the residence and to the picnic and also threatened to stop her from taking [A] out for his activities if she did not allow the Father to bring [C] out for the picnic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     The Mother was afraid that the Father would go through with his threat of stopping her from taking [A] out and called the police for assistance. The Father learnt that she had called the police and followed the Mother from the living room to the main door where she was waiting for the police. He accused her of denying him access to the children and said that if she did not let him have the children, he would not allow her to have the children and threatened to have Child Protection Services take the children away. When the policemen arrived, they spent a substantial amount of time in the Father’s room. Subsequently one of the policemen called the Mother to the room and spoke to both of them together. The Mother made a police report regarding the incident. As she was afraid for both her and the children’s safety, she asked her mother to stay with them until the following Monday 27 May 2024 when she applied for PPOs for herself and the 3 children as well as a DEO in respect of the entire matrimonial residence. On 27 May 2024, an Expedited Order was granted to restrain the Father from committing family violence against the Mother and [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The Father denied the Mother’s assertions that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Taking the Mother’s case at its highest, what transpired was that a disagreement broke out after the Mother refused to allow the Father to take [C] out to a picnic. I did not see how this could have caused the Mother or the children to be in fear of hurt. I also did not see how the Father could have the necessary intent to place the Mother in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">19. Incident on 1 June 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The Mother alleged that she had returned to the matrimonial flat after bringing [A] to his art class. The Father was carrying [B] in the living room while she was in the kitchen. Suddenly, the Father blurted out without any provocation, “Daddy doesn’t want to be around hateful people. Such hateful people with hateful values”. She alleged that the Father handled [B] roughly while putting him down in the playpen, causing [B] to cry. The Mother alleged that the Father did not even bother to soothe [B] and simply walked away and shouted at the Mother, “Get out of my face and out of my life”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>. The Father then went upstairs and slammed the door of the study room<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     In the Mother’s closing submissions, she stated that she had been in the kitchen at that time, away from the Father and had not spoken to the Father nor done anything to him before this outburst. She submitted that “it is clear that the Father is volatile and unstable. He can suddenly lose control of his temper and flare up over nothing, putting the subject of his anger in danger”. She submitted that the Father’s handling of [B] in his agitated state suggested that when the Father is angry or agitated around [B], [B] would likely to be hurt or put in fear of hurt by the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Having viewed the video recording and examined the transcript<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>, I am not convinced that the Father had put [B] down in the playpen in a rough manner as alleged by the Mother. The area in the living room where the playpen was is not large. I accepted the Father’s explanation that he put [B] down as he wanted to leave the living room so as to not to engage further with the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     The Mother’s own evidence showed that she was not in fear of harm. She had originally been in the kitchen, away from the Father. I failed to see how she could have been in fear since after she heard the Father blurting out that he did not want to be around hateful people, she then voluntarily chose to come out of the kitchen to the living room where the Father was with [B] before the Father then said, “Get out of my face and get out of my life”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">20. Incident on 27 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Mother alleged that he had questioned the helpers in a threatening manner multiple times throughout the day after having read their affidavits. The Mother alleged that he hurled insults and expletives at her including “big liar”, “lying bitch”, “lying scum” and “vile human being”. She alleged that the Father “was standing in close proximity to (the Mother) and pointing and gesturing at (the Mother) while he insulted her. He could have hurt her physically if she had responded or retaliated to (his) tirade”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    The Mother further alleged that the Father had also involved his own mother and aunt to take [C] out of the home that afternoon despite the Mother’s objections. She submitted that “by taking [C] out of the home in the context of his threatening behaviour towards (the Mother) and the helpers that day… (he) was demonstrating that he, as the aggressor and as head of the household had control and dominance over the (Mother) and the children. After parties’ affidavits were exchanged, (he) felt the need to re-exert control over the Mother and the children”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The Father denied that family violence was committed. I accepted his submissions. Although the Mother submitted multiple recordings, text messages and a police report regarding the 27 July 2024 incident, none of the evidence showed that the Father had made any threat of hurt to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. I also note that it was the Mother who walked into the kitchen when the Father was talking to the helper. If the Mother was in fear of the Father, it defies logic that she would voluntarily walk into the kitchen and be in the Father’s way. The video also shows that the time period where the Father had interacted with the Mother in the kitchen only lasted for 40 seconds<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    For all the reasons stated above, I find that the Mother has not proven her case under limb (a) in that she has not shown that the Father had willingly or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Mother or any of the children in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(b) Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Physically abusing a family member constitutes family violence under limb (b). There are, however, two types of force which are exempted from the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of the Charter;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Force lawfully used in self-defence and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Force lawfully used by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age (“the Correction Exception”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    The Mother relied on 2 incidents to support her allegation that the Father had caused hurt to her and 2 other incidents to support her allegation that the Father had caused hurt to [A]. I will consider the incidents in turn:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1. Incident in or around August 2016</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    As stated in paragraph 13 above, the Mother had alleged that the Father had pinned her hand to a cabinet and bruised her hand sometime in August 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    I had accepted the Father’s version of what transpired in paragraph 15 above, that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him, causing him to push her arm away so that she would not hit him and as a result he came into contact with the Mother’s arm. His evidence given both in his affidavit and tested during cross-examination at the trial<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> was consistent that it was the Mother who had tried to assault him. There was no police report or medical evidence to the contrary. I accepted the Father’s evidence that he had acted in self-defence and I reject the Mother’s claim that the Father had committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">2. Incident on or around 22-23 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The only other incident where the Mother alleged that actual physical hurt was caused to her is stated in paragraph 85 above. The Mother alleged that she had called the police as she was concerned that the Father’s behaviour would escalate. The Father shouted at her and she took her phone to record him. The Father instead got in her face, taunted her for recording him, grabbed her arm and shook her violently, causing pain and soreness to her arm”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    I had found above in paragraph 90 that the video recording of the Father allegedly shaking the Mother was only 5 seconds long and did not show that he was shaking her violently. The Mother also did not produce any medical reports to show that she had suffered any injury or pain on her arm. Her own evidence did not suggest that she had suffered any injury, since shortly after this, she chose to go to the playpen where the Father was sitting in with [B] and ask the Father to pass [B] to her so that she could carry [B] to say goodbye before she left for work. In my judgment, the Father’s actions were in response to the Mother calling the police and taking out her phone to record him and I do not accept that actual physical hurt was caused to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">3. Incidents from 7 June 2023-12 June 2023 while parties were overseas </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    The next 2 incidents concerned [A]. The first incident occurred just after parties had taken the maxicab from the airport and arrived at their Airbnb accommodation. The only person who gave evidence that the Father had beat [A] was [E], the helper who looked after [A]. [E]’s evidence was that after they got off the maxicab, the Mother passed [A] to her parents to take care of him as the Mother was feeling very tired from carrying [A] throughout the whole flight from Singapore. [A] could not stop crying as he wanted to stick with the Mother and the Father took [A] from the Mother’s parents and “forcefully hit his buttocks and legs multiple times to stop him from crying”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    [E]’s account directly contradicted the Mother’s account of what transpired. The Mother’s evidence was that it was her father who brought [A] to his own adjacent Airbnb apartment and after a while, when her father managed to soothe [A], he brought [A] back to the Mother and the Father’s Airbnb apartment but when [A] saw the Father, [A] started crying again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    This alleged incident of physical hurt to [A] was also completely missing from the affidavit of the Mother’s father who was allegedly the one the Father took [A] from. If the Father had indeed taken [A] from the Mother’s father and then hit [A] forcefully on his buttocks and legs multiple times according to [E]’s account, it was puzzling why this important event was not mentioned at all in the affidavit of the Mother’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    On the whole, I found it difficult to accept [E]’s account that the Father had taken [A] from the Mother’s parents and hit him as it contradicted the Mother’s own account of what had transpired and it was entirely missing from the affidavit of the Mother’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    For completeness, I will add, that even if the Father had used physical force on [A] (which I did not accept), I would have gone on to consider if this fell within the Correction Exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    While there is, as the Family Court observed in <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> (“<em>VYB</em>”) at [11], growing suggestion internationally that physical punishment produces detrimental consequences in children, the Correction Exception remains part of Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    If indeed the Father had spanked [A] as claimed by [E], I am of the view that it could fall within the Correction Exception if it was done for the purpose of teaching discipline with a measure of good sense, in a judicious and responsible manner, and for the benefit of the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>. It was not in dispute that [A] was tired and had not slept well on the plane and had cried throughout the maxicab ride to the Airbnb. The Mother was very tired from carrying [A] throughout the flight and needed to rest, yet [A] still wanted to remain with the Mother. In my judgment, the Father’s correction of [A] in these circumstances would not have constituted family violence. The common law, which continues to underpin legal regulation of the relationship between parent and child in Singapore, has long supported the authority of a parent to inflict reasonable discipline on the chid, including some degree of physical punishment as long as it is a reasonable one. In <em>VYB</em>, the Court identified at [14] - [15], several related factors that shed light on the reasonableness of the physical punishment by a parent of a child. These include the reasons for the punishment, the nature of the punishment, and the age and personal characteristics of the child. I am of the view that the Father’s spanking of [A] on his butt and legs was not unreasonable considering the circumstances: that the Mother needed to rest after the flight but [A] was still crying and wanting to stick to her. I will also add that even if this incident of spanking could be considered harsh for a young child, consistent with the observations in <em>TCV (On behalf of Child, A) v TCU</em> [2015] SGFC at [14], the law does not intervene through the issuance of a PPO in every instance of parenting that exceeds the Correction Exception and a PPO will not be granted unless it is necessary for the protection of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">4. Incident in or around September 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    This was the only other incident in the Mother’s closing submissions where it was alleged that actual physical hurt had been caused to [A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    As stated in paragraph 63 above, [E] had alleged that [A] woke up from his afternoon nap and cried for the Mother. The Father came into the room and yelled at [A] to stop crying but he would not stop. The Father then took a bamboo cane and beat [A] multiple times on the leg. [E]’s evidence was that this caused [A] to scream, cry even more and choke on his own saliva. He had difficulty breathing and his nose started to bleed. [E] stated that she pleaded with the Father to stop beating [A] and the Mother rushed into the room because she heard [A] scream loudly. It was only then that the Father stopped beating [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    The Father disputed this, stating that [A] had been crying non-stop for a good half an hour. He recalled that the Mother had been increasingly telling him to be stricter and to discipline [A] and the Mother herself had also just started using a cane to discipline [A]. He carried [A] in an attempt to soothe him, but [A] would not stop crying and instead started hitting him. The Father told him to stop but he would not listen and this continued for at least another half an hour. The Father then took the cane and tried to apply the Mother’s method of physical discipline. He denied that [E] had pleaded with him to stop bearing [A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    I had accepted the Father’s account of the incident as stated at paragraph 65 above. As I have stated, despite the severity of the alleged beating, breathing difficulty and nosebleed, there is no evidence that medical attention was sought for [A]. The Mother herself also gave no evidence at all regarding this incident in her affidavits or on the stand, despite citing numerous other incidents less serious in nature throughout her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    I will also state that I do not find that the Father’s method of discipline towards [A] was overly excessive such that it crossed the boundaries set by the Correction Exception and amounted to family violence as defined in the Charter. There is also no evidence that this correction was for the Father’s own “gratification of passion” or “rage”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> as submitted by the Mother, and I do not accept her submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    I therefore find that the Mother has not shown that the Father had caused hurt to her and/or [A] under limb (b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(c) Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    The Mother also relied on limb (c) to state that when the Father had stood at the doorway when the Father stood at the doorway and blocked her from leaving the room with [A] in or around December 2020, he had wrongfully confined or restrained her against her will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    As per paragraph 31 above, the Mother had alleged that she was carrying [A] in the bedroom when her parents were out. The Father came into the room and asked to take [A]. She declined as [A] was asleep and she did not want him to be disturbed. The Father shouted at her and accused her of denying him access to [A]. He tried to snatch [A] from her and she retreated into a corner of the room to avoid him. She tried to get past the Father to leave the room but he came very close to her with his arms outstretched towards her and [A]. The Mother stated that eventually she managed to get past the Father and leave the room with [A]. She went quickly to her parents’ room where her phone was and called her father. By then, the Father had left and she returned to the bedroom with [A] and locked the door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    I had found earlier at paragraph 36 that it was the Mother’s actions of carrying [A], who was the subject of the disagreement, and trying to leave the room that led to the escalation of the situation. The Father’s actions merely showed that he wanted access to [A] which the Mother was refusing to give. I do not find that the Mother was confined or restrained in her room. In fact, it was her own evidence that she managed to leave the room with [A] and that she got past the Father. In my view, the Mother could easily have left [A] who was sleeping in the room and left at any point since it was access to [A] that the Father sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    I therefore find that the Mother has not shown that the Father had wrongfully confined or restrained her against her will under limb (c).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">(d) Continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    The Mother also alleged that the Father had continually harassed her and the children under limb (d). The Mother submitted that the Father’s harassing behaviour towards and the children was repeated across multiple incidents such that they constituted prolonged, persistent or sustained conduct, and even if each incident in and of itself may not be sufficient to warrant a PPO being granted, taken together, they showed a persistent course of conduct on the Father’s part to alarm and distress the Mother whenever he was upset or angry, which has caused severe and repeated anguish to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Saying threatening words to the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    The Mother also submitted that the Father continually harassed her with threatening words with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause her anguish in the following 3 incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Incident in 2020 during the Mother’s pregnancy with [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    The Mother alleged that sometime during her pregnancy in 2020, the Father had demanded a divorce and told ger that it would be better if she had a miscarriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Incident on or around 25 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    The Mother alleged that the Father threatened to forcefully bring [A] out for a picnic with his friend despite her disagreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Incident on or around 27 July 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    The Mother alleged that after the Father had seen her and her witnesses’ AEICs, he threatened her to “watch out” and this caused her to feel afraid and threatened by his words.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Saying threatening words to [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    The Mother submitted that the Father continually harassed [A] with threatening words with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause him anguish in the following incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Incidents from 7-12 June 2023 while parties were overseas</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    The Mother alleged that during their overseas trip, the Father threatened [A] as follows: on 7 June 2023 when [A] could not stop crying, the Father threatened to beat him and leave him behind. On 9 June 2023 when the Father threatened to abandon [A] in the shopping street and let passers-by take [A] away when [A] would not stop crying. On 10 June 2023, when the Father threatened [A] that the maxicab driver would take him away if he did not stop crying and on 11 June 2023, when the Father threatened to leave [A] behind when he was tired and fussy at the airport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Incident in or around October or November 2023 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    The Mother submitted that in or around October or November 2023, the Father threatened to leave [A] at the top floor of the matrimonial flat when [A] cried when he was insecure being away from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Incident on or around 25 May 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    The Mother alleged that the Father insisted on bringing [C] to a picnic and kept shouting at the Mother who was then carrying [A] saying “Why cannot bring [C] out’. To keep [A] safe, the Mother handed [A] to his helper who brought [A] to his room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Shouting/using vulgarities and slurs/insults in a hostile manner</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">1. Towards the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    The Mother submitted in the closing submissions that the Father had caused her continual harassment by shouting, using vulgarities and slurs, and/or insulting her and relied on 15 incidents from 2020 till July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span>. She highlighted that the Husband had apologised for the incident on or around 23 August 2020, where he had used vulgar language on her and her parents, showing that he knew such behaviour would cause distress to the Mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2. Towards [A]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    The Mother submitted that the Father had caused [A] continual harassment by shouting, using vulgarities and slurs, and/or insulting him, or shouting in his presence during 8 incidents from 2020 till July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3. Towards the Twins</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    The Mother relied on 6 incidents of the Father’s behaviour of shouting in the presence of one or both of the twins when the Father was shouting to submit that he was likely to cause or have caused continual harassment. She further stated that “considering (his) pattern of behaviour, especially how he has treated [A] who is now 4 years old, it does not require a leap of logic to see that (the Father) would also be behaving in the same hostile and harassing manner to [B] and [C], if such behaviour goes unchecked”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Hitting or throwing things/pointing aggressively/cornering or following around aggressively/intruding into a safe space</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    The Mother further submitted that the Father had caused continual harassment through 3 incidents of hitting or throwing things in the incidents in or around July 2020, 23 August 2020 and 12 February 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    She also alleged that the Father had caused her continual harassment by pointing at her aggressively during 3 incidents, namely on or around 4 May 2024, 9 May 2024 and 27 July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    Furthermore, she submitted that the Father cornered her or followed her around aggressively in 4 incidents, in or around December 2020, 9 May 2024, 22 and 23 May 2024 and 25 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    The Mother also submitted that the Father had intruded into her safe space twice during the incidents on or around 22 and 23 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    There is no legislative definition for the term, “harassment”, as it is used in limb (d) of s 64 of the Charter. We must therefore look to the cases which have interpreted the term “harassment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    The case of <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> (“<em>Yue Tock Him</em>”) is instructive. The District Court ruled that “harassment” means: “a course of conduct by a person, whether by words or action, directly or through third parties, sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause, and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance of another person”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    Further, the conduct that is said to constitute “harassment” must be “continual” to constitute “family violence” – a single act of harassment does not, in itself, constitute “family violence”. Following from this, “not all unpleasant or annoying behaviour between two family members will, by itself, be considered as “family violence”. Only sufficiently serious and grave conduct, which are continual and sufficiently repetitive will meet the requirement (see <em>WDR v WDQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27586-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 46</a> and <em>VKW v VKX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24914-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 70</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    These requirements may, at first glance, appear rather stringent to a victim of family violence. However, as the District Court explained in <em>Yue Tock Him</em>, it is necessary that the law protects against frivolous complaints that make an issue of the most trivial of matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_147\"></a>147    None of the incidents either on their own, or in totality, involve serious threat of harm to the Mother or the children. They may fairly be characterised as loud and antagonistic disagreements. However, it would be inappropriate for the Court to rule that such incidents constitute family violence, without more.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_148\"></a>148    I would also add that while the Mother cited incidents spanning from 2020 to July 2024, there are clearly several breaks in continuity between the incidents. The 21 incidents that she cited as constituting harassment occurred across more than 6 years. 1 incident occurred in 2016, 4 occurred in 2020, 3 in 2021, 1 in 2022, 4 in 2023 and 7 in 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span>. I do not find that this demonstrated a repetitive and sustained pattern of behaviour which warranted the grant of a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_149\"></a>149    While the Father’s conduct may not have met the highest standards of husbandhood, on the totality of the incidents alleged by the Mother, even taken at its highest, I do not find that there was sufficiently serious and grave conduct by the Father, which was continual and sufficiently repetitive as to constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Necessary for the protection of a family member</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_150\"></a>150    I have found above that the Mother had not shown that family violence had not been committed under any of the limbs (a) to (d). For completeness, I will go on to state that I would also not have found that the Mother had satisfied the second limb of S 65(1) of the Women’s Charter, that it was necessary on the facts to grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_151\"></a>151    Necessity is determined by whether there are likely to be further acts of family violence committed against the particular family member, in the event that a PPO is not granted. This is because a PPO is not a punitive measure to punish a person for past violence but is instead a preventive order that serves to restrain the person concerned from committing family violence in future. Therefore, if it is unlikely that there will be family violence in future, it serves no purpose to restrain the party concerned, and it must follow that a personal protection order would not be necessary (<em>Yue</em>, at [64]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_152\"></a>152    Further, as the Family Court explained in <em>WLP v WLQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29626-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 10</a> at [15], the concept of “necessity” implies that there must be a measure of effectiveness to the end sought. An order that is ineffective in addressing family violence will be “extraneous to and hardly necessary for the protection or personal safety of the applicant”. In other words, this statutorily prescribed requirement of necessity serves as a safeguard against unnecessary intervention by the Court in family matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_153\"></a>153    The only 2 incidents cited by the Mother that allegedly involved physical harm occurred in August 2016 and then 8 years later in May 2024. I have found on the facts that no such physical harm occurred to her. All the other allegations concerned verbal disagreements that, while undoubtedly uncomfortable, do not amount to family violence. No serious incidents of physical violence or persistent harassment have been proved by the Mother. Accordingly, the granting of a PPO is not necessary in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_154\"></a>154    Specifically with regards to the children, there is currently no court order for custody, care and control and access of the children. That being the case, the Court will also be loath to intervene to issue a PPO when this may indirectly restrict or hamper the Father’s access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_155\"></a>155    It is evident that the arrival of the children to the family unit has placed tremendous strain on the Mother. She had explained in her affidavit that all their children were conceived by way of IUI and she had undergone multiple IUI attempts in 2019 and 2022 where she received more than 1,000 hormonal injections over multiple months. The Mother stated that having gone through so much just to conceive the children, their welfare was her utmost priority. The twins were born pre-mature and she was especially concerned about their physical health. She listed the sacrifices she had made for their children, such as breastfeeding [A] until he was 2 years old despite working full-time and then subsequently breastfeeding [B] and [C] until they were 8 months old, continuing to pump milk every 3 hours for the twins’ dietary needs. She also extended her maternity leave and went on part-time and flexi-work arrangements to care for the children. She also employed 2 helpers to help with caring for each of the twins. In addition, there is a third helper who cares for [A] who has stayed with the Mother’s parents since he was born, coming over to the matrimonial flat only on weekends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>. I would urge the Father to seriously reflect on his behaviour and consider what made the Mother pursue this application against him. Although her application for a PPO has failed, this should not be construed as a victory for him. He should learn to control his temper and exercise more patience and care towards the Mother, failing which it may be that a PPO may be granted if the conflict between the parties does escalate in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_156\"></a>156    It is not uncommon that new parents of young children face considerable issues adapting to their new roles, and that disputes over different parenting styles and expectations may arise. It is evident that both parents love their children dearly. I encourage the Mother to accept as much help as she can from the Father in parenting the children and the Father to exercise much patience and care towards the Mother. Both the Mother and Father have a long journey of parenting ahead of them, a journey that can be both challenging and rewarding. The children are young and require all the love and support from both the Father and the Mother and I hope that they can do the best that they can for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Domestic Exclusion Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_157\"></a>157    The Mother had applied for a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) against the Father in respect of the entire matrimonial home where they resided. As I have dismissed the Mother’s application for the PPOs, I will also dismiss her application for the DEO.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a

Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       On the 7<sup>th</sup> of October 2021, the Wife filed for divorce. Parties had managed to find common ground on the ancillary matters, and this was recorded, by way of consent, in the interim judgment. Final judgment was obtained on the 4<sup>th</sup> of February 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties marked their return to court when, on the 26<sup>th</sup> of August 2024, the Husband applied, <em>vide</em> SUM 2713/2024 (“SUM 2713”) to vary the paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) of the interim judgment. This arose from a change in the care arrangements for one of the children who had relocated abroad to continue his studies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That child is currently living in a student dormitory.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In essence, the Husband seeks to vary the orders in relation to care and control of the three children of the marriage, as well as maintenance. It is in this context that the Husband has taken out his application for discovery and interrogatories <em>vide</em> SUM 3502/2024 (“SUM 3502”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties on 20 January 2025 on the bulklist and reserved judgment. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       These are the items which the Husband seeks in his application for discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s payslips from April 2024 to present (Item 1);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s CPF transaction history for the past 15 months (Item 2);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife’s IRAS Notices of Assessment and any other tax documents arising from any employment she may have overseas (Item 3);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Wife’s employment contract and/or any letters from her employer in relation to the latest change in her pay, if any (Item 4);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Monthly statements from the Wife’s bank accounts (whether sole or joint) from April 2024 to present (Item 5);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Supporting documents in relation to the Wife’s expenses for herself and the children of the marriage (from April 2024 to present) (Item 6).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As for the Husband’s application for interrogatories, these are the items sought:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A list showing the Wife’s position on expenses for Child [A] and Child [B] (Item 1);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A list showing the Wife’s position on expenses for herself (Item 2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There were two main arguments which counsel for the Wife, Ms Linda Joelle Ong (“Ms Ong”) advanced, both at the hearing before me, and in written submissions, as to why the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories should be dismissed in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       First, that there is no causative link to re-assess maintenance for all three children “on the basis of the recent change of only one child residing in Japan”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In other words, the Wife argues that the Husband has no basis to seek a variation of the orders in the interim judgment, which were made by consent – and in that vein, his application in SUM 3502 must therefore be dismissed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I cannot accept this argument. I am not the judge hearing the Husband’s application for variation in SUM 2713. It is not for me to decide, at the interlocutory stage, where the merits of that application may lie. I would also add that insofar as the Wife alleges that the Husband’s application for variation in SUM 2713 is without merit, she has not applied to strike out his application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The second argument follows a similar line of logic. Ms Ong highlighted, during the hearing, that the order which the Husband sought to vary was a consent order. Citing cases such as <em>WNF v WNG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29837-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 15</a> and <em>WWA v WWB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31572-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 33</a>, Ms Ong argued that the Husband could not discharge his burden of showing that there was a material change in circumstances which justified the court varying the maintenance order which had been recorded by way of consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> It thus followed that his application for discovery and interrogatories should be dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As I have explained above (at [9]), I am not hearing the substantive matters in SUM 2713, nor am I dealing with an application to strike out SUM 2713. While I can, in assessing the relevance and necessity of the items listed in the Husband’s application in SUM 3502, take into account the fact that his application in SUM 2713 is to vary a consent order, assessing whether he can demonstrate a material change in circumstances would be a bridge too far.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to consider the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories, bearing in mind the twin principles of relevance and necessity which govern such applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I start with the Husband’s request for interrogatories. There were two requests. The common thread binding them is that the Wife is asked to state her position on the expenses for two children, [A] and [B] as well as her own expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As a preliminary point, I add that the interrogatory, as framed, is rather ambiguous. It could mean either one of the following two things:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife is being asked to state her position as to what would be reasonable expenses in relation to herself, and Child [A] and [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is being asked to state her expenses, as well as that of Child [A] and Child [B].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     During the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Ms Eileen Lim (“Ms Lim”), clarified that it was the latter meaning that the Husband was referring to (see [14(b)] above). However, even if one were to proceed on this basis, the interrogatory is still ambiguous because it does not specify a time period (<em>ie</em>, that the Wife is being asked to state her average monthly expenditure for the past 6 months).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Notwithstanding this, I will allow the Husband’s request for interrogatories. I am conscious of the fact that it is the Husband who is seeking to vary the orders in relation to maintenance – to that end, he not only has to convince the court that there is a material change of circumstances warranting the variation, but also the extent to which the order should be varied (see the approach taken in <em>AYM v AYL and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a>). Framed this way, it is evident that the Husband’s interrogatories will certainly have a bearing on the extent to which the order should be varied. To deal with the ambiguity that I had earlier noted (above at [14]), I will order that the Wife state her average monthly expenditure, as well as that of Child [A] and [B], for the past 3 months (<em>ie</em>, November 2024 to January 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I turn now to consider the Husband’s request for discovery. The six items listed (see above at [5]) may be broadly divided into two groups: a) documents showing the Wife’s financial means (Items 1 – 5), and b) documents showing the expenses for herself and the three children (Item 6).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It must be remembered that the Husband’s application in SUM 2713 is to vary a consent order in relation to child maintenance. In that vein, it goes without saying that the obligation to maintain a child is one that is jointly shared by both parents (see <em>WFK v WFL</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 261 at [128(a)] citing <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a>). In deciding how this obligation is to be apportioned, the financial capacity of each parent is a relevant consideration. As the court in <em>WWA v WWB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31572-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 33</a> had noted (at [61] – [62]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">61    It is an established principle that the financial obligations of parents depend on their financial capacity. As noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (at [38]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">… financial capacity need not be rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. Consistent with s 69(4)(b) of the Charter, the court should consider the parties’ “income, earning capacity (if any), property and other financial resources”, as well as significant liabilities and financial commitments. For instance, a party who earns no income but has substantial savings or had received substantial inheritance would well be able to afford to bear a higher burden of the maintenance obligation, if reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The court should also have regard to the assets received by parties after the division of their matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">62    As the Mother is seeking to vary the maintenance order, the burden of proving the existence of a material change in circumstances rests with her: see <em>AXM v AXO</em> [2014] 2 SLR 805 (at [31]). The Mother says that she no longer has an income or earning capacity, though this is disputed by the Father. However, even taking her case at its highest, I found that she has not discharged the burden of proof. <b>As noted above, the financial capacity of a party is not rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. The court is required to consider the party’s property and other financial resources. A party who earns no income may well have property and other financial resources that could meet his or her maintenance obligation.</b> As the Mother has not provided any evidence of her property or other financial resources, there is no basis for the court to form an accurate assessment of her financial capacity that would warrant a variation. Accordingly, I made no order on her cross-application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It follows from this that the documents which the Husband seeks in Items 1 – 5 are relevant and necessary to the hearing of SUM 2713. These documents would paint a picture as to the Wife’s financial capacity and allow the court to determine the extent to which the order should be varied (assuming that the court is indeed satisfied that there is a material change in circumstances warranting such a variation) (see <em>AYM v AYL and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16670-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 559</a> generally and at [16]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It also follows, from the above, that the documents which the Husband seeks in Item 6 are also relevant and necessary. The documents showing the Wife’s expenses will go towards assessing her financial capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As for the proof of the children’s expenses, I do not think it can be seriously disputed that such documents are also relevant and necessary to the hearing of SUM 2713 (see <em>WFK v WFL</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 261 at [122]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For completeness, I add that I do not agree with Ms Ong’s argument in written submissions that the Father’s requests are a “blanket inquiry” into the Mother’s income and expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> As I have explained above (at [18] – [19]), these documents build a picture as to the Wife’s financial capacity and will allow the court to assess how the obligation to maintain the children should be apportioned, assuming, of course, that the court is indeed minded to vary the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I will therefore allow the Husband’s request for all the items sought in discovery (see above at [5]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In summary, the Husband’s application in SUM 3502 is allowed in its entirety, subject to the following modification I have made to the interrogatories ordered (see above at [16]). The Wife is to file her compliance affidavit by 4 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing SUM 2713.

They had a son and a daughter, who were born in February 2011 and in March 2012 respectively. By 2018, the marriage had fallen apart. In December 2021, these divorce proceedings were commenced. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in May 2022 on the ground that each spouse had behaved in a manner that made it intolerable for the other to continue to live with him or her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Despite the differences that led to this divorce, the spouses continued to co-parent their children. They agreed to share the custody of the children. They also agreed that the wife was to have care and control of the children and that the husband was to have access to the children each week, on public holidays and other special occasions, and during the children’s school vacations. This cooperation between the spouses was heartening, and these arrangements recorded in order of court dated August 2022 that was made with the consent of the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the spouses on the remaining ancillary matters, which were the division of the matrimonial assets and the maintenance of the wife and the children. I divided the matrimonial assets 63.5:36.5 in favour of the husband. I also ordered the husband to maintain the wife for two years in the monthly sum of $200 and the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The wife is dissatisfied with my decisions on the division of the matrimonial assets other than the matrimonial home and on the maintenance for the children. I now provide my reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       As the Court of Appeal observed in <em>WQP v WQQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32465-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 34</a> at [43], the division of matrimonial assets implicates a 4-stage process. First, the identification of the matrimonial assets. Second, the valuation of those matrimonial assets. Third, the determination of the contributions of the spouses to the acquisition of those matrimonial assets. Fourth, the fair apportionment of the matrimonial assets between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Identification and valuation of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I began by identifying and valuing the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in joint names</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The matrimonial home was the only asset that the spouses held jointly. The wife is not challenging my decision on the division of the matrimonial home and is challenging on my decision on the division of the other assets. Still, for completeness, and because I had examined all the matrimonial assets (including the matrimonial home globally), I set out my decision on it briefly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The value of the matrimonial home as a matrimonial asset was the difference in the market price of the matrimonial home and the outstanding amount on the loan that had been taken for the purchase of the matrimonial home. The wife submitted that the market value of the matrimonial home was $889,000. The husband submitted that the market value of the matrimonial home was $819,000. In the absence of better evidence on the market value of the matrimonial home and given the relatively small difference between the values put forward by the parties, I took the middle of these two values (<em>ie</em>, $854,000) as the market value of the matrimonial home. The spouses agreed that the outstanding loan on the matrimonial home was $415,736. Accordingly, the value of the matrimonial home in the pool of matrimonial assets was therefore $479,124.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in name of wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I set out the assets in the name of the wife and the values that each spouse ascribed to each of these assets.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"61.26%\"><col width=\"19.36%\"><col width=\"19.38%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s Value (S$)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s Value (S$)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Central Provident Fund Balances</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">29,739</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">29,739</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">UOB Bank Account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,262</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,262</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">POSB Bank Account</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,954</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,954</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tencent (400 shares)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21,080</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">21,080</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Xiaomi (3,400 shares)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5,864</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5,864</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Monies Withdrawn</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">148,625</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Sub-Total</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>64,899</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>213,524</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The spouses agreed that the wife had Central Provident Fund balances of $29,739, a UOB Bank Account with $6,262, a POSB Bank Account with $1,954, 400 Tencent shares with a value of $21,080, and 3,400 Xiaomi shares with a value of $5,864. All these items and their corresponding values were thus included in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     But the spouses took different views on monies amounting to $148,625 that the wife had withdrawn between January 2019 and September 2022 from her UOB Bank Account and her POSB Bank Account. The wife did not dispute that she had withdrawn these monies but explained that she had spent the monies on the household. The husband disagreed and submitted that these monies should be included in the pool of matrimonial assets that fell to be divided between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence of the wife, the marriage had broken down by 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The withdrawals, which took place between 2019 and 2022, had been made after the marriage had broken down. Once a marriage had broken down, any substantial sum expended by a spouse other than for daily or run-of-the-mill expenses had to be returned to the asset pool if the monies would otherwise have been matrimonial assets and the other spouse had not consented to the expenditure. Regardless of whether the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate the monies, or for the benefit of children or relatives, the spouse who made the expenditure had to be prepared to bear it personally and in full (see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31318-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 11</a> at [43] and [49] citing <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was therefore incumbent on the wife to account for the $148,625 as run-of-the-mill expenses and/or show that the husband had consented to the expenditures in question (see <em>WJG v WJH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29111-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 28</a> at [29(c)]). Beyond bare assertions that the monies had been spent on the family, however, the wife offered little explanation for the expenditure. Although it was unsurprising that objective or documentary evidence may not have been available to bear out every expenditure in a family, the absence of such evidence to support even the larger withdrawals cast doubt on the credibility of explanations of the wife for the withdrawals as a whole.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I set out the notable withdrawals for which the objective evidence did not bear out and/or sat inconsistently with the claims of the wife on them:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife withdrew $15,000 between February and March 2020 and suggested that she had done so to support herself and the children when they moved out of the matrimonial home after the marriage had broken down. But neither the wife nor the children did in fact move out of the matrimonial home, and they continued to reside in the matrimonial home even at the time of these proceedings. Further, it was not in dispute that the husband had supported the family and paid for the outgoings of the household during the marriage, even after the wife had purported to move out of the matrimonial home. This left little need for the wife to withdraw monies to support herself and the children over and beyond that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The wife withdrew $16,000 in April 2022 and suggested that she had much of these monies had been spent on course fees of $19,227 for a master’s degree for herself. But these course fees had been paid in two tranches – of $8,471 and $10,756 – with the latter due only in November 2022. And the wife offered no explanation for why she had made a withdrawal in April 2022 to meet course fees that were due over six months thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife withdrew $20,000 in July 2022 to repay a loan from one “Texas Lee”. But there was no documentary evidence in support of any liability by the wife to pay such a sum. This absence of documentation of the liability was particularly surprising given the relatively large quantum of this expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The wife withdrew $13,000 in December 2021, and $12,485 across July and August 2022 and claimed that part of the monies went to paying her legal expenses, ostensibly for these divorce proceedings. But legal fees for divorce proceedings should in principle be paid out of the payor’s share of the matrimonial assets and not the pool of matrimonial assets in general (see <em>WUA v WUB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31018-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 10</a> at [8]). Such expenditures had to be added back to the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Adding the $148,625 that the wife had withdrawn after the marriage had broken down to the other assets in the name of the wife, the value of the assets in the name of the wife totalled $213,524.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Assets in name of husband</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I set out the assets in the name of the husband and the values that each spouse ascribed to each of these assets.</p> <table align=\"left\"

husband were not in dispute, whether as to the identity of the assets or the value of the assets. The only assets over which the spouses diverged were 475 shares in Meta Platforms, Inc, a time deposit account in OCBC Bank that the husband held jointly with his mother, and the proceeds of the sale of shares in a business called “[PB]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The spouses agreed that 475 Meta shares in the name of the husband were matrimonial assets. But they diverged over the date at which those shares were to be valued. The wife submitted that these shares were to be valued at the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, when these shares were worth $309,415. The husband submitted that these shares were to be valued at the date of the interim judgment in May 2022, when these shares were worth only $76,090. In <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> (“<em>VQF</em>”) at [1], the Family Division of the High Court observed that the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets was the date of the interim judgment, which dissolved the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets, save for money account balances, was the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters, because that date would facilitate the use of the most up-to-date values in ascertaining the economic fruits of the marriage. The husband asserted that the four-fold increase in the value of the Meta shares should accrue solely to him because it was his decision to hold the shares beyond the date of the interim judgment that produced the increase in the value of the shares. But there was little evidence to show, as of the date of the interim judgment, that the husband was assuming solely for himself rather than for the matrimonial pool the consequences of holding the Meta shares beyond that date. Without such evidence, there was little reason to depart from the position in <em>VQF</em>. The date for valuing the 475 Meta shares was thus the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. At that date, these shares had a value of $309,415.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It was also not in dispute that there was a time deposit with OCBC Bank in the names of the husband and his mother that had a monetary balance of $134,800. The wife submitted that this value was to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. The husband, however, claimed that he had made no contributions to and had no beneficial interest in this time deposit or the monies therein. In support of this claim, the husband adduced an affidavit deposed by his mother in which she repeated the claim of the husband. But the husband as a joint owner of the bank account was entitled to the undivided whole of the monies in that account. On the face of his legal ownership of the account, the monies therein were matrimonial assets. Insofar as the husband asserted that he had no beneficial interest in the account, it was incumbent on him to obtain a determination from the civil courts to that effect because the Family Justice Courts were unable to adjudicate on a claim by a third party to a putative matrimonial asset (see <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]). But there was no such determination before me. Beyond the bare and self-serving assertions of the husband and his mother, there was no evidence to show that, despite the legal interest of the husband in that account, he had no beneficial interest in the monies in that account. I thus included that account in the pool of matrimonial assets and valued it at $134,800.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     It finally appeared that the husband had received approximately $20,000 from the [PB] business. He had received this sum in two tranches, which were a fortnight apart, in September 2021, which was shortly before these divorce proceedings were commenced in December 2021. Scant explanation was offered to account for these monies. In my view, these monies were matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Adding the values of the Meta shares ($309,415), the OCBC Time Deposit ($134,800), and the proceeds of the sale of the [PB] business shares ($20,000) to the other assets in the name of the husband, the total value of the assets in the name of the husband was $927,175.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Based on my findings above, the pool of matrimonial assets comprised $479,124 in assets in the joint names of the spouses, $213,524 in assets in the sole name of the wife, and $927,175 in assets in the sole name of the husband. The value of the pool of matrimonial assets thus totalled $1,619,825.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The exercise of dividing matrimonial assets sought to fairly apportion the economic fruits of the marriage between the spouses by duly recognising their breadwinning and homemaking contributions to the marriage, in line with the philosophy that marriage was an equal partnership (see <em>TNL</em> at [45]). Two different approaches applied based on the nature of the breadwinning and homemaking arrangements in the marriage. In general, the “structured” approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a> (<em>“ANJ</em>”) was used, whereunder the court ascertained ratios representing: (a) the spouses’ direct contributions to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets; and (b) the spouses’ indirect contributions to the welfare of the family. These two ratios would then be averaged and necessary adjustments to the weightage of each ratio could be made to reach a fair and just division of the matrimonial assets. But the <em>ANJ</em> approach would not be applied in long single-income marriages because it over-recognised the financial contributions of the breadwinner and under-recognised the non-financial contributions of the homemaker. Instead, the division exercise in such circumstances tended to centre on the indirect contributions of the homemaking spouse, and the weight to be ascribed to these indirect contributions would be broadly proportional to the length of the marriage. Hence, the final ratios of division ranged from 50:50 (in long single-income marriages of 25–35 years’ duration) to 75:25 in favour of the breadwinner (in shorter single-income marriages of 10–15 years’ duration).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The observations of the Court of Appeal in <em>BOR v BOS and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (“<em>BOR</em>”) at [111]–[113] were instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">111    … In <em>TNL v TNK</em>, this court observed that the trend in long single-income marriages had tended towards an equal division of matrimonial assets, but different considerations may attach to short single-income marriages (at [48]). To give some context to the terms “long” and “short”, <em>TNL v TNK</em> itself involved a marriage of some 35-years. The cases which the court referred to as relevant precedents involved marriages of between 26 to 30 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112    The marriage in the present case lasted about 11 and a half years, much shorter than the examples which the court discussed in <em>TNL v TNK</em>. Different considerations apply to such mid-length marriages. As we stated in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [27] (albeit in the context of discussing the structured approach), as a general rule, the longer the marriage, the more weight is given to the parties’ indirect contributions. Conversely, the shorter the marriage, the less weight will be ascribed to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">113    We find that the precedents are generally consistent with this principle. Thus, in <em>ATT v ATS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0859.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 859</a> at [18], we observed that the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. It would appear from the examples discussed that what was meant by “moderately lengthy” was a period in the range of around 15–18 years. For marriages of shorter duration (around 10–15 years), the trend appears to be towards awarding the non-income earning party about 25% to 35% of the matrimonial pool. Thus in <em>UGG v UGH (m.w.)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 25</a>, which involved a marriage of 12 and a half years, a Wife who had made minimal direct financial contributions was awarded 31.35% of the pool of matrimonial assets. In <em>ABX v ABY and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0969.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 969</a>, which involved a marriage of nine years, the homemaker wife was awarded 25% of the pool of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nevertheless, as the Family Division of the High Court cautioned in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a>, a litigant could not focus excessively on categorising a marriage as one that was single-income or dual-income. Rather, the court was ultimately guided by the philosophy that a marriage was an equal partnership, and equal and sufficient recognition had to be paid to both breadwinning and homemaking contributions. The power of dividing matrimonial assets would therefore be exercised in broad strokes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     This caution was apposite in these proceedings, where the wife had worked periodically for a total duration of approximately a year within the 11-year marriage. At the time of these proceedings, too, the wife was actively looking for employment and had found employment by the conclusion of these proceedings. Still, the wife submitted that the <em>TNL</em> approach for long single-income marriages should apply,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and that she should be awarded 50% of the matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> But given the relatively short duration of the marriage, one year of work by the wife was not insubstantial. This marriage therefore did not fit squarely within the <em>TNL</em> framework for long single-income marriages. The structured approach in <em>ANJ</em> was thus, by default, the appropriate one to take.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The husband, who was a breadwinner throughout the marriage, paid for the matrimonial home that had a value of $479,124 and the matrimonial assets in his name that had a value of $927,175. The wife, who worked for a year during the marriage, financed the matrimonial assets in her name that had a value of $213,524. The ratio of the direct contributions of the spouses was thus 87:13 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For the indirect contributions of the spouses, the marriage had lasted 11 years and the wife had been the primary caregiver to the two children throughout the marriage. The husband, who was the primary breadwinner, travelled regularly for work. Yet he paid the expenses of the household, oversaw the acquisition and fitting out of the matrimonial home, and engaged domestic helpers to assist the wife with her homemaking. As the husband submitted, these indirect contributions of his helped the wife with her homemaking and freed her to obtain educational qualifications including a diploma and a master’s degree, as well as pursue full-time jobs (albeit for limited periods of time). On balance, a fair apportionment of the indirect contributions of the spouses was 60:40 in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Fair and equitable division</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Taking the average of the ratios of the direct and indirect contributions of the spouses, the final ratio was 63.5:36.5 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The wife urged me to award her at least a 5% uplift in this final ratio by drawing an adverse inference against the husband for a lack of full and frank disclosure of his assets. She claimed that he had provide piecemeal responses to her applications for discovery and interrogatories and had been less than candied on his transactions especially in relation to his OCBC Time Deposit and his investment in the [PB] business. But the disclosure provided by the husband in discovery and interrogatories, even if occasionally piecemeal, was generally complete. Further, it was more principled, given that the values of the OCBC Time Deposit and the proceeds from the [PB] business shares were known, to add those values to the pool of matrimonial assets rather than to provide an impressionistic uplift to the final ratio of division in favour of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I thus awarded the wife a 36.5% share of the $1,619,825 pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, if this marriage were classified, as submitted by the wife, as a single-income marriage, the approach in <em>TNL</em> would apply. Thereunder, given the 11-year length of the marriage, the wife would likely have received 25-30% of the pool of matrimonial assets. This would have been less favourable for the wife than the 36.5% share of the pool of matrimonial assets that she would receive pursuant to the structured approach in <em>ANJ</em>. But given that the purpose of the <em>TNL</em> approach (as an exception to the default <em>ANJ</em> approach) was to provide due recognition to the homemaking contributions in single-income marriages, it would be justified to grant the wife, who was the primary homemaker here, the more generous of the awards under the TNL approach and the <em>ANJ</em> approach. Accordingly, I awarded her 36.5% of the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     At the time of these proceedings, the husband and the wife were each approximately 50 years of age. The husband earned a monthly income of $10,737. The wife earned a monthly income of $3,500.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     For wife maintenance, the wife had earned a monthly income of $6,600 before the divorce, had lost that employment thereafter, and had found work only during the hearing of the ancillary matters at a monthly income of $3,500. It was commendable that the wife had made efforts to find such gainful employment, because the law encouraged former wives to seek employment to defray their personal expenses and contribute to preserve their pre-divorce lifestyles and standards of living (see <em>Quek Lee Tiam v Ho Kim Swee (alias Ho Kian Guan)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/5771-M.xml')\">[1995] SGHC 23</a> at [21]–[22] and <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [13]). Still, the difference between the monthly income of the wife before and after the divorce was substantial. It was thus just to have the husband contribute to the reasonable expenses of the wife while she found her feet after the divorce. Taking account of the not insubstantial share of the matrimonial assets that the wife would receive, I ordered the husband to maintain the wife for two years in the monthly sum of $200.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     For child maintenance, the wife sought a monthly sum of $3,250 for each child and asked that the husband further “bear the children’s mandatory education expense including school fees, school trips and any extra lessons and/or programs organized by the school”. She added that the maintenance should be payable until the children complete their tertiary education and attain their first tertiary degree.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The husband proposed monthly figures of child maintenance of $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     At the outset, I found it unjustified at this juncture to have the husband maintain the children beyond the age of 21 years, which was the age upon which child maintenance obligations terminate unless otherwise ordered by the court (see s 69(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed)). The children were 13 and 11 years of age respectively. There was no certainty that they would be pursuing education beyond 21 years of age. As the Family Court in <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> observed at [10]–[12], maintenance catered to present and certain financial needs and not potential or uncertain aspirational wants. Absent certainty that the children would be pursing tertiary education, it would be unjustified to order maintenance to that effect.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the quantum of maintenance, the wife offered no breakdown for how each child spent $3,250 per month. Instead, she tabulated a detailed list of what she called “nocturnal activities” on the part of the husband then demanded that he put up $6,500 each month for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She appeared to premise her claim for $3,250 per child per month on the basis that the husband should be fully responsible for maintaining the children because he had a higher earning capacity than her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The husband, on his part, likewise offered few specifics on the expenses of each child beyond asserting that $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter comprised 62% of the reasonable expenses of each of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Based on the submissions of the spouses, the following expenses of the children were not in dispute:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Student care: $245 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     School transport: $123 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Pocket money: $160 per month per child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Over and above these sums, the wife justified her claims for child maintenance on the basis that the children attended tuition and incurred expenditures on “daily living necessities such as food and grocery expenses, transportation costs, personal care, clothing and other miscellaneous needs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> For tuition, in particular, the wife submitted that the son incurred $1,434 each month while the daughter incurred $450 each month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As between the submissions of the husband and the wife on child maintenance, I found the submissions of the husband more credible. Even as neither spouse provided detailed breakdowns of the expenses of each child, the submissions of the wife were more difficult to accept for three reasons. First, she claimed that the reasonable expenses of each child were the same when, on her own calculations, the son spent approximately $1,000 more than the daughter on tuition each month and the other expenses of each child were broadly similar. Second, on the calculations of the wife, the daughter would be spending over $2,000 each month just on food and groceries, clothing, and other miscellaneous needs, which estimate was objectively high. Third, the wife appeared to premise her claim for child maintenance on the basis that the husband should maintain the children solely when the maintenance of children is a joint parental responsibility and she was not without earning capacity. Indeed, at the time of these proceedings, the wife was seeking work at the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I thus preferred the estimates of the husband as to the reasonable expenses of the children and his proposals to pay $1,192 for the son and $1,587 for the daughter each month. The maintenance of the children was a joint parental responsibility, and the wife was not without financial resources to play her part in discharging that responsibility given the not insignificant amount of matrimonial assets that she would receive as well as the employment income that she had recently secured. Still, the wife would, even when she secured employment, require some time to settle into a breadwinning role after serving as a homemaker for much of the marriage. I thus ordered the husband to maintain the children in amounts that were slightly higher than those that he had put forward. The husband was thus to maintain the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I thus made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of, was to be divided in the proportions of 62.5% to the husband and 36.5% to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband was to maintain the wife in the monthly sum of $200 for two years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The husband was to maintain the children until they attained 21 years of age in the monthly sums of $1,300 for the son and $1,800 for the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I made no order on the costs of these proceedings.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>2WAOM at [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [39]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [56]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>NE 25/10/24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [89]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [85]–[89]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>W’s 1<sup>st</sup> Subs at [72]</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Dissipation of shares"],"date":"2025-02-10","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 228 of 2023","title":"XIM v XIN","citation":"[2025] SGFC 17","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32846-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chan Eng Jin, Darren (Zeng Yongren, Darren) and David Zhang (Legal Aid Bureau) for the plaintiff","Lim Hong Wen, Amelia and Low Seow Ling (Liu Xiaolin) (Emre Legal LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-02-17T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Marcus Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XIM v XIN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XIM <em>v</em> XIN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32846-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 17</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Plaintiff filed her Writ for Divorce on 16 January 2023. The interim judgment was granted on 12 April 2023 (the “IJ”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Plaintiff was 53 years old at the time of hearing. The Defendant was 63 years old. There were no children of the marriage, although the Plaintiff had two adult children from his previous marriage and the Defendant had one adult child from her previous marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The ancillary matters came up before me for hearing on 19 September 2024. I delivered my decision on 25 October 2024. The only issues for my determination were the division of the matrimonial assets and spousal maintenance. In respect of the former, the parties had agreed on the pool of matrimonial assets, save that the Plaintiff contended that: (i) the Defendant had wrongfully dissipated his shares in Company X, and that a certain sum should consequently be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets to account for this; and (ii) that the Defendant had transferred a sum of $71,356.44 to his friend which should be added back into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I ultimately determined that: (i) a sum of $101,874.69 should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets on account of the shares that were dissipated by the Defendant; and (ii) the sum of $71,356.44 transferred by the Defendant to his friend should also be added back into the pool. I valued the total pool of matrimonial assets at $1,096,817.10 and determined that this should be divided in the proportion of 75% to the Defendant and 25% to the Plaintiff. I further ordered that there should be no spousal maintenance for the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Plaintiff has since appealed specifically against my computation of the amount to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets owing to the Defendant’s dissipation of his shares in Company X. My decision here will therefore focus on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Company X was incorporated in 2009 by the Defendant and his friend, A. They each contributed $10,000 towards the start-up capital. The Defendant and A were the only directors and shareholders of the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 19 May 2015, the Defendant transferred all 250,000 of his shares in Company X to his elder child, C1. C1 was 23 years old and a university student at the time. This transfer was approved by himself and A as directors of Company X<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. On the same day, the Defendant tendered his letter of resignation to relinquish his position as a director of Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For reasons that are disputed, though his shares were transferred to C1 on 19 May 2015, the Defendant continued as a director of Company X until 21 August 2018, when C1 was made a director of the company in his place. C1 was 26 years old at that point, and remained a university student.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Although the Defendant had ceased to be the legal owner of the shares as at the date of the interim judgment, the Plaintiff nevertheless posited that the value of those shares should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets. The Plaintiff’s case was that the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X to C1 was an act of wrongful dissipation intended to deplete the pool of matrimonial assets at a time where the divorce was imminent. The Plaintiff argued that the shares were sold to C1 at an undervalue, that the Defendant’s narrative surrounding the disposal of his shares was untrue, and that the Defendant’s explanation for the transfer was unbelievable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Defendant’s position was that the sale of his shares to C1 was a legitimate one done at a fair and accurate market value. The Defendant disagreed that divorce proceedings were imminent at the time of sale. The Defendant consequently objected to the value of the shares being added to the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined and the applicable law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Generally, the starting point in an exercise to divide the matrimonial assets is the identification of matrimonial assets and their respective values. The default operative date to determine the assets in the matrimonial pool is the date of the interim judgment, though the court retains the discretion to depart from this default position (see <em>ARY v ARX and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18744-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 2 SLR 686</a> at [31]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     However, simply identifying all the assets and liabilities in existence as at the operative date may not always sufficiently reflect the true material gains of the marriage, and therefore may not result in a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. This may be the case where an asset was expended <em>prior</em> to the operative date, such that the value of the asset would not be reflected in the pool of assets, to the benefit of the party who disposed of the asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To achieve an equitable outcome, the court is therefore empowered to add certain sums back into the pool of matrimonial assets. <em>Where divorce proceedings are imminent</em>, the court may order a substantial sum expended by one party to be returned to the pool of matrimonial assets if the other spouse was considered to have at least a putative interest in it and had not agreed to the expenditure, whether or not the expenditure was a deliberate attempt to dissipate matrimonial assets or not (see <em>TNL v TNK and another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL</em>”) at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, even <em>before divorce is imminent</em> (or the grant of interim judgment), where it is proven on the facts and evidence that an expenditure amounts to wrongful dissipation with the intention of depleting the matrimonial pool, the court may add a sum back into the pool of matrimonial assets (see <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> at [66] to [68]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     With the relevant authorities in mind, I considered the following two questions to determine whether the value of the shares in the company should be added to the pool:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Were divorce proceedings imminent at or around May 2015; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Did the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X amount to wrongful dissipation?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     If I were to determine that the value of the shares should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, then I would have to decide what notional amount I should add to the pool to account for the Defendant’s dissipation of his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 1: Whether divorce proceedings were imminent at or around May 2015</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I first considered if divorce proceedings were imminent at or around the time that the Defendant transferred the shares to C1, <em>i.e.</em> on 19 May 2015. If divorce was imminent, I could, per the dicta in <em>TNL</em>, add the value of the shares back to the pool of matrimonial assets, whether or not the Defendant had deliberately attempted to dissipate the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Plaintiff argued that the parties’ marital relationship was no longer functioning at this time, and that divorce between the parties was imminent. The circumstances drawn up by the Plaintiff were as such: in April 2015, the Defendant committed family violence against her. This led to the Plaintiff applying for a personal protection order in or around May 2015, which she subsequently withdrew upon the Defendant providing an undertaking at a mention on 23 June 2015 that he would not use family violence against her. Around this time, the Defendant threatened her with divorce and reduced her allowance. Viewed as a whole, the Plaintiff submitted that the Defendant’s conduct indicated that the ‘prospect of divorce’ was already on his mind at the time. The Plaintiff suggested that the Defendant only withheld filing for a divorce at that time to avoid exposing his plan to dissipate his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     However, the Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 1), which formed the basis for the grant of the IJ, did not rely exclusively on events in or around May 2015; nor did it cite the events in or around May 2015 as the core reason for the divorce. Rather, it referred to events even after May 2015 and suggested that the parties’ relationship had deteriorated over the years after the altercation in 2015, and that it was a cumulation of events that resulted in the breakdown of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The fact of the matter is that the Writ for Divorce was only filed some eight years later. The Plaintiff withdrew the PPO, ostensibly with the hope of reconciliation. After May 2015, the parties even went on various overseas holidays as a couple between 2017 and 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff could have filed for a divorce herself at any time earlier, but did not do so. She consciously chose to stay in the marriage, even if for material reasons only. In the Plaintiff’s affidavits, she expressed her disappointment at the Defendant’s efforts to the marriage, which suggested that she continued to hold expectations of him as her husband over the years, even after 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It therefore appeared to me that the love might have been lost, but the marriage very much remained. I was not satisfied on the evidence that divorce was imminent at that point in time, and did not accept the Plaintiff’s hypothesis that the Defendant only resisted filing for a divorce all those years just to avoid exposing his plan to dissipate his shares in Company X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 2: Whether the transfer of the Defendant’s shares in Company X amounted to wrongful dissipation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Notwithstanding my finding that the divorce was not imminent in May 2015, I examined if the Defendant’s shares in Company X were wrongfully dissipated. If so, the court may nevertheless add the value of these shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets, even if divorce was not imminent at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Were the Defendant’s shares transacted at an undervalue?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I first considered the value of the consideration that the Defendant said he received for the shares. While the adequacy of the consideration received might not in itself be determinative of the legitimacy of the transfer, the disposal of shares for consideration less than its true value might indicate that the transfer should not simply be taken at face value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this regard, the Defendant’s position was that the consideration of $150,000 was intentionally calculated to “<em>accurately reflect the market value of the shares</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Defendant explained his calculation as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The principal amount of $359,820.98, based on the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of the 250,000 shares in Company X as reflected in the IRAS Working Sheet C for Transfer of Shares (“IRAS Working Sheet”);<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Divided by two, <em>i.e.</em> $179,910.49, because half of the shares were held on C1’s behalf, and that C1 therefore only needed to pay him for the Defendant’s half of the shares; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Less the sum of $29,500, being the Defendant’s estimation of the company’s losses in 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Shy of any better evidence, I accepted the NAV as reflected in the IRAS Working Sheet. This document purported to contain information from the company’s management accounts as at 31 January 2015, which preceded the events in April 2015 cited by the Plaintiff. There was nothing put forth by the Plaintiff to suggest that the information in the IRAS Working Sheet was inaccurate or unreliable, nor did the valuers engaged by the Plaintiff (the “Plaintiff’s Valuers”) suggest that there was something untoward about it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, I found the rest of the Defendant’s formula to be problematic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Firstly, there was a slight inaccuracy in the Defendant’s calculation, as applying his formula should result in the amount of $150,410.49, not $150,000. No explanation was given for using the lesser sum, not even an explanation that he chose to round it down for convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Secondly, by the Defendant’s own admission, there were no documents or correspondences exchanged between Company X, C1 and himself evidencing how the consideration of $150,000 was actually determined at the time of the transfer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Thirdly, and importantly, I did not accept the Defendant’s reasons for dividing the NAV of his 250,000 shares in two. The Defendant claimed that C1, who was only around 17 years old at the time, was the beneficial owner of half the shares because he used $5,000 of C1’s <em>ang bao</em> monies (that the Defendant had saved up over the years on C1’s behalf) toward the start-up capital of Company X. I found this be a weak and baseless claim:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no documentary evidence showing that the Defendant had taken a sum of $5,000 that belonged to C1, or that C1 was the beneficial owner of half of the shares, whether such evidence took the form of a trust deed, or even contemporaneous emails or messages. The Defendant simply relied on a bare assertion that at the material time, he had a verbal agreement with C1 that he would hold C1’s shares in his name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I noted that this assertion was not even something that C1 himself corroborated on affidavit, despite C1 having filed two affidavits in these proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It seemed inconceivable that the Defendant did not have the sum of $5,000 at his disposal at the time, such that he had to rely on C1’s savings. There was also no explanation as to why the Defendant could not have taken this sum of $5,000 as a loan from C1 instead. Similarly, there was no explanation as to why he did not include C1 as a shareholder of the company any earlier, if he was indeed the beneficial owner of half of the Defendant’s shares;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, on the face of the documents titled “Return of Allotment of Shares” dated 1 November 2011<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and 14 August 2013<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>, 75,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 26 October 2011 and 10,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 7 August 2013. The documents indicated that there were further cash payments made to acquire those shares. However, there was no evidence that C1 had put up any further cash payments toward those shares, such that any shares from further allotments should be attributed to him too. While the Defendant suggested that C1 had a 25% interest in the company’s profit and returns, and that a portion of such profits was reinvested over the years, I noted that there was no evidence of C1 receiving any corresponding share of dividends or profits over the years. There was also no evidence proving this arrangement or showing C1’s agreement to this arrangement. The affidavits filed by C1 also did not attest to such an arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Lastly, there was no objective evidence showing what the company’s losses were in 2015 to support how the Defendant arrived at the figure of $29,500. That was simply an estimate that he had decided on his own, with no apparent basis whatsoever.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> There was also no explanation as to why the sum of $29,500 was only deducted from half of the NAV of the 250,000 shares and was not first deducted from the full NAV before dividing the remainder by two, which would have resulted in a different balance of $165,160.49 instead. This appeared to me to be a contrived attempt at backward reasoning to justify the figure of $150,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I therefore found that the consideration of $150,000 was not commensurate with the value of the shares. This was also the finding arrived at by the Plaintiff’s Valuers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The fact that the Defendant accepted this amount, which was much lower than its NAV, and which was derived at without any coherent method of calculation, suggested that the transaction might not have been done at arm’s length. I noted that the Defendant never explained that he had accepted a consideration of lower value on account of his relationship with C1, though this might have been understandable, and perhaps even reasonable. Rather, the Defendant was constant in his insistence that the transfer had been done at fair market value. I therefore held the Defendant to this standard in examining the veracity of his claim, and found that he fell short.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Defendant’s explanation for transferring the shares in May 2015 credible?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     To explain his decision to transfer his shares to C1, the Defendant reasoned that around the time of the transfer, the parties’ relationship was strained and that for a prolonged period of time, he “<em>lost sleep due to the Plaintiff’s behaviour at home</em>”. The Defendant felt that with his increasing workload and his struggle with the English language, he was unable to perform his role as a director properly. The Defendant felt stressed and under pressure and therefore decided to resign and transfer his shares on 19 May 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     These did not strike me as very compelling reasons for disposing of his shares at the time that he did. Company X had been operating since 2009 and had been profitable over the years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> It did not seem to me that the Defendant’s deficiencies with the English language, if any, had been a hindrance to him conducting his business effectively, and it seemed odd that he would see this as a challenge after six years of operating the company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Furthermore, these operational burdens would have arisen from his role as a director, not a shareholder. The Defendant could have simply resigned from his role as director, without having to give up his shares. Rather, the opposite happened, as he sold his shares but had to remain as director for another three years or so. This would have done little to relieve him of the burdens he supposedly felt about the job. It also did not make sense to me that he found his ownership of his shares so stressful, yet so readily passed this apparent ‘poison chalice’ on to his son, without harbouring any similar concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Apart from an allusion to the business being a private company, there was no actual explanation as to why the Defendant decided to sell his shares to C1, and not anyone else. There was no evidence that this sale was something he had been considering for some time, nor was there any evidence of any attempt to sell these shares at a higher value to A or to another third party. I noted that the Defendant did not inform the Plaintiff of the transfer of the shares in Company X, and that the Plaintiff only found out on her own much later. If this was a legitimate arrangement with nothing untoward about it, there was no reason for him to have kept the Plaintiff in the dark this whole time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In light of the above, I did not find the Defendant’s reasons to be credible, particularly in the context of the state of the parties’ relationship at the time. The Defendant’s explanation did not resolve my suspicions, but conversely raised further doubts about the transaction, and gave a sense that the Defendant was obfuscating the truth. I therefore found that that the transfer of shares was, on the balance of probabilities, done with the intention of keeping them beyond the Plaintiff’s reach and depleting the pool of matrimonial assets, particularly given the lack of trust between the parties at the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue 3: The amount that should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets to account for the Defendant’s wrongful dissipation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having decided that the Defendant had wrongfully dissipated his shares in Company X, it remained for me to determine the notional value to be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets. In this regard, I considered the operative date for determining the value of the shares that were dissipated, and whether the full value of these shares as at said operative date should be added back into the pool of matrimonial assets for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">What is the operative date for determining the value of the dissipated shares?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Plaintiff’s position was that the value of 250,000 shares in Company X should added to the pool of matrimonial assets at their <em>present value</em>. To this end, the Plaintiff argued that the 250,000 shares should be valued at $1,930,000, being what the Plaintiff’s Valuers found to be their value as at 31 January 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> I noted that 31 January 2023 was a date prior to the interim judgment but was nevertheless the latest available valuation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Without going into the correctness of the Plaintiff’s Valuers’ Valuation Report, I did not agree with the Plaintiff’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Plaintiff’s position was premised on the trite proposition that matrimonial assets are generally valued at the date of the ancillary matters hearing, or as close to the date as possible. However, the court retains the discretion from this where warranted on the facts and where there are cogent reasons to do so (see <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [42] and [43]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In this case, it was not the shares that were being added back into the pool of matrimonial assets, but the <em>notional value</em> of those shares <em>to account for the Defendant’s dissipation</em>. An addition of any amount to the pool of matrimonial assets would have been by virtue of an exercise of discretion to correct the wrongful dissipation, and not by virtue of the Defendant’s ownership of the shares. Accordingly, I was of the view that it was the value of the shares <em>as at the time of dissipation</em> that should be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, not the latest value of the shares as though they had remained an asset in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     As at the time of the hearing, C1 was the legal and beneficial owner of the shares. There was no evidence that C1 held these shares on trust for the Defendant. It would have been artificial and unduly prejudicial to the Defendant to adopt the latest value of the shares. It is anyone’s guess how Company X would have grown over the years had the Defendant remained a 50% shareholder of the company rather than C1, bearing in mind that shareholders are entitled to vote at meetings and thereby influence the company’s business decisions too. It is not the court’s place to dabble in such speculation, and it would be unfair on the Defendant to hold him to such speculative value where he has had no entitlement to any such gain in value from 2015 to 2023. If the reverse occurred and the value of the shares decreased significantly, or if the company had ceased its operation completely, it may be unfair on the Plaintiff if <em>nothing</em> was added back to the pool to account for the Defendant’s dissipation, where the shares were of considerable value at the time of dissipation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In any case, I found that it would be onerous on the Defendant to add the full value proposed by the Plaintiff, which would have been close to double what I had found to be the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets. As there was no evidence that the Defendant had any interest in the shares since 19 May 2015, and similarly no evidence that he received any dividends from the company that had flowed from such interest since then, the Defendant would not have been able to tap on any commensurate gains in the shares over the years. This would have been prejudicial to his ability to satisfy any division order made. I did not think that this would have led to an equitable outcome in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It remains to be said that one of the key reasons that led to my finding of dissipation was that the transfer of shares to C1 was done at an undervalue. If the consideration paid was not $150,000, but closer to its NAV instead, I might not have found the transaction to amount to a dissipation but rather a mere liquidation of assets, and consequently might not have decided to add the value of the shares back into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I therefore found on the justice of the case that adopting the value of the shares as at the time of dissipation, <em>i.e.</em> in May 2015, would be sufficient to account for the Defendant’s dissipation, whereas it would have been excessive to adopt the latest value of the shares.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Should the full value of the Defendant’s 250,000 shares be added to the pool?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As a starting point to compute the value of the shares to be added to the pool of matrimonial assets, I found it appropriate to adopt the NAV as declared in the IRAS Working Sheet, <em>i.e.</em> $359,820.98.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     As mentioned above, there was no evidence that the information in the IRAS Working Sheet was inaccurate or unreliable. On the face of the IRAS Working Sheet, the NAV of the shares transferred was calculated by deducting the value of the company’s total assets less the value of its total liabilities as declared as at 31 January 2015, divided by two (as the Defendant held 250,000 out of 500,000 shares). Given the dearth of information available as to the company’s finances at the time, the Plaintiff’s Valuers found the NAV method to be the only viable option to determine an estimate of the company’s minimum value.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I noted that the Plaintiff had previously issued a summons for discovery of, among other things, financial documents for the financial years ending 31 January 2015 and 31 January 2016, but subsequently withdrew her application. Nevertheless, the financial statements for Company X for the financial years ending 31 January 2017 and 31 January 2018 were in evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> These statements contained information relating to the company’s net assets for 2016, 2017 and 2018. Based on these statements, the total net assets for these years were respectively valued at $646,539, $531,480, and $523,568. Each of these values were lower than the NAV accepted for the financial year ending 31 January 2015. This suggested to me that the NAV of $719,641.96 (for all 500,000 shares) might not have been too far off, and was certainly not unrealistically low as a representation of the value of the shares as at May 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The question that remained was whether I should simply add the full NAV of the dissipated shares, <em>i.e.</em> $359,820.98, back into the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In this regard, I found that of the total of 250,000 shares, 75,000 were acquired before the marriage. This was evident from the Return of Allotment of Shares lodged on 1 November 2011, which showed that 75,000 shares were allotted to the Defendant on 26 October 2011, bringing his total shareholding at the time to 150,000 shares. There was no suggestion that any further shares were acquired between the date of the parties’ marriage (2 October 2011) and 26 October 2011. The likely inference was therefore that the Defendant had acquired 75,000 shares prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my assessment, these shares had not been converted into a matrimonial asset by way of either party having “<em>ordinarily used or enjoyed</em>” the shares, per Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”), as I did not find that the Defendant working for the company and using any income received from this company toward family expenses to constitute ‘usage’ or ‘enjoyment’. There was also no suggestion that these shares were “<em>substantially improved</em>” on by the Defendant, per Section 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I also did not accept the ‘commingling’ argument run by the Defendant. Unlike monies in a bank account, I found that the shares were distinct and separately identifiable, and that there would be no issues tracing and separating the pre-marital shares from those acquired after the marriage. That there might have been some commingling of the <em>dividends</em> received by the Defendant only went so far as to suggest that the <em>dividends</em> might constitute matrimonial assets, but this was not the issue before me. I therefore found that the corresponding value of these 75,000 shares retained their character as pre-marital assets and should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The NAV of the remaining 175,000 was therefore $251,874.686. Of this amount, I found that the sum of $150,000, being the amount paid by C1 to the Defendant as consideration for the transfer of the shares in Company X, should be deducted from the notional value to be added back to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     This sum of $150,000 was evidenced by an image of a cheque issued by Company Y,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> which was a sole proprietorship registered by C1 in 15 May 2014.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff argued that it was incredible that C1 had the sum of $150,000 in his possession at the time. However, in my view, that it was equally unlikely that C1 would register a business if he had no such enterprise going on at the time, and that it was similarly unlikely for the Defendant and the C1 to have hatched a scheme register this business as a ruse just to execute this dissipation, given that Company Y was incorporated nearly a year prior to the transfer of shares on 19 May 2015. The Plaintiff did not further pursue her application for discovery against C1 and did not provide any concrete evidence to indicate that the monies were not C1’s, or that there were no monies paid out by C1 to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     While there were no documents showing the Defendant’s receipt of this sum, the Defendant had explained that he was unable to retrieve the relevant bank account statements, given the passage of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff did not pursue this matter in any application for discovery, and did not specifically question or dispute the receipt of this sum in her affidavit or in her submissions. In these premises, I found on the balance of probabilities that the Defendant had indeed received this sum of $150,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Consequently, I found that the sum of $150,000 should be deducted from the NAV of 175,000 shares ($251,874.686). I therefore decided to notionally add back into the pool of matrimonial assets the balance sum of $101,874.69.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For the reasons set out above, I ultimately found that adding the sum of $101,874.69 back into the pool of matrimonial assets was the most appropriate and equitable redress for the Defendant’s wrongful dissipation of his shares in Company X in May 2015.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 147 of the Defendant’s Voluntary Affidavit filed on 13 November 2023 (“DA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 82 to 83 of the Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Affidavit, filed on 26 July 2024 (“DAM2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 9 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Page 152 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Paragraph 7 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Pages 296 and 297 of the Plaintiff’s Affidavit in support of FC/SUM 482/2024, filed on 21 February 2025 (“PA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Pages 584 and 585 of PA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Paragraph 9 of DA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 14 of the Plaintiff’s Valuers’ Affidavit, filed on 26 July 2024 (“PVA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Paragraph 50 of the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 9 June 2023;

They had four children together. It was a marriage that, up to the time the Wife filed for divorce on 12 January 2024, had lasted for almost 39 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on 20 June 2024. Thereafter, parties set a course for the hearing of the ancillary matters. It is in this context that the Husband had taken out this application for discovery <em>vide</em> SUM 3441/2024 (“SUM 3441”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the matter on 20 January 2025. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       These were the two items which the Husband had asked for in respect of discovery:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     All Whatsapp messages between the Wife and [A], including those in the deleted folder, for the period January 2020 to October 2024 (“Item 1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     All Whatsapp messages between the Wife and [B], including those in the deleted folder, for the period January 2020 to October 2024 (“Item 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       During the hearing, the Husband offered two reasons as to why the Wife should be ordered to disclose these Whatsapp messages. First, to prove that she had committed adultery with these two men, [A] and [B], and second, to prove that because of the “wayward” lifestyle she had lived, she could not have made significant financial contributions to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Counsel for the Wife, on the other hand, made two broad points as to why disclosure of these Whatsapp messages should not be ordered. First, that there was no <em>prima facie</em> evidence that these messages had, at any time, been in the Wife’s possession custody or power.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Second, and in any event, the Husband had not shown that the Whatsapp messages were relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – the discovery process should not be used to “excavate imaginary bones in the closet” and even if there was any evidence of adultery, it was clearly not relevant to the disputed issues insofar as the ancillary matters were concerned.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is well established that when it comes to applications for discovery, the court is guided by the twin principles of relevance and necessity – in other words, the party seeking discovery must show that these documents are both relevant and necessary to the issues in dispute: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22] and [24] citing <em>UJN v UJO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21836-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 47</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In addition, the court in <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> had (at [64]) also noted that a pre-requisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some <em>prima facie</em> evidence that the documents sought do indeed exist:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    A prerequisite to the court’s power to order discovery is that there must be some evidence that the document requested is or has at any time been in the respondent’s possession, custody or power. The standard of proof is that of a <em>prima facie</em> case: see <em>Alliance Management SA v Pendleton Lane P and another and another suit</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53698-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 133</a> (at [24]). In the present case, I find that there is prima facie evidence of the existence of the bank account by way of inference drawn from the evidence given by the Wife as explained above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the present case, the Husband had merely asserted, during the hearing, that his younger daughter had allegedly chanced upon these messages. This was not something that I could take notice of given that it was not stated on affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I also note that while the Husband had, in his 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Asset and Means, gone into some detail about the Wife’s two alleged affairs, he had not exhibited any documentary evidence to corroborate his allegations. There was nothing that had been exhibited in the affidavits before me to indicate, on a <em>prima facie</em> basis, the existence of such messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Even assuming that there was such <em>prima facie</em> evidence, the Whatsapp messages were neither relevant, nor necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. I do not accept the Husband’s argument that the Whatsapp messages were relevant in that they would show that the Wife could not have made financial contributions to the family because of her “wayward lifestyle” as evinced by her alleged acts of adultery. Even if these messages existed, they would only cast light on the nature of the relationship between the Wife, and [A] and [B] – it would hardly go towards showing the extent of the direct, or indirect, financial contributions which the Wife had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband’s application in SUM 3441 is thus dismissed. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing that I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters. The time limited for filing an appeal shall begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Unless parties are able to agree on the issue of costs, they are to tender their written submissions on costs by way of letter to court. This shall be done no later than 10 February 2025, and these submissions shall not exceed 3 pages.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 5 citing <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> at [64].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 12.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2025-01-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4355 of 2023 (Summons No 3472 of 2024)","title":"XHW v XHX","citation":"[2025] SGFC 12","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32827-SSP.xml","counsel":["Chan Xian Yi, Jonathan (Zeng Xianyi) (Chia Wong Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff","Lim Fang-Yu Mathea (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-02-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHW v XHX</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHW <em>v</em> XHX </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32827-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 12</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4355 of 2023 (Summons No 3472 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chan Xian Yi, Jonathan (Zeng Xianyi) (Chia Wong Chambers LLC) for the plaintiff; Lim Fang-Yu Mathea (PKWA Law Practice LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHW — XHX </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married in the United Kingdom sometime in July 2009.

This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Interrogatories </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       It is well established that the court will only order interrogatories if those interrogatories are both relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> [2024] SGFC at [22]. It is also well established that the court, at the interlocutory stage, is not concerned with the truth of any answers given to an interrogatory, but rather, whether that answer is sufficient: <em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31582-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 32</a> at [9] – [11]; <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [28] – [30].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife, Mr Jonathan Chan (“Mr Chan”) confirmed that, where the interrogatories were concerned, the Wife was only proceeding in respect of four out of the five items which she had originally sought in SUM 3472. I shall deal with them in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I first deal with the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 3:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 1 was a request for the Husband to state and explain the whereabouts and purpose of several recurring withdrawals/payments from his HSBC account ending -21. These transactions ranged in value from £500 – £990.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 3 was a request for the Husband to state and explain the current whereabouts and purpose(s) of the several recurring monthly withdrawals from his HSBC premier account ending -1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Counsel for the Husband, Ms Mathea Lim (“Ms Lim”), argued that the Husband should not have to answer these interrogatories on the basis that the transactions involved are insubstantial. In support of this argument, they cite my earlier decisions in <em>XDD v XEE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32212-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 79</a> and <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31617-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 29</a> for the proposition that the process of discovery and interrogatories should not be used as an exercise in forensic accounting. Ms Lim had also highlighted in written submissions that the Husband had explained that these transactions made in the UK were for the payment of bills, and that they have been made on a regular basis since the family had relocated to Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I do not find that the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 3 was an attempt to engage in a forensic accounting exercise. I agree with the point Mr Chan had made – that these expenses, which were not insignificant, were rather odd given that the parties had relocated from the UK to Singapore. In this vein, it is clear to me that this interrogatory is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – it would show why the Husband had continued to incur and pay for expenses in the UK although parties were no longer living there, and how he had managed to do so especially given that he had stated that he had been unemployed for the past 3 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> This would have a bearing on issues such as whether there had been dissipation of matrimonial assets, the Husband’s financial capacity to pay for child maintenance, and whether there were any other undisclosed bank accounts or credit cards in the Husband’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For the reasons set out above, the Wife’s request in Items 1 and 3 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Item 2 was a request for the Husband to “state and explain the sum(s) of monies” which he had allegedly loaned to his helper, and to provide details of when such loans had been disbursed and what was the outstanding sum loaned to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The basis for the Husband’s objection is that a voluntary request had not first been served. Mr Chan does not dispute that no voluntary request had been served. He explained that the Wife had taken such a course of action in a bid to avoid protracting proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the fact that a voluntary request for Item 2 had not first been served, I am still minded to deal with the Wife’s request on its merits, though I would add that the failure to comply with the applicable rules of procedure may be a relevant consideration when it comes to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I find that Item 2 is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The quantum of the loan which the Husband had extended to their helper certainly goes towards the determination of the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As a final point, I note that the Wife did, in fact, ask the Husband in her voluntary request for discovery, to disclose documents showing payments made to their helper. The Husband had provided a rather detailed explanation as to why such payments were made and why such payments were no longer reflected on the relevant bank statements. The Husband’s explanation, however, does not state the sums which he had loaned to the helper, and the outstanding sums that are still owed to him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> These are all pertinent points that would have a bearing on the issues at the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I come now to the final request in Item 4. This was the request as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant is to state and confirm whether the flat in Seoul, South Korea at [XXX] is the only South Korean property he and his parents own and have ever owned, and if not, the address and particulars of ownership of any other property owned by the Defendant or his parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Although it is undisputed that a voluntary request in respect of this item had not been served, as I had stated above (at [14]), I am not minded to dismiss the Wife’s request on that basis. In my judgment, this interrogatory is certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – any properties in the Husband’s name, or that are being held on the Husband’s behalf are certainly a relevant consideration when it comes to determining the matrimonial pool of assets as well as the division of such assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Wife’s request in Item 4 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Application for Discovery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I come now to the items which the Wife had sought in discovery. In considering the Wife’s application, I bear in mind the principles that govern the discovery process, namely, that the court will only order discovery if the documents sought are relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     During the hearing, Mr Chan confirmed that the Wife was not pursuing her request in respect of Items 4, 9, and 11. I shall deal with the rest of the items in turn. I will also make brief mention of Item 9 given the points that were raised by both Mr Chan and Ms Lim at the hearing before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Item 1 was a request for the Husband to produce documents showing the disbursements, transactions and purpose of loans taken from January 2023 to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband does not dispute the relevance or the necessity of these documents. Rather, his position is that he has no such documents in his possession, custody or power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As I had noted in <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [75], parties cannot “tiptoe around” their obligation to give discovery with the mere assertion that they do not have the documents which are requested for. The Husband cannot sidestep his obligation to provide disclosure with the bare assertion that he has no such documents in his possession, custody or power.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I will allow the Wife’s request in Item 1. If the Husband says that he does not have these documents, he must provide an explanation on affidavit, and exhibit any supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Item 2 was a request for documents showing the current whereabouts and purpose of various recurring withdrawals from the Husband’s HSBC account ending -21. This mirrored Item 1 of the Wife’s request for interrogatories (see above at [8(a)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I will allow the Wife’s request in Item 2 for the same reasons which I had set out above (at [10]). Although Ms Lim urged me to disallow the Wife’s request in respect of this item on the account that the sums in question were insubstantial, and that the process of discovery and interrogatories should not be used as a tool to aid in a forensic accounting exercise, as I have explained, the documents sought would cast light on why the Husband had continued to incur these expenses in the UK although parties were no longer living there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Item 3 was a request for documents showing that the Husband had temporarily borrowed a sum of $2000 from one [K] on 26 June 2023, the whereabouts of this sum, and the purpose of the alleged loan.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Husband’s basis for objecting to this request was that he had already provided all the documents in his possession, custody and power. He states that there was no written documentation in relation to these loans which were extended to him by friends.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Wife, on the other hand, argues that disclosure should be ordered because the Husband has repeatedly made claims that various deposits and withdrawals from his bank accounts are loans/repayment of loans, but did not provide any supporting documents to back up his assertions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> During the hearing, Mr Chan emphasised the point in his oral submissions that if these were indeed loans made from the Husband’s friends, there would be some messages to evidence such an arrangement. In this connection, these messages would go towards establishing the liabilities which the Husband now claims to have.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I note that the Husband’s explanation, that this transaction was repayment of a loan given to him by [K], was his response to the Wife’s voluntary request for discovery. It is a bare explanation. The Husband simply stated that it was a temporary loan from [K] made on 26 June 2023. He did not state any reasons as to why he could not produce the requested documents, neither did he state that he did not have any documents in his possession, custody or power given the nature of the loan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the circumstances, I will allow the request in respect of Item 3. The documents are, in my judgment, certainly relevant and necessary. It would go towards assessing whether this transaction was indeed for the repayment of the loan as the Husband alleges.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I come now to Items 5 and 6. I shall deal with them together as they both concern various deposits which had been made to the Husband’s UOB account ending -8. These were the specific requests as framed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item 5 was a request for documents to show that various deposits into the Husband’s UOB account ending -8 was for alleged “loans” extended to him for his living expenses and legal fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item 6 was a request for documents showing the source as well as the purpose of various deposits made by certain individuals into the Husband’s UOB account ending -8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Husband objects to both Items 5 and 6 on the same basis as Item 3 – that he had already disclosed all the documents in his possession, custody and power, and that because these were loans which had been extended to him by family and friends, there was no documentation of any such loan agreements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Wife’s argument in respect of Items 5 and 6 was that that these were rather substantial deposits to the Husband’s UOB account. Accordingly, these documents would establish whether they were indeed loans extended to the Husband, or proceeds from any other sources of income or funds that the Husband had yet to disclose. This would have a bearing on issues such as determining the matrimonial pool of assets, the division of matrimonial assets and the Husband’s ability to pay maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Again, I note that in the Husband’s response to the Wife’s voluntary request for the same documents as set out in Items 5 and 6,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> he explained that these were “monies loaned” to allow him to pay for his living expenses and legal fees in Singapore and that there were “no documents for the said loans” “save for those already previously provided”. The Husband merely asserts that there are no documents, but does not go on to explain why that is the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In my judgment, both Items 5 and 6 are certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would allow the court to assess the source of these deposits into the Husband’s account and the reasons for these deposits. This would, as Mr Chan had rightly pointed out in written submissions (see above at [36]), have a bearing on issues such as ascertaining the matrimonial pool of assets and maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife’s request in both Items 5 and 6 are allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I turn now to Item 7. This was a request for the Husband to produce documents showing the source of funds and the purpose for various deposits from company [T] to the Husband’s UOB account ending -8.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Again, the Husband objects to this request on the basis that he had already provided all the documents in his possession, custody and power.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> He says that these were loans extended to him by his family which had been transferred to him via a wire transfer service provider which was reflected as company [T] on his bank statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife, on the other hand, argues that these documents are relevant to showing the source of such funds which are relevant to issues such as ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets, whether there had been dissipation of any matrimonial assets and maintenance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I agree with the arguments advanced by the Wife – these documents would show the source of the funds, and would, accordingly, shed light on the Husband’s true financial capacity and whether these were indeed, as he says, loans extended to him by his family. This would go towards issues such as ascertaining the matrimonial pool of assets as well as maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Wife’s request in Item 7 is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Item 8 was a request for documents showing the current whereabouts and purpose of several recurring transactions from the Husband’s HSBC premier account ending -1. This request mirrored the Wife’s request for interrogatories at Item 3 (see above at [8(b)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Given that I had allowed the Wife’s request for interrogatories, I will also allow this request for discovery. The Husband shall answer the Wife’s interrogatory as framed in Item 3 and provide the relevant documents requested. In my judgment, these documents sought are indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters – they would cast light on why the Husband had, by his account,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> continued to pay for bills incurred in the UK although the family had since relocated to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Item 9 was a request for documents showing the source of funds and purpose of some 21 deposits into the Husband’s HSBC premier account ending -1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     During the hearing, Mr Chan explained that the Wife was no longer pursuing Item 9 given the Husband’s response in his reply affidavit to SUM 3472. That being said, the Husband had also disclosed the existence of <b><em>two</em></b> other credit cards which he had not previously disclosed. Given this, the Wife now wanted the statements of these credit cards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Ms Lim, naturally, objected to this. She said that the Wife was now shifting the goalposts of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I did not think that this was necessarily the case. As I had explained to Ms Lim during the hearing, my understanding was that the Wife was merely seeking further discovery of the statements of these two credit cards which had now surfaced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In any event, even if Mr Chan was asking that I order the disclosure of these two credit card statements, I was not minded to consider the request given that it was not included in SUM 3472, and the Husband did not appear to have had the opportunity to consider the request. In the circumstances, I directed that any further voluntary request for interrogatories and discovery be filed and served by 27 January 2025. The Husband was to give his response by 17 February 2025. I also further directed parties to attend at a Case Conference after 17 February 2025 to update the court on the status of the voluntary request and whether a formal application would be required.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I come now to the final request in Item 10. This was a request for documents showing that the Husband had received retrenchment benefits as well as 3 months’ worth of salary in lieu of notice. These sums of money had allegedly been paid to the Husband’s HSBC Singapore account in May 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Husband argues that the Wife’s request should be disallowed. He says that he had already obtained the relevant bank statement, and sought the Wife’s consent to file a further affidavit to SUM 3472 to exhibit this statement. However, the Wife did not reply. As such, this bank statement was annexed to his written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     During the course of the hearing, Mr Chan argued that the sums which the Husband alleges had been paid to him as part of his retrenchment package does not match that in the bank statement which the Husband had belatedly disclosed. The Wife was therefore maintaining her request in Item 10, and sought a court order for the Husband to produce these documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It appears that the Wife is continuing the maintain her request in Item 10 because of the discrepancy between the bank statement the Husband had produced, and what he had previously declared. However, the discovery and interrogatory process is not an avenue for parties to ventilate arguments on where the truth may lie in relation to matters which are in dispute. Given that the Husband has produced a bank statement that appears to reflect the deposit of his retrenchment benefits, I make no order in relation to Item 10. I will, however, order the Husband to exhibit this bank statement in his compliance affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In summary, I make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall answer the interrogatories as set out in Items 1 – 4 of the Request for Interrogatories (as indicated at para 2b of SUM 3472) on affidavit, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents listed in Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Request for Discovery (as indicated at para 1b of SUM 3472), whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall exhibit, in the affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband shall also exhibit, in his compliance affidavit, the bank statement contained in Annex A of his Written Submissions dated 10 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In addition, the Husband’s compliance affidavit is to be filed by 24 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Unless parties are able to agree on costs of SUM 3472, they are to write in, by way of letter, with their respective submissions on costs. This is to be done no later than 14 February 2025 and the length of these submissions shall not exceed 3 pages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the judge hearing the ancillary matters. The time limited for filing an appeal shall also begin to run from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Chan and Ms Lim for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at pp 29 – 30 and 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit at p 855.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit at p 854 where the Husband had explained that the transaction in question was a payment to [K] for “monies temporarily borrowed on 26 June 2023”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at p 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at p 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at pp 9 – 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit at p 856.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at p 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at pp 12 – 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>See Husband’s Written Submissions at pp 22 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at Annex A.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – custody – access, care and control","Family Law – maintenance – child","Family Law – matrimonial assets – division"],"date":"2025-02-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4534 of 2023","title":"XHY v XHZ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 13","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32820-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Thirumurthy Ayernaar Pambayan (Murthy & Co) for the plaintiff","Mr Patrick Fernandez (Fernandez LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2025-02-11T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Nicole Loh","html":"<root><head><title>XHY v XHZ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHY <em>v</em> XHZ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32820-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 13</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The ancillary issues relating to custody, care and control, access of the children, division of matrimonial assets, wife maintenance and cost were adjourned to chambers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The ancillary matters proceeded for hearing on 7 January 2025 and my decision was delivered through Registrar’s Notice on 8 January 2025. The Wife has since appealed all of my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both parties are about 37 years of age and gainfully employed. The Wife was a senior Office Administrator and the Husband a freelance driver. At the time of the divorce, parties had been married for almost 9.5 years. There are 2 children born of their marriage, a son (turning 9 years in 2025) and a daughter (turning 7 years old in 2025). The Wife and children left the matrimonial home in March 2023. She applied for maintenance under section 69 of the Women’s Charter and a by consent order for the Husband to pay $350 per month for each child’s maintenance was recorded without prejudice to her rights and claims for child maintenance in the divorce proceedings. There is also a Personal Protection Order against the Husband in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the hearing of the Ancillary Matters, I was informed by both counsel that parties are in agreement with the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties shall have joint custody of the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Wife is not making a claim for her maintenance;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Husband shall pay the outstanding SP Services/utilities bills for the matrimonial flat incurred after March 2023; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Husband shall pay the outstanding Town Council Service and Conservancy charges for the matrimonial flat from March 2023 until the sale of the flat;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Husband shall pay 50% of the year end school books and uniform expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I accordingly ordered the above by consent as part of my eventual order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The issues before me for determination were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Care and control of the children and if shared care was not granted, access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Division of matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Care and control and access </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife asked for care and control of the children to be granted to her and the Husband asked for shared care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife, in support of her claim, detailed her involvement in the care of the children since birth and in particular, how she became a homemaker for about 5 years before returning to employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband, in support of his case for shared care and control, points to the current arrangement since March 2023, wherein he has the children from Friday 6pm to Sunday 6pm. He therefore submitted this should continue since it is workable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I do not find the current arrangements of timing that the Husband has with the children equates to a shared care and control order. It only provides for time the children spend with him. A shared care and control arrangement works in the interest of children if both parents are highly co-operative and willing to mutually discuss effective and reach agreements with regard to the daily activities of the children, e.g. which day the children go for what classes (without overly being calculative about how much care time that parent loses for example) so that the children’s daily life is seamless even when they switch homes. I do not believe the parties in this case have such a relationship. I find that the Wife has been the main caregiver of the children, therefore I grant her care and control in view of her involvement with the children since birth, their current young age and that they live primarily with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having granted care and control to the Wife, the issue of access to the Husband arises. The following access was agreed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Deepavali from 2pm to 8pm; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Alternate public holidays (except Deepavali) from 10am to 9pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As submitted by the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, he has had time with the children from Fridays 6pm to Sundays 6pm since March 2023. There were no allegations of violence from him towards the children. No issues have been raised by the Wife with regard to the time the children were with him since so he should have the same timing for access. He also sought half of the March, June, September and year end school holidays with liberty to travel and midweek dinner access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Although the Wife had raised issues with overnight access in her affidavits and concerns over the children’s safety in view of the Husband’s violent behaviour, there was no response from the Wife about the current arrangements described by the Husband that have been in place for more than 1.5 years. The Wife submitted that weekend time should be carved out for her as well and that March and September school holidays were a short one week so there was no need to grant half to the Husband. There was also a concern raised as to whether the Husband would exercise access faithfully in view of the uncertainty of the Husband’s hours of work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I accept that the Wife should also have some time on the weekends to spend with the children as she would have little opportunity to plan any leisure activities if she only has the weekdays when the children are in school and she is at work. I also accept that there is evidence to support her allegations of family violence by the Husband towards her but there is no evidence of any such behaviour towards the children. The fact that the Husband has been having overnight weekend access without incidents for more than 1.5 years also allay any concerns. As for his working hours, I accept the Husband’s submission that he can arrange for his work to be scheduled around access time given that it is flexible. There were no instances raised to show that he has not shown up for access. I am also wary of reducing access periods only on a speculative problem. Furthermore, plans can change even within an intact family. It is for parties to communicate and make alternative arrangements to deal with the change in plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Access time is to enable the children to continue to have a bond with a parent whom they do not live with primarily. I therefore granted half of the school holidays (including the March and September school holidays) and a midweek access bearing in mind the children’s routine given the following day would be a weekday. For completeness, even though the March and September school holidays are relatively shorter school holidays compared to the June and year-end school holidays, there is no reason not to give the Husband and children the opportunity for access. After all, public holidays (usually a brief one-day holiday) are also commonly shared between parents. I also allowed both parties the liberty to bring the children overseas during their time with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore made the following orders for access (including those by consent as set out in paragraph 11 above):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During school term,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Weekly from Friday 6pm to Saturday 8pm;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Wednesdays from 5:40pm to 7:30pm;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Half of the March, June, September and year end school holidays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Either party is at liberty to take the children overseas during their time with the children upon at least 14 days advance notice to the other party with the travel itinerary and contact details.</p> <p

With regard to legal fees of parties, following <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25220-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 109</a>, they should not be deducted from the pool of matrimonial assets but each party should settle their own legal costs from their respective share of the assets.

It was conceded the Husband provided the financial support for the family although the exact amount he provided was disputed. He claimed to have provided his entire salary which was between $2,000 to $7,000 previously. When the Wife started work, he stopped providing his entire salary but still provided $3,000 to $4,000.

There was no evidence to support either party’s claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Using a broad brush approach, I considered that generally the Wife was the main caregiver whilst the Husband was the breadwinner for about half their marriage.

The Wife’s 50.6% of $519,720.26 amounts to $262,750.75. After deducting $34,569.41 which is already retained by her, she is entitled to $228,181.34 from the matrimonial flat. This amounts to 51% of the net value of the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I therefore ordered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The matrimonial assets shall be divided 50.6% to the Wife and 49.4% to the Husband. In this regard, the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market within 6 months from the Final Judgment. The net sale proceeds (after repayment of the outstanding mortgage loan and cost and expenses of sale) shall be divided 51% to the Wife and 49% to the Husband. Each party to refund their CPF accounts for monies utilised in the acquisition of the matrimonial flat including accrued interest from their respective share of the net sale proceeds.

items 8, 9 and 10 of the expense list. For item 8, both children are Singapore citizens enrolled in a local primary school. The school fees is listed as $13 per child and there is no explanation or evidence to prove the Wife’s claim that their school fee is $32.50 per child. I determined the school fees as $13/child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>, it was held that</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure. This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case……It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drafting up what can be described as a “budget”, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category..”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For enrichment/tuition, the Wife claimed a monthly expense per child of $340. This accounted for a substantive 1/3 of her expense claim for the children but there was no evidence on this expenditure or what it entailed. Not every child requires enrichment/tuition. Different types of enrichment and/or tuition will affect the reasonable amount to be budgeted for a child. Without any evidence as to any enrichment/tuition that the children are enrolled in and their costs, I excluded this claim. With regard to hobbies/sports claim of $135 per child, similarly there was a lack of evidence on this expense. However, I accept that it is reasonable for all children to have some form of hobbies and sports. Without any other evidence to assist me in in determining the reasonable sum based on the hobby or sports the child engages in, I allocated $60 per child per month for this expense on a broad budgeting basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife’s take home income is $2,913 and submits the Husband should have a higher income than what is declared because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Previously in the marriage when they were together, his income was $7,000 and this is proven by his self-declaration of providing $3,000 to the Wife monthly previously; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He continues to be in the same field of work so his income should remain the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Husband disputes earning $7,000 or $5,000, a figure was used by the Wife’s Counsel to submit he should pay more maintenance. He declared he earned an average of about $3,600 from his jobs. He exhibited his Notice of Assessment which shows he earned $48,000 in one year, i.e. $4,000 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I had difficulty accepting the Wife’s argument regarding the Husband’s past income because it is based on the Husband’s assertion which she has expressly disputed. If she wants the Court to disbelieve that he didn’t provide as much financial support as he claimed for the purposes of dividing matrimonial assets, she cannot then flip her entire position to now claim it is true for the purposes of child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Husband has provided supporting evidence of his current income and there is no evidence to find that he has a higher income currently. Nonetheless, the Husband offered to bear 64% of the children’s expenses, which I find is a fair proposal given that he earns about 58% of their combined income. I therefore ordered him to pay 64% of $1,306 which amounts to $835.84. I rounded this up to $840 in total (i.e. $420 per child).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In view of both parties’ practical and reasonable approaches during the hearing before me and also in view that neither party really succeeded fully on any particular point, I made no order as to cost.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Paragraph 22 of Husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement"],"date":"2025-01-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 1648 of 2024","title":"XHQ v XHR","citation":"[2025] SGFC 10","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32809-SSP.xml","counsel":["The complainant in person and unrepresented","The respondent in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-02-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHQ v XHR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHQ <em>v</em> XHR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32809-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 10</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 1648 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The complainant in person and unrepresented; The respondent in person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHQ — XHR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Enforcement</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were divorced in 2016. Pursuant to an order of court (“FC/ORC xx/2016”), the Father was ordered to pay $500 as monthly maintenance for the two children of the marriage. This sum was to be deposited into the Mother’s bank account on the last day of every month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 19 July 2024, the Mother applied for an enforcement of maintenance arrears <em>vide</em> MSS 1648/2024 (“MSS 1648”). The matter was fixed for hearing, and I heard the trial on 1 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Towards the end of the trial, it was discovered that the Father had been recording the proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> A check done by the court officer showed two audio recordings of the trial on his phone. By recording the proceedings, the Father was in contempt of court: s 5 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016. The Father was given an opportunity to purge his contempt: <em>You Xin v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 4 SLR(R) 0017.xml')\">[2007] 4 SLR(R) 17</a> at [54]. He did so by deleting those recordings and confirmed that he had not disseminated any recordings made. He also apologised for his conduct. Assured that there would be no repeat of this behaviour, I decided it was appropriate to not take cognisance of the contempt and proceeded with the remainder of the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       After the trial, I reserved my judgment. On the 15<sup>th</sup> of November 2024, I handed down my decision where I allowed the Mother’s application and made the relevant orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       When it comes to the enforcement of maintenance orders, s 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961 sets out what the court may do in the event that an order to pay maintenance has not been complied with. This, of course, assumes that the maintenance order should be enforced, and in that vein, it has been held that “the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is for a respondent to be given a chance to “show cause” (<em>ie</em>, provide reasons which are satisfactory to the Court) why an enforcement order should not be made against him or her”: <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a> (“<em>VUJ</em>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> at [20] citing <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a>; <em>WUG v WUH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31032-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 11</a> at [9]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As to when a respondent to an enforcement application has shown cause, that is an assessment which must, naturally, turn on the facts. At the end of the day, what is important to bear in mind is whether the making of an enforcement order would “lead to injustice and/or where it would be inequitable to do so given the circumstances and facts of a given case”: <em>VUJ</em> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       To give a flavour of the sort of circumstances in which a respondent had been found by the Family Courts to have shown cause, I reproduce the succinct summary in <em>VUJ</em> at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    where the parties had mutually agreed to a reduction of the amount payable pursuant to maintenance order or where there was an understanding (whether implicit or explicit) between the parties not to require strict compliance with the terms of the said order (see for eg., <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [15], <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [24] – [28] and <em>VAM v VAN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23625-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 96</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    where the respondent had went over and beyond what was required under the maintenance order and/or had provided additional support to the complainant even though the payment modality may not have been exactly in accordance with the terms of the maintenance order (see <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a> at [22] – [27]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    where a complainant had used monies belonging to the respondent to pay for expenses which were within the scope of the maintenance order such that the respondent should be treated as having paid for those expenses (see for eg. <em>TXY v TXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 21</a>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    where a respondent had a good track record of payment but is facing genuine financial difficulties in keeping up with the payments (see for eg. <em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, a case involving financial difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the trial, there was no dispute between the parties as to the arrears owed which came in at $3000 as of 1<sup>st</sup> November 2024. The real contention between the parties was whether the Father had given good reasons as to why these arrears should not be enforced against him, specifically, whether the Father’s medical condition was a good reason for his non-payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father gave evidence that he used to work as an IT engineer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> However, he had not been working this year owing to his medical condition. He testified that he had been admitted to hospital for treatment, and that he had a heart attack on 11 June 2024. Later, on 12 August 2024, he underwent cardiac surgery. The doctors had told him that a complete recovery would take approximately 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father also told me that he intended to look for work once he had fully recovered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In his estimation, he figured that he would be able to resume his obligation to pay child maintenance once he managed to find a job that was not too physically taxing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I did not doubt that the Father had a serious heart condition, or that he had had surgery. Signs that he had undergone surgery were plainly evident from the medical tubes protruding from beneath his shirt. In addition, the Father had also produced a bundle of medical certificates from the hospital which showed that he had been in and out of hospital since March 2024. There was also a letter from the doctor stating that the Father was receiving inpatient medical care, including cardiac surgery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father explained that notwithstanding his medical condition which had put him out of work since January 2024, he had tried his best to continue paying maintenance. He had drawn down on his savings to do so, and his current wife had also chipped in.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> He told me that his savings were down to $100, and that his current wife was shouldering the financial burden during this time. When quizzed about his current medical expenses, the Father said that he was paying roughly $200 each month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father, however, had not put any documents (<em>ie</em>, bank statements) in evidence to support his assertion that he was cash-strapped as a result of his medical condition and therefore could not afford the $500 monthly maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     That being said, I add that there are also two pieces of evidence which, to my mind, pointed to the <em>real</em> reason behind the Father’s failure to keep up with the maintenance payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The first was his response to the Mother’s question. She had asked why he could not simply have responded to her repeated text messages chasing him for payment to say that he could not pay.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s response was that the Mother was only concerned with getting the money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> When he was hospitalised, she did not enquire as to how he was doing, but rather, kept hounding him for the monthly payments. The Father went on to add that he was not spending time with the children despite having gone through supervised visitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> He told me that he wanted to spend time with the children, but the Mother did not allow that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second was a text message dated 12 June 2024. The Father’s current wife had texted the Mother, using his phone, to inform her that the Father was unwell and that the money would be transferred. The money owed, however, was never transferred and the Mother continued to hound the Father for payment. I would also note from the screenshots which the Father produced, that it is clear that the Mother did send rather nasty text messages to him in demanding for payment owed under the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It appears to me that the Father may well have ceased payment because of his frustration with the Mother’s attitude and her continued refusal to let him see the children. I would add that if it were indeed the case that the Father had intended to keep up with his maintenance obligations, but could not afford to do so, he could have sent the Mother a text, providing her with details about his health condition and asked for more time to make payment. Instead, there was radio silence. And while the Father chalks this up to his hospitalisation after surgery, he had more than 3 months to at least send a simple response to the Mother’s repeated text messages. He did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore did not find that the Father had shown cause as to why the arrears should not be enforced. Although the Father was still recovering from a heart operation, he had not managed to show that his medical condition put him in such dire financial straits such that he simply could not afford to pay the $500 monthly maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I thus allowed the Mother’s application in MSS 1648 to enforce the arrears of $3000 and made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father shall pay off these arrears in monthly instalments of $100, starting from April 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This sum of $100 shall be paid on the last day of every month; directly to the Mother’s stipulated bank account;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For the avoidance of doubt, maintenance that is owed under the current order remains payable.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript at p 31 – 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The appeal against the DJ’s decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 74/2021 was deemed withdrawn on 28 September 2021.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The appeal against the DJ’s decision <em>vide</em> HCF/DCA 108/2023 was dismissed on 24 April 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript at p 14, ln 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript at p 16, lns 5 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at p 16, lns 11 – 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27, lns 1 – 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Transcript at p 26, lns 1 – 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Transcript at p 27 lns 16 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Transcript at p 28, lns 9 – 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Transcript at p 28, lns 14 – 15.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2025-01-20","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)","title":"XHA v XHB","citation":"[2025] SGFC 9","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32806-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Luke Anton Netto (Netto & Magin LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-02-06T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHA v XHB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHA <em>v</em> XHB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32806-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 9</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Both applications had been taken out by the Wife who sought orders in relation to discovery and interrogatories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These were the parties’ submissions in respect of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Counsel for the Husband, Mr Netto, argued in written submissions, that it was the Wife who should be, pursuant to Rule 857(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (the “FJR 2014”), liable for costs to the tune of $500.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This was because the Wife had failed to, prior to taking out SUMs 3376 and 3318, serve a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories on the Husband. This meant that the Husband had no opportunity to respond to the voluntary request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Mr Netto further pointed out that while the Wife was self-represented, the learned Assistant Registrar had, in a case conference on 14 November 2024, highlighted that an “application for discovery and/or interrogatories ought to be in relation to existing request(s) where one party did not receive a satisfactory response to”, and that there could be cost consequences if one were to proceed with their application without first taking out a voluntary request.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Finally, Mr Netto argued that the Wife should be ordered to pay costs to signal, to parties, the importance and necessity of complying with the rules of procedure which are meant to ensure “fairness and equity in the proceedings”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Wife, on the other hand, took the position that she was entitled to costs in respect of both SUMs 3376 and 3318. She gave the following reasons. First, that apart from incurring $221.80 in the filing of both summonses, she had also spent a great deal of time and effort in learning how to navigate the “complex legal processes without the benefit of formal legal training”. Second, the Wife highlighted the Husband’s conduct, namely, that he would alternate between verbal threats and passive indifference which “created unnecessary delays and heightened emotional distress”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s behaviour took a toll on her which necessitated sessions with a psychologist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Where costs are concerned, it is well-established that costs shall follow the event. The court, however, can depart from this starting point if the circumstances of the case justify doing so: <em>WXE v WXF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31618-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 40</a> at [7] citing Rules 852 and 854 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Mr Netto relies on Rule 857(1)(<em>b</em>) of the FJR 2014 to argue that it is the Wife who should have to pay costs to the Husband, even though she had succeeded in both her applications. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Costs arising from misconduct or neglect</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">857.—(1)    Where it appears to the Court in any proceedings that anything has been done, or that any omission has been made, unreasonably or improperly by or on behalf of any party, the Court may order —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the costs of that party in respect of the act or omission, as the case may be, shall not be allowed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that any costs occasioned by that party to any other party shall be paid by him to that other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (1), the Court must for the purpose of that paragraph have regard to the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the omission to do anything the doing of which would have been calculated to save costs;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the doing of anything calculated to occasion, or in a manner or at a time calculated to occasion unnecessary costs;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    any unnecessary delay in the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The Court may, instead of giving an order under paragraph (1), direct the Registrar to inquire into the act or omission and, if it appears to the Registrar that such an order should have been given in relation to it, to act as if the appropriate order had been given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The Registrar shall, in relation to anything done or omission made in the Court of taxation and in relation to any failure to procure taxation, have the same power to disallow or to award costs as the Court has under paragraph (1) to order that costs shall be disallowed to or paid by any party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Where a party entitled to costs fails to procure or fails to proceed with taxation, the Registrar may, in order to prevent any other parties being prejudiced by that failure —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    allow the party so entitled a nominal or other sum for costs; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    certify the failure and the costs of the other parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 857 is derived from Order 59 Rule 7 of the Rules of Court 2014 and forms one of the “well-established exceptions to the general rule that costs follow the event”: Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) (“Family Procedure in Singapore”) at [857.01]. For example, it is noted that in cases where a plaintiff has adopted an “entirely wrong procedure”, that plaintiff may have to pay his opponent’s costs even though he has prevailed: <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2021</em> vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2021) (“White Book”) at 59/7/7 citing <em>Re Nichols &amp; Von Joel’s Contract</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/49176-E-M.xml')\">[1910] 1 Ch. 43</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, the Wife did not first serve a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories, prior to taking out both applications. As I had noted in my judgment, the Wife could not, despite being self-represented, be said to be wholly ignorant of the applicable procedural rules: <em>XHA v XHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32763-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 6</a> at [7]. I also note that in the case conference on 14<sup>th</sup> November 2024, the learned Assistant Registrar told the Wife that costs may be ordered if she did not first take out a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories before putting in a formal application to court – the Wife was also told to seek legal advice on the implications of pursuing her applications if she was unsure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s course of action naturally meant that there was no voluntary request for the Husband to respond to. As Mr Netto points out, this means that the Husband did not have the opportunity to “negotiate on the time period and/or type of documents to be provided”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I add that although the Husband had resisted the Wife’s application in both SUMs 3376 and 3318, this does not necessarily mean that he would have responded in the same way to a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories. The point remains that because a voluntary request for the items sought in SUMs 3376 and 3318 was never made, the Husband never had an opportunity to consider and respond to those requests, or make proposals in respect of these requests for the Wife to consider.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In the circumstances, I deem it fit to depart from the general rule that costs shall follow the event. I order that the Wife pay costs for both SUMs 3376 and 3318, which are fixed at $350 (all-in), to the Husband. This is to be done by 24<sup>th</sup> February 2025.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 4.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions on Costs at para 5.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Child Maintenance"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 1060/2023","title":"XHM v XHN","citation":"[2025] SGFC 8","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32771-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Applicant-in-person and unrepresented","The Respondent-in-person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-01-27T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHM v XHN</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHM <em>v</em> XHN </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32771-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 8</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 1060/2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Applicant-in-person and unrepresented; The Respondent-in-person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHM — XHN </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child Maintenance</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       MSS 1060/2023 (“MSS 1060”) was the Mother’s application for maintenance for her 18-year-old son. The Mother sought, from the Father, $400 per month as maintenance for their son. Both the Father and the Mother had been divorced in October 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 4 September 2024 and allowed the Mother’s application. I ordered that the Father pay monthly maintenance of $150 per month, at the end of every month, with effect from 1 June 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       When it comes to such applications for maintenance, s 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961 is the first port of call. In particular, s 69(2) provides that the court may, “on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for his child who is unable to maintain himself, order that parent to pay a monthly allowance or a lump sum for the maintenance of that child” (see also <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> at [8(a)]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found that the Father had indeed neglected to provide maintenance for his son. During the trial, I heard evidence from the Mother that she was the one who had supported the child, even throughout their marriage. The Father’s own testimony corroborated the Mother’s account. He told me that he had only contributed some money when his son was born. However, as his son was growing up, he could not afford to support him. This was because he was homeless and sleeping in the streets. The Father explained that he worked odd-jobs as a mover on a part-time basis and only made $70 a day. At times, he was only able to find a 2-day job in a single week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In my judgment, the Father should therefore be ordered to pay maintenance for his son – the next issue I had to consider was the quantum of such maintenance the Father should be ordered to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In making such an order for child maintenance, s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 stipulates that the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including factors such as the financial needs of the child (s 69(4)(<em>a</em>)), the income and earning capacity (if any) of the child (s 69(4)(<em>b</em>)), and the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage (s 69(4)(<em>d</em>)) (see also <em>WIM v WIL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28998-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 80</a> at [4] – [9]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>). The court does not adopt a mathematical approach to calibrating the quantum of child maintenance. As was recently noted in <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Applicable legal principles for quantifying maintenance</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">9     <b>Maintenance is ordered to provide for the reasonable needs of the child, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case: see s 69(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”).</b> The mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render such expenses reasonable expenses for the purposes of determining maintenance. Instead, parties should show how their projected expenditure for the child’s expenses is reasonable having regard to all relevant circumstances, including the child’s standard of living and the parents’ financial means and resources. Further, the changed circumstances following the marital breakdown of the parents’ relationship are relevant as the breakdown of a household invariably has an impact on the family’s financial needs and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">10     <b>It follows that in seeking to quantify the child’s reasonable expenses, parties should avoid an overly mathematical approach where receipts are adduced to prove every single item of expenditure.</b> This is not to say that no evidence is ever required to support proposals for what is sought as reasonable maintenance; it depends on the type of expenses sought, and of course, on the facts of each case. While receipts are useful as an indication of the child’s accustomed standard of living, they are not necessarily conclusive of what the child’s reasonable expenses are. It may be helpful for parties to apply their minds to drawing up what can be described as a ‘budget’, whereby broad categories of the child’s estimated needs are identified, and a corresponding reasonable sum is proposed for each category (see, for example, the table set out below at [13]). It was observed in <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (at [13]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">While it is a very useful practice to determine whether each item in the list of expenses submitted by the Wife is a reasonable one, one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement. The law provides that the court shall take into account various factors in deciding the maintenance award. The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. A child’s needs and expenses may also fluctuate from month to month; similarly, household expenses may fluctuate over time. Setting out regular specific expenses nevertheless enables the other party and the court to assess broadly whether the expenses are reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother explained that she had taken out her application in MSS 1060 as she was facing difficulty in supporting her son given the state of her health and her son’s growing expenses. She was unable to work as she was battling a host of medical conditions which included: a nerve issue which required surgery, as well as diabetes and cholesterol. In addition, the Mother also explained that she had been seeing a psychiatrist from the Institute for Mental Health for depression and anxiety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I also heard evidence that the son was working part time and was earning an hourly wage of $10. The Mother would give him some money amounting to $350 – $400 a month for school fees and food. I was also told, by the Mother, that the son, who is currently a student at the Institute of Technical Education, intends to further his education by enrolling in polytechnic. The Mother shared that the son would like to focus on his studies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the Mother’s circumstances, it was clear to me that the Father must do his part to provide financially for the son. That is his responsibility as a parent. In that connection, the Father told me that in his estimation, he would be able to afford $100 a month in child maintenance, but only upon his release from prison in 2026. He had begun serving a two-year sentence earlier in March this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I thus ordered that the Father pay maintenance of $150 per month to his son starting from 1 June 2026, and that this sum be paid on the last day of every month. This means that the first payment will be made on the last day of June 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In drawing up this order for maintenance, I placed weight on the Father’s financial circumstances and his capacity to make payment (see <em>VLO v VLP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26219-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 68</a> at [135]; <em>XFP v XFQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32408-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 97</a> at [14] – [15]). I accepted that the Father currently had no means of paying monthly child maintenance given his testimony that he had no savings, and the fact that he was currently in jail. It was also likely, in my judgment, that the monthly sum of $400 which the Mother had sought, while a reasonable sum to ask for in respect of child maintenance, would be beyond the Father’s means. There was, in my judgment, little point in making an order that the Father had no means of being able to comply with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As to what the Father could reasonably afford, I took into account his evidence that he had previously been able to find part-time work at a rate of $70 per day. Even accepting that the Father may not be able to find part-time work at the same daily rate for every day of the month, the monthly sum of $100 which the Husband thinks he can afford is, in my judgment, on the conservative side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     This order gives the Father a little time to get back on his feet upon his release from prison sometime at the end of March 2026. The Father will have about 3 months to find a job and to get his finances in order so that he can begin to do his part to support his son. While he has not done so for the better part of his son’s life, it is not too late for him to start doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given that the Mother did not ask for costs of her application, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Pursuant to an Order of the Syariah Court.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The appeal filed against the decision of the District Judge was deemed withdrawn on 22 December 2022.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery"],"date":"2025-01-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 5149 of 2023 (Summons No 3306 of 2024)","title":"XHI v XHJ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 7","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32767-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ong Ying Ting, Eunice (Netto & Magin LLC) for the plaintiff","Seetha Lkshmi P.S.

They had two daughters. After more than two decades of marriage, the Husband filed for divorce on the 25<sup>th</sup> of October 2023, citing the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour as the reason for irretrievable breakdown of their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Interim judgment was granted on the 25<sup>th</sup> of April 2024. Thereafter, parties charted a course for a hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is in this context that the Wife has taken out an application for discovery <em>vide</em> SUM 3306/2024 (“SUM 3306”). During the hearing before me, counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha Lkshmi (“Ms Seetha”) confirmed that the Wife was only proceeding on the following two items:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b><u>Item 1:</u></b> Bank account statements for the following bank accounts for the period (January 2020 to May 2020 and January 2023 to December 2023):</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       OCBC account ending -57;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       POSB account ending -44;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       DBS account ending -46;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       DBS account ending -23.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b><u>Item 2:</u></b> Bank account statements for a Standard Chartered Wealth Saver account ending -35 from the time the account was opened, till the time the account was closed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is hornbook law that a party seeking discovery must demonstrate the relevance and necessity of the documents sought to the hearing of the substantive matters: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       With regard to Item 1, the Wife explained that the bank statements are needed for two reasons. First, to ascertain why the Husband had received the sum of $45,000 from a third party, [X]. The Wife says that the Husband had told her, in a conversation, that he had lent this sum of money to [X]. The Husband’s account, however, is that [X] had transferred this sum to him to make investments on his behalf.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second reason the Wife gives is that these statements are needed to ascertain if the Husband had been dissipating assets. She points out that the Husband had, in April 2021, some $390,000 in his DBS account ending -6. However, in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means (“AOM”) filed on 3 June 2024, the Husband discloses that he only has $8,903.73 in that account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my judgment, the documents which the Wife seeks disclosure of in Item 1 are certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It would go towards the issue of whether the sum of $45,000 which [X] had sent to the Husband, was for an investment to be made on [X]’s behalf, or whether it was repayment for a loan which the Husband had made to [X]. It would also shed light on whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I note that the Husband has given his account of events relating to the sum of $45,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He has also explained the reason for the reduction in the balance in his DBS account ending -6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I must emphasise that, at the interlocutory stage, it is not for me to decide where the truth lies in relation to the various transactions which the Wife is disputing. The purpose of the discovery process is to ensure that all the relevant evidence is placed before the hearing judge, and also to allow parties the opportunity to evaluate their case: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [14] citing <em>The Lao People’s Democratic Republic v Sanum Investments Ltd and another and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0947.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 947</a> at [24] citing <em>Teo Wai Cheong v Crédit Industriel et Commercial</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0573.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 573</a> at [41]. In that connection, a party only needs to demonstrate the relevance and necessity of the documents sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As for the Husband’s objection to providing disclosure on the basis that it would be too costly for him to do so, I too, could not accept this argument. For one, the costs of complying with an order for discovery is generally borne by the party giving discovery. Although the court can depart from this starting point, and order that the party entitled to discovery “bear a whole or a portion of the costs of compliance with such an order for the giving of discovery” (<em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a> at [21] citing Family Justice Courts Practice Directions para 81(35) and (36); Chen Siyuan, Eunice Chua, Lionel Leo, <em>Family Procedure in Singapore</em> (LexisNexis, 2018) at p 945), I saw no reason to depart from this general position. After all, the Husband had, in his reply affidavit to SUM 3306, stated:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I also maintain that I have always provided a full and frank disclosure of my assets and finances as I have always kept good records of my finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Given the Husband’s evidence, one would expect him to have kept copies of these bank statements. In any event, insofar as the Husband has stated that he would need to fork out, at the very least, $9,600 to obtain the statements which the Wife seeks,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> he did not put forward any documentary evidence from the banks to support his claim. As I had noted in my earlier judgment in <em>WZR v WZS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31842-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 51</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25    I would, however, observe that in a future case, it may well be open to the party giving discovery to seek liberty to apply for an order that the party entitled to discovery is to bear the entirety, or a portion of the costs that may be incurred in complying with the order for discovery. In doing so, that party must articulate their legal and factual basis for seeking such an order. Naturally, in deciding whether it is appropriate to make such an order, the court will consider all the relevant circumstances. This could include factors such as the quantum of such costs that had been incurred or were likely to be incurred, and whether there was any reasonable way to avoid incurring such costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Finally, as to the Husband’s objection that the statements sought related to a period where divorce was not contemplated at all, the law is clear that it is indeed useful for the court to have an insight into parties’ finances during the breakdown of the marriage and prior to the filing of divorce. This is because, during the breakdown of the marriage, there is often a decrease in the knowledge and involvement of each party about the other’s finances: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [9] citing <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [79] citing <em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher v Ng Lay Mui (m.w.) and other cases</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25533-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 306</a> (“<em>Tan Bin Yong Christopher</em>”) at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In this connection, although the divorce was only filed in October 2023, I note from the Husband’s Statement of Particulars as well as parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> AOMs, that their marriage of some two decades, did not appear to have been an entirely happy one, and that their relationship had gone down the path of no return long before the divorce was filed. For instance, the Husband states, in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that their marital relations had begun to break down over the years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Wife also states, in her 1<sup>st</sup> AOM, that she had suffered “25 years of [p]hysical and [e]motional abuse” by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Apart from the various details which demonstrate that the parties’ relationship was strained years before the divorce, the Husband did also state, in his reply affidavit to SUM 3306, that the both of them always had “independence over [their] own bank accounts and finances” and that they would not “question each other on how” they chose to spend their own money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Given this state of affairs, it appears that the Wife may not have had much knowledge, or involvement in the Husband’s finances. In that vein, the Wife’s request for the documents in Item 1 cannot be said to be a wholly unreasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore allow the request in Item 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As for the request in Item 2, the documents which the Wife seeks are, in my judgment, also relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. These bank statements would go towards verifying the Husband’s claim in his 1<sup>st</sup> AOM that he used to hold the sum of $501,849 on behalf of his mother, and [X], for investment purposes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Husband’s main objection to giving disclosure in relation to Item 2 is that he no longer has the documents given that he has “disposed of all documents relating to this account”. I cannot accept this for two reasons. First, I find it rather strange that the Husband would dispose of these statements, especially given his claim that the money in this account belonged to other people. During the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Ms Eunice Ong (“Ms Ong”) had told me that the Husband was careful with money and that he would keep the relevant statements where he had dealt with other people’s money. If this was indeed the case – then the Husband should have no difficulty in producing these bank statements. In any event, I note that the Husband has not provided proof that it would be impossible to obtain these statements by writing to the bank to request for the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife’s request in Item 2 is also allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In summary, I therefore order that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as listed in Schedule A of SUM 3306, whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall exhibit, in his affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 10<sup>th </sup>of February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As to the issue of costs, Ms Ong argued that parties should bear their own costs. Counsel for the Wife, Ms Seetha Lkshmi (“Ms Seetha”), on the other hand, argued that the Wife should be entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given that the Wife had succeeded in her application, she is entitled to costs, which are fixed at $950 (all-in). In determining the quantum of costs, I took into account the fact that the Wife’s application was not a lengthy one and did not involve any novel points of law. The Husband is to pay this sum of $950 to the Wife by the 10th of February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, it remains for me to thank Ms Ong and Ms Seetha for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306 at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 18(ff).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Wife’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 20(xii).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Reply Affidavit to SUM 3306.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> AOM at para 21.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Discovery","Family Law – Procedure – Interrogatories"],"date":"2025-01-03","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)","title":"XHA v XHB","citation":"[2025] SGFC 6","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32763-SSP.xml","counsel":["The plaintiff in person and unrepresented","Luke Anton Netto (Netto & Magin LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XHA v XHB</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XHA <em>v</em> XHB </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32763-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 6</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2865 of 2023 (Summons No 3376 and 3318 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">03 January 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The plaintiff in person and unrepresented; Luke Anton Netto (Netto &amp; Magin LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XHA — XHB </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Discovery</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interrogatories</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">3 January 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       Parties were married on the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011.

This is my decision in respect of SUM 3318 and 3376.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The general principles relating to discovery and interrogatories are well established – that is, the court will only make the relevant orders if the requests for discovery or interrogatories are relevant and necessary: <em>WWS v WWT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31488-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 24</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In addition, it is also true that before an application for discovery or interrogatories may be taken out, a voluntary request to give discovery, or answer interrogatories, must first be made: Rule 63(4) and 69(5) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”). This forms the basis for the Husband’s objection to the Wife’s application in SUMs 3318 and 3376 – that because she did not put in a voluntary request for discovery or interrogatories, both her applications should be dismissed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Although the Wife was self-represented, it was apparent to me that she had done some research on the applicable procedures relating to the process of seeking discovery and interrogatories in family proceedings. It could not be said that the Wife was entirely ignorant of the relevant procedures – she had, after all, taken out a voluntary request for discovery in respect of other documents, and the Husband had provided his responses in respect of the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       That being said, I am not inclined to dismiss the Wife’s application on the basis that she had failed to first make a voluntary request for discovery and interrogatories. The matter had come before me, and it was perhaps more practical to deal with it on its substantive merits. After all, if I were to dismiss the Wife’s application for non-compliance with the FJR 2014, there was nothing barring her from making the same voluntary request – and then taking out another application in the event that she did not receive satisfactory responses from the Husband. The end result: a delay in bringing matters to a final conclusion, and more toing and froing between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What I have said above, however, must not be taken, or interpreted, as a basis for failing to comply with the applicable procedural rules. Even if the court is minded to look past any procedural defects and deal with the matter on its substantive merits, non-compliance with the applicable procedural rules is certainly a factor that may be accounted for when it comes to costs: see <em>eg</em>, Rules 854 and 857 of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I turn now to deal first with the Wife’s application for interrogatories in SUM 3376. The interrogatories sought fell into two categories. The first were interrogatories relating to any bonuses the Husband may have received during the tenure of his service with the [xxx]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Provide details of the gratuity bonuses received for each cycle of service in the [xxx], including the amounts received and the corresponding years (e.g., 6-year or 10-year cycles).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    State when each gratuity bonus was paid and specify the account to which each payment was made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Confirm whether the Defendant has signed on for life in the [xxx] and, if so, provide details of any annual bonuses received, including the amounts and dates of payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Provide details of the scheme signed, including the date of signing and any subsequent financial entitlements such as annual bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Counsel for the Husband, Mr Luke Netto (“Mr Netto”), made the point that these interrogatories were a mere “fishing expedition” as the Wife had no proof that the Husband had received any gratuity bonuses which were not reflected in the bank statements which he had already disclosed, or that the Husband had indeed been hiding money from the Wife, or that he had been dissipating his assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Husband also reiterates that he only has one bank account into which his salary from the [xxx] is deposited.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I do not agree with Mr Netto’s characterisation of the Wife’s application as a “fishing expedition”. It might equally be said that it is precisely because the Wife has no proof that the Husband had not been hiding his assets – that is why she has to pose these interrogatories in order to obtain the information she needs to assess her case for the hearing of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my judgment, the interrogatories which the Wife sought (above at [10]) were certainly relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. It went towards the outstanding issues which included the division of matrimonial assets as well as maintenance. It would also go towards the issue of whether there had been any dissipation of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request as set out in Items 1 – 3 of SUM 3376, but only for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The second category related to details of a safe deposit box which, according to the Wife, contained her personal jewellery that was now in the Husband’s possession:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Provide details regarding the safety deposit box opened jointly with the Plaintiff, including its closure status, the location of the items within, and any records of access to the box.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     During the hearing, Mr Netto argued that the Husband’s position was that the jewellery belonged to the Wife’s mother. In that vein, Mr Netto argued that if the Wife wished to assert a claim over the jewellery, which (allegedly) belonged to the Wife’s mother, then the proper thing was to follow the approach laid down in <em>UDA v UDB and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> (“<em>UDA</em>”) – in other words, the Wife should commence separate civil proceedings to obtain a declaration that the jewellery did belong to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The present case does not appear to fall neatly into the four situations described in <em>UDA</em> at [51]. The Wife’s ownership of the jewellery is disputed – but the Husband’s position is that the jewellery does not belong to him, but rather, the Wife’s mother. Having said that, insofar as it is alleged that the jewellery belongs to the Wife’s mother, I am not aware of any proceedings which the Wife’s mother may have brought to assert her alleged ownership over the jewellery (see <em>UDA</em> at [54]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     What is clear to me, however, is that the issue of whether these pieces of jewellery are indeed a matrimonial asset is one that will have to be decided at the ancillary matters hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife had stated, in her first Affidavit of Asset and Means (“1<sup>st</sup> AOM”), that her position in relation to the jewellery was that these were gifts given to her on her wedding day and 21<sup>st</sup> birthday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> Assuming that the jewellery were indeed gifts, one possible conclusion may be that they should be <em>excluded</em> from the matrimonial pool of assets: see s 112(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961. To arrive at this conclusion, it must be established that: <b>a)</b> the jewellery does indeed belong to the Wife, and <b>b)</b> that the circumstances of their acquisition means that they should be excluded from the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Framed in this way, it is clear that the interrogatory posed by the Wife is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The interrogatory asks the Husband to provide details such as which pieces of jewellery were stored in the safe deposit box and their current location. The answers would go towards establishing whether the Wife owns the jewellery and whether they should be included in the matrimonial pool of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will therefore allow the Wife’s request as set out in Item 4 of SUM 3376.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I turn now to the Wife’s application for discovery in SUM 3318. The items which the Wife sought in respect of discovery mirrored that sought in her application for interrogatories. The first category of items concerned documents relating to the bonuses which the Husband had received during the course of his service with the [xxx]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Documents showing the amount of gratuity bonuses received by the Defendant for each service cycle in the [xxx]. Include details for both the 6-year and 10-year cycles.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    Bank statements of the account(s) where the gratuity and annual bonuses were deposited including POSB/DBS statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Documents confirming whether the Defendant signed on for life in the [xxx], including details of the specific scheme signed, the date of signing, and subsequent annual bonuses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband objects to providing discovery on the basis that he only has a single bank account into which all his bonuses from the [xxx] have been deposited, and that it is hardly necessary for him to have to provide documents relating to the payment of all bonuses received since the start of the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband also takes the position that the Wife’s request is nothing more than a fishing expedition given that she has not a shred of proof to show that he had been dissipating assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the same reasons I have set out above (at [12]), I do not think that the Wife’s request for discovery is a fishing expedition. As I had explained in an earlier judgment, one other function of the discovery process is to allow parties to “evaluate their cases and clarify issues in dispute”: <em>XGY v XGZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32725-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 3</a> at [14]. The Husband’s responses to the Wife’s request for discovery would provide clarity as to whether there had been any dissipation of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I thus find that the Wife’s request for discovery as set out in Items 1 and 2 of SUM 3318 is indeed relevant and necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters. The Husband is to comply with the request, but the period of disclosure shall be limited to the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 to the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024. This period would cover the years in which the Husband may have received gratuity bonuses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife’s request in Item 3, however, is disallowed. That request sought disclosure of documents confirming that the Husband had signed on “for life” including the details of his employment contract with the [xxx]. In my judgment, this request is hardly relevant or necessary to the hearing of the ancillary matters, especially given the orders which I have made above (at [25]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The second category of items concerned documents relating to the safe deposit box containing jewellery which, according to the Wife, belonged to her:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    Documents relating to the safety deposit box jointly opened by the Defendant and Plaintiff, including records of access, closure, and disposition of the items contained therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As I had observed above (at [18] – [20]), it is clear to me that the issue of whether the jewellery is a matrimonial asset is likely to be raised at the hearing of the ancillary matters. These documents which the Wife is asking for in discovery would go towards shedding light on what had happened to the jewellery in the safe deposit box – this would have a bearing on any orders which the judge hearing the ancillary matters may make in relation to the jewellery which, according to the Wife, belongs to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife’s request in Item 4 of SUM 3318 is therefore allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     To sum up, it is therefore ordered that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband shall answer the interrogatories as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Items 1 – 3 of SUM 3376 (for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 till the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Item 4 of SUM 3376;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>on affidavit, to the best of his knowledge, information and belief, pursuant to Rule 69 of the Family Justice Rules 2014;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband shall state on affidavit, pursuant to Rule 63 of the Family Justice Rules 2014, in respect of each of the following documents sought in discovery, as set out in:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Items 1 – 2 of SUM 3318 (for the period from the 4<sup>th</sup> of June 2011 till the 31<sup>st</sup> of December 2024);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Item 4 of SUM 3318;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>whether the same is in his possession, custody or power, and if not then in his possession, custody or power, when he parted with it and what has become of it;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband shall exhibit, in his compliance affidavit, a copy of each of the documents that are in his possession, custody or power. If any of the documents are not in his custody, power or possession, he is to state the reasons why, together with supporting documentation for his explanation (if any);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband is to file his compliance affidavit by the 31<sup>st</sup> of January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In addition, parties are to write in, by way of letter to court, with their submissions on costs of both SUMs 3318 and 3376 by the 10<sup>th</sup> of January 2025. These submissions shall be limited to a maximum of 3 pages each.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing I have said here shall bind the hands of the judge hearing the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Finally, it remains for me to thank Mr Netto for his assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 23 April 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 28 March 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Statement of Particulars (Amendment No. 2) at para 1e.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at paras 12 and 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit for SUMs 3318 and 3376 at pp 13 – 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 28 March 2024 at para 19.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at paras 15 – 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Husband’s Skeletal Submissions at para 18.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Wife’s Supporting Affidavit for SUM 3318 at para 5.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Costs"],"date":"2025-01-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4676 of 2023 (Summons No 3168 of 2024)","title":"XGI v XGJ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 5","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32716-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gurmeet Kaur d/o Amar Singh (Harjeet Singh & Co) for the plaintiff","Arul Suppiah Thevar (APL Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-13T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XGI v XGJ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGI <em>v</em> XGJ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32716-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 5</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

That summons had been taken out by the Wife who sought leave to file a joint affidavit from her four daughters to address issues relating to certain items of gold jewellery. My decision in respect of SUM 3168 can be found in <em>XGI v XGJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32622-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 110</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These were the parties’ respective submissions on the issue of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband’s position was that the issue of costs should be addressed at the hearing of the ancillary matters. In any case, parties should bear their own costs as they are both legally aided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On the other hand, the Wife’s position was that, although both parties were legally aided, the Husband should still be liable for costs, to the tune of $2500, pursuant to s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAA”) as he had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168. These costs should be paid to the Director of Legal Aid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Where costs are sought against legally aided persons, there are two relevant provisions (<em>WXG v WXH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31649-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 41</a>). The first is s 12(4)(<em>c</em>) of the LAA which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where any Grant of Aid is so filed, the aided person —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    is not, except where express provision is made in this Act, liable for costs to any other party in any proceedings to which the Grant of Aid relates; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second is s 14 of the LAA. That provision states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Court may order payment of costs by aided person in certain event</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14.—(1)    Where it appears to a court that any of the circumstances mentioned in subsection (3) exists in relation to an aided person, the court may order the aided person to pay the costs of all or any of the following persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Director;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the solicitor who acted for the aided person;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the other party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In subsection (1), a reference to an “aided person” includes, in any case where the Grant of Aid has been cancelled before the making of the order, the person who immediately before the cancellation was the aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    For the purposes of subsection (1), the circumstances are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the Grant of Aid issued to the aided person has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the aided person acted improperly in bringing or defending any legal proceedings, or in the conduct of those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where an order is made under subsection (1), the costs must be taxed as if the party ordered to pay costs were not an aided person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The costs so ordered to be paid must, unless otherwise directed by the order, include —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    fees and charges of the nature referred to in section 12(4)(a) and (b); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any sums which, pursuant to section 13(3), were expended by the Director in meeting out-of-pocket expenses or were advanced by the Director for that purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    Where the costs of the Director or the solicitor who acted for the aided person ordered to be paid under subsection (1) include any of the fees, charges or sums referred to in subsection (5), then if any amount is recovered by the Director in respect of such costs, the same must be applied in the first instance in or towards the satisfaction of such fees, charges or sums.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that the Wife is invoking s 14(3)(<em>b</em>) to argue that the Husband should be liable for costs despite being legally aided, she bears the burden of showing that the Husband had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168. In that vein, the mere fact that the Husband did not prevail in his bid to have SUM 3168 dismissed is not, in of itself, evidence that he had acted improperly. The Wife must put forward evidence to show that the Husband had conducted his “defence in a way that a reasonable [respondent] would not”: <em>Anpex Pte Ltd v Cheng Yong Sun and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29042-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 294</a> at [4].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife’s basis for saying that the Husband had acted improperly in resisting her application in SUM 3168 appears to be that the Husband was lying in his affidavits when it came to the issue of the gold jewellery. The Wife points out that in his first Affidavit of Assets and Means, he had alleged that the jewellery was removed by the Wife from the matrimonial flat, and that the jewellery had been acquired during the course of their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The Husband, however, appears to shift his position because in a Reply Affidavit filed later on the 12<sup>th</sup> of November 2024, he denied the “existence and/or true value of the…gold jewellery items” which had been purchased by the Wife and their children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the circumstances, the costs of SUM 3168 shall be reserved to the judge hearing the ancillary matters.

In this judgement, I will explain the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin by setting out the applicable principles. They are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Starting position</em>. Under of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR</b>”), the starting position is that “costs should follow the event” – i.e., in usual cases, the successful party should be given the costs of the application or action: r 852(2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Therapeutic justice</em>. However, the FJR also provides that a court is free to depart from the starting position if the “circumstances of the case” warrant it: r 852(2). In this regard, courts <em>frequently decline to make costs orders</em> at the end of matrimonial proceedings: <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> (“<b><em>JBB</em></b>”) at [24] to [27]. There are at least two reasons for this. <em>First</em>, it is often hard to say which party has “succeeded” in such proceedings. <em>Second</em>, a costs order may also be perceived as a signal that one party has “won” and the other has “lost”. Courts prefer not to send such a signal as this may increase acrimony and discontent between the parties – and thus undermine the aims of therapeutic justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Parties’ conduct.</em> The judicial preference of not ordering costs does not mean that costs orders will never be made in matrimonial proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       This is because when determining whether there is a need to make costs orders, courts are <em>statutorily obliged</em> to consider the <em>parties’ conduct</em> before and during the proceedings. This includes considering whether they have made any attempt to resolve their dispute: r 854 of the FJR (“must”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In this regard, a court “may” make a costs order, <em>including against a successful party</em>, if a party “has failed to establish any claim or issue which he has raised”, and “has thereby unnecessarily or unreasonably protracted or added to the costs or complexity [of the proceedings]”: r 865 of the FJR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Courts have held that a costs order would be justified –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       Where one party had made a genuine and reasonable offer to settle the matrimonial proceedings, and the matter could have been settled without the need for litigation: <em>WLL v WLM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29872-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 30</a> at [7], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       To signal that the adversarial stance taken by a party is not acceptable in a family justice system that adopts therapeutic justice: <em>VVB v VVA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29144-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 4 SLR 1181</a> at [26] and [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     To sum up – it is appropriate to make costs orders to deter conduct which is contrary to the principles of therapeutic justice. If the appropriate signal is not sent, then parties who act reasonably may feel exploited by those who do not subscribe to such principles. Over time, confidence in the practice of therapeutic justice will be eroded and this is detrimental to our family justice system.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs ought to be ordered against the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Following from [4] above, whether the Father has succeeded in part, or has been “completely unsuccessful” in SUM 2056 is not determinative of whether costs should be ordered: see [2(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Instead, the more pertinent issue is whether the Father’s or the Mother’s conduct of SUM 2056 warrants a costs order against him/her: <em>JBB</em> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On this issue, I find that a costs order should be made against the Father. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayers 1 and 2 – Sale of matrimonial flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I begin with Prayers 1 and 2. They are the Father’s application –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     for extension of time to sell the matrimonial flat: Prayer 1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     to have sole conduct of such a sale: Prayer 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9        <em>Father’s allegations</em>. To support these prayers, the Father alleged the following in an affidavit dated 30 August 2024:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">36.    There is currently <em>no confirmation when</em> such completion will be, <em>if at all</em>. There is a chance that the completion may eventually be called off given the current buyer’s increasing financial penalties for delaying completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37.    It is <em>now 30 August 2024</em>, and the Matrimonial Flat’s completion is <em>still being delayed indefinitely</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">38.    Parties thus now require an extension of time for the sale of the Matrimonial Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The above allegations give the impression that as of 30 August 2024 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The completion for the sale of the flat had been delayed indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father did not have any confirmation as to when the completion would take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     He did not know if the completion would ever happen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11      <em>Allegations are false</em>. The Father’s allegations are clearly false given the following undisputed evidence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In a letter dated 21 August 2024 (i.e., nine days <em>before</em> the Father’s affidavit was filed), HDB had already written to the Mother and him to <em>confirm</em> the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The “<em>effective</em> date for resale” of the flat “<em>has been fixed</em> on <u>30/8/2024</u>” (underscore in original text, italics added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Father and the Mother were to pay the flat’s “service/conservancy charges up to 30/08/24” with the town council.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “[T]here should be no outstanding service/conservancy and lift upgrading charges due to the Town Council on the resale effective date”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There is no suggestion that the completion date of 30 August 2024 would be postponed. In fact, in so far as HDB is concerned, the <em>completion was to proceed as scheduled</em>. This is clear from two letters (dated 22 August 2024) which HDB had sent to the parties. In these letters, HDB specifically informed them of the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The parties had to pay $38,886.68 to settle the completion of account for the resale of the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “The completion of the resale transaction has been scheduled for you to <em>sign the legal documents</em> and <em>hand over the keys</em> to the flat”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The completion would be on <em>30 August 2024</em> at <em>3.30 pm</em> at the HDB Hub, Resale Office. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     It is clear that the Father and the Mother had no intention to postpone the completion date of 30 August 2024. In a document dated 22 August 2024, the Father had confirmed with HDB that the Mother and he “<em>will handover the house keys</em> as there are no extension of stay”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     There is also no evidence to show that the buyer(s) had between 21 to 30 August 2024 asked to postpone the completion fixed on 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The completion eventually proceeded on 30 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12      <em>Father’s position on the false allegations</em>. The Father denied that the allegations were false.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His counsel submitted unconvincingly that (i) the Father’s allegations referred to the “actual act of completion where parties sign all the documents and complete the transaction”, and (ii) 30 August 2024 was only the “anticipated completion date”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s counsel also submitted that the allegations were merely “outdated” and not false. To support this submission, counsel stated that the Father’s affidavit was confirmed on 29 August 2024 and signed in the morning of 30 August 2024 – i.e., <em>before</em> the completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I find these submissions to be disingenuous.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Father could have waited until <em>after</em> 3.30 pm (i.e., the scheduled completion time) to file his affidavit. If the completion did not proceed as scheduled, he could then state this accordingly in his affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, based on the eLit records, the Father’s affidavit was filed only at 5.42 pm – i.e., two hours <em>after</em> the time fixed for the completion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Finally</em>, after the completion of the flat, the Father would have known that (1) the completion had concluded successfully and (2) the evidence/impression which he had conveyed in [9] and [10] are “erroneous” (to use counsel’s description). During the hearing, the Father’s counsel agreed that a reasonable person would have taken steps to correct this “error” – e.g., by expeditiously informing his counsel to clarify the matter during the case conference on 10 September 2024 or by filing a supplemental affidavit. The Father had failed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13      <em>Unnecessary work done</em>. As a result of the Father’s conduct (false allegations and failure to correct them), the Mother had to seek the leave of court to file a further affidavit to clarify that the flat had already been sold. This affidavit was filed on 17 September 2024. It was only after this further affidavit that the Father’s counsel informed the Mother’s counsel that Prayers 1 and 2 would be withdrawn. This took place only on 23 September 2024 – i.e., about three weeks after the completion of the resale of the matrimonial flat. By then, unnecessary work has been done by the Wife and her counsel to address Prayers 1 and 2. The Father’s conduct is clearly unacceptable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayer 3 – Variation of Daughter’s caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Next, I turn to Prayer 3 of SUM 2056, which is the Father’s application to replace the Mother as the Daughter’s caregiver. By way of a quick re-cap, the Father had made the application on two grounds. <em>First</em>, he had discovered his Daughter’s photos on social media which show her to be in an allegedly inappropriate pose and in the company of “strangers”. According to the Father, this showed that the Mother had failed to protect the Daughter’s interests. <em>Second</em>, he alleged that the Mother had denied him access to the Daughter: Judgement at [12] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I dismissed Prayer 3 because I found it to be dubious and “utterly devoid of merit”: Judgement at [23] to [35]. There is no evidence to show that the Father had approached the Mother to clarify matters <em>before</em> seeking this prayer. In my view, he could have addressed his concerns expeditiously and easily by simply checking with the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayers 4 and 5 – Variation of non-family members clause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I now turn to Prayers 4 and 5. The Father had wanted the following clause to be completely deleted from the AM Order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother objected to the complete deletion of this clause because she was concerned for the Daughter’s safety if she was with strangers. The Mother was however prepared to be flexible, and she proposed the following variation to the non-family members clause:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Save for the Plaintiff’s romantic partner, the </u> <del>The Plaintiff’s</del> access shall not be in the presence of non-family members<u>, unless the Plaintiff obtains the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I note that as early as 2 August 2024, the Mother had already proposed her variation in [17] to the Father in her Offer To Settle (“<b>OTS</b>”). The Father did not accept the offer. Neither did he attempt to address the Mother’s concerns, e.g., by counter-proposing suitable text. It is the Father’s case that he did not trust her enough to negotiate on a mutually acceptable access clause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I agree with the Mother that Prayers 4 and 5 could have been resolved much earlier if the Father had adopted a problem-solving approach and proposed modifications to the Mother’s OTS.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Indeed, I had noted that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… during the proceedings, the Father had largely stuck to his positions and did not make much effort to address the Mother’s concerns arising from his application. In contrast, in line with the spirit of therapeutic justice, the Mother had shown flexibility and reasonableness – e.g., by suggesting suitable language for varying the access orders.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I eventually varied the non-family members’ clause as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff’s access shall not be in the presence of non-family members <u>save for the following circumstances:</u></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>i</u>)     <u>The non-family member is the Plaintiff’s romantic partner.</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<u>ii</u>)    <b><u>The presence of the non-family member is incidental to the Child pursuing her recreational, educational, or other needs during the access periods.</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>If the Plaintiff wishes to conduct the access in the presence of non-family members in other circumstances, then he must seek the Defendant’s prior consent in writing</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[variation in underscore] [bolding added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although I had eventually allowed Prayers 4 and 5, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother’s variations and the ones that I have ordered are substantively similar, save the text in bold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Father did not make any contribution towards the formulation of the varied clause that I have ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Prayer 6 – Modes of child access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Finally, I come to Prayer 6. In this prayer, the Father had sought to expand the manner in which he could exercise access to the Daughter. I had found the Father’s proposed variations in Prayer 6 to be “problematic”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I eventually accepted the Mother’s proposed variations which, in my view, “strikes the right balance between flexibility and certainty regarding the manner of the handover”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother’s proposed variations are not new – she had already proposed them to the Father in her OTS in August 2024. In my view, it is unreasonable for him to reject the Mother’s proposed variations. Litigation on Prayer 6 could have been avoided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Summing-up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To sum-up, I agree with the Mother that in relation to the issues in SUM 2056, valuable time and resources have been wasted because of the Father’s uncompromising stance, even when she had made a reasonable OTS. The Father has failed to substantiate his bare allegation that “it was reasonable for [him] to not try to negotiate further with the [Mother]” at the material time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father cannot continue with such an attitude. The Daughter is only eight years old. For the next 13 years, he will need to work together with the Mother on matters relating to their Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In my view, it is necessary to make a costs order against the Father to clearly signal to him that he needs to be more reasonable moving forward, and to compensate the Mother for the costs that she had unnecessarily incurred in the Father’s pursuit of SUM 2056.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Amount of costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, an order of <b>$6,500 (all in)</b> would be appropriate in this case. In coming to this amount, I have considered (a) the extent of work done, and (b) the fact that the Mother had shown flexibility in trying to resolve the issues early – by making an OTS and through the facilitative conduct of her counsel during the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The terms of the OTS are substantially similar to those that I have ordered. Admittedly, the Mother’s proposal regarding the non-family members clause did not go far enough: Judgement at [48] and [49]. That said, I do not think that this is due to a lack of genuine efforts on her part to resolve the access issue. I am satisfied that her OTS was made in good faith. If only the Father had kept an open mind and proposed suitable language to the non-family members’ clause to address the Mother’s concern, the issue could have been resolved with the need for litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father is to pay $6,500 to DBS Account No. 014-904xx by 27 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32      <em>First</em>, to support his claim that it was not reasonable for him to negotiate with the Mother, the Father submitted that after my decision on Prayers 4 and 5, the Wife had refused to allow him to bring the Daughter to visit his partner’s family members for Deepavali celebrations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I am unable to accept the Father’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     To support his submissions, the Father had relied on his chat records with the Mother. I find that these records are <em>not admissible</em> – they are annexed to the Father’s submissions and are not adduced by way of affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Mother’s counsel submitted that the Father had omitted the rest of the parties’ conversation, and that there was no evidence that the Daughter could not visit his partner’s family members for Deepavali celebrations. It is the Mother’s case that after my variations on the relevant clauses, the Father’s child access has proceeded smoothly. She is prepared to adduce the relevant evidence to support her case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <em>Second</em>, my decision in this case seeks to emphasise the point that the practice of therapeutic justice is not merely a vague concept. It is a key principle in our family justice system, with real practical implications on how parties are expected to resolve their matrimonial disputes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>__________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u>ANNEX A</u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>DETAILS OF PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS</b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"9.34%\"><col width=\"44.86%\"><col width=\"45.8%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Father’s submissions</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Mother’s submissions</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>1</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Outcome of SUM 2056</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father’s “main point” is that he has succeeded in part for Prayers 4 and 5, as well as Prayer 6.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father is “completely unsuccessful” in SUM 2056.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Out of the six prayers, two were withdrawn (Prayers 1 and 2), one was dismissed (Prayer 3), and three were allowed in part (Prayers 4 – 6).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>2</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Was it necessary to commence SUM 2056</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Yes –</b> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) Prayers 3 to 7 – These were granted in part.

Having considered parties’ evidence and submissions, I made various orders relating to the child’s care arrangements, including an order for the Defendant Mother to have sole care and control of the child, and orders providing for the Father’s access to the Child. The Father has since appealed against the whole of my decision. I now set out herein the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties are both Indian nationals. They married on 4 August 2017 in India. The Father is on an Employment Pass, while the Mother is on an S Pass, that was extended until 10 August 2027.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The child of the marriage was born on 8 November 2018 (the “Child”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Father had been living in Singapore prior to the marriage. The Mother lived in India, but moved to Singapore to join the Father after the marriage. The parties lived in rental premises throughout the marriage, first in a property at Pegu Road, and thereafter in an apartment at Henderson Road, where the Father continued to live in as at the date of hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It was not disputed that sometime in April 2023, the Mother left their rented apartment with the Child, taking the Child’s passport with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Sometime in May 2024, the Mother and the Child travelled to India. While the Mother returned to Singapore thereafter, the Child remained there, living with the Mother’s parents. The Father did not know that the Child had travelled to India or that the Child has been living there until the Mother revealed this at a Family Dispute Resolution (“FDR”) Conference on 5 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 29 May 2024, the Father filed the present application. Sometime in August 2024, the Mother filed for a divorce in Bangalore, India. In this regard, the Mother asked that the present proceedings be stayed for the court in Bangalore to determine the Child’s custody issues. As there was no application filed by the Mother to stay the present proceedings, I declined to do so, and proceeded to hear this matter on 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Apart from the present proceedings, the parties had previously applied for a personal protection order against each other: the Mother in SS 1624/2022, and the Father in SS 635/2023. A PPO was issued in respect of SS 1624/2022, restraining the Father from committing family violence against the Mother. SS 635/2023 was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s application </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In his application, the Father sought the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the Mother be restrained from removing the Child from Singapore until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother shall handover the Child’s passport to the Father’s solicitors for safekeeping, and that the Father’s solicitors shall not handover the passport to anyone until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the Father be granted interim care and control of the Child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That the Father be granted interim liberal access to the Child pending the resolution of the matter, or until further orders;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     That the Mother produces the Child before the court within 7 days of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Among the reasons given by the Father, the Father said that the Mother has been unduly restrictive with his access to the Child. The Father said that the Mother would make various unilateral decisions without consulting him, and suggested that she has been less than cooperative as a parent. The Father said that the Mother is unsuited to be the Child’s main caregiver because “<em>she has no qualm [sic] in using [the Child] as a tool to control the Father and she does not care whether there is a healthy father relationship between [the Child] and [the Father]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The Father said that there is a <em>“pressing need for him to see the Child to determine if further medical care is required</em>” in the wake of the Child’s operation in April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Father says that he has “<em>suffered from being completely cut off from [the Child] since November 2023 and [he] can no longer endure it as [he] truly miss[es] [the Child] a lot</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When faced with an application filed under Section 5 of the Guardianship and Infants Act 1934, the court is foremost guided by doing what is in the Child’s best interests. The court is less concerned about achieving equity or equality between parents. There is, after all, no standing presumption that both parents should have equal responsibility over, or equal time with, their child (see <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> at [12] and [20]). Each party’s behaviour toward the other, or indeed their respective contributions toward the marriage, are relevant to the extent that it affects the child in question. This may be the case where, for example, a party’s actions may have a direct or indirect impact on their ability to care for their child, or on their child’s relationship with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I therefore examined the reasons for the Father’s application, and considered, based on his reasons, how the orders sought by the Father would advance the Child’s best interests, rather than that of either party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On the evidence provided, I found some force to the Father’s arguments that the Mother had not been cooperative as a joint parent and that she had not been facilitative of the Father spending time with the Child. For instance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     From April 2023 to the time of hearing, which was a span of nearly one and a half years, the Father only met the Child once in person. This was in public, and in the Mother’s presence, at VivoCity on 8 November 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Apart from this brief access in November 2023, the Father only had two video calls with the Child which lasted for about three to four minutes each;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whereas the Child had been attending a preschool at Redhill Close, the Mother withdrew the Child on 31 December 2022 and enrolled him into a different preschool at Henderson Crescent. The Mother did not consult the Father, nor did she inform him of this before effecting the withdrawal and enrolment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Mother arranged for the Child to undergo an adenoidectomy in India in April 2024 without consulting or informing the Father. The Mother says that she informed the Father’s mother, but never received any queries from her or the Father. At the hearing, the Mother said that she did not think that the Father would be interested, and acknowledged that she should have informed the Father but did not.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     There was evidence that even when the parties were living together, the Mother was less than forthcoming about the Child’s whereabouts. For instance, WhatsApp messages between 8 October to 29 October 2022 suggested that there were various occasions where the Father would ask to see the Child, or ask about the Child, without any response from the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The WhatsApp messages on 21 and 22 January 2023 suggested that the Mother had taken the Child on a “stay holiday” without informing the Father. Despite the Father’s message at 8.54am on 22 January 2023 requesting the Mother to bring the Child back earlier for lunch, or for her to inform him of the Child’s whereabouts and the time they would be returning, the Mother only responded to the message at 11.47pm without providing any of the information sought, though they had yet to return at that late hour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)     There was also some evidence that the Mother had spoken uncharitably of the Father in front of the Child. For instance, a transcript of a recorded conversation shows that the Mother told the Child that the Father “<em>is not your father because he doesn’t take care. He is not your father. You no need to call him Abbu. He doesn’t take any responsibility.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> At pages 168 to 169 of FA1, a transcript of another recorded conversation suggests that the Child told the Father that the Mother “<em>threatens [the Father]</em>” and that he is “<em>also afraid of her</em>”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_g\"></a>(g)     On the evidence provided, when the Father tried to initiate access, the Mother appeared slow to respond, or else did not respond at all. For instance, on 22 April 2023, the Father requested for some video call access, but the Mother did not respond to this at all. On 9 September 2023, the Father requested to see the Child at 3.00pm the next day, but the Mother only responded at 3.09pm on 10 September 2023 to say that she was unwell, after the Father sent another message at 2.37pm that day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Taken at face value, the Mother’s actions, as described by the Father, suggest that she may have been inclined to fetter the Father’s time with the Child and to exclude him from making significant decisions relating to the Child. However, I also noted the following, which I found to have diluted the strength of the Father’s claim and reduced the culpability of the Mother’s actions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Despite the Father’s claims that he had made multiple requests for access, I noted that there was limited evidence showing this. For instance, a screenshot of WhatsApp messages between them showed that after the Father’s request for a video call with the Child on 22 April 2023, which the Mother did not respond to, the Father did not send another message or make any other request to the Mother until 8 August 2023, when the Father requested to take the Child out for the afternoon.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence provided on affidavit that explained this gap in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Similarly, there was no evidence of the Father asking about the Child’s well-being, whether on a consistent basis or otherwise. In this regard, there appears to be some truth to the Mother’s messages sent to the Father on 10 September 2023 at 3.16pm and 3.24pm, namely that the Father only wanted to spend time with the Child at his own convenience, and that he had not been asking how the Child was doing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> There was no evidence that the Father replied to these messages, and the Father did not provide an explanation for these messages in his affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, with respect to the Father’s access on 8 November 2023, the Mother’s evidence was that when they met, the Father “<em>could not control his anger and temper and began shouting and cursing at [the Mother] in front of [the Child</em>]”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> This was supported by a screenshot of WhatsApp messages she had sent to the Father, recording her displeasure at how the access went. The Father did not specifically dispute this, nor did he adduce any further WhatsApp messages to refute or to provide further context to the Mother’s messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In any event, while the Father argues that the Mother’s actions may have had a consequential adverse effect on the Father’s relationship with the Child, the relationship between the parent and child is but one of the factors that the court considers in its assessment the child’s welfare (see <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [51]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the balance of things, I was not persuaded that the Father should have sole care and control of the Child, as sought by him. Rather, I was of the view that the Child would benefit from continuing to reside with his primary caregiver. On the evidence, this appeared to be the Mother, not the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     One month after the Child was born, the Mother returned to India with the Child. The Child therefore spent his first year under the Mother’s primary care with limited physical involvement from the Father. After the Mother and the Child returned to Singapore in December 2019, there was little evidence adduced to suggest that the Father took over the role as the Child’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Father claimed to have been very much involved in the Child’s life, the Father’s best evidence of his involvement was that he fed his son well, took him to his favourite indoor playgrounds alone, and purchased baby supplies for him. He said that on occasion, he would “<em>give [the Child] a shower, put on a suit, and clean his poop</em>”, and that every time the Child was ill, he would take him to the clinic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Father also pointed to his efforts in applying for a student pass for the Child, but I did not think that this necessarily indicated his level of involvement in the Child’s day to day affairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     At paragraph 3.7 of MA1, the Mother alleged that the <em>“only interest [the Father] showed in [the Child] was limited to taking him out to indoor playgrounds for a couple of hours over the weekend or taking him to his sister’s house in Jurong East”</em>. The Father had the opportunity to respond to this but did not do more than make a blanket statement that “<em>these allegations are false</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The Father never provided much detail as to any other activities or events he would take the Child to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On the face of the evidence, I could not accept that the Father was a primary, or even an equal, caregiver during the marriage. I found that the Father likely bore the responsibility of being the main breadwinner of the family, but took on more of a supporting role when it came to parenting the Child. In contrast, the fact that the Mother was primarily responsible for caring for the Child during the marriage, as well as the Mother’s ability to physically care for the Child, were not seriously disputed. Rather, the Father’s main charge about the Mother’s suitability as a caregiver was that “<em>the [Mother] is not a suitable caregiver to [the Child] presently given her tendency to destroy the parental link between [the Child] and [the Father]</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I ultimately found that the Child had, throughout his life, mostly been reliant on the Mother and that it would be remiss to remove the Child from the Mother’s care. As the Child’s primary caregiver, the Mother would be better placed to attend to the Child’s physical and emotional needs, and provide the Child with a sense of stability amidst this period of transition. Further, I found that much of the Father’s concerns may be addressed through appropriate orders on custody and access, and do not in itself justify the order of sole care and control that he sought. <u>I therefore found that the Mother should be granted sole care and control of the Child</u>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     With respect to the Father’s access to the Child, the Father’s position was that he should have liberal access to the Child, if care and control was not granted to him. The Mother did not object to the Father having access, but said that this should take place in India. Otherwise, any access in Singapore should be in her presence, and should not be accompanied by any other members of the Father’s family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While the Mother said that the Child has been much happier in India, there was little evidence to support this. The Mother provided scant details of the Child’s routine and living arrangements to the court, and it appears that prior to the FDR Conference on 5 August 2024, the Mother did not even inform the Father of this significant development. I did not find the Mother’s decision to take the Child to Bangalore for a surgery, and then to effectively relocate the Child there, to be reasonable or justified. If this surgery was indeed necessary, I did not see why the Mother could not undergo the surgery here in Singapore. The Mother did not satisfactorily explain this (and never cited finances as a reason for doing so).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Further, the Mother’s case that the Child’s best interests would be best served in India was not substantiated on the evidence. The circumstances of the Mother taking the Child to India, without informing the Father and without any court application to do so, lend itself to the inference that the Mother herself may not have felt that she had such a strong case in that regard. I found the Mother’s reasons for not informing the Father of her decisions to have been unsatisfactory. I therefore did not deem it appropriate to effectively affirm the Mother’s actions by ordering any access to take place in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Rather, I found on the circumstances of the case that the Father should have regular access with the Child, and that such access should take place in Singapore. Notwithstanding the Mother’s misgivings, there is no evidence to suggest that the Father is unable to exercise access with the Child, particularly where it is not disputed that he had previously taken the Child out on his own to indoor playgrounds when the Child was younger. The Father should be given the opportunity to establish – or re-establish – his relationship with the Child, and to be the parent that the Mother says he has never been.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     However, given the length of time since the Father had any substantial time with the Child, I was of the view that such access should be exercised on an incremental basis. I did not find the liberal access suggested by the Father to be in the Child’s best interests, and I also noted from the requests made by the Father to the Mother for access over the past one and a half years that he never asked for any overnight access with the Child, or even for a period of much longer than a few hours. As the Child has been living in India for nearly six months as at the time of the hearing, I allowed a transition period of two weeks before access was to commence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I therefore ordered that the <u>Father has reasonable access to the Child</u> in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the first 6 weeks, with effect from the week commencing 25 November 2024, the Father shall spend 3 hours either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. The Mother shall be at liberty to be present during this access;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the next 6 weeks, and for a period of 3 months, the Father shall continue to spend 3 hours either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. The Mother is not to be present during this access without the Father’s consent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the above period of 3 months, the Father shall continue to spend 3 hours each week either on Saturday or Sunday for a meal and an activity with the Child. In addition, the Father is to have access to the Child for dinner after school on a weekday. The Mother is not to be present during this access without the Father’s consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As neither party raised any concrete proposals for access arrangements, I left it to the parties to make the necessary arrangements between themselves. However, <u>if the parties were unable to agree to this in writing within 7 days of my order</u>, the Father’s access was to take place as such:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the first 6 weeks, with effect from 30 November 2024, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Mother shall be at liberty to be present during this access. The Father shall inform the Mother of the location of access at least 48 hours in advance, i.e. by 10.00am on the Thursday preceding the access, and the Mother shall bring the Child to said location by the appointed time, ie. by 10.00am;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the next 6 weeks, and for a period of 3 months, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Father shall inform the Mother of the location of access at least 48 hours in advance, i.e. by 10.00am on the Thursday preceding the access, and the Mother shall bring the Child to said location by the appointed time, ie. by 10.00am. The Mother is not to be present during this access unless the Father consents to it in writing;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the above period of 3 months, the Father shall have access from 10.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays. The Mother shall handover the Child to the Father at the void deck of the Father’s place of residence, and the Father shall return the Child to the Mother at the void deck of the Mother’s place of residence. In addition, the Father shall have access on Wednesdays, after the Child’s school, or from 5.00pm (whichever is earlier) until 8.00pm. The Father shall pick the Child up directly from school and shall return the Child to the Mother at the void deck of the Mother’s place of residence. The Mother is not to be present during this access unless the Father consents to it in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given my above orders for the Mother to personally bring the Child for the access sessions, I did not find it necessary to order that the Child be produced before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     While the Father did not make any express prayers for custody orders (despite him seeking an order for sole custody in his written submissions), I found that it would be beneficial to make an order for the <u>parties to share joint custody of the Child</u>. I was of the view that in the context of this case, such an order clearly affirming both parties’ equal right to make major decisions for the Child such as the Child’s choice of school and the Child’s country of residence would avert any acrimony between the parties stemming from one party making any such decisions unilaterally, which may inadvertently have an impact on the Child’s relationship with the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     With respect to prayers 1 and 2 of the Father’s application (namely for the Mother to be restrained from removing the Child from Singapore until further orders, and for the Mother to handover the Child’s passport to the Father’s solicitors for safekeeping pending further orders), given that the Child was already overseas, and given my orders for the Mother to have sole care and control of the Child, I made no orders with respect to these prayers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In relation to the issue of costs, the Father sought costs of $4,000 (all-in). The Father’s counsel argued that this application was necessitated by the Mother’s actions, that the Father’s application was mainly for access, that it was the Mother who made it difficult for the parties to resolve the matter, and that the hearing of the matter was delayed, with a number of case conferences necessitated before the hearing of the matter. The Mother’s response was that she could not afford to pay costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I made no order as to costs. The Father had expressly sought an order for sole custody and care and control, and never made any concessions in this regard. I therefore did not agree that his application was primarily about the issue of access. In this regard, the Father did not find any success in his requests for sole custody and care and control. I also did not agree that the parties’ inability to resolve the matter prior to hearing was solely the Mother’s fault. I noted that the parties had been fixed to attend FDR Mediation, but that it was the Father who chose to withdraw from this after parties had attended the FDR Conference. I also noted that there were only two case conferences convened prior to the hearing on 16 October 2024, which was not an unduly high number, and that the Mother had only filed one affidavit in this matter, whereas the Father had filed four of his own. I overall did not find any order for costs to be warranted in the circumstances of the case.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Page 300 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 28 May 2024 (“FA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 4 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 13 June 2024 (“FA2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 13 of the Father’s Written Submissions dated 7 October 2024 (“FS1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Paragraph 14 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Pages 77 to 81 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Pages 212 to 215 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Page 151 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Pages 168 and 169 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Page 272 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 271 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Page 274 and 275 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Paragraph 3.10 of the Mother’s Affidavit dated 26 August 2024 (“MA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Paragraph 22 on page 139 of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of the Father’s Affidavit dated 12 September 2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paragraph 39 of FA2</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family law – Matrimonial proceedings – Jurisdiction – Whether parties who have consented to the grant of interim judgment entitled to a stay of ancillary reliefs on the ground of forum non conveniens","Family law – Ancillary powers of court – Pre-nuptial agreements – Whether case management stay should be granted pending conclusion of foreign proceedings on validity of pre-nuptial agreement","Conflict of laws – Natural forum – Stay of proceedings – Whether Singapore court is an appropriate forum in light of concurrent foreign proceedings"],"date":"2025-01-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce Suit No. 249 of 2023, (Summons No. 930 of 2022)","title":"XFS v XFT","citation":"[2025] SGFC 1","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32700-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mr Chiok Beng Piow (AM Legal LLC) and Ms Chuah Hui Fen Christine (D' Bi An LLC) for the Plaintiff","Mr Ivan Cheong, Mr Shaun Ho and Ms Imogen Harvey (Withers KhattarWong LLP) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-01-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kevin Ho","html":"<root><head><title>XFS v XFT</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XFS <em>v</em> XFT </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32700-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 1</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

FC/SUM 930/2023 (“SUM 930”), was filed by the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) in March 2023 seeking a stay of the divorce proceedings in FC/D 249/2023 (“D 249”) which were commenced by the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To better appreciate the context surrounding the present application and the implications of the orders sought in SUM 930, one must first consider the procedural history of D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife commenced D 249 in January 2023. The Husband, who was served the divorce papers, filed a Memorandum of Appearance around a month later indicating his intention to contest the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband then filed SUM 930 on 22 March 2023 and sought a stay of the divorce proceedings pending the conclusion of a specific legal action in Israel (which he had commenced against the Wife) on the ground of “<em>forum non conveniens</em>”. This was followed by a Defence and Counterclaim which the Husband filed in May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In a somewhat unusual turn of events, the parties reached an agreement that they would proceed with D 249 on an uncontested basis in relation to the <em>grounds of divorce</em> (<em>ie</em>. on both the Wife’s and the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour). Both parties filed amended pleadings in September 2023 – the Wife filed her amended Statement of Claim and Statement Particulars, and the Husband filed his amended Counterclaim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Interim Judgment for Divorce (“IJ”) was thus granted on 7 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Even though the IJ had been granted, it remained the Husband’s position that he would continue to pursue SUM 930. That effectively meant that the stay of proceedings he had sought in SUM 930 would relate only to the proceedings for ancillary matters (“AM”) relief in D 249 since the grounds for the parties’ divorce were already fully and finally determined in the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Following the grant of the IJ, the Husband applied for and obtained permission from the Court to formally amend SUM 930 to refer only to the AM reliefs sought in the pleadings,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> as well as to include a general reference to all the legal proceedings which were pending before the Israeli courts (“Israeli Proceedings”). By that time, there were multiple lawsuits between the parties in Israel. I will address the Israeli Proceedings in greater detail later on in these grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       By the time SUM 930 was heard by this Court, it transpired that much of the Israeli Proceedings have concluded, save that the Husband’s appeal against part of the Israeli Family Court’s earlier decision (“Israeli Appeal”) has not yet been heard. As such, the Husband – through his counsel – sought a <em>permanent</em> stay of D 249. The effect of such a stay would be that the remainder of the divorce proceedings, <em>ie.</em> the proceedings for AM reliefs (“AM Proceedings”), would be brought to an immediate end.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 21 October 2024, I delivered my oral grounds of decision in respect of SUM 930. In summary, I dismissed the Husband’s application for a permanent stay and ordered that there be a limited case management stay of D 249 pending the conclusion of his Israeli Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Both parties have since appealed against my decision, <em>vide.</em> HCF/RAS 20/2024 and RAS 21/2024. These are my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Stay on the Ground of <em>Forum Non Conveniens</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Given the procedural posture of the present proceedings, there was some initial debate between the parties’ counsel as to whether the Husband’s stay application remained grounded on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. This issue arose because despite the prayers in SUM 930 referring to phrase “<em>forum non conveniens</em>”, much of the Husband’s counsel’s arguments was focused on the impact and relevance of the parallel Israeli Proceedings, and the concern with multiplicity of proceedings in two jurisdictions, <em>ie.</em> Israel and Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Notwithstanding the somewhat unusual turn of events, I agreed with the Husband’s counsel that the principle of <em>forum non conveniens</em> remained a live issue between the parties, and was one of the legal bases relied upon by the Husband in support of SUM 930. This was evident from the fact that both counsel had filed detailed written submissions addressing this issue, and the principle itself was referred to in SUM 930.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Moreover, the concerns as regards <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in the present case arose as a result of the Husband’s subsequent Israeli legal action against the Wife, as compared to D 249 which was the Wife’s initial divorce application in Singapore against the Husband. The situation thus fell within what the Court of Appeal in <em>Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Constructions Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 1097.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 1097</a> (“<em>Virsagi</em>”) had observed as being a “reversed parties situation”, <em>ie.</em> where a plaintiff sues a defendant in Singapore, and the same defendant then sues the plaintiff abroad (see <em>Virsagi</em> at [27]). The <em>lis alibi pendens</em> in such a situation operates <em>within</em> the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, and is to be considered under the rubric of the general principles applicable to the doctrine (see <em>Virsagi</em> at [38] and [39]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I will therefore start by addressing the question of whether the Husband is entitled to seek a stay on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the outset, I note that, in both parties’ written submissions, they accept that in considering the issue of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, the Family Court would apply the principles set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] 1 AC 460</a> (or the “<em>Spiliada</em> test”) to determine whether a stay of divorce proceedings should be granted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> I agree with the said approach as that is consistent with the prevailing caselaw: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a> and <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a>, Debbie Ong JC (as Her Honour then was) held as follows (at [14] of the judgment):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">14    It is well accepted in Singapore that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> remains relevant in matrimonial proceedings, including proceedings involving the custody of children. The High Court in <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 0993.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 993</a> first made it clear that the <em>Spiliada</em> principles (derived from and named after the seminal case of <em>Spiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a> (“<em>Spiliada</em>”)) apply in matrimonial proceedings. Similarly, the High Court in <em>Mala Shukla v Jayant Amritanand Shukla (Danialle An, co-respondent)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0920.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 920</a> applied the <em>Spiliada</em> principles to divorce and related ancillary matters, citing [16] of the Court of Appeal decision in <em>PT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2001] 1 SLR(R) 0104.xml')\">[2001] 1 SLR(R) 104</a> which reads […]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In gist, the <em>Spiliada</em> test is a factors-based test which starts with an assessment as to whether the applicant (in this case, the Husband) has shown that there exists another available forum which is more appropriate. If there is <em>prima facie</em> another more appropriate forum, the court will grant a stay unless there are “special circumstances” which justify refusing to grant the stay: see <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> at [21] – [24]. The latter is commonly referred to as the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     At the second stage, the burden shifts to the responding party (ie. the Wife in the present case) to show the presence of “special circumstances” by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused: see <em>AZS v AXR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 3 SLR 0700.xml')\">[2013] 3 SLR 700</a> at [11]; <em>WYZ v WZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32014-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 68</a> at [7].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband is precluded from raising forum non conveniens</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As I had alluded to above, the present case is unique in that the parties agreed to hold SUM 930 in abeyance while allowing the IJ to be granted in relation to D 249 by the Singapore court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In my judgment, I find the Husband’s agreement for the Singapore court to grant the IJ to be inimical to his claim that a stay should be granted on account of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)    <u>The Husband had accepted Singapore as the most appropriate forum</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To satisfy the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the Husband asserted that there exists another court (presumably, the Israeli court) which would be “more appropriate” than the Singapore court. However, such a claim cannot be sustained when he had himself accepted (and had, in fact, expressly agreed with the Wife) that the Singapore Family Court was the appropriate court to grant IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     What is of especial significance, in the present case, was that the IJ was granted on <em>both</em> the parties’ amended claim and counterclaim relating to their respective unreasonable behaviour. In other words, both the Wife and the Husband expressly invoked the Family Court’s matrimonial jurisdiction to put an end to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In the Husband’s amended pleadings, his entire Defence (including his objection to the Singapore courts having jurisdiction to determine the AM Proceedings) was deleted. In the Husband’s amended Counterclaim, AM reliefs <em>from the Singapore Family Court</em> were expressly sought and for those same reliefs to be adjourned to be determined in Chambers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> In my view, the Husband thus recognised that the Singapore was the appropriate jurisdiction to grant AM reliefs and cannot then claim that there was a more appropriate forum elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)    <u>Whether a “partial stay” of divorce proceedings can be granted</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Does this mean that that the Husband cannot then seek a stay (or, in counsel’s submissions, a “partial” stay) of D 249 such that <em>only</em> the AM proceedings are stayed? In addressing this question, both counsel made extensive submissions on whether the concept of a partial stay was even applicable to divorce proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Drawing from similar principles in the context of civil litigation, the Husband’s case was that the Singapore court can always grant a partial stay whenever a claimant has different claims against the same defendant. The court would then be at liberty to decide which claims ought to be stayed against the defendant (so that they could be pursued elsewhere), while allowing the other claims to proceed within the forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the present case, the Husband analogised the claims leading to the grant of the IJ (<em>viz.</em> the grounds for the divorce) as being one claim between the parties, and the AM Proceedings (for ancillary relief) being an entirely separate claim, with the latter capable of being stayed independently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While I acknowledge that a Singapore court can grant such “partial stays” in relation to commercial claims (as was recognised by the High Court in <em>Humpuss Sea Transport v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19731-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 5 SLR 1322</a> (“<em>Humpuss</em>”)), the cases where the grant of such stays were discussed occurred in the context of a claimant having different civil claims (or causes of action) against the same defendant some of which could be pursued in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For example, the High Court in <em>Humpuss</em> (at [96] of the judgment) referred to a situation where part of a party’s claims arose from a specific jurisdiction’s statutory law. Where such claims are brought alongside other general claims, the statutory cause of action may sometimes be partially stayed in favour of that forum so as to discourage litigants from tacking on claims with no obvious connection to the forum to claims which do.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     However, those principles (which makes sense in the context of civil litigation) do not sit well with, and <em>cannot</em> be easily analogised to, divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To begin with, the power of the Family Court to grant any form of AM relief is derived from (and consequent on) an interim judgment of divorce being granted to dissolve the parties’ marriage. In my view, one cannot exist without the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     There are no <em>separate</em> causes of action or claims within the context of divorce proceedings because a party cannot apply to the Singapore Family Court to independently divide assets or seek a maintenance order, under Chapter 4 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev. Ed.) (“WC”), without first obtaining interim judgment from the same Singapore court. This is apparent from the statutory schema of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For example, s 112(1) of the WC (which is located within Chapter 4) gives the court the power to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets only “<em>when granting or subsequent to grant of a judgment of divorce</em>”. Section 113(1)(b) similarly gives the court the power to order maintenance “<em>when granting or subsequent to grant of a judgment of divorce</em>”. Indeed, s 123 (in Chapter 5 of the WC) likewise directs the court not to make final any judgment of divorce unless arrangements have been made for the welfare of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     While the present marriage does not involve children, what is clear from the overall context of the provisions in the WC is that proceedings for ancillary relief (which relate to the financial consequences of a divorce and, where applicable, child-related orders) are intimately connected with, and are <em>part of</em>, the same claim for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To put matters in perspective, prior to 2011, it was well acknowledged that there was a “gap” in Singapore’s matrimonial law because the Singapore court had no powers to grant any AM relief independently, if it was not the court which granted the judgment for the parties’ divorce (see the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>UFM v UFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24027-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 2 SLR 650</a> at [1]). Parliament then had to statutorily enact Chapter 4A of the WC to specifically allow former spouses who were divorced in another jurisdiction to apply to the Singapore court for financial relief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was thus not persuaded by the Husband’s argument that the AM Proceedings should be considered a separate claim or cause of action which can be “severed” from a claim for the dissolution of the parties’ marriage. They are two inter-connected parts of the same claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Accordingly, the Husband was not entitled to seek a stay (whether fully or partially) of D 249 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> given that he had submitted to the Singapore court’s jurisdiction and had accepted its appropriateness to determine the parties’ divorce. It followed therefore that, by the Husband’s actions, he had acknowledged that the Singapore court was <em>in fact</em> the appropriate court to hear and determine the AM Proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Israel is not a more appropriate forum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, even if the Husband was entitled to seek an independent stay of the AM Proceedings (contrary to my decision above) and I had applied the <em>Spiliada</em> test, I would not have found Israel to be a more appropriate forum in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In my view, apart from the fact that there were (and possibly continues to be) legal proceedings in the Israeli courts which the Husband had commenced against the Wife, no other factor clearly points to Israel being the appropriate jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In this regard, I accept the Wife’s submissions that both parties registered and celebrated their marriage in Singapore, and had lived in Singapore both before and after their marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> They both applied for and had obtained Permanent Resident status in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Wife is now a Singapore citizen. They also worked in Singapore and have significant assets in Singapore, including two Singaporean companies – [SGD] Pte Ltd and [AML] Pte Ltd.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The fact that they may also have an asset overseas (in the United States of America) was, in my view, inconclusive – it certainly does not point to the Israeli court as being the “more appropriate” forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This is particularly so given that the stay sought by the Husband was only in relation to the AM reliefs to be granted by the Singapore court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Overall, I was satisfied that all relevant connecting factors point to Singapore as being the appropriate forum. The Husband’s request for a stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> was therefore not made out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other Considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Before addressing the Husband’s other arguments, I wish to make clear that in reaching my conclusion that he was not entitled to seek a partial stay on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, I did not accept the Wife’s submission that because the WC was the “governing law” for marriages in Singapore,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> it meant that there were public policy considerations which would enjoin this Court to conclude that Singapore must be the most appropriate or, indeed, the only forum of choice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the main, the Wife’s submission was that since the parties registered their marriage in Singapore, the “just and equitable” division of assets regime (or the legal concept of a deferred community of property) envisaged under the WC should be seen as a manifestation of public policy operating to favour Singapore as the only jurisdiction of choice when it comes to the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In the context of modern-day marriages, spouses can come from different jurisdictions, geographical locations, and they can choose to register (or celebrate) their marriage in any number of countries. It does not seem logical to say that because the parties married in Singapore, <em>ipso facto</em>, Singapore’s domestic marriage laws must apply as a matter of “<em>public policy</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Family Court, in considering whether a stay of proceedings ought to be granted, will still have to weigh the relevant connecting factors pursuant to the <em>Spiliada</em> test. Where the parties had registered their marriage and the applicable marriage laws of that forum are, at best, one of several considerations and would not be dispositive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I should also add that my decision in the present case should not be taken as having expressed a definitive view that it is legally impermissible for spouses to agree to have their marriage dissolved in Singapore, but with the AM proceedings dealt with by another court, in another jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Parties may perhaps be entitled to come to an express agreement for such an outcome. Another possibility alluded to by the Husband’s counsel relates to the existence of legal frameworks in other jurisdictions which permit spouses to <em>first</em> apply for the division of their marital assets in that jurisdiction and then apply for divorce elsewhere, or <em>vice-versa</em>. If parties had agreed to take such a path, it might be possible that the divorce sought in Singapore relates only to the dissolution of their marriage. As these considerations were <em>not</em> present in this case, I express no firm views on these matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     My decision in the SUM 930 should be limited to the particular facts of the present case – <em>ie.</em> where a party, having freely elected and consented to the Singapore Family Court granting an IJ to end his marriage and agreeing for his prayers for ancillary relief to be adjourned for determination, subsequently seeks to stay the consequent AM proceedings in favour of another jurisdiction on account of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In such a situation, I find that the party in question is not allowed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Should a Case Management Stay be granted? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Although the Husband was not, in my view, entitled to a stay of the D 249 on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, that was not the end of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Court can, in exercise of its discretion, grant a case management (or limited) stay if I were to find that there was a risk of multiplicity of proceedings if D 249 is allowed to proceed given the existence of the Israeli Proceedings. In deciding whether to do so, the Court must consider all the circumstances of the case, and determine whether there is a need to ensure the efficient and fair resolution of the dispute as a whole: see <em>BNP Paribas Wealth Management v Jacob Agam and Ruth Agam</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19908-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 3 SLR 27</a> at [34] and [35]. For case management stays, it is not necessary for the Court to consider the principles governing <em>forum non conveniens</em>: see <em>Chan Chin Cheung v Chan Fatt Cheung</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 1 SLR 1192.xml')\">[2010] 1 SLR 1192</a> at [47].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Although the Husband’s main case was that there should be a permanent stay of the D 249 (whether on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, or because of the outcome of the Israeli Proceedings) and not a limited case management stay, the issue of such a stay was nonetheless raised during oral submissions. It was also expressly referred to in the Wife’s written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> As the grant of a case management stay was within this Court’s inherent powers, I find it relevant to discuss this issue in detail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Israeli Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In considering the issue of multiplicity of proceedings, I will first address the Israeli Proceedings which the Husband had relied on as a significant aspect of his case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It was common ground – both in the parties’ submissions and in their experts’ evidence – that there were two separate actions before the Israeli Family Court, <em>ie.</em> Suit No. 60180-XX-XX (“Israeli Suit 1”) and Suit No. 5245-XX-XX (“Israeli Suit 2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     It was also not disputed that Israeli Suit 1 dealt with the <em>financial</em> issues arising from a partnership agreement which parties had signed in March 2015 (“Partnership Agreement”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     On 24 October 2023, Judge Samuel Bar Yosef of the Israel Family Court gave his judgment in respect of Israeli Suit 1 (“1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment”). In the said Judgment, the court held that the Partnership Agreement was enforceable only in relation to the properties which the parties had “<em>accumulated until the date of marriage of the parties (January 16, 2020)</em>” and that it was “<em>not enforceable in regards</em> [sic] <em>to property that was accumulated after the marriage of the parties</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> For completeness, Judge Yosef’s decision also covered assets which were accumulated before marriage, but are connected to post-marital assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The second common ground between the parties was that part of Israeli Suit 2 was commenced to <em>enforce</em> the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment. This was what Judge Yosef had envisaged in the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli judgment when the learned judge stated in his Judgment that “<em>the implementation of the provisions of the</em> [Partnership Agreement]<em>, according to this ruling shall be conducted in a separate proceeding</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Israeli Suit 2 was thus the said “separate proceeding”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     However, it was clear from the evidence that Israeli Suit 2 covered <em>more</em> than the mere enforcement of the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment and/or the implementation of the Partnership Agreement (which provided that the Husband should be entitled to 80% of the relevant assets). The Husband had also sought additional reliefs in Israeli Suit 2 which covered the division of the parties’ <em>post-</em>marital assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The latter issue was one which the court in Israeli Suit 1 <em>did not</em> make orders for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The judgment for Israeli Suit 2 was delivered by Judge Yosef in April 2024 wherein the learned Judge granted the enforcement order sought by the Husband (arising from Israeli Suit 1) and, <em>in addition</em>, that the Husband was entitled to 50% of the assets accumulated <em>after</em> marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> In dealing with the parties’ post-marital assets, Israeli Suit 2 had – in effect – determined what the Singapore court would have to decide in the AM Proceedings for D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     It follows from the matters discussed above that the relevance of the Israeli Proceedings and the parties’ conduct <em>vis-à-vis</em> these proceedings formed a significant dispute between the parties in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In particular, the Husband focused his arguments on whether this Court should find the Wife as having submitted to the jurisdiction of the Israeli courts. The Husband’s case was that if this Court finds that the Wife had done so, she should then be bound by the judgments in both Israeli Suits 1 and 2, and this Court should not proceed with the AM Proceedings given that those reliefs had already been sought <em>and obtained</em> by the Husband in Israel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As regards the issue of submission to jurisdiction, I accept the Husband’s argument that the Wife did submit to the jurisdiction of the Israeli court in Israeli Suit 1. The Wife filed submissions in Israeli Suit 1 and had participated in the court hearings leading up to Judge Yosef’s judgment on 24 October 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This was not seriously disputed by the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     What was more controversial was whether the Wife had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Israeli courts (whether voluntarily or otherwise) in relation to Israeli Suit 2. The Husband’s primary position was that Israeli Suit 2 was merely a “continuation” and/or “enforcement” proceeding following on from Israeli Suit 1 and that this Court should consider both Suits in the Israeli Family Court as being one and the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     While much ink was spilled in both parties’ written submissions as to the nature of the Israeli Suit 2, the fact remained (and which I accept) that Israeli Suit 2 covered matters which <em>went beyond</em> Israeli Suit 1.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Husband had sought adjudication by, and relief from, the Israeli Family Court with regard to the parties’ post-marital assets (which was a new claim in Israeli Suit 2). Separate service of legal process was carried out in respect of Israeli Suit 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the Israeli Family Court appeared to have expressed a dim view of the Wife for her decision not to participate in Israeli Suit 2 when she had already participated in Israeli Suit 1, I nevertheless accept the Wife’s foreign law expert’s opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that she did not act in a manner which could be taken as having submitted to the Israeli Family Court’s jurisdiction <em>for Israeli Suit 2</em>. She did not participate in those proceedings, nor did she file any documents or take any steps in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To address this concern, the Husband mounted a <em>secondary</em> argument, <em>ie.</em> that this Court should deem the Wife as having submitted to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction of Israeli Suit 2 under the principle of “inchoate submission” referred to in the High Court’s decision of <em>Giant Light Metal Technology (Kunshan) Co Ltd v Aksa Far East Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0545.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 545</a> (“<em>Giant Light Metal</em>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I accept that the principle of inchoate submission has been recognised by the local courts as being part of Singapore law. The General Division of the High Court’s recent decision in <em>Re Sapura Fabrication Sdn Bhd and anor matter (GAS, non-party)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32165-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 241</a> at [81] confirmed its application in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     However, I am not persuaded that the principle of inchoate submission applies in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In <em>Giant Light Metal</em>, Andrew Ang J explained the principle as follows (at [48] and [49] of the judgment):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    Underlying all three of these cases is the principle that the courts are willing to recognise, for the purposes of international jurisdiction, that a party’s consent to the jurisdiction of a foreign court in relation to certain claims may be imputed to further claims in some circumstances. … Such “inchoate submission” – as seen in Whyte and Aeroflot – is also possible in relation to claims which are brought pursuant to subsequent and separate proceedings in respect of the same parties, rather than just to claims which are part of the same proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">49    The question then is when consent will be imputed or “inchoate submission” be said to arise. Murthy provided two factual reference points for consent to be so imputed: where the subsequent claim concerns the same subject matter; and where the subsequent claim is related to the original claim. Which subsequent claims will fall under these categories is then a matter of degree based on the circumstances. The courts in making this assessment seemed to be informed by concerns of fairness to both the plaintiff and the defendant, and also a desire to disregard technical impediments created by procedural rules under both foreign and forum law. With respect, I agree with such an approach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For the reasons I had set out at [64] above, I find that Israeli Suit 1 and Suit 2 did not concern claims for the <em>same</em> subject-matter and/or that the claim in Suit 1 was <em>related</em> to Suit 2. The “same” or “related” subject-matter I am referring to is the claim for the division of the parties’ <em>post-marital</em> assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In my view, it would not be appropriate or fair to impute the Wife’s consent to, and participation in, Israeli Suit 1 (which related to the parties’ Partnership Agreement) as being her acceptance of the Israeli court’s jurisdiction <em>vis-à-vis</em> Israeli Suit 2 when a significant part of the latter Suit related to how the parties’ matrimonial assets are to be divided. The two Suits thus involved separate subject-matter and reliefs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     On a related issue, the Israeli court had, in its judgment for Israeli Suit 2, determined that there was proper service of legal process on the Wife in accordance with Israeli procedural rules, and that it was satisfied that the Wife was aware of the proceedings in Suit 2 when it proceeded to render its judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Notwithstanding the Israeli court’s decision, the Wife’s counsel submitted that in answering the question as to whether a party had submitted to a foreign jurisdiction, the Singapore court ought to determine the same by reference to <em>Singapore’s</em> conflict of laws principles.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> In other words, even if a party is deemed to have been within the foreign court’s jurisdiction pursuant to the rules of foreign civil procedure, it does not necessarily mean that there has been voluntary submission under the Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I agree with the Wife’s submissions and for the reasons I have explained above, the Wife did not voluntarily submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of Israeli Suit 2, despite the foreign court’s own decision that it had jurisdiction over her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In view of my conclusion that the Wife did not submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction for the purpose of Israeli Suit 2, I find that the Husband’s other argument relating to transnational issue estoppel (which he had raised in his written submissions) would not be engaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In <em>The Republic of India v Deutsche Telekom AG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31082-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 56</a> (“<em>Deutsche Telekom AG</em>”), the Court of Appeal re-affirmed the formulation of the legal test for transnational issue estoppel observing (at [64] – [65]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">64    The same test has been applied with some modifications in the context of <em>transnational</em> issue estoppel where the prior judgment is rendered in a foreign jurisdiction (<em>Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp (formerly known as Merck &amp; Co, Inc) v Merck KGaA (formerly known as E Merck)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26043-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 1102</a> (“<em>Merck Sharp</em>”) (at [2]); <em>The Sennar</em> at 500). The test for transnational issue estoppel has been formulated as follows (<em>Merck Sharp</em> at [35]–[40]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The foreign judgment must be capable of being recognised in this jurisdiction, where issue estoppel is being invoked. Under the common law, this means that the foreign judgment must:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    be a final and conclusive decision on the merits;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   originate from a court of competent jurisdiction that has transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(iii)   not be subject to any defences to recognition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    There must be commonality of the parties to the prior proceedings and to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    The subject matter of the estoppel must be the same as what has been decided in the prior judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65    With respect to the requirement at [64(a)(ii)] above that the <b>court giving the foreign judgment must have transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound</b>, this requirement has been defined in terms that <b>the forum court recognising the judgment must be satisfied that, according to its own rules of private international law</b>, <b>the foreign court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction in the “international sense”</b> to render that judgment (<em>Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v PT Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19731-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 5 SLR 1322</a> (“<em>Humpuss Sea Transport</em>”) at [71]; <em>The Republic of the Philippines v Maler Foundation and others and other appeals</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 1 SLR 1389.xml')\">[2014] 1 SLR 1389</a> (“<em>Maler Foundation</em>”) at [66]). <b>There are four possible grounds of jurisdiction: (a) presence in the foreign country; (b) filing a claim or counterclaim before the foreign court; (c) voluntarily submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court by appearing in the proceedings; and (d) agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction before the commencement of proceedings</b> (<em>Humpuss Sea Transport at [71]; Sang Cheol Woo v Spackman, Charles Choi and others <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29049-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC 298</a> (“Sang Cheol Woo”) at [57]).</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     In the present case, none of the four possible grounds of jurisdiction noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>Deutsche Telekom AG</em> (see above) applied such that a judgment in Israeli Suit 2 would be one which “<em>originate from a court of competent jurisdiction that has transnational jurisdiction over the party sought to be bound</em>”. The Wife had no presence in Israel, did not file any formal claim or counterclaim in Israeli Suit 2, nor did she agree and/or voluntarily submit to the Israeli court’s jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that allowing D 249 to proceed would not create multiplicity of proceedings. Insofar as Israeli Suit 2 sought to divide the parties’ matrimonial assets, that decision was made in the Wife’s absence, and she is entitled to proceed with the AM Proceedings in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I do not find there to be a need for a permanent case management stay to be granted as a result of Israeli Suit 2. To avoid doubt, nothing in my decision precludes the Husband from raising the outcome of the Israeli Suit 2 to the Singapore court hearing the AM Proceedings, or for the Wife to apply to set-aside any judgment rendered in Israeli Suit 2 (if she so wishes).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     As regards Israeli Suit 1, the subject matter of that action pertains to the parties’ <em>pre­</em>-marital assets. It is trite that the spouses’ pre-marital assets are not matrimonial assets over which the Family Court has the power to divide under s 112(1) of the WC. That being the case, the 1<sup>st</sup> Israeli Judgment may well be a matter which could be raised to the court hearing the AM Proceedings in Singapore, but it was not a decision which would result in a multiplicity of proceedings, or might give rise to inconsistent judgments if the AM Proceedings continue in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relevance of the Israeli Barring Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Before I leave the issue of the Israeli Proceedings, I want to briefly address an order issued by the Israeli Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     On 10 February 2024, the Israeli Family Court issued what the parties referred to as a “Barring Order”. In effect, this Barring Order was akin to an anti-suit injunction prohibiting the Wife from conducting “<em>property proceedings</em>” in a jurisdiction other than in the Israeli court. Both parties accept that the Barring Order would cover D 249.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     At the conclusion of the first tranche of the hearing of SUM 930, I directed both parties’ counsel to file further written submissions on the relevance and impact of the Barring Order <em>vis-à-vis</em> SUM 930.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     It was common ground in both counsel’s written submissions that while the existence of the Barring Order was something which this Court can consider in the overall analysis of the case, this Court was not bound to follow the Barring Order, save that it may give rise to a consideration of international comity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     In my view, any concerns as regards international comity in the present case may well be academic given that the Husband (in favour of whom the Barring Order was made) had taken the position – through counsel – that the proceedings in Israel were effectively over. Counsel explained that that Israeli Suit 2 had since completed with the Israeli Family Court issuing an order for the payment of monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In other words, there is now an alleged judgment debt due from the Wife arising from the Israeli court’s final determination of the “property dispute” in relation to Israeli Suit 2. How the Husband seeks to enforce that judgment against the Wife would be a separate matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Insofar as D 249 is concerned, the question before this Court is simply whether it should continue now that the Israeli Family Court had issued its decisions. In my view, this is not a matter which would impinge on, or overlap with, the Barring Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     In any case, whether the Wife is liable for breaching the Barring Order (if at all) would be a matter to be addressed in the Israeli courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s appeal against the Judgment in Israeli Suit 1</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     I move on to the next (and final) issue, <em>ie.</em> what, if any, would be the impact of the Israeli Appeal filed by the Husband’ against the Judge Yosef’s decision for Israeli Suit 1?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In my judgment, the Husband’s appeal is particularly relevant given that it was the Husband’s case, in Israeli Suit 1, that the Partnership Agreement between the parties operated as a pre-nuptial agreement (“PNA”). In the Husband’s Statement of Appeal to the Israel District Court, he requested the appellate court to intervene and hold that the Partnership Agreement also applied to property accumulated after marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This meant that if the Israeli appellate court eventually decides that the Partnership Agreement (and its 80:20 division ratio in favour of the Husband) also applied to post-marital assets, such an outcome may potentially have an impact on the Singapore AM Proceedings. This is because the enforceability of a foreign PNA entered into by the parties before marriage may be a relevant fact which the AM court in Singapore may take into account when it determines what would be a just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets: see for <em>eg. TQ v TR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0961.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     Put another way, the present case would be akin to a case where, in proceedings for ancillary reliefs before the Singapore court, one of the parties wishes to rely on the terms of a PNA governed by foreign law while the other party challenges the PNA’s validity. Where there are parallel proceedings in the foreign court to determine the validity and/or enforceability of the said PNA under the laws applicable to the contract, it is not uncommon for the Singapore court to temporarily stay the local proceedings to await the decision of the foreign court in order to assess whether the foreign court’s decision might impact how the assets are to be divided in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Both counsel have confirmed, via correspondence to the Court in October 2024, that the Husband’s Israeli Appeal remains pending. Given that the outcome of the appeal may have an impact on what the court hearing the AM Proceedings has to consider, I find it fair and reasonable to grant a limited case management stay of D 249 until the conclusion of the Israeli Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Over the course of various series of twists and turns in the progress of the Israeli Proceedings, the Husband’s position with respect to the present divorce proceedings have similarly meandered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     SUM 930 which was filed as an application for a stay of the entirety of D 249 on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> turned into to a partial stay of the AM reliefs <em>pending</em> the conclusion the Israeli Proceedings (per the Husband’s application to amend SUM 930), and finally to a request for a permanent stay because of the outcome of the Israeli Proceedings (per the Husband’s counsel’s submissions at the hearing of SUM 930).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     In the end, I ordered that there be a limited case management stay in respect of D 249 pending the conclusion of the Husband’s Israeli Appeal. This order was, in effect, similar to what the Husband had sought in his Prayer 1 of the amended FC/SUM 930/2023, <em>ie.</em> that the proceedings in FC/D 249/2023 are stayed pending the final decision of the Courts of Israel (Family court, District court, etc.) in relation to suit no. 60180-XX-XX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     However, given that the Husband was no longer seeking a temporary stay of proceedings and the entirety of the hearing of SUM 930 was focused on whether he was entitled to a <em>permanent</em> stay of D 249 (which I did not agree with), I found that the Wife was, in the overall analysis, the successful party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     When I delivered my oral decision on 21 October 2024, I asked both counsel to address me on the issue of costs which the Wife would be entitled to as costs should follow the event.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     In this regard, the Wife’s counsel sought costs in the sum of $8,000, excluding disbursements. The latter would include the costs of the Wife’s foreign law expert, and her counsel had proposed that a separate determination be made for the quantum of such disbursements if parties were unable to reach an agreement. The Husband’s counsel disagreed with the Wife’s claim, including whether the Wife was entitled to claim disbursements and costs relating to her foreign law expert.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    Given the parties’ disagreement, I directed both parties to file further submissions on the matter, which both counsel duly did so. Having considered the same, I find that the Wife’s claim for the costs of her foreign law expert in the sum of $36,624.78 to be very high. Given the nature and complexity of the issued which the Court had to consider, the contents of the expert’s report, and the lack of any breakdown or itemization, I am unable to agree with this figure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I therefore ordered costs be paid by the Husband to the Wife in the sum of $5,000 (inclusive of disbursements).</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>By Order made in FC/SUM 561/2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff-Wife’s Submissions dd 13.05.24 (“WS1”) at [47]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Defence and Counterclaim (Amnd No. 1) re-dated 18.09.23;

After a contested divorce, the issue of the division of assets came before me for hearing. I ordered for each party to keep their respective assets and for the Husband to pay cost fixed at $2,500 for the ancillary matters hearing. The Wife appealed against the entire order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties married on 15 December 2018 in Singapore and the Interim Judgment dissolving the marriage was granted on 2 October 2023. During the course of the marriage, both parties did not work. The Wife was about 32 years of age at the time of the hearing and the Husband was about 55 years of age. The Wife is a Chinese National residing in China whilst the Husband is a Singapore Citizen residing in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Prior to the marriage, the Husband transferred sums of money to the Wife and her parents. After the marriage, as the Husband had surrendered his passport to the authorities, parties lived together in the Husband’s HDB flat whenever the Wife was in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime around 18 May 2021, the Wife discovered the Husband had acted improperly with another lady. The Husband was then incarcerated a few days later (around 20 May 2021). They had little to no contact until the Wife served the divorce papers on the Husband in 2022. In the ancillary proceedings, the Husband sought the return of the monies from the Wife and the Wife claimed a share of the Husband’s HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband’s claim is based on the monies:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     he/his brother had transferred to his Wife and her parents between 1 February 2015 to 19 May 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     withdrawn from his China account between 20 September 2015 and 31 January 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Totalling: CNY2,744,794.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       He claimed there was an agreement/understanding between the parties that the above sums were for investment purposes and he sought a recovery of 50% of the amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife resisted the Husband’s claim on the basis that the monies were gifts to her and disputed the existence of any agreement. In any event, the Wife submitted that the Husband’s claim is a civil claim and cannot be claimed as a division of matrimonial assets pursuant to a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife claimed a 30% share of the Husband’s HDB flat on the basis of her indirect contributions during the marriage. The Husband resisted this claim on the basis that the HDB flat was acquired by him prior to the marriage and therefore not a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s claim for 50% of the monies with the Wife </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Husband clarified at the first ancillary hearing on 23 April 2024 that he sought the Wife’s repayment of 50% of the sum referred to in paragraph 5. He claimed that the monies were for investment and the Wife had purchased a property in China (which was meant to be their matrimonial home) as well as banking products from such monies. He claimed 50% repayment of the principal invested amount and claimed this was fair since he is sharing this equally with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Transactions set out in tables 7.1 and 7.8 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife conceded that the transfers set out were received/taken save for Table 7.1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SN 16: a transfer of CNY500,000 to the Wife’s mother on 20 July 2018</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SN 15: cash savings of S$60,000 withdrawn from the Wife’s UOB account on 19 May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     For SN 16, the Husband’s evidence was on page 78 of his 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit. However, page 78 contains what appears to be a screenshot of a mobile message in Mandarin save for 2 names, which did not appear to belong to the parties. The message was not translated and the Husband was clearly aware of the requirement for evidence to be translated as he was reminded of this by me during the contested divorce trial wherein some of his evidence was expunged for the lack of translation. The alleged transfer in SN 16 is therefore unproven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     For SN 15, the Husband referred to pages 51 and 52 of his Affidavit of Assets and Means. The 2 pages contain translated messages between the Husband and Wife around 28 October 2018. Firstly, the message occurred years before the alleged timing of the transaction in SN 15 and secondly, the messages only reflected the Wife’s initial impression that she could not withdraw monies from a Singapore bank account in China. There is no supporting evidence to prove that during the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife’s UOB bank account contained S$60,000 which belonged to him; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such amount was withdrawn by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Therefore, SN 15 is also unproven.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the remaining amounts which the Wife admitted to, she explained they were monies given to her by the Husband, her boyfriend at that time, for financial support and as gifts. They had an ongoing relationship where she was fully supported by him financially and these monies were just given to her or instructed by him to be withdrawn by her for her own use. There were no instructions from the Husband about investments and she was free to deal with the funds as she wished as they were gifted to her. She explained she used the funds for her living expenses as well as her parents’ living expenses and also did some investments (in which she suffered losses). In any event, she submitted that these monies do not form any matrimonial asset since all transactions occurred prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Applicable law on the division of matrimonial assets</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Family Court has the power to divide matrimonial assets upon a divorce. The definition of matrimonial assets is defined in section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter. The case of <em>USB v USA and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24645-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 57</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>USB v USA</em>”) is instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“18    Examining the above provision, it is clear that the intention of the legislature was to confine the court’s powers of division to <em>assets relating to marriage</em>. It is established law that in determining the legislative purpose of a provision, primacy must be accorded to both the text and statutory context of the legislation: <em>Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [43]. As a starting point, the title of s 112 of the Charter states that the provision deals with the “[p]ower of court to order division of matrimonial assets”, <em>ie</em>, assets relating to marriage. Further, s 112 falls under Pt X of the Charter which, on the whole, pertains to matters relating to the dissolution of <em>marriage</em>. In the Charter, Parliament made the decision to confine the court’s power to divide assets belonging to divorcing parties to those they acquired during marriage. This was a matter of social policy, and one clearly within Parliament’s purview. The court cannot and should not wade into matters of social policy where the legislature has established a clear statutory framework providing for the division of assets relating to <em>marriage</em>. <b><em>It is, thus, axiomatic that the court must disregard assets which were acquired during pre-marital cohabitation or during any non-marital relationship. The ownership of such assets would have to be determined in accordance with general property law principles.</em></b> It should further be emphasised that in determining the length of a marriage, the court ought not to take into account the period during which parties were cohabiting. Marriage confers a legal status on the parties which carries with it specified rights and obligations. For non-Muslim couples who marry in Singapore, their marriage begins when they satisfy the various statutory prescriptions which the Charter sets out for the attainment of that status. The Charter governs all aspects of civil marriage and divorce in Singapore. Thus, under our law, it is inherently self-contradictory to treat parties as “married” when they were simply cohabiting.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original omitted; emphasis added in bold italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband’s claim is not on any of the Wife’s existing assets/investments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, although he made reference to the existence of them, which shows she has hidden assets that can meet his claim<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and/or corroborates his case that there was an agreement/understanding to invest. Majority of his claim is based on transactions that occurred prior to the marriage. The exceptions are SN 15 (which is unproven) and SN 10. For SN 10, there were 3 transfers from the Husband’s brother (allegedly to return a loan to the Husband) totalling CNY 80,000.00 (S$16,000) into the Wife’s account in 2019. The Husband’s consistent case throughout the hearing was to recover investment monies based on an alleged agreement formed prior to the marriage between parties. This is not a claim that can be made pursuant to the Court’s ancillary powers in divorce proceedings. Notwithstanding the Husband’s claim that they were already planning to marry then and he treated her as his wife, it is the conferment of the legal status through a valid marriage that satisfies the relevant statutory requirements that parties can avail themselves of the marital rights and obligations set out in the Women’s Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I therefore made no order, based on the Husband’s claim although he is at liberty to take up other appropriate actions for the relief he sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s claim for 30% share of the Husband’s HDB flat</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It is undisputed that the HDB flat in question is solely owned by the Husband and was fully acquired by him prior to the marriage. The Wife sought a 30% share of the HDB flat based on her indirect contributions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In paragraphs 15-18 of her Affidavit of Assets and Means, she confirmed she made no direct financial contributions towards the flat and listed her indirect non-financial contributions during the marriage, which I summarise to be broadly to be,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when she stayed with the Husband in Singapore for short periods of 1 to 2 months at a time between December 2018 to 2019 and then for one year period between 2020 to 2021, she provided companionship and comfort to the Husband; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     when in China, she provided companionship and comfort to the Husband via WeChat calls and messages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means, she did not initially make any claim on the Husband’s HDB flat. The claim was first made in the Wife’s second Ancillary Affidavit. There was no further evidence detailing the Wife’s contributions. Little ink was spilled in the Wife’s written submissions on this claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I first considered whether the HDB flat is a matrimonial asset as it was clearly acquired before the marriage. Section 112(10) provides for the inclusion of assets acquired prior to the marriage as matrimonial assets if transformed. Again, the case of <em>USB v USA</em> at paragraph 19 offers guidance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    “Transformed matrimonial assets”: we use this term to denote assets which were acquired before the marriage by one spouse (or, more rarely, by both spouses), but which have been substantially improved during the marriage by the other spouse or by both spouses, or which were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. Once transformed, the whole asset goes into the pool but if there is no transformation then, subject to (c) below, any asset acquired before the marriage even if acquired by both parties would be dealt with in accordance with general principles of property law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Parties did live in the HDB flat, as their home whenever the Wife was in Singapore notwithstanding the short marriage. In the case of <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19114-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1172</a>, ordinary use and enjoyment cannot be occasional or casual:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">18    I found that the Bayshore property was ordinarily used by both parties for shelter and, therefore, a matrimonial asset. The requirement of ordinary use would not be satisfied if the parties’ use of or stay at the property was “occasional or casual”: <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> at [23]. Examples of casual residence are staying in a property for no more than 21 days out of 14 years of marriage (<em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0647.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 647</a> at [60]) or on only two occasions throughout the marriage (<em>JAF v JAE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19032-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 717</a> at [15]). On the present facts, even if I had accepted the Husband’s submission, residence in the property for 15 months is sufficient to constitute ordinary use for shelter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In the current case, parties lived together in the HDB flat during the marriage for about 23 months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> based on the Wife’s own evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. This was the only residence they lived together during their marriage as the Husband could not travel. There were multiple earlier attempts by the Husband to try to obtain longer residential passes for the Wife in Singapore, which supported the probability parties intended to make Singapore their home base. There were no indications that the HDB flat was meant to be a casual or temporary residence pending further plans to move to a more permanent home. I therefore made a finding that the HDB flat is a transformed matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of a solely acquired matrimonial asset in a short childless marriage</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In the case of <em>TNL v TNK</em> and <em>another appeal and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>TNK v TNK</em>”), the Court of Appeal clarified that the approach set out in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (hereinafter referred to as “<em>ANJ v ANK</em>”) will not apply to single income marriages. The Court of Appeal confirmed the approach for long single-income marriages albeit leaving the considerations for short Single-Income marriages open:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">48    In <em>long</em> Single-Income Marriages, the precedent cases show that our courts tend towards an equal division of the matrimonial assets. We are in general agreement with this approach. We pause to highlight that different considerations may attach in <em>short</em> Single-Income Marriages, although we propose to leave that issue to be dealt with in an appropriate case in the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In the current case, neither party worked during the marriage. However, the Husband was clearly the sole financial provider during the marriage. I am of the view that the same principle why <em>ANJ v ANK</em> methodology should not be used for single-income marriages would similarly apply in this case to unduly favour the Husband as explained in <em>TNL v TNK</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">44    Our reconsideration of the <em>ANJ</em> approach in the context of Single-Income Marriages stems from the fact that <em>ANJ</em> approach tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse. This is because financial contributions are given recognition under <em>both</em> Steps 1 and 2 of the <em>ANJ</em> approach. Under Step 1, the working spouse in a Single-Income Marriage would be accorded 100% (or close to 100%) of direct contributions. He or she would also be accorded a substantial percentage under Step 2 solely on the basis of his or her indirect financial contributions, and this could well be the case even if he or she made little or no non-financial contributions. On the other side of the equation, this means that the non-working spouse is, in this sense, doubly (and severely) disadvantaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Whilst for long single-income marriages, division tends towards equal division, this cannot be similarly applied to short marriages. Although decided before <em>ANJ v ANK</em> and <em>TNL v TNK</em>, the Court of Appeal held in <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/53472-M.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR 729</a> non-financial contributions in a short childless marriage will be minimal:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">28    Having excluded Malvern Springs from division, we now turn to consider the division of the matrimonial home. <em>In a short and childless marriage, the division of matrimonial assets will usually be in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions as non-financial contributions will be minimal.</em> Thus, in <em>Wang Shi Huah Karen v Wong King Cheung Kevin</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 2 SLR(R) 0172.xml')\">[1992] 2 SLR(R) 172</a>, a case where the wife left home after a year, the High Court divided the matrimonial home solely in accordance with the parties’ direct financial contributions. In the present case, it has been established that the direct financial contributions of the parties to the matrimonial home are in the proportions of 64:36 from the Husband and the Wife respectively. The Wife rightly did not make a claim for any non-financial contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added in italics]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the current case, I find the non-financial contributions claimed by the Wife to be minimal in view of the short marriage, especially bearing in mind the Husband’s incarceration and lack of contact since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I therefore awarded the Wife no share in the HDB flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Neither party succeeded in their claim in the ancillary matters hearing. However, I awarded costs of $2,500 in the Wife’s favour given that hearing time was almost entirely spent on the Husband’s claim. I also took into account the fact that the Wife took up a belated application to file a further affidavit after the matter was fixed for ancillary hearing.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Set out in Table 7.1, the first set of SN 1 to 17 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Set out in Table 7.8 of the Husband’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband orally submitted on 10 July 2024 that he does not plan to claim investment returns but only to get back his investment principal.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s oral submission on 16 July 2024 that paragraphs 10.2 to 10.4 of his 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit is to prove the Wife’s accounts have money which she has hidden but his claim is 50% of what was transferred to her.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Paragraph 10 of Wife’s 3<sup>rd</sup> AM Hearing Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>There was an error in the timeframe in my brief reasons but nothing turns on this error.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 17 of the Wife’s 4<sup>th</sup> Affidavit</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Guardianship of Infants Act – Shared custody, care and control – Access"],"date":"2024-12-31","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OSG 12/2022","title":"XGE v XGF","citation":"[2024] SGFC 109","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F32684-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mrs Quah Li Hwee Patricia (Patricia Quah & Co) for the plaintiff","Mr Tan Hock Lay Robin (Robin Tan & Co) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2025-01-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Cassandra Cheong","html":"<root><head><title>XGE v XGF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XGE <em>v</em> XGF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32684-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 109</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OSG 12/2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">31 December 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Cassandra Cheong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Mrs Quah Li Hwee Patricia (Patricia Quah &amp; Co) for the plaintiff; Mr Tan Hock Lay Robin (Robin Tan &amp; Co) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XGE — XGF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Guardianship of Infants Act</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Shared custody, care and control<sup></sup></span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Access</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">31 December 2024</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Cassandra Cheong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was essentially an application by the Plaintiff Father (“the Father”) for joint custody and shared care and control of the child of the marriage (“C”).

She sought for joint custody, with sole care and control to herself and supervised access to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       There were also prayers for maintenance of the child which were heard subsequently.

It is worth noting, however, that the Mother did not appeal against my decision to grant the Father overseas and overnight access to C during the gazetted school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Parties met sometime in February 2016 and were married two years later in Singapore on 5<sup>th</sup> October 2018. They have only one child to the marriage, C born on xx June 2020. At the time of the hearings, C had just turned 4 years of age. After marriage, parties lived together with the Father’s parents and sister at the Father’s family home (“the family home”). It is not disputed that the Father comes from a traditional, Chinese patriarchal family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Sometime in 2016, parties sought the approval of the Father’s father (“the Grandfather”) to marry prior to the demise of the Mother’s mother, who was terminally ill. Their request was rejected by the Grandfather. According to the Mother, the Grandfather was often critical of the Mother, her family and their finances. To exacerbate matters, the Mother and the Father’s family had differing family values and practices, especially in relation to the upbringing of C, which resulted in increased tension within the family home. The Father inevitably found himself caught between both sides of the family overtime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 6 April 2021, a dispute arose between the Mother and the Grandfather during dinner, when the Grandfather told the Mother to shave C’s hair. C was about 9 months old at the time. According to the Father, prior to the incident, the Grandfather had on numerous occasions advised parties to shave C’s hair, in keeping with Chinese tradition, but the advice went unheeded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     When the Mother refused, an argument broke out at the dining table and the Grandfather threw a spoon on the table in the direction of the Mother. The Grandfather also threatened to cut C’s hair himself if the Mother did not do so. Following the incident, as she was afraid that the Grandfather would carry through with his threat, the Mother urged the Father to move out of the family home. They eventually moved out a few days later to stay with the Mother’s father at his flat, together with C. However, about two weeks after moving into the flat, the Father returned to his family home to live. According to the Father, the Mother’s father had express unhappiness with the Father for failing to provide for the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Although the Father returned to his family home to live, it is not disputed that he continued to visit the Mother and C on a daily basis, from about 8.00 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. to help take care of C and perform his duties before C fell asleep. He would bring with him necessities, groceries and food for the Mother and C. On Saturdays, parties would bring C over to the family home to visit the Father’s family and on Sundays, the Father would go over to spend time with C in the morning until her naptime after lunch. During her naptime, he would return home until the Mother called to inform him that C was awake. Parties would then bring C out together to visit attractions, playgrounds, parks or the library until after dinner. This arrangement lasted until 7 January 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident on 7 January 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 7 January 2022, during the Father’s visit, the Mother found the Father locked in the common toilet together with C at the flat. The Mother knocked on the toilet door repeatedly until the Father opened the door. To her horror, the Mother saw that C’s fringe had been snipped by the Father who was holding onto a pair of kitchen scissors. According to the Father, prior to 7 January 2022, the Father had noticed that the C’s fringe was getting longer to the point of irritating her eyes. He advised the Mother to trim C’s fringe, but nothing was done. As such, he decided to give C a quick trim. Shaken by the incident, the Mother called her father for assistance and the Father was asked to leave the flat by the latter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident on 11 January 2022</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After the incident, there was no communication between parties until 11 January 2022. As the Father had not seen C since the incident, he requested to visit the child around 7.30 p.m. and was informed by the Mother to visit the child after 8.30 p.m. Unknown to the Mother, the Father’s family accompanied him on this particular visit as the Father had decided on separating from or divorcing the mother, and they wanted to discuss with the Mother and her father care and access issues relating to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     During the discussion, the Grandfather proposed for each party to have the child live with them for 3.5 days a week. It is not disputed that this discussion took place largely between the Grandfather and the Mother’s father for about an hour, with little or no input from the parties themselves during the discussion. When asked whether she agreed to the proposed arrangement, the Mother refused. Dissatisfied with the Mother’s response, the Grandfather told the Mother that he would call the police (which he promptly did) since the Father is entitled to 50% of the week with the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On 14 January 2022, the Father sent messages to the Mother requesting to bring the child out to the parks and the zoo alone. The Mother replied stating that she was not agreeable to the Father taking C out without her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 16 January 2022, the Mother sent a message asking the Father to see a counsellor together with her. She also informed the Father that he could visit the child as usual at her father's flat but he could not bring C out without her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On 17 January 2022, while at work, the Father learnt from his parents that the Mother had applied for a personal protection order against the Father, his parents and his sister and they had just been served with the Summons for the application. This led to the Father doubting the Mother’s intentions to co-parent C equally with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Propelled by the above incidents, the Father filed the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applications for Personal Protection Orders (“PPOs”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother instituted applications for PPOs for herself and for C against the Father and the Father’s family, the details of which is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS x2/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father’s sister on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 1 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS x3/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father’s mother (“the Grandmother”) on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 1 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_c\"></a>(c)     SS x4/2022 filed by the Mother against the Grandfather on 14 January 2022. I heard the matter and dismissed the application on 20 April 2023. There was no appeal against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_d\"></a>(d)     SS x5/2022 filed by the Mother against the Father on 14 January 2022. This was withdrawn on 8 August 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for Supervised Visitation and Counselling at a Divorce Specialist Support Agency</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     After the commencement of this Originating Summons, at a case conference on 16 February 2022, parties agreed for the Father to have supervised access to C at a Divorce Specialist Support Agency (“DSSA”) for 2 hours weekly. This was without prejudice to parties’ position taken in the main application. Parties were also referred for mediation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The supervised visitation sessions carried on for about 8 sessions between March to May 2022 (“1<sup>st</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”) and a report from the DSSA was furnished to court, recommending (i) that parties attend co-parenting counselling and (ii) subject to the consent of the paternal grandparents and the Father, counselling for the paternal grandparents to negotiate and manage their boundaries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     From the court’s perspective, given the disruptive nature of the relationship between parties and the extended family at the time, the recommendations were aimed at equipping parties and the paternal grandparents with the necessary tools required to support and enable parties to co-parent effectively for the benefit of C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     As parties were unable to reach an agreement at mediation, at the case conferences on 30 May 2022 and 16 November 2022, parties agreed for supervised access to continue at the DSSA. The aim was to facilitate the Father’s continued access to C, pending the outcome of the Mother’s PPO application against the Father. The access carried on for about 8 sessions between August to December 2022 (“2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”) and a further 8 sessions between January to June 2023 (“3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I also ordered parties to attend counselling to work on their co-parenting skills and, subject to the consent of the paternal grandparents, for the paternal grandparents to attend counselling, as recommended in the report. In view of the nature of the relationship between the Father and the paternal grandparents, and how the Father would often defer to the opinion of the paternal grandparents, particularly the Grandfather, I found it necessary for the paternal grandparents to learn the importance of holding boundaries in order to assist and support the Father and Mother in their efforts to co-parent C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     A report from the DSSA was again furnished to court after each tranche of supervised visitation orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     After the 2<sup>nd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, a report from the DSSA was furnished to court, recommending for a 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation to be ordered. This was to enable the Father and C to continue bonding and for the Father to receive parenting modelling and intervention during the supervised visitation sessions at the DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The report further recommended that the paternal grandparents be included in the supervised visitation sessions so as to (i) provide the paternal grandparents with information on grandparenting and (ii) support the family in defining boundaries through modelling and psycho-education during the supervised visitation sessions, such as not undermining the Father's parental role. Simultaneously, the Father was recommended to attend the “Triple P Programme” to gain parental skills and confidence in bonding with C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Orders were made in accordance with the recommendations and a report was submitted to the court by the DSSA thereafter, recommending for a 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation to be ordered and for counselling to continue for the parties and the paternal grandparents to explore the possibility of re-communication between parties and their extended families on child related matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     It was noted from the report that the paternal grandparents were present for 4 out of the 8 supervised visitation sessions for the 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche, and only during the second half of each session. It was further noted that following the counselling sessions and interventions received during the 3<sup>rd</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, the Father was better able to maintain his parental role and exhibited firmness on what he wanted to do with the child for each session, notwithstanding the Grandfather's differing opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Parties voluntarily agreed to a 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation being ordered, with the cost of the supervised visitation being borne by the Father solely. It is worth noting that the Mother was amenable to the participation of the paternal grandparents in the second half of all 8 sessions. At the case conference on 10 April 2023, orders were made accordingly with the consent of the parties. The access carried on for about 8 sessions between June to September 2023 (“4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Apart from supervised visitation orders at the DSSA, the Father also filed interim applications for access to the child outside of DSSA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order for Chinese New Year Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 4 January 2023, the father filed an application in FC/SUM x4/2023 for the following orders, <em>inter alia</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For access to C on Chinese New Year Eve and the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 10.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m., together with the Father’s family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For additional weekly supervised access to C, outside of DSSA, every Wednesday from 4.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m. Access to be supervised either by the Father’s two domestic helpers or the Child Representative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     For one-way supervised exchange to take place at noon every Saturday at DSSA, so that the Father may have supervised access to C outside of DSSA. Access to be supervised either by the Father’s two domestic helpers or the Child Representative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Given the short time frame between the Father’s application and the Chinese New Year period, I heard parties on the application for supervised access during Chinese New Year first. On 13 January 2023, after hearing parties, I gave orders for the Father to have supervised access to C on Chinese New Year Eve at the DSSA from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. I also allowed the paternal grandparents to be present during the access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the 1<sup>st</sup> day of the Chinese New Year, the following orders were made with the consent of parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Father shall be granted access to C on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from 10.00 am to 1.00 pm at Hillion Mall located at 17 Petir Road, Singapore 678278 (“Hillion Mall&quot;) as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Defendant shall handover the Child to the Plaintiff outside the premises of McDonald's located at level B1 of Hillion Mall;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The access shall take place in accordance to the Schedule of Itinerary appended to the Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       In the event of any unforeseen changes to the itinerary proposed in the Schedule of Itinerary hereinabove, the Plaintiff shall keep the Defendant informed of any changes to the itinerary before proceeding to the venue of access in accordance with the amended itinerary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father's parents may be present at all times during the Plaintiff's access to the Child as stated above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is at liberty to observe the Father's access on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of Chinese New Year from a distance as long as the Mother's presence does not interfere with the Father's interactions with C during the said access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     At the end of the Father’s access, the Father shall hand over C to the Mother outside the premises of McDonald's.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The orders made above are without prejudice to any application by the Mother for the Father to have supervised access to C at the hearing of the main application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_f\"></a>(f)     All other prayers in this Summons to be adjourned for further hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     There was no appeal filed against the Orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for additional weekly access and appointment of parent coordinator</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As mentioned earlier, FC/SUM x4/2023 was filed on 4 January 2023. After making the relevant orders in relation to Chinese New Year access, the remaining prayers were adjourned to be heard at a later date. This was to give the Mother time to file her affidavit in reply to the rest of the orders sought by the Father and for parties to file their submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As C was only three years of age at the time of the Father’s application, I indicated to parties that the appointment of a child representative may not be suitable, given her young and tender age. There was a real concern as to whether C was of the developmental age to be able to express her wishes to a child representative effectively in relation to the care and access arrangements sought by parties. The Court further queried if the appointment of a parent coordinator would be more appropriate in the circumstances to facilitate parties in their co-parenting efforts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In view of the Court’s indications above, the Father subsequently amended his application for the appointment of a parent coordinator to assist in the access arrangements with C. I noted that the main intention of the Father was to have a neutral party (i.e. someone other than the Mother or a person from the Father’s household) to supervise the interim access to C. This was because of the Mother’s insistence on supervised interim access pending the hearing of the main application and the submission of the Custody Evaluation Report (see paragraph 45 below).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The main purpose of a parent coordinator is to assist parties in their co-parenting arrangements and to help parties communicate better and grow in their co-parenting skills. The hope at the end of the day is enable parties to function effectively, without the need of a parent coordinator, in their roles as co-parents. Given the tensions between parties in the present case, it was clear that if the Father was to have access to C outside of DSSA, parties would benefit from the appointment of a parent coordinator. It is unusual however for a parent coordinator to supervise access. Nevertheless, I note in the present case that the Father had obtained the consents of the proposed parent coordinators, Mr T and Ms X, both experienced and established family lawyers, to assist in the supervision of interim access to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On 23 September 2023, the Father and the Mother attended the hearing together with their counsel. After hearing parties and taking note in particular of the Mother’s financial constraints and parties’ submissions in relation to the apportionment of the fees payable to the parenting coordinator, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Mr T is appointed parenting coordinator in this matter (the “Parenting Coordinator”) for an initial duration of 4 months from the date of this order, which may be extended by further order or agreement between the Father, the Mother and the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Parenting Coordinator shall accept or decline the appointment by filling up and returning to the Court the “Notice of Acceptance / Non-Acceptance”. In the event that the Parenting Coordinator does not submit the “Notice of Acceptance / Non-Acceptance” within 3 days of the Court notifying the Parenting Coordinator of the order, the Parenting Coordinator is deemed to have declined the appointment. Ms X or another parenting co-ordinator will be appointed in place of the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Parties shall pay their share of the parenting coordination fees directly to the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Court allocates payment of fees for parenting coordination as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Father will bear 100% cost of the first 1-hour joint session and 80% of any joint session thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Mother will bear 20% of the joint sessions thereafter, with the Father bearing 80%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Any solo sessions with the parent coordinator is to be borne by the parties respectively and the parties are at liberty to decline such solo sessions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The parties must, as far as practicable, provide to the parenting coordinator copies of all pleadings, documents and/or orders as may be requested by the parenting coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The parenting coordinator may meet with the parties and/or C together or separately, in person or by any electronic means for a total number of 16 hours including the 1<sup>st</sup> joint 1 hour session held by the parenting coordinator, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Parties agree that they shall not hold the parenting coordinator liable for any damage or loss that they may incur in the course of or arising from the parenting coordination process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     With regard to the Father’s application for additional weekly access, the following orders were also made at the hearing:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In addition to the supervised access at the DSSA, the Father shall be granted interim access to the Child in the presence of the Parenting Coordinator on alternate Wednesdays from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. at any one of the following locations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Bukit Timah Plaza</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Bukit Panjang Plaza</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       West Mall Public Park</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Hillion Mall</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Subject to the consent of the Parenting Coordinator, parties agree that the interim access shall take place at all times in the presence of the Parenting Coordinator.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father and, subject to the consent of the Parenting Coordinator, the Parenting Coordinator shall pick up C from C’s childcare centre and return C thereafter to the Mother's residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Father's parents, sister and helpers are not to be present during the interim supervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Parties are at liberty to change the terms of access by mutual agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In making the above orders, I took into consideration the fact that there were times when access at the DSSA had to be rescheduled as C and the Mother were unavailable (e.g. due to illness). This resulted in the Father having irregular access to C. As such, I granted the Father an additional supervised weekly access day to C outside of the DSSA. Parties did not appeal against the orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Order for Custody Evaluation Report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     On 31 March 2023, the Father filed FC/SUM xxx1/2023 for an order that a Custody Evaluation Report be submitted to address the suitability of parties being granted shared custody and shared care and control of C, or alternatively, that the Father has unsupervised and overnight access to C. I heard the application on 19 June 2023 and granted the orders sought. The Mother did not appeal against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Custody Evaluation Report was subsequently submitted to the Court on 4 October 2023, recommending that joint custody and shared care and control of C be granted to parties. In particular, that the Father be granted unsupervised overnight access from Mondays 17:00 hours to Thursdays 09:00 hours every alternate weeks, and from Thursdays 17:00 to Monday 09:00 hours every other week. It further recommended, <em>inter alia</em>, that both parties be at liberty to take C overseas for recreational purposes from age 5 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Parties were promptly informed briefly of the findings and recommendations of the Custody Evaluation Report at the next case conference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders for Supervised Exchange at DSSA</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Pursuant to the 4<sup>th</sup> tranche of supervised visitation, a report was submitted to the court by the DSSA recommending, <em>inter alia</em>, for the Father to have supervised exchange to C, subject to the following conditions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First two supervised exchange sessions between the Father and C to take place for 3 hours. The Father is to pick C from the Mother at the DSSA and return C to the Mother at a mall near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The subsequent six sessions between the Father and the child to take place for up to 4 hours, with liberty for the paternal grandparents to be present. The Father is to pick C from the Mother at the DSSA and return C to the Mother at a mall near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the supervised exchange sessions, the Father is to spend time with C at either his house, a mall, a library, a playground or a mutually agreeable venue near the Mother's house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Photographs and videos during the supervised exchange time to be taken by the Father and sent via the WhatsApp GroupChat (set up between parties and the caseworker/counsellor) to keep the Mother updated and to ensure C's safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_e\"></a>(e)     If there were signs of physical exhaustion in Child, Father is to inform Mother to pick up Child earlier than 3-4 hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_f\"></a>(f)     If the first three supervised exchange sessions were successful, the next five sessions can be done without the Mother having to bring Child to the DSSA for drop-off. Father and Mother can exchange the Child near their houses and inform the caseworker/ counsellor via WhatsApp GroupChat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although parties were largely agreeable with the recommendations made by the DSSA, the Mother objected to the Father bringing C back to his home during access as she was still concerned about the paternal grandparents influence on the Father and C, particularly the Grandfather, given her past experience and interactions with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On 7 November 2023, after hearing counsels’ submissions on behalf of parties and considering the recommendations of the DSSA reports, the following orders were made:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties to attend 8 sessions of supervised exchange, to take place at the DSSA as in accordance with the recommendations stated in the report, subject to the following variation to the recommendations: that at least the first three sessions of supervised exchange and access is to take place with the father and child alone for 3 hours. With regard to the venue for access, the counsellor is to work this out with the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother to attend Family Transition-Positive Parentings Programme (FT-Trip P). Parties to attend any other therapy or counselling session or programme as recommended by the caseworker/counsellor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father shall have access to the child on Christmas Day from 11.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. with liberty to the paternal grandparents to join the access session.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Given that this was the 5<sup>th</sup> tranche of orders to be made, costs were payable by parties. The Grandfather volunteered to bear the costs for the supervised exchange sessions. As parties had no objections to the same, orders were made accordingly with the Grandfather’s consent. The supervised exchange sessions took place from December 2023 to April 2024. A further order for another 8 sessions of supervised exchange was subsequently made with the consent of parties on 11 April 2024. The 8 sessions took place from May to July 2024, which overlapped with the hearings of the main application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Legal Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122) states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot; Where in any proceedings before any court, the custody or upbringing of an infant or administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is clear that the overriding and paramount principle is the welfare of the child. In <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> [1991] SLR 93, the Court of Appeal made the following observations in relation to the ‘welfare principle’ when custody is fought for:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Obviously the court has to take all relevant factors into account in considering the welfare of the children… We agree with counsel for the appellant that some of the relevant factors are these:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    the conduct of the parties;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   the wishes of the parents and the wishes of the child where he or she is of an age to be able to express an independent opinion;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   a young child would be best look after by its mother;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   which party can offer better security and stability; and,</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(v)    that siblings should not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We also agree that the fact that one parent is more capable of providing material comfort for a child does not necessarily render that parent a better parent and thus entitles him or her to the custody of the child. In the final analysis it is an exercise in weighing the relevant factors which often conflicts.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Shared Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In considering whether shared care and control would be in the child's welfare, it was held in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a>, that the court has to consider factors such as that particular child's needs at that stage of life, the extent to which the parents are able to co-operate within such an arrangement and whether it is easy for the child, bearing in mind his or her age and personality, to live in two homes within one week. The court should also be concerned with whether both parents can support a two-home arrangement with sufficient co-operation so that there is minimal conflict over issues that ordinarily arise from daily living.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Supervised Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     With regard to whether a parent's access to a child ought to be supervised, it was held in <em>APE v APF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16869-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 17</a> that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…unsupervised access should be awarded, unless the following exceptional circumstances are present:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    there are serious welfare concerns regarding the noncustodial parent such as violence or inappropriate parenting if the child were left unattended with the noncustodial parent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    on an examination of the state of the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child before the commencement of the divorce proceedings and after the commencement of the divorce proceedings, it is found that the child has been estranged from the noncustodial parent such that the parental-child relationship is in need of serious repair (for instance, if the child is fearful in meeting the non-custodial parent); or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    factors exist such that it is difficult for unsupervised access to be effectively implemented (eg, where the relationship between both parents is so acrimonious that the custodial parent frustrates the effectiveness of unsupervised access orders and unsupervised access is not possible without detriment to the child).&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Court in the above case went further to state at [33] that even if the child should view the non-custodial parent in a fearful or negative light, the Courts should nevertheless seek to repair the parent-child relationship where the circumstances permit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     With regard to whether there are serious welfare concerns in relation to the non-custodial parent, it was noted by the Court in <em>BKJ v BKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0261.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 261</a> at [23]-[25] that there must be a reasonable basis for the allegations of abuse or danger, and a mere unsubstantiated fear or suspicion is insufficient to justify supervised access. In that case, the Court found that while the Defendant Mother did not think much of the Plaintiff Father’s parenting skills, there was no evidence that the Plaintiff’s parenting skills were so very bad that the child would be in danger of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applying the Law to the Facts of the Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue of Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As parties agreed on joint custody, the issue in relation to care and control was whether the Court should grant sole care and control of C to the Mother, or shared care and control to parties in the present case. Although no appeal is made against my decision for sole care and control to be granted to the Mother, for totality I briefly set out my reasons why I did not grant shared care and control in the present case despite the recommendations of the custody evaluation report set out at paragraph 45 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Applying the law as set out in <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22070-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 11</a> to the facts, I found that C was still of a tender young age. At the time of the hearing, she had turned 4 years of age only recently, on 13 June 2024. It is not disputed that the Mother has been the primary caregiver of C since birth. Uprooting a young child, like C, every 3-4 days to live in two different households would be overly disruptive for her development since young children require a familiar and secure environment to grow in and seek refuge in when confronted with the challenges of growing up. To exacerbate matters, given the differences between parties in their values and approaches to parenting, if shared care and control is ordered, a sense of dislocation may result where C is torn between two households where there are competing primary caregivers and approaches to her upbringing. (<em>AQL v AQM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0264.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 264</a> at paragraphs [17] to [19].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Regarding the Father's concern about sending the wrong signal to the Mother if shared care and control was not granted, I did not agree with the Father’s submissions that the effect of not granting such an order would be the Court acceding and condoning the Defendant's alleged selfish acts of wilful assertion of her authority over the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As highlighted in <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20688-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 213</a> at [75], the court would not give much weight to any potential signalling effect of a shared care and control order. Any signalling effect is dealt with by the custody order. In this case, the granting of joint custody will signal the important role that both parents play as persons with parental authority in making decisions in relation to the child. On the other hand, care and control orders are mainly concerned with the practicalities of day-to-day care of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue of Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In relation to the issue of access, I note that the Mother did not appeal against my decision to grant the Father unsupervised access. It was clear from the evidence provided before the Court and the various reports submitted, that there were no issues of serious welfare concerns regarding the Father, such as violence or inappropriate parenting if C was left unsupervised in his care. I note furthermore that the relationship between C and the Father was not estranged, such that it needed reparation and supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother’s main contention pertains to specific orders relating to weekly overnight access and public holiday access (excluding access during Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year) as per the orders made on 23 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ submissions on overnight and public holiday access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     At the hearing on 17 July 2024, the Mother objected to the Father’s application for overnight access as C was still of a young age - she had just turned 4 years old. C has also been sleeping with the Mother since birth and latches to the Mother at night before she sleeps. Further, whenever C wakes up in the middle of the night, she is soothed back to sleep by the Mother. Thus, it would be traumatic for C to spend the night alone with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father on the other hand submitted that notwithstanding the above, he believed that C, who attends childcare, would be able to adjust easily to spending overnight access with him at his family home. He noted that C displayed no signs of upset or distress during the supervised exchange sessions that took place at his family home. Evidence was also provided by the Father to show that he had taken steps to make the family home suitable for overnight access to take place, such as by preparing a room for C, complete with a child’s bed, toys and a toddler-sized table with chairs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In relation to Public Holiday access, I note from the Mother’s affidavits filed and both written and oral submissions made to the Court that, apart from the major public holidays like Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year, no specific orders in relation to Public Holiday access were sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The Father sought for Public Holiday access to be specified so as to avoid conflict between parties in terms of the access arrangements. Excluding Chinese New Year, Christmas and New Year, the Father specifically sought for access to be granted to him on the following Public Holidays:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)     National Day;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Good Friday;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Deepavali and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Vesak Day</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Court’s Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I commend the Mother and Father for their efforts in encouraging C to build and maintain her relationship with both parents. I noted from the reports that C is a happy child who is comfortable spending time with the Mother, Father and her extended family. There are no signs of triangulation of the child between parties, notwithstanding the breakdown in the relationship of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     In view of the above, although I did not grant the Father shared care and control of the child, I allowed him overnight access to C upon C turning 5 years of age. I noted from the evidence and the reports that the Father was able to care for and bond with C independently in the absence of the Mother. I noted further from the case authorities provided by parties that overnight access was usually granted upon the child turning 5 years of age. There was no reason in the present case not to grant the Father overnight access to C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I was not persuaded by the Mother’s submission that overnight access would disrupt C’s breastfeeding routine or that such an order would be traumatic to C. Since the order for overnight access was to begin only upon C reaching the age of five, I did not find the order for overnight access to be disruptive to C’s current breastfeeding routine. Time was factored in for the Mother to assist in the adjustment of C to the overnight access arrangements. Furthermore, I noted from the evidence of parties and the reports submitted that C was comfortable being alone with the Father. There was no evidence in the affidavits of C exhibiting any separation anxiety from the Mother. As such, I did not think that an order for overnight access upon C turning 5 years of age would cause the child unwarranted trauma.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     From the Mother’s affidavit and submissions against shared care and control, it was clear that the Mother was also concerned about the overbearingness of the Grandfather and the impact it would have on the Father and C, if C was to live at the Fathers’ family home. These concerns would apply as well if overnight access was to be ordered. However, I found these concerns to be speculative. While the Grandfather may have exhibited domineering behaviours towards the Mother, there is no evidence of such behaviour being exhibited towards the child. More importantly, I note that the Father is now better able to hold his ground and parent the child confidently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Since C would have regular weekly access to the Father on Wednesday (4.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.) and Friday (4.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.) and almost the entire day Saturday from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., to allow parties to transition smoothly to overnight access, I allowed the Father to have overnight access to C from Friday, 4.30 p.m. to Sunday 9.30 a.m. This would ensure regularity for C and allow the Mother to have one day as well on the weekend with C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     In relation to the orders for Public Holiday access, I noted that there were no objections from the Mother to the Father’s request at the hearings. As such, given that C would be with the Mother on the remaining three Public Holidays (namely Labour Day, Hari Raya Puasa and Hari Raya Haji) as understood by parties at the hearing, orders were made accordingly for the Father to have access to C on the requested Public Holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding Remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     This is a case where the relationship between parties unfortunately broke down due to the tension in the relationship between a newly established family unit and the extended family members. It is clear from the incidents set out in the affidavits that, while all involved had good intentions towards the child, the differences in values and approach in parenting amongst them resulted in hostility and acrimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     While it is true that the Mother and Father are the main persons responsible for their co-parental relationship, it is undeniable that the co-parental relationship is subject to challenges especially in situations where one party may be inextricably dependent on the emotional and psychological support provided by the extended family, unfortunately to the exclusion of the other party. For the co-parental relationship to be effective, it is therefore necessary for all parties involved to learn the importance of boundaries and equip themselves with the skills necessary to help build and support the co-parental relationship for the benefit of C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Nevertheless, I commend parties in the present case for their continued efforts in working on their co-parental relationship and I would like to encourage both parties to continue to create an environment where C may be able to benefit from having access to the love and support of both the maternal and paternal families in her life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     I would also like to commend both counsels who represented parties in this matter for working tirelessly to help parties work out the care and access arrangements throughout the duration of this matter for the benefit of C.</p> </div></content></root>"}]
