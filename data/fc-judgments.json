She contended that, prior to the commencement of divorce proceedings, the Husband had already agreed to pay this amount in maintenance, in addition to separately covering other expenses. However, he later reduced the amount to $10,000/month. Following mediation, the maintenance was further reduced to $8,000/month. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband disputed the Wife’s account. He maintained that it was the Wife who had initially demanded $13,000/month, and who subsequently proposed a reduction to $10,000/month. The Husband stated that he had suggested that the parties monitor the actual expenses incurred by the Wife and the son before reaching a mutually agreed amount. He further explained that he had agreed to pay interim maintenance of $8,000/month solely to secure the Wife’s withdrawal of (a) her maintenance application (MSS 1174/2024), and (b) her application for a personal protection order (SS 1056/2024).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I reject the Wife’s reference to the pre-trial discussions in support of her case. I wish to take this opportunity to express my concern with such references in general.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a matter of general principle, such discussions are conducted on a “without prejudice” basis and are therefore inadmissible in determining the substantive issues before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This principle holds particular significance in the family justice context, where the Court adheres to the framework of therapeutic justice. Therapeutic justice promotes reconciliation and encourages the amicable resolution of disputes as the preferred way forward. For this approach to be effective, parties must be able to engage in pre-trial discussions openly and candidly, without fear that their statements may later be used against them in litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To reference such discussions in submissions is to undermine the very foundations of therapeutic justice. It erodes trust between parties, heightens adversarial tension, and detracts from the goal of preserving relational stability. If parties are discouraged from speaking freely during pre-trial discussions, the prospects for healing, resolution, and meaningful cooperation post-divorce will be significantly compromised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I shall now consider the Wife’s application for spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10      <em>Threshold requirements</em>.

At the material time, she had felt unsafe remaining in Hong Kong due to the widespread violence and civil unrest arising from the protests against China. (The Wife is a Chinese national.)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I find the Husband’s evidence to be plausible. The large-scale protests in Hong Kong during 2019 and 2020 – marked by significant violence and civil unrest – were widely reported in the media. The unrest stemmed from, among other things: (a) opposition to an extradition bill that would have permitted the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China; (b) alleged misconduct by the Hong Kong Police Force; and (c) broader tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China. The situation was serious enough for Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue an advisory against non-essential travel to Hong Kong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In light of these circumstances, there were reasons for the Wife to wish to relocate to Singapore in 2020. Accordingly, the fact that she gave up a high-paying job in Hong Kong cannot, on its own, be regarded as a strong basis for awarding spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has the Wife stopped working for the past five years</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Next, I consider whether the Wife has, in fact, been unemployed during the past five years: see [12(a)(ii)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Husband submitted that the Wife had remained employed by her former employer in Hong Kong (“<b>Hong Kong company</b>”) even after relocating to Singapore in 2020. This submission is based on the following.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In December 2024, the Husband observed a deduction from the parties’ joint account for the Mandatory Provident Fund (“<b>MPF</b>”) – a contribution scheme applicable to individuals employed in Hong Kong. When questioned, the Wife confirmed that the deduction was for her MPF contributions but declined to reimburse the sum, stating instead that she would pay it “next year,” thereby suggesting she intended to make further contributions. The Husband tendered WhatsApp messages relating to this exchange in evidence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In response to the Husband’s discovery requests, the Wife acknowledged that she had no resignation or termination letter from the Hong Kong company. She instead disclosed an email dated February 2025, in which the company indicated that her contract and rank would be temporarily maintained until January 2025, pending a further review of her performance. She also produced payslips from the company covering the period from September 2024 to February 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In addition, the Husband tendered banking and WeChat transaction records from late 2024 and March 2025, which showed that the Wife had continued to remit insurance premiums on behalf of clients to the Hong Kong company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Taken together, the above evidence supports the inference that the Wife had remained formally employed by the Hong Kong company for a period after relocating to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     That said, the evidence also suggests that while the Wife remained formally affiliated with the Hong Kong company, she was not gainfully employed in Singapore during this period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, her commission statements between September 2024 and February 2025 indicate that she had received insignificant income (averaging about $338/month) during this period.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> The income is primarily from the renewal of a handful of existing insurance policies (dating back to 2015 and 2018), rather than from new business activity.

He contended that the domestic helper was responsible for accompanying the child to school and enrichment classes, and that he himself had attended the child’s school meetings and birthday celebrations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I do not find the Husband’s assertions sufficient to displace the Wife’s evidence that she has been the son’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The mere fact that a domestic helper assisted with certain logistical tasks, such as bringing the son to school or enrichment classes, does not negate the Wife’s overarching caregiving role. It is common for parents to rely on domestic assistance, and the involvement of a helper does not, in itself, undermine a parent’s status as the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Likewise, the Wife’s absence from the son’s school meetings and birthday celebrations does not, in my view, indicate a lack of interest in his life. According to the Husband’s own evidence, the Wife refrained from attending these events due to her concern about her limited proficiency in English.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the Husband’s involvement in such events does not negate the possibility that the Wife undertook the day-to-day caregiving responsibilities. These include attending to the child’s daily needs, managing his routine, and providing continuous supervision and emotional support – tasks she was well positioned to perform, given that she was not gainfully employed during the relevant period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I have no reason to doubt the Wife’s evidence that she ceased working in order to be the son’s primary caregiver. This conclusion is supported by the following undisputed facts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband would not have been in a position to give reliable and direct evidence on the Wife’s daytime caregiving role, as he was likely occupied with work commitments during those hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, as noted at [21] above, the Wife has not been gainfully employed in Singapore since relocating in 2020. She would therefore have had the capacity to attend to the child’s daily needs and overall welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband had consented to the Interim Judgment granting the Wife care and control of the son. This indicates his acknowledgment that the Wife was the more appropriate parent to meet the child’s day-to-day emotional, developmental, and practical needs. See <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [67] to [69]; <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> at [72]. This acknowledgement is likely to have been based on, among others, the fact that she had been the son’s primary caregiver: <em>XDZ v XEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a> (“<b><em>XDZ</em></b>”) at [14(a)] to [14(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In summary, I find that the Wife had made significant sacrifices for the marriage by remaining a stay-home mother over the past five years to care for the son.

He contended that these funds could have been applied toward meeting her own expenses and those of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I make the following observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Withdrawal of $35,000.</em> I find that the $35,000 withdrawn by the Wife in May 2024 would likely have been substantially, if not entirely, depleted by the time of this judgment. The estimated monthly living expenses of the Wife ($3,800/month) and the son ($4,600/month) is approximately $8,400/month in total: see <b><u>Annex B-2 (18)</u></b> and <b><u>Annex C (24)</u></b>. The $35,000 would have covered just over four months of their expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>ORSO Fund</em>. The Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance (“<b>ORSO</b>”) is administered by the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, Hong Kong’s statutory body overseeing both MPF and ORSO schemes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> In my view, the ORSO fund should not be treated as a readily available resource for the purposes of assessing the Wife’s ability to support herself post-divorce. The fund is a form of retirement savings subject to statutory restrictions on withdrawal under Hong Kong law. There is no evidence to suggest that the Wife is currently eligible to access the funds, nor that early withdrawal is permitted without penalty. It would be inappropriate and unfair to require her to rely on funds earmarked for her long-term financial security – particularly where she lacks other stable sources of income and is still in the process of re-establishing economic independence. As such, I do not consider the ORSO fund to be a disposable asset that can be considered when determining the necessity or quantum of spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Huizhou apartment</em>. According to the Wife, the apartment will need renovations before it can be rented out to generate income. I have no reason to disbelieve her evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Hong Kong BCT Fund</em>. This is a pension fund and is thus illiquid.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Excluding the ORSO Fund, the Huizhou apartment, and the Hong Kong BCT Fund – none of which are presently liquid or readily realisable – the Wife’s disposable assets amount to approximately $174,271.03. This sum represents her share in the matrimonial asset as provided under the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In my view, it is not reasonable for the Wife to rely solely on this amount to meet her living expenses post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As of the date of this judgment, the Wife is 47 years old. The average life expectancy for women in Singapore is approximately 85 years. This means that she may have nearly four decades ahead of her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Based on the evidence before the Court, I estimate the Wife’s personal living expenses to be approximately $3,800/month, or $45,600/year: see <b><u>Annex B-1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex B-2</u></b>. If she were to rely exclusively on her disposable assets ($174,271.03) to cover these expenses, these assets will likely be exhausted in fewer than four years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Can the Wife find employment in Singapore</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <u>Ability to work</u>. Does the above analysis mean that the Wife is entitled to spousal maintenance? The short answer is no. The law does not presume that a wife is entitled to spousal maintenance solely because she is unemployed. Section 114(1)(c) of the Women’s Charter 1961 expressly requires the Court to consider her “earning capacity” in determining whether maintenance should be ordered. Thus, a wife who claims that she is unable to work must prove this claim. For instance, if the inability to work is claimed on medical grounds, then she must adduce relevant and persuasive medical evidence to support her case: see e.g., <em>UWM v UWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26780-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGCA 105</a> at [26]. Likewise, if a wife contends that she cannot work because she needs to care for her child, then she must show (a) why the child’s needs preclude her from working, (b) that she has explored all reasonable alternatives, and (c) that none of these are viable: <em>TYS v TYT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21175-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 5 SLR 244</a> at [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <u>Efforts to secure employment</u>. Where the wife is assessed to have earning capacity, the Court will examine whether she has made genuine and sustained efforts to seek employment. Mere token attempts or an unduly narrow search – such as limiting applications to certain industries or roles – will not suffice: <em>TXU v TXV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19957-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 19</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35      <u>Estimated income</u>. The Court will also consider what the wife could reasonably be expected to earn upon re-entering the workforce. This involves an assessment of factors such as (a) her academic and professional qualifications, (b) her age, (c) her employment history, (d) her previous income, and (e) prevailing market conditions. See <em>ANZ v AOA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0243.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 243</a> at [71] and [72] (considerations for assessing earning capacity); <em>CYH v CYI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29284-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 4</a> at [63] (wife’s earning capacity assessed to be higher than her last drawn salary one year before her unemployment); <em>WGJ v WGI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29413-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 11</a> at [36] (wife’s earning capacity pegged to the last drawn income one year before her unemployment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <u>Possible outcomes</u>. When determining an application for spousal maintenance, the Court may adopt one of several approaches, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Reject the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>This is appropriate where there is no need to mitigate the financial impact of the divorce on the wife or to redress any financial disadvantage arising from the marriage.

She had previously worked as a freelance Chinese language teacher in Hong Kong, held the position of financial advisor and unit manager at the Hong Kong company, and had also established a business selling veterinary diagnostic products.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is a Singapore Permanent Resident and has been taking English lessons since 2010. The Husband highlighted that her email correspondence with the German Embassy was written entirely in English, which, in his view, contradicts her claim of limited English proficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As for her assertion that she suffers from various health issues – such as gastritis and breast lumps – and requires regular medical attention,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> the Husband pointed out that no supporting medical evidence has been tendered to show that these conditions impair her ability to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband further submitted that, despite their separation in June 2024, the Wife has made minimal efforts to secure employment in Singapore. He emphasised that she previously earned over $18,000/month between April 2018 and March 2019. Even accepting that her earning capacity may now be reduced, he estimated that she should still be capable of earning approximately $9,000/month, which would be more than sufficient to meet her monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence before me, I find that while the Wife may face some challenges in re-entering the workforce, these do not render her unemployable. Her educational qualifications, prior work experience, and past earnings indicate that she possesses marketable skills. The fact that she had previously held managerial positions and operated a business reflects a degree of professional competence and entrepreneurial initiative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Although the Wife has cited age, language barriers, and health concerns, there is insufficient evidence to establish that these factors substantially impair her ability to work. Notably, no medical reports have been produced to substantiate her claims of ill health. As for her English proficiency, the evidence (e.g., her correspondences) shows that she is functionally literate in English.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That said, I accept that the Wife has been out of full-time employment for several years and may not be able to command the same income she once earned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Considering the Wife’s qualifications, work history, the duration of her employment gap, as well as the relevant salary guides and information,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> I estimate her current earning capacity to be in the range of <b>$3,500 to $4,000/month</b>. This is a conservative approximation that recognises both her professional background and the challenges she may face in re-entering the job market after several years as a homemaker.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Spousal maintenance is appropriate</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Time is needed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In my view, the key issue is not whether the Wife is capable of securing employment in Singapore, but how much time she reasonably requires to attain full financial independence. My assessment on this point is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It would not be reasonable to expect the Wife to resume employment immediately. She will require time to identify suitable work opportunities. If she intends to leverage her prior experience by returning to the insurance or financial advisory industry, she must first undertake and pass the requisite regulatory examinations, and obtain the necessary certifications and licences. This process will inevitably take time and preparation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     More significantly, the time required for the Wife to return to work is influenced by the needs of the son, whose welfare remains the Court’s paramount consideration. At 12 years of age, he is entering a formative phase of adolescence and is likely to still require close care, guidance, and supervision. The transition from being cared for by a stay-home mother to adjusting to her working outside the home is one that must be managed carefully to minimise disruption to his well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s assets will be depleted quickly</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my assessment, the Wife’s expenses are likely to increase during the transition from being a stay-home mother to becoming fully economically self-sufficient. She will need to incur costs associated with preparing for re-employment, including expenses for professional certification or licensing, transportation to attend job interviews, and possibly enrolling in refresher courses. In addition, she may need to engage childcare support to supervise the son while she attends to examinations, training, or work-related commitments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The assets identified at [28] above represent the Wife’s sole source of financial security. These resources are finite and will likely be depleted during her transition to full-time employment. There is no evidence to suggest that the Wife has access to alternative sources of familial or financial support in Singapore during this period, or in the event of an emergency. The available evidence indicates that her parents reside in China and the Husband now resides in Thailand. This absence of a support network may place significant stress on the Wife, which in turn could adversely affect the welfare of the son – whose well-being remains the primary consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Maintenance is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, fairness to the Wife and the best interests of the son support the granting of short-term spousal maintenance. Such an order –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Gives due recognition to the sacrifices the Wife made during the marriage by serving as the son’s primary caregiver over the past five years: see [26] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Affords the Wife a reasonable period to re-enter the workforce and regain financial independence: see [44(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Cushions the emotional and practical impact of the transition on the son, who is entering a formative stage of development and adjusting to the Wife’s shift from a stay-home to working parent: see [44(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Preserves the Wife’s limited capital from premature depletion, thereby protecting her long-term financial security: see [45] and [46] above; <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> at [44]; <em>ATE</em> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     To summarise – A limited maintenance order will provide the Wife with essential transitional support as she works toward resuming economic self-sufficiency. At the same time, it reflects the principle that spousal maintenance is not meant to be indefinite, particularly where the recipient is capable of regaining financial independence with time and effort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Duration of the maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The next question is how long the spousal maintenance should last. In my view, a period of <b>two years</b> is appropriate in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     This duration will provide the Wife with a reasonable window to adjust to her post-divorce circumstances, including her transition to full-time employment while continuing to care for the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     By the end of this period, the son will be approximately 14 years old – an age at which he is likely to have developed greater maturity and independence, thereby easing the practical demands on the Wife as a working parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A two-year term is also proportionate when viewed against the length of the marriage, which spanned approximately 15 years. Courts have generally regarded short-term maintenance within such a context as fair and reasonable: <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance amount</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I shall now turn to the next issue – the appropriate quantum of spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having considered the evidence, I find the Wife’s reasonable monthly expenses to be approximately <b>$3,800</b>. In arriving at this figure, I have excluded several items from her stated list of expenses on the basis that these are more appropriately met from her existing personal funds. The amount of $3,800 comprises her share of household expenses, transport costs, and basic personal needs such as toiletries: see <b><u>Annex B-1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex B-2</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife’s estimated earning capacity should be sufficient to meet these expenses over time: see [43] above. However, in the interim, a short-term maintenance award is warranted to provide financial stability while she re-establishes her income stream.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband can afford</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my view, the Husband has the financial means to provide the Wife with monthly maintenance of $3,800.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on his tax returns,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> the Husband’s average monthly income (after tax but before CPF deduction) from Company A is $30,364.20.

I urge you to have more confidence in your abilities. The evidence clearly shows that you can understand and read English.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> You have also previously drawn a strong income in Hong Kong. With determination and perseverance, I am confident that you will be able to secure suitable employment in Singapore. I encourage you to have confidence in your abilities and to take active steps toward financial independence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     You may also have concerns about how your son will adjust to you becoming a working mother. Such concerns are natural. However, children are generally resilient, especially when they are supported by loving and consistent parenting. You can contribute to his development – not only by being present, but also by modelling the values of perseverance and responsibility through your own actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the Husband</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Divorce inevitably entails disruption and adjustment for all parties. Your former wife faces the difficult challenge of transitioning from a stay-home mother to a working parent. Your son, in turn, must adapt to having less time and attention from his primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_d\"></a>(d)     These transitional challenges can be softened if both parents adopt a cooperative and equitable approach to post-divorce parenting. As the financially stronger party, your willingness to support your former wife through this limited period of spousal maintenance can make a significant difference. The maintenance ordered is not indefinite – it is a temporary, transitional measure aimed at enabling her to regain financial independence and ensuring continuity and stability for your son during this sensitive period.

Months before his most recent birthday, he penetrated the vagina of his then-10-year-old sister with a pencil. He admitted to three further acts against her: once penetrating her vagina with his finger and twice committing other acts of indecency with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       For the act of penetration with a pencil, the youth was found guilty of a charge of sexually penetrating a minor within s 376A(1) of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed). For the other three acts, each of which constituted an offence within the Penal Code or the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”), the youth consented to having them taken into consideration in the formulation of the dispositional orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Upon this finding of guilty, the Prosecution urged me to immediately commit the youth to a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (a “JRC”) for 36 months and objected to any assessment of his suitability for any other order. It submitted that he had preyed on a young and vulnerable victim and had while doing so understood the wrongfulness of his acts. It added that the gravity of the offence meant that “the most appropriate punishment is the maximum term of detention in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre as that would best give effect to the principles of deterrence and retribution while serving the aims of rehabilitation.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The power of the Youth Court to seek an assessment of the suitability of an offender for different dispositional orders is found in s 47 of the CYPA. Thereunder, it may obtain “information” on the background and state of development of the youth to equip it to formulate orders that are in the best interests of that youth: s 47(9) of the CYPA. To do so, it calls for a report of “a probation officer, an approved welfare officer, a registered medical practitioner or any other person whom the Youth Court thinks fit to provide a report on the child or young person”: s 47(10) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found it premature to immediately commit the youth to a JRC for 36 months purely because he had committed a grave offence. Such a term would have been the maximum that I could have imposed: s 49(1)(i) of the CYPA. But the paramount consideration in these proceedings was not the gravity of his offence but his welfare and best interests: s 4(b) of the CYPA. Determining this welfare and best interests “would depend on his prospects of rehabilitation under the different sentencing options”: <em>WLK v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29618-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 22</a> at [10]. To facilitate this determination, I called for a report of an investigating probation officer, who would in preparing that report collate information on the family background, general conduct, home surroundings, school record, medical history and state of development of the youth: s 49(10) of the CYPA. This determination would then be enriched by the insights of two advisers from a panel of advisers appointed by the President whose roles were to “inform and advise” the Youth Court when a report had been prepared in respect of a youth: s 38(1) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Mr Adriel Tham, an investigating probation officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development, prepared that report. Mr Tham assessed that the youth had anti-social proclivities that, if left unaddressed, would likely lead to further offending. These proclivities included theft, underage smoking, physical aggression, and incestuous behaviour. Exacerbating these proclivities was his general defiance of authority and his inability to abide by structure or routine. Worse, his mother, who was his primary caregiver, lacked the capacity to supervise him. In these circumstances, Mr Tham concluded that the rehabilitation of the youth was best served by committing him to a JRC for 24 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Prosecution did not disagree with the assessment of Mr Tham that a 24-month placement in a JRC would conduce to the rehabilitation of the youth. But it maintained that the gravity of the offence had been committed justified a 36-month placement in a JRC. It argued that even as rehabilitation was a key focus of the Youth Court, this focus &quot;can be diminished or eclipsed by considerations of deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant&quot;. It urged me to give effect to such deterrence and retribution by imposing the &quot;maximum term of detention&quot; in a JRC because the offence involved &quot;predatory behaviour <em>vis-à-vis</em> vulnerable victims&quot;.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The parents of the youth admitted that they had struggled and would struggle to supervise him in the community. They therefore accepted that it was in his best interests to place him in a JRC. Nevertheless, they asked that this placement be limited than 24 months, within which time they hoped that he would change for the better. Unusually, they also asked to have his younger sister, who was the victim in the offence that was the subject of these proceedings, attend in court to watch the pronouncement of any dispositional orders in respect of the youth. They explained that this would allow her to see that justice had been done and facilitate her recovery from his acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I declined this request. There was no evidence that witnessing the pronouncement of dispositional orders for of the youth would facilitate his sister’s recovery from his offence. His sister was barely 11 years of age. It was doubtful that she possessed the maturity to understand these proceedings. Indeed, she did not even appear to have understood the significance of the act that was the subject of the offence. Her participation in these proceedings would be of scarce benefit to her. This would not conduce to her welfare or best interests. In any event, my focus in these proceedings was the welfare of the youth and not that of his sister. That welfare would not be furthered by publicising the proceedings in which dispositional orders were made for the youth, even if the publication was only to the extent of his sister. Citing s 46(1) of the CYPA, Amy Tung DJ in <em>Public Prosecutor v GFM (a minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29557-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGYC 4</a> observed that the law strives to insulate from stigmatisation youth offenders dealt with in the Youth Court (at [50]). In a related vein, s 10 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (2020 Rev Ed) provides requires that all matters and proceedings in a Family Justice Court, which includes a Youth Court, “must be heard in private”. Incongruous it would have therefore been to publicise these proceedings simply for a non-party to realise some benefit from watching the pronouncement of the youth’s deserts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Returning to the dispositional orders for the youth, everyone agreed that a stint in a JRC would promote his welfare and best interests. I had the same view. The youth struggled with behavioural issues that made impracticable his rehabilitation in the community. He had, since 2018, been placed on care and protection orders because of the harms that he presented to himself and others as well as the inability of his family to care for him. The most recent of these orders was made in December 2024 in the wake of his commission of the offence that was the subject of these proceedings. This order committed him to the place of safety that was the Singapore Boys’ Hostel pending investigations into that offence. There, he defied the staff, broke security features including locks, and fought with the other residents. He was then transferred to the Singapore Boys’ Home, which was at once a place of safety and a JRC, initially for his care and protection and subsequently on remand pending the resolution of these proceedings. There, he defied the staff, damaged the items that he had been issued, defaced the common property, and used abusive language on the other residents. These events suggested that it could be challenging to rehabilitate him even within a closed and structured environment like that of a place of safety. This left little optimism about his prospects for rehabilitation under such community-based dispositional orders as a probation order and necessitated his placement in a JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As for the duration of that JRC placement, I returned once again to the CYPA, which was the legislative framework that governed these proceedings. As the Prosecution highlighted, the offence that the youth had committed was amongst the gravest of all sexual offences. Had he been an adult, any concern for his rehabilitation would likely have been eclipsed by the public interest in retribution and general deterrence that would attract a stiff sentence of incarceration, as the Court of Appeal observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v CPS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32701-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 2 SLR 749</a> at [29]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">29    … rehabilitation will be readily displaced as the predominant sentencing consideration in the case of serious offences. It is also clear that serious cases of rape, such as that in <em>Hafiz</em> ([20] <em>supra</em>), involve such outrageous offending behaviour that rehabilitation has to be subordinated to a more serious form of corrective punishment (<em>Al-Ansari</em> at [35]). What the current jurisprudence does not prescribe (rightly so, in our view) is a rigid rule for cases of rape which do not immediately fall in the uppermost category of severity. The court is instead called upon to undertake judgment on a case-by-case basis to determine whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing calculus, which involves close scrutiny of the specific circumstances of the offence and the offender. In doing so, a broad heuristic offered by this court in <em>Mohd Noran</em> ([18] <em>supra</em>) is that as a general rule, neither probation nor RT is suitable in cases of rape (at [3]), and that where an offender is of mature age and understanding, a custodial sentence should be imposed in the absence of exceptional circumstances (at [2]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Still, the youth was not an adult. Rather, he was little more than a child. The law therefore <em>mandated</em> that he was charged with and tried for his offence by the Youth Court: s 39(1) of the CYPA. Here, the paramount consideration was the welfare and best interests of the child or young person before the court: s 4(b) of the CYPA; see also <em>WLK</em> at [10]. This consideration enjoined me to focus on the rehabilitation of the youth by formulating dispositional orders that addressed the causes of his offending and steered him towards productive pursuits. Indeed, the public interest lay in this focus on rehabilitation in the light of the characteristic impulsiveness of the youth’s adolescent decision-making and the benefit to society from his reform given the years that he had ahead of him: <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I found wisdom in the recommendation of Mr Tham, the investigating probation officer, to place the youth in a JRC for 24 months. As Mr Tham explained, this period would comprise 12 months of rehabilitation programs followed by 12 months of reintegration programs. During the first 12 months, the youth would undergo three months of assessments to determine the risks that had to be addressed and his capacity for education. The next nine months would equip the youth with offence-specific skills to manage the causes of his offending, general skills to function productively in society, and habits and routines that conduce to independent living. This would be followed by 12 months of reintegrative programs, which could include the milestones of day release and home leave, for the youth to practice independent living in the community with those skills. An excellent description of these reintegration programs and the year-long post-care support for a resident of a JRC is found in Lim Hui Min, <em>Juvenile Justice in Singapore: Rehabilitation, Reintegration, Restoration</em> (Academy Publishing, 2023) at paras 7.33–7.39:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.33  Residents can aim to achieve certain milestones. The milestones are progressive, in that if the resident does well at each milestone, he or she can be considered for the next one. These eventually lead the placement on reintegration programmes and trials in the community. meaning that the resident can spend time outside the Home, in school or at work, or in his or her own home. This system gives the residents ownership over their rehabilitation by giving them goals to aim for, which lead to family and community reintegration and a restoration to ordinary life outside the youth justice system. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.34  Home leave is a reintegration programme to allow residents to build bonds with family members and prepare them for living in a family setting. During home leave, the residents can go back home to see their families over the weekend while observing a curfew which is usually from 10.00pm to 6.00am. Their friends can also come over to see them, and they can go out to see their friends. Before the residents are allowed to go on home leave, the caseworker will discuss with them and their families what ground rules should be set for this period (for example, when they are allowed to be out with their friends, how far ahead of time they should let their parents know that they are going out, what chores they are expected to help out in at home), and ways that the family can spend time together (for example by watching TV and having a meal together).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.35  If the residents do well in the Home and have completed the various programmes in their individual care plans, they can go on to the Day Release Scheme. This Scheme allows residents to leave the Home in the day to pursue their studies or employment outside the Home and return to the Home after school or work. On weekends, the resident can be granted home leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.36  Before going out into the community, the resident would have been taught self-management skills such as emotional regulation, rational thinking, budgeting, time management and self-control. The caseworker and Youth Guidance Officer will also address critical areas with the resident such as how to manage temptation (<em>eg</em>, the temptation to take drugs, drink alcohol, break curfew, commit offences), and problem-solving, for example resolving conflict with peers without resorting to fighting, or saving no to friends who are a bad influence For example, the resident can be asked to do a role-play where the Youth Guidance Officer plays a friend who asks him to play truant from school. The resident will practise responding, and will be given tips on how to respond in the right way, and also to think of the consequences of whatever decision he might take, for example to think about who he would let down by skipping school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.37  The idea of the Day Release Scheme, which the resident can be on after achieving a diamond banding, is to support the residents progress towards discharge and eventual integration back into the family and society. If the resident does well on the Day Release Scheme, he or she can be considered for the Readiness for Community and Home Scheme provided there is a stable and conducive living arrangement for him or her, with adequate adult supervision. Under this Scheme, residents can return to their own homes full-time, though they would have to observe a curfew. They would still have to meet with their caseworkers, and show good progress at school or work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.38  Whenever necessary, psychologists from the Clinical and Forensic Psychology Service of the MSF will provide a specialised risk assessment to examine specific risks or mental health issues that the resident may have. This may provide additional information to that contributed by the resident's multi-disciplinary team to determine the resident's suitability to be placed on the Day Release Scheme and the Readiness for Community and Home Scheme.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.39  There is a post-care support service for residents discharged from [a JRC], which lasts for a year. The purpose is to help the youths re-integrate into the community, and sustain the skills they learnt and the good habits they formed during the time of their orders. The service starts six months prior to the resident's discharge. During this time, the post-care worker (from an appointed social service agency) builds rapport with the resident and his or her family. Upon the resident's discharge, the post-care worker continues to work with him or her for one year. The frequency of interactions is tailored to the individual risks and needs of the youth. The post-care worker will give the youth and his or her family support and encouragement, link the youth to schools, employers, and interest groups, or community resources for financial or social service needs, and help him manage and resolve any difficulties early.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Prosecution submitted that, even apart from retribution and deterrence, a 36-month placement in the Singapore Boys’ Home was justified because it would benefit the youth, who had struggled to adapt to its structure while remanded there during these proceedings. It argued that notwithstanding Mr Tham’s recommendation of a 24-month placement, a 36-month placement would provide more time for the rehabilitation and the reintegration programs there to operate. But a longer placement in a JRC should not be imposed if a shorter placement there will secure the rehabilitation of a young offender. The Youth Court seeks to act with parsimony in that it will avoid imposing severe orders and onerous conditions where less severe and onerous ones will sufficiently rehabilitate the offender. I reproduce the observations of Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>M Raveendran v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27671-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 1183</a> at [55]–[56] endorsing the application of judicial parsimony in the Youth Court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">55    For completeness, I should state that the rejection of the parsimony principle as a general sentencing principle does not mean that it should not, in limited and appropriate circumstances, be applied. An example is where an accused is a young offender as was observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v ATW (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGJC 0002.xml')\">[2011] SGJC 2</a> at [3]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <b>Fundamental Considerations</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Juvenile Court seeks to act with judicious parsimony with juveniles in that it [does not seek] to impose severe orders and onerous conditions where less severe and onerous ones are sufficient. Since this is so, and to pursue rehabilitation and restoration, probation is generally the preferred option.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">56    It must, nevertheless, be reiterated that the principle does not apply whenever the accused person is a young offender. Due regard must be had to whether the circumstances personal to the accused in question call for a less intrusive punishment to be imposed. I respectfully consider that this was correctly articulated in <em>Public Prosecutor v GCB (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22932-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGYC 1</a> as follows (at [3]–[4]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <b>General Principles</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3    The Youth Court … focuses primarily on finding rehabilitative measures and solutions that are most workable for the juvenile, given the facts and circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">4    Such an approach cannot mean that a less intrusive or less severe option such as probation is always chosen, as though every juvenile would be entitled to it by virtue of his youthfulness. The court may generally prefer a parsimonious approach, favouring less intrusive and less severe options wherever possible.[*] But it has ultimately to ensure that the order chosen would be one that best serves the interests of the young offender before it. More rigorous orders will have to be imposed where they are needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[* footnote 3] I am aware of what has been expressed in <em>Than Stenly Granida Purwanto v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22402-M.xml')\">[2003] SGHC 200</a> limiting application of the principle of parsimony. The pronouncements, however, were in the context of dealing with adult offenders, not juveniles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphases removed]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     By the time of these dispositional orders, the youth had spent over three months under care and protection and/or in remand in the Singapore Boys’ Home. This period should have accustomed him, even if imperfectly, to the environment there. Taking account of the assessment of Mr Tham, I found that a further stint there of 24 months would best serve the welfare and interests of the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For completeness, in <em>CPS</em>, the offender who was 16 years of age at the time of his offence of rape was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. The Court of Appeal found that the gravity of the offence alone had displaced the presumptive focus on rehabilitation that arose from the youth of the offender in favour of the public interest in retribution and deterrence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Here, the youth was not far in age from the offender in <em>CPS</em>. Nor was his offence overly dissimilar in gravity to that of the offender in <em>CPS</em>. Nevertheless, that difference in age between the youth and the offender in <em>CPS</em>, even if it was only a year or two, was not immaterial. Because the youth had yet to attain 16 years of age on the date of commencement of the hearing of his charge, the law mandated that he had to be tried for his offence by and only by the Youth Court: s 39(1) and (6) of the CYPA. In doing so, s 4(b) of the CYPA required the Youth Court to have as its paramount consideration the welfare and best interests of the youth, which consideration fell to be determined by reference to his prospects of rehabilitation: <em>WLK</em> at [10]. The gravity of the offence, and the considerations of retribution and deterrence that the common law had found a heinous sexual offence to implicate, had to operate within this legislative framework.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Accordingly, I committed the youth to the JRC of the Singapore Boys’ Home for a period of 24 months forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I record my appreciation Dr Vivien Huan and Mr Muhammad Dzulkifly, the advisers whom with me constituted the Youth Court in these proceedings pursuant to s 38(1) of the CYPA, for their service and advice.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Children and Young Persons Act – Care and Protection Orders"],"date":"2025-06-19","court":"Youth Court","case-number":"Youth Court Appeal YA-0002-2025-01, Case No. CPO 000034-2022","title":"Father of XGK v Child Protector","citation":"[2025] SGYC 3","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33556-SSP.xml","counsel":["Child Protector in person","Parent in person"],"timestamp":"2025-07-25T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Wendy Yu","html":"<root><head><title>Father of XGK v Child Protector</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> Father of XGK <em>v</em> Child Protector </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33556-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGYC 3</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Youth Court Appeal YA-0002-2025-01, Case No. CPO 000034-2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 June 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Youth Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Wendy Yu </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Child Protector in person; Parent in person </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Father of XGK — Child Protector </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Children and Young Persons Act</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Care and Protection Orders</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 June 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Wendy Yu:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This appeal is brought by the Father, Mr B (“the Father”) of the child XGK, female, born on 27 July 2009 (“the Child”) against the final orders made on 19 June 2025 pursuant to an application brought by Child Protective Service (“CPS”), Ministry of Social and Family Development, Singapore (“MSF”) under Section 54 of the Children and Young Persons Act, Cap 38 (“CYPA”) for a review of an existing care and protection order (“the Application”). The mother of the Child, Mdm C (“the Mother”), had expressed her agreement in Court on 17 April 2025 to the making of orders as per the recommendations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The orders that I have made on 19 June 2025 (“the Final Orders”) are set out as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    [The Child] is to be placed under the supervision of an Approved Welfare Officer, under the care of Mr D and Mdm E, for a period of 6 months, with effect from 19 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    [The Father] is to comply with the following conditions, under section 54(8) of the CYPA:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    (a) [The Child’s] contacts with [The Father] and any significant others to be subject to the approval and review of the Approved Welfare Officer;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    [The Father] is not to do any act that will compromise the safety and well-being of [the Child];</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    [The Father] shall not publish or broadcast, through any means including on social media or the Internet, anything which directly or indirectly relates to or is the subject of the proceedings before the Youth Court;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    [The Child], [the Father] and any significant others to attend and participate in individual interviews, discuss safety plans and caregiving arrangements with the Approved Welfare Officer to ensure the safety and well-being of [the Child].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Professionals to release the medical, psychological, counselling and/or relevant reports of [the Child] and [the Father] to the Approved Welfare Officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    [The Father] and [the Child] are to be required to undergo any counselling/psychotherapy/assessment/programme/treatment as deemed necessary by the Approved Welfare Officer, and [the Father] shall execute a bond of $1,000.00 to comply with the order under Section 60(2), in accordance with Section 60(5) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I will now set out the grounds for the Final Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       CPS first took out an application on 4 December 2022, for a care and protection order after invoking Section 11(1) of the CYPA. The basis of their application was on Section 5(1)(d)(i) and Section 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA, that the Child has been, or is at risk of being ill-treated by the Father and that the Child behaves in a manner that is, or is likely to be, harmful to herself and the Father is unwilling to take necessary measures to remedy the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Social Report hearing was fixed on 9 May 2022, and CPS had recommended for, <em>inter alia</em>, an order for the Child to be committed to the care of the Fit Persons, namely her paternal grandparents, Mr D and Mdm E (“the paternal grandparents”), for a period of 12 months, with a review in 6 months. Besides the grounds set out in paragraph 4 above, CPS had added an additional ground in the social report, under Section 5(1)(g), that the Child was likely to suffer from emotional harm due to emotional or psychological abuse by the Father. The Mother had agreed to CPS’s recommendations on 5 May 2022. The Father disagreed with the recommendations and so the Court had fixed the matter for a Family Conference to allow a Family Court Specialist to facilitate the conversation between CPS and the Father and to address the Father’s concerns. After the Family Conference on 31 May 2022, the matter was resolved as CPS and the Father agreed for the Child to be placed under a statutory supervision order, under the care of the paternal grandparents for a period of 12 months, with a review in 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the review hearing on 30 December 2022, CPS had recommended for the Child to be committed to the care of the Fit Persons, namely, the paternal grandparents, for a period of 12 months as they were of the view that the Child continues to be in need of care and protection. The Father contested the recommendations. The matter was fixed for hearing on 6 July 2023 before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After hearing the matter on 6 July 2023, I had directed for a child interview on 4 August 2023 to be arranged for me to speak to the Child to ascertain her views. The Child was 14 years old then and would be mature enough to express her views about her living arrangements and her relationship with her Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After considering the Child’s views at the interview (which remained confidential) and the parties’ submissions, I had ordered, on 30 August 2023, for the Child to be placed under the statutory supervision of the Approved Welfare Officer, under the care of her paternal grandparents, for a period of 12 months (“the August 2023 orders”). I had also expressed to parties at the hearing that the August 2023 orders will give time for professionals to help mend the Father-daughter relationship and that CPS should work with the Father towards the ultimate goal of reintegration to the Father, as the Father continues to receive services from the professionals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Current Application for Review and CPS’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       CPS had subsequently requested for a review hearing on 30 August 2024 (“the Review Hearing”). The Child had turned 15 years old. CPS had recommended for the current order for statutory supervision to be extended for another 12 months. The matter was fixed for a contested hearing on 13 November 2024 (“the 13 November Hearing”) before me as the Father had objected to the recommendations. The Mother did not attend the 13 November Hearing as she had given her consent to the recommendations on 16 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For the 13 November Hearing, CPS had filed 2 affidavits, namely, the Affidavit of CPO Mr F dated 4 October 2024 and the Affidavit of CPO Ms G dated 30 October 2024. CPS had also filed their submissions dated 6 November 2024. The Father had filed 2 affidavits dated 11 September 2024 and 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">CPS’s Position at 13 November Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     CPS had submitted<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> that there has been no material change in circumstances since the August 2023 orders and that the Child remains in need of care and protection under section 5(1)(g) read with sections 5(2)(a) of the CYPA. CPS is of the view that the Child has suffered and continues to be likely to suffer from emotional harm because she has been subjected to emotional and psychological abuse by the Father, as the Father has subjected the Child to persistent acts of rejection or degradation that are harmful to her well-being or sense of self-worth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     CPS had contended that there remains a significant risk that the Father may subject the Child to further acts of emotional or psychological abuse if she is returned to his care at this stage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, which is shown by the Father’s confrontational behaviour during the access sessions between the Child and him, as well as the Father’s persistent acts of exposing the Child’s identity online.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     CPS has informed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> the Court that two of the six access sessions (on 27 February 2024 and 26 March 2024) had to be terminated early at the Child’s request. CPS has added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> that since the August 2023 orders, the Father had persistently compromised the Child’s well-being by revealing her identity as being subject of CPS’s investigations and of previous care and protection orders, both online and in public<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In particular, the Father had recorded the six access sessions between January and March 2024 without permission and uploaded them on YouTube and/or his website and uploaded a full, unredacted copy of his affidavit filed in previous Youth Court proceedings which contained various references to the Child’s name. The Father had contravened Section 111 of the CYPA by recording and uploading photos of his access sessions with the Child onto social media platforms and was given a 24-months conditional warning by the Police<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     According to CPS, the Child’s “emotions became very unstable, and that she felt nauseous and experienced chest tightness, after [the Child] had learnt of [the Father’s] uploading of videos.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 25 August 2024, it was also brought to CPS’s attention that the Father had uploaded online screenshots of text messages exchange with CPS. The Child could be identified in these messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s position at the Hearing on 13 November 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father objected to the recommendations at the 13 November hearing. The Father alleges<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that he had “discovered corrupt practices (unmerited/excessive referrals to Social Service Agencies (SSAs) by CPS and bribery arrangements between them, enabled and protected by the Family Justice Courts)”. The Father argues<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> that CPS did not adhere to the principles of the CYPA with a “corrupt intent” so that the Child Protection Order in this matter could be “extended for as long as possible to generate fraudulent counselling fees”. The Father contends that CPS “did nothing to facilitate the reintegration process with a ‘corrupt intent’ to generate fraudulent counselling fees (paid by public monies) for SSAs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father contends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that the existing child protection order was “voided” on 13 March 2024 because CPS “did nothing” to facilitate the reintegration process when the Child agreed to move in and live with him during the access session on 12 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father had submitted at the 13 November Hearing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that the existing orders must be discharged and that the Child must return to live with him immediately. The Father had informed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Court that he had moved from a 1-room rental flat in Choa Chu Kang to a 3-room flat in Bukit Batok which means he is able to provide a more stable and comfortable home environment for the Child. The Father has stated that the Child’s paternal grandparents currently live in a “short-lease 2 room Flexi flat” where the Child does not have her own room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     When the Court asked the Father at the 13 November Hearing whether he had removed the online content identifying the Child as someone being involved in these Child Protection Proceedings (as directed by the Court by DJ Amy Tung at the Review Hearing), the Father had informed the Court that he did not intend to remove the online content.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     After hearing both parties, I had then passed interim orders and directed CPS to arrange for the Child to undergo psychological and/or psychiatric assessment by the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and for IMH to furnish a copy of the report to the Court and Parents before the next hearing, so as to ascertain the current mental and/or emotional state of the Child to decide what were the orders that should be made that would be in her best interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father had filed an appeal against my interim orders made 13 November 2023. The appeal has been dismissed on 18 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Developments since 13 November 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     There were two medical reports dated 21 January 2025 and 5 February 2025 furnished by Dr H (“Dr H”) from the Child Guidance Clinic (“the Medical Reports”). In the first report dated 21 January 2025, Dr H has reported that [the Child] shares a good relationship with her mother, while [the Child] has expressed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> to him that she “did not wish to visit [her Father] as ‘he would never change’. Moving forward, Dr H had recommended that supervised sessions with [the Father] at a neutral setting with a trusted therapist should be arranged so that [the Father] can still have some regular interaction with her. Dr H had also added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> that such arrangement should only take place when [the Child] is ready and agreeable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In a further report by Dr H dated 5 February 2025, he added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> that “it will be likely that having to stay with her father and depart from the living arrangement [the Child] has been used to, will adversely affect her emotional and mental well-being. Dr H had also highlighted that [the Child] will be taking her national examinations at the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Further Hearings on 20 February 2025, 17 April 2025, 28 May 2025 and 19 June 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     At the hearing on 20 February 2025, parties had informed me that the appeal against the interim orders made on 13 November 2024 were to be heard on 18 March 2025. I had adjourned the hearing to 17 April 2025 to wait for the outcome of the appeal. However, as I had the benefit of considering the contents of the Medical Reports by then, I was of the view that it would be in the interest of the Child for the Court to hear from the Mother at the next hearing, especially when Dr H had reported that the Mother and the Child shared a good relationship. I had therefore directed for arrangements to be made for the Mother to be present at the hearing on 17 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Both parents were present at the hearing on 17 April 2025. CPS had maintained their position as stated in their review report, while the Father was of the view that the Child should be returned to him immediately. The Mother, on the other hand, expressed that it was not in the interest of the Child to return to the care of the Father. The Mother also informed the Court that she was seeking legal advice as to whether to apply to the Syariah Court for a variation of the care and control order (which is currently with the Father) back to her. I was of the view that the Mother’s views should be stated on affidavit as this was the first time the Court had a chance to hear her views on the matter. While the issue before this Court is not one of custody care and control, if the Mother decides to file an application to the Syariah Court for a variation of the current care and control orders, it may potentially affect the living arrangements of the Child. I therefore adjourned the hearing to 28 May 2025 to give the Mother a chance to file an affidavit on her views on the matter and to confirm the course that she was intending to take.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the hearing on 28 May 2025, the Mother did not turn up for the hearing and also did not file her affidavit as directed. However, CPS had updated the Court on further developments since the previous hearing. CPS had informed the Court that the Father had breached the interim order made on 17 April 2025, by sending emails to various foreign embassies which resulted in the disclosure of the identity of the Child in these proceedings to non-parties. The Father had explained at the hearing that he had done so as he intended to seek political asylum from the foreign embassies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     CPS had then sought the leave of Court to prepare an affidavit to furnish the Court with the contents of such alleged breach of the interim orders on the part of the Father. I had granted leave to CPS to prepare their affidavit- to be filed and served by 4 June 2025. I had also granted leave to the Father to prepare an affidavit (if he wishes to) to explain the alleged breach, before adjourning the hearing to release my decision on 19 June 2025. The Father did not file the affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavit of Ms J, Deputy Director of Protective Service (formerly known as CPS) dated 3 June 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     There were multiple emails (dated 6 May 2025, 19 May 2025, 21 May 2025, 22 May 2025) sent by the Father to CPS, which has also been copied to various foreign embassies, with attachments that disclose the name of the Child, exhibited in the affidavit of Ms J.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father had, in his emails<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, expressed his intention to relocate out of the ASEAN/Commonwealth location to return his Ural- Altaic roots by 2030. The Father’s act of disclosing the Child’s identity to non-parties to the proceedings is in breach of the interim court order that stated that “[the Father] shall not publish or broadcast, through any means including on social media or the Internet, anything which directly or indirectly relates to or is the subject of the proceedings before the Youth Court.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     There was a whatsapp message between the CPO and the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, that was exhibited in Ms J’s affidavit, with CPO asking the Father on 27 March 2025 if he would like to resume supervised access leading up to the hearing. The Father declined the offer to resume supervised access but had insisted on “reintegration”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In a review of existing care and protection orders, the legal test that is to be applied is as stated at BHR (Natural Mother of B) v Child Protector <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16760-SSP.xml')\">[2014] SGJC 1</a> (“BHR”) at [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…whether there exist any change in circumstances…to warrant/justify the cancellation/rescission [of the Previous Orders]. In this regard [the Court] will have to consider whether the child is still in need of care and protection under [the relevant sections of the CYPA] given the welfare and best interests of the child as of paramount interest.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the unreported decision of the High Court in Youth Court Appeal No. YA 004 of 2018/01<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, which was an appeal from Child Protector v Parents of GCQ v GCB <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22225-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGYC 4</a> (“GCQ”), Debbie Ong J had opined<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> that the Court needed to consider at a review hearing “whether the Parents are now in a different position such that they are sufficiently fit to have the children returned to them”. In determining this, the Court could consider whether the parents have complied with counselling and other interventions, whether they are committed to a safety plan, and whether there have been breaches in safety plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I was guided by Section 4(b) of the CYPA, which states that “in all matters relating to the administration or application of this Act, the welfare and best interests of the child or young person must be the first and paramount consideration<em>”</em>, in making my final orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application of Law to the Facts of this Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I agree with CPS’s submissions that there has been no material change in circumstances since the August 2023 orders, as the Father does not appear to be in a different position such that he is sufficiently fit to have the Child returned to him. In determining this, I have considered that there has been multiple breaches of the interim orders, such as disclosing the identity of the Child to non-parties, and also the Father’s refusal to accept the professional’s attempts to start with supervised access to help ease the Child to have more contact with him. Parent-child relationships are dynamic and a broken relationship will need sufficient time to heal. While the Father is insisting on an immediate discharge of the statutory supervision order, the Father’s recent act of disclosing the Child’s identity in the past month by copying the multiple foreign embassies also persuaded me that the Father still does not seem to have insight currently as to how his conduct would compromise the well-being of the Child. The Child should not be returned to his care until he is sufficiently fit to care for the well-being of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Nevertheless, I am also of the view that the status quo should not remain in the long-term as attempts should be made to heal the relationship between the Father and the Child, to work towards reintegration. I had considered Dr H’s recommendations that it will be helpful to arrange for supervised sessions with the Father at a neutral setting with a trusted therapist so that there could be a rebuilding of relationship between them. Considering the welfare and best interests of the Child as paramount, I extended the statutory supervision order for another 6 months- to offer some stability to the Child as she completes her O level examinations at the end of 2025 and to give the professionals a chance to help re-integrate her back to living with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father must understand that the Child is going to be 16 years old, with a mind of her own, and if he continues to disregard her views or to remain adamant in refusing to work with the professionals to mend this fragile relationship, re-integration will become even more difficult as she grows older. If the Father still refuses the therapeutic sessions to work on helping the Child feel safe at the prospect of living with him, it is to his own detriment and will only delay the re-integration process.

It raises several interesting issues regarding the issue of fairness. For instance, should the request be allowed on the sole basis that he had been retrenched? Is he expected to liquidate his assets so as to continue paying the agreed maintenance? What are the dominant considerations in determining whether to reduce the agreed maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the background facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In November 2015, the Father consented to a court order which stipulated that he was to make the following payments for the maintenance of his daughter (D.O.B. xxx 2005) and son (D.O.B. xxx 2008): (“<b>Maintenance Order</b>”).</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.78%\"><col width=\"50.84%\"><col width=\"40.38%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Age of the child</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Maintenance amount</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Between 12 to 17 years (inclusive)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">€1,100/month</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">From 18 years until the child turns 21 or gains employment, whichever is later</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">€1,200/month</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In May 2024, the Father was retrenched. Prior to this event, he had been paying €2,300/month as child maintenance (combined).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From June 2024, the Father began paying €1,150/month as child maintenance (combined).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In October 2024, the Mother sought a court order to compel the Father to comply with the Maintenance Order and to pay €2,300/month in child maintenance: MSS 2292/2024 (“<b>Enforcement Application</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_e\"></a>(e)     About one month later, the Father applied to reduce the child maintenance to €800/month for both children (combined) starting from June 2024, arguing that his retrenchment was a material change in circumstances. He further applied for the maintenance payments which he had made in excess of €800/month since June 2024 to be used to offset his future maintenance payments: FC/OADV 105/2024 (“<b>Variation Application</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Mother opposed the Variation Application. She contended that the Father had the financial means to comply with the Maintenance Order and that she did not have sufficient resources to make up for the shortfall if the maintenance is reduced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Variation Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Before turning to the merits of the parties’ applications, I will set out the principles governing the variation of child maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Material change in the circumstances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father’s application is based on s 118 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court <em>may</em> at any time vary ... any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application ... of the person against whom the order was made ... where there has been any <em>material change in the circumstances</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is important to note that the retrenchment of a paying parent <em>per se</em> does not automatically justify a variation of a maintenance order. This is because s 118 confers a discretion on the court – it “<em>may</em>” vary the order, but is not obliged to do so. To persuade a court to vary a maintenance order, the paying parent must prove three things. <em>First</em>, there has been a change in the circumstances (<b>Requirement 1</b>). <em>Second</em>, the change has occurred <em>after</em> the maintenance order was made (<b>Requirement 2</b>). <em>Third</em>, the change is of such a nature that makes it necessary to vary the order (<b>Requirement 3</b>): <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<b><em>BZD</em></b>”) at [10] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Is it unfair for the paying parent to comply with the maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In general, Requirements 1 and 2 do not raise any issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Requirement 3 requires some elaboration. To satisfy this requirement, a paying parent must show that because of his/her loss of employment, “it is no longer fair” for him/her to provide maintenance order as originally ordered by the court: <em>BZD</em> at [14]; <em>ATS v ATT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19435-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 196</a> at [12]. In assessing whether the paying parent has met this requirement, the potential hardship to him/her is not the sole consideration. This is because the principle of fairness requires the court to also consider two interests of two other persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the interests of the child. A reduction in the paying parent’s maintenance obligation must not prejudice the child’s welfare – which remains the paramount concern.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the interests of the other parent. It follows from [7(a)] that the resultant shortfall in maintenance will often have to be borne by the other parent. It is contrary to the principle of fairness if the paying parent is permitted to reduce his/her maintenance obligation by causing the other parent to suffer undue hardship in having to cover the shortfall. Ultimately, a court must ensure a fair and realistic division of the maintenance obligation between the parents with due regard to their respective means and circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       What matters should a court consider when balancing the various interests so as to arrive at a fair outcome? In my view, these include the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that the loss of employment is sudden/unexpected?</em> It is settled law that whether a change in the circumstances is foreseeable is a relevant consideration: <em>BZD</em> at [15]. One example of a foreseeable loss of employment is where a paying parent, who was on probation when the maintenance order was made, is subsequently not confirmed as an employee: see e.g., <em>TXC v TXD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19946-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 12</a> at [51] to [54].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that the loss of employment is not self-induced?</em> Courts are slow to allow a variation application if the loss of employment is self-induced: see e.g., <em>CDV v CDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25381-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 1427</a> at [88]; <em>TBC v TBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17192-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 27</a> at [18].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Following from this, a paying parent should provide the reason for his/her loss of employment. If a paying parent fails to do so, then his/her variation application is unlikely to succeed: see, e.g., <em>VBP v VBQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23729-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 116</a> at [22] to [24]. (Although this case concerns an application to rescind a maintenance order, the approach adopted there is equally applicable to variation applications.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       A paying parent will not be allowed to avoid or minimise his/her maintenance obligation by voluntarily resigning or causing his/her own termination from employment: <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> (“<b><em>UNC</em></b>”) at [24(a)]. This principle is illustrated in <em>UWY v UWZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23246-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 60</a> (“<b><em>UWY</em></b>”). In that case, the variation application was denied because the paying parent had resigned to become a self-employed in his own start-up: at [25] and [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that he/she is unable to pay the child maintenance?</em> This requires a court to consider the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, has the paying parent provided evidence of his/her financial resources? A variation application may be dismissed if such evidence is not provided: <em>WWA</em> at [62]; <em>WGQ v WGR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/28815-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 72</a> at [29] to [33]; <em>XCJ</em> at [98].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, has the paying parent shown that he/she has limited financial resources and earning capacity? See <em>CKO v CKP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25848-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHC 92</a> (“<b><em>CKO</em></b>”) at [20]; <em>Wong Lai Kum v Lim Khee Tee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0151.xml')\">[2012] SGHC 151</a> at [23] to [25]; <em>XCJ v XCK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32085-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 73</a> (“<b><em>XCJ</em></b>”) at [95] and [96]. In <em>WWA v WWB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31572-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 33</a> (“<b><em>WWA</em></b>”) at [62], the court emphasized that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">... the financial capacity of a party is not rigidly ascertained by sole reference to income alone. The court is required to consider the party’s property and other financial resources. A party who earns no income may well have property and other financial resources that could meet his or her maintenance obligation. ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Third</em>, has the paying parent’s provided evidence of his/her monthly expenses? Are these expenses reasonable? Has the parent explored and exhausted all reasonable solutions that could enable him/her to comply with the maintenance order? See, e.g., <em>CKO</em> at [22]; s 114(1)(b) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that it would be fair for the other parent cover the shortfall in maintenance?</em> The shortfall resulting from a reduction in the paying parent’s share of child maintenance will have to be covered: see [7(a)] above. The paying parent must thus prove that the other parent will not have any difficulty in covering this shortfall: see e.g., <em>WZN v WZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32430-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 41</a> at [28] to [33], [38] and [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issues for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I will now apply the above principles to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Requirements 1 and 2 are clearly satisfied. At the time of the Maintenance Order in 2015, the Father was gainfully employed. He was retrenched in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As for Requirement 3, the Father submitted that it is no longer fair for him to comply with the Maintenance Order because of his retrenchment. To succeed in his variation application on this basis, he must go on to prove the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That he cannot afford to pay €2,300/month in child maintenance: see [8(c)] above. (“<b>First Issue</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother can afford to cover the resulting shortfall of €1,500/month – i.e., the difference between €2,300/month (the amount that the Father is supposed to pay) and €800/month (the amount that he proposes to pay): see [8(d)] above. (“<b>Second Issue</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">First Issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father relied on the following to show that he could no longer afford to pay €2,300/month following his retrenchment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Retrenchment benefits</em>. On 20 June 2024, the Father had received $78,314.99 in his Standard Chartered Bank (“<b>SCB</b>”) account as retrenchment benefits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He claimed that these funds are no longer available as he had used them for the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       To purchase a small apartment in the Philippines (“<b>Philippines property</b>”). This property is co-owned with his partner and occupied by her daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       To pay the advance rental for his current apartment ($28,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Income and expenses</em>. The Father receives rental income of $4,200/month. He claimed that this amount is insufficient to cover his personal expenses of approximately $11,482/month: see <b><u>Annex A</u></b>. He added that his mortgage loan ($485,081.04) exceeds the cash in his SCB account ($385,142.53).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Earning potential</em>.

This is incorrect. The mortgage loan is tied to his Canberra Drive apartment. This apartment is valued at approximately $1.42 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> After deducting the mortgage, the apartment has a net value of around $1 million. In other words, the Father has a net <em>surplus</em> of assets: see [16] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s claim that he cannot afford to pay child maintenance of €2,300/month (approximately $3,416/month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>) does not gel with the fact that he could afford to spend $121,424 to purchase the Philippines property. He was aware of his impending retrenchment as early as 2 April 2024 – well before he made full payment for the Philippines property. If there had been a genuine concern about his financial situation at the material time, he could have opted to forego the purchase. During the hearing on 2 July 2025, his counsel confirmed that backing out of the purchase would have cost the Father only $2,248 in forfeited reservation fees.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother submitted that it is inconceivable for the Father to have only $385,142.53 in savings, and that he must have undisclosed assets. These submissions are based on the following.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In 2013/2014, he held assets amounting to €437,243. Of this sum, €148,000 were paid to the Mother pursuant to the ancillary matters order, leaving a balance of €289,243. The Mother contended that this balance had not been accounted for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Father was employed for nearly a decade after the ancillary matters order and had earned substantial income during that time. In 2012, he had received a stock incentive valued at USD23,000. The Mother argued that he would likely have received further incentives before his retrenchment in 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> His tax returns for the years of assessment 2022 and 2024 reflected a total income of $1,194,152.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father also held investments that generate approximately $4,200/month in dividends from two funds AAA and BBB.

He is 56 years old – well below the statutory retirement age. He has considerable professional experience, having served as the General Manager (Asia) of a multinational corporation in the medical devices sector. He has also taken steps to become self-employed. In this regard, he had earned $5,759.86 in consultancy fees in January and May 2025,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and is actively exploring additional consultancy opportunities in Germany.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In my view, it is a matter of time before the Father resumes employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In the interim, the Father will have to take active steps to manage his personal expenses. I make two observations in this regard:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is unclear what the “Maintenance” item of $1,642/month refers to.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> No explanation or supporting evidence has been provided to justify this amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, after excluding the expense item relating to “Maintenance” and the children, the Father’s personal monthly expenses amount to $9,595: see <b><u>Annex A</u></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This sum appears disproportionately high for a single who is unemployed. The Father has not explained why he needs to incur $1,500/month on food, $550/month on utilities, and rental expenses of $4,000/month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Second Issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I now turn to the Second Issue: see [11(b)] above. I find that he has also failed to discharge his burden of proof on this issue. Let me begin by summarising his position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father submitted that it is reasonable for the Mother to bear the shortfall in maintenance if his Variation Application is granted. This submission is based on the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He estimated the combined expenses for both children to be only about €1,480/month – and not €2,300/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> (See <b><u>Annex B</u></b> for his computations.) This estimate is premised on the children’s cost of living (who now reside in Germany) being lower than in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     When he reduced the maintenance payments to €1,150/month in June 2024 – the Mother began contributing €400/month towards the children’s expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Father argued that if his maintenance payments were reduced to €800/month, the resulting shortfall would be only €280/month – i.e. 1,480/month minus [€800/month + €400/month].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father submitted that the Mother can bridge this shortfall (€280/month) by securing better employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> He added that the financial impact would not be significant on her as she receives rental income, government support, and is eligible for retirement payments from the German government.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I find that it is not fair to require the Mother to bear the shortfall in maintenance. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Maintenance Order was entered by consent.</u> At the outset, I emphasise that the amount in the Maintenance Order is one that the Father had voluntarily consented to. Courts are slow to disturb consent orders without compelling reasons, especially where the agreed maintenance reflects the parties’ understanding of their children's present and future needs: <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [31] to [33]; <em>UNC</em> at [24(b)] to [24(e)]; <em>WWQ v WWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/33239-SSP.xml')\">[2025] 3 SLR 1167</a> at [6]; <em>AON v AOO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0926.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 926</a> at [24]; <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0548.xml')\">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 548</a> at [5]–[6].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>No good reason given for setting aside agreed maintenance</u>. In this case, the Father has failed to prove that €1,480/month is a reasonable amount for the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There are significant gaps in his computation of the children’s expenses. For instance, he had omitted basic and recurring monthly expense items such as utilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       His estimates for the children’s expense items are also unrealistically low. For instance, he had proposed pocket money allowance of only €50/month for both children – i.e. less than one euro/day per child. This is manifestly insufficient as his children are already young adults – 17 and 19 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father contended that older children would incur fewer expenses than when they were younger. Not only does this contention defy logic, it also contradicts the underlying premise of the Maintenance Order that he had consented to. In the order, the maintenance amounts are expressly stated to increase with the children’s age, thus reflecting their growing financial needs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> see [2(a)] above. Indeed, the children will be going to university and they will soon have to incur additional expenses, including accommodation expenses estimated at €500/month per child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       I prefer the Mother’s computation of the children’s expenses – €1,054/month for the daughter and €1,131/month for the son: see <b><u>Annex C</u></b> at (14) and <b><u>Annex D</u></b> at (15).

Specifically, he has failed to prove the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That he cannot afford to pay €2,300/month in child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother can afford to cover the resulting shortfall in maintenance payments if the Variation Application is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Enforcement Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given the above finding, it follows that the Father has also failed to establish a good reason for not complying with the Maintenance Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During the hearing on 16 July 2025, I was informed that the maintenance arrears came to a total of €16,100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     After hearing the parties, I made the following orders to enforce the payment of the maintenance arrears:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father is to <b>pay the arrears</b> in one lump sum on or before <b>1 September 2025</b>. He has sufficient funds to comply with this order: see [16] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father is to <b>show proof of the above payment</b> by <b>4 September 2025</b> by 10.00 am. The show-payment may be done online.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In default of show-payment, the Father is to serve <b>four weeks’ imprisonment</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is well settled that a child’s interests are paramount in family matters. It follows from this that a child’s welfare cannot be collateral damage to the personal financial preferences of a parent who is supposed to pay for the child’s maintenance. Where there is credible evidence that the paying parent has substantial resources, it is only fair to expect that parent to draw upon those resources to discharge his/her maintenance obligations. Parents are expected to make sacrifices for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In this case, the Father is not devoid of means. Putting aside the retrenchment benefits ($78,314.99), he has about $1,506,566.53 in disposable assets: see [16(G)]. Allowing the Variation Application will have placed on the Mother (who has far less means) a disproportionate financial burden. It is manifestly unfair to allow the Father to preserve his assets at the Mother’s expense. This is especially so when he had chosen to use his retrenchment benefits to purchase the Philippine property for his partner’s daughter. These benefits could be used to provide for about 23 months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> of child maintenance. In this case, fairness requires the Father to liquidate his assets, even at some financial loss, if this is necessary to meet his continuing legal and moral duty to maintain his children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Accordingly, the Variation Application is dismissed, and the Enforcement Application is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

The Husband did not object to the inclusion of this incident:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>-13 September 2024- Persistent Knocks on the Door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In the Husband’s cross-application against the Wife in SS1511, he relied on the following 3 incidents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_i\"></a>i.     30 July 2024 – Wife pushed Husband causing his head to hit wooden door and hitting his stomach.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     1 August 2024 - Parties had both mutually spat at each other and that the Wife had pushed the Husband causing him to sustain an injury.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     17 October 2023- Wife venting work stress on the children including one act of disciplining 4-year-old son with a hanger that broke in half.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband had also included 2 incidents that took place after the date of the filing of his complaint on 8<sup>th</sup> August. The Wife did not object to the inclusion of the 2 incidents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i\"></a>i.     21 August 2024 - Wife accusing Husband eavesdropping and recording conversations and snatching Husband’s phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     18 September 2024 - Wife yelling at Stepdaughter for no reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In her application in SS1532, the Wife relied on another incident:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_\"></a>-    9 August 2024 - Husband threatened to hit or kill the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The 3 applications were jointly heard on 12 February 2025 and adjourned to enable counsel to prepare written submissions. On 24 March 2025, the following decisions were made in respect of the 3 applications:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i\"></a>i.     SS1475 – Protection order made against the Husband for the protection of the Wife and the Son based on the incidents that took place on 7 January 2024, 13 April, 23 April and 17 June 2024. Both the Wife and Husband were ordered to attend mandatory counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     SS1511 - Application by the Husband was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     SS1532- Protection order and a domestic exclusion order made against the Husband for the protection of the Wife for the incident that took place on 9 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband has appealed against the whole of my decisions in the 3 applications. For completeness, I set out the reasons for all my decisions in 3 applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties were married in 2022 and blessed with two children, one of whom is the Son involved in SS1475. The other child is not involved in any of the 3 applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Wife also has 2 children from her previous marriage who are the Stepson and Stepdaughter of the Husband whom the Husband also sought to protect in SS1511.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits and submissions filed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_i\"></a>i.     Wife’s affidavit sworn on 23 September 2024 (CA1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Wife’s affidavit in reply to SS1511 sworn on 25 September 2024 (CA2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     Wife’s 1st witness (AW1)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_iv\"></a>iv.     Wife’s 2nd witness (AW2)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_v\"></a>v.     Wife’s 3rd witness (AW3)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W3).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_vi\"></a>vi.     Wife’s 4th witness (AW4)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_i\"></a>i.     Husband’s affidavit affirmed on 6 January 2025 (RA1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Husband’s supplementary affidavit affirmed on 7 February 2025 (RA2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The following written submissions were submitted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_i\"></a>i.     Wife’s main submission dated 3 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Husband’s main submission dated 3 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     Wife’s reply submission dated 14 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_iv\"></a>iv.     Husband’s reply submission dated 13 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”) that apply in the 3 applications are those under the former sections 64 and 65 as the new provisions only came into effect on 2 Jan 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To obtain a protection order, the applicant must prove the two elements, on a balance of probabilities. Firstly, that “family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed”: s 65(1). Family violence is defined in s 64 of the as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second element requires the applicant to establish that the protection order is necessary for the protection of the family member concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The decision to make a protection order is thus a two-stage process. First is to determine whether there was any family violence committed or likely to be committed within the definition of family violence under section 64. Second is whether a protection order is necessary for the protection of the family member concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Where a protection order is issued, under section 65(5)(a) the Court may also issue a domestic exclusion order and under section 65(5)(b) a counselling order if the court thinks fit having regards to all the circumstance of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will first deal with whether there was any family violence committed or likely to be committed based on the two applications by the Wife followed by the application by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Applications against Husband (SS1475 and SS1532) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The following were the evidence given by the Wife, her witnesses and the Husband in descending order of the incidents alleged, that is starting from the most recent to the oldest. My findings of fact, whether for or against the party concerned are set out at the end of each incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13 September 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband kept knocking on the door of the room in which the Wife was sleeping. She told him to stop as she and the children needed to sleep. However, despite her pleas to stop, the Husband continued with his irresponsible actions. The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband’s act had “tormented, harassed and distressed” the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband submitted that no family violence committed. The Wife did not provide any Closed-Circuit Television (“CCTV”) footages or audio recordings of this incident. The Wife, in cross examination, also confirmed that this incident did not involve any hurt or threat of causing hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I came to the view that there was no family violence committed. The Wife’s counsel erroneously relied on the new definition of family violence which includes conduct which torments, harasses or distresses the victim and thus inapplicable<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> in this case. Even if considered under the applicable definition, the acts alleged were insufficient to amount to “continual harassment” under limb (d) of the definition of family violence under section 64.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">9 August 2024 incident </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Husband told the Wife to meet him at the void deck below their flat. This was after the Wife had made her first application in SS1475 on 6 August. At the said void deck, the Husband wanted her to withdraw her application against him. However, she refused and told him that she was just protecting herself and the children from his acts of violence. To her horror, the Husband shouted angrily at her in Chinese as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Even if you have PPO, anything I want to hit or kill you, you have the PPO is useless. Do you think your PPO can help you?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In cross-examination she reiterated the same, that the Husband had said to her in Chinese: “if have PPO also useless anytime he want hit me kill me, this PPO also no use?”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The threatening words kept circulating in her mind for the next several days. The Wife was very disturbed, continued to be so and was afraid that the Husband might kill her or the children as the Husband had ever taken a knife to threaten her previously. Following the incident, she decided to file for a domestic exclusion order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife’s counsel submitted that by the Husband above-stated words he had wilfully or knowingly placed, or attempted to place, the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Husband denied this allegation. According to him, as set out in his affidavit <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, he was on his way to meet a female friend when he saw the Wife speaking to his mother at the lift lobby. The Wife shouted at him and said that his mother had proposed to buy over the matrimonial flat if the Wife did not want it. During her tirade, the Wife said that “she had filed the PPO application as a means to gauge his reaction” and that “lots of couples have filed PPO against each other, yet their marriages still thrive”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     According to him “she asserted that a true man should not retaliate against the application.” The Husband did not engage in any further conversation with her to avoid causing an outburst or an argument. The Wife then asked if he was going to meet a lady, but he ignored her. Later, the Wife called him to ask if he was cheating on her and threatened to take the children and leave him. He was worried for the children’s safety and called the police emergency hotline. She then calmed down and assured him that she would not take the children away upon being told that he had called the hotline. According to him, later that evening, he and the Wife met up to bring the children out to watch the fireworks after which they went home. In cross-examination, he maintained his stand that the incident as alleged by the Wife did not take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In his submissions, the Husband’s counsel pointed out that there is no other corroborative evidence on the alleged act and that based on the cross-examination done, the Wife did not seem to have a good recollection on the incidents as her evidence were riddled with inconsistencies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision .</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I noted that the 1<sup>st</sup> application by the Wife was made on 6 August. The Summons would have been served on the Husband by 9 August before this incident took place. According to the Husband’s affidavit, when the Wife said that she had filed a PPO application against him, the Husband also did not deny having any knowledge of any PPO Summons issued against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     While the Husband had alleged that the Wife did not have any other evidence to corroborate her allegations, in the Husband’s affidavit, he informed that his mother was present on that day when he met the Wife. The mother would be the best person to corroborate his version. However, she was not called as a witness to this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I considered the versions given by both parties and found the Wife’s version believable and that the Husband’s version likely concocted by him and did not take place as claimed. The discrepancies in her cross-examination were minor and did not affect her credibility. The conduct displayed by the Husband as narrated by the Wife, was a more likely reaction to be expected from a respondent on being served with a court summons alleging family violence. I also found the Husband’s version incomprehensible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was of the view that the words uttered by the Husband as alleged amounted to 'wilfully placing a family member in fear of hurt&quot;. There was thus family violence committed against the Wife on this day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1 August 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The incident of 1 August is relied on by the Wife in SS1475 and the Husband in his application in SS1511.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     On 1 August at around 11pm, when the Wife saw the Husband talking on his mobile phone and smoking along the corridor outside their flat, she immediately went to one of the rooms where his Stepson (who is the Wife’s natural son) who was asthmatic, was sleeping. She found the room smelt of cigarette and the Stepson coughing. She stated that the Husband had been caught smoking in the toilet of that room previously and had confronted the Husband on his conduct. When reminded, he shouted “shut the (expletive) up” to both the Wife and the Stepson. She told him to leave the flat as it was very late, and the children needed the sleep as it was a school week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband then came into the room very aggressively with his hands behind his back, shouted at her and asked what she wanted from him. He then spat at her face and in response, she spat back at him. The Husband then spat at her again after which she froze as he was physically bigger and heavier than her and she could see his anger on his face and his mannerism. He then rushed out of the room and returned shortly with an empty beer can. Without any warning, the Husband threw the beer can at her left head. She then called her church mates who advised her to call the police. She did not see a doctor as she was too shocked and was not bleeding but did make a police report subsequently on 20 August.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     She denied that she had caused the knee injury alleged by the Husband in the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband’s act of spitting, shouting the vulgar words and throwing the beer can at the Wife amounted to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The evidence of the Wife’s four witnesses corroborated each other and was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     On 1 August 2024 at around 11 pm AW3 received a call from the Wife that the Husband had spat and threw an empty beer can at the Wife’ head. He then relayed this information to three other church mates (AW1, AW2 and AW4). All the three gave evidence that they received the same information from AW3 at around 11 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Husband averred that both parties had mutually spat at each other and that the Wife had pushed the Husband causing him to sustain an injury. In cross-examination, the Wife agreed that during the period concerned, their relationship had broken down. There was a scuffle and that the Husband had fallen and suffered an injury. He produced a medical memorandum dated 21 August 2024 stating he suffered a right knee injury due to the alleged assault by the Wife on 1 August.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s counsel submitted that during the cross-examination of the Husband, there were little to no inconsistencies, save for the confusion on the version of the order of the events. He also submitted, amongst other things, that the Wife has not sought to provide any evidence to oppose the Husband’s version of events aside from the difference in the parties’ sizes. She had averred that due to her smaller frame and built, she could not have possibly been able to afflict the harm described by the Husband. It was also submitted on the Husband behalf that if one had been drinking and was caught off guard, it could have been entirely possible for even someone with a smaller frame to push them and cause him to be off balance and to topple down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this incident, the Husband was alleged to have smoked in the room the asthmatic Step- son who was sleeping. An altercation took place, and the Husband spat at the Wife's face twice and threw a beer can at the Wife 's left head. The Wife did spit back at the Husband in the incident. The Husband then shouted, &quot;shut the (expletive) up”. The Husband's response was that he was holding an empty beer can that he was previously drinking and during the scuffle, inadvertently flung the beer can in her direction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, the vulgar words alleged used by the Husband alone were not sufficient to place the Wife in fear of hurt. It was plausible that the Husband threw the empty can at the spur of the moment. As for the knee injury alleged by the Husband, I was not convinced that it was caused by the acts of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The incident that took place was a result of an altercation which resulted in physical exchanges. I was of the view that no family violence took place whether as against the Stepson, the Wife or the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17 June 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In the afternoon when parties were at their flat, the Husband asked the Son to accompany him to Punggol SAFRA but the Son declined as he was tired and wanted to rest. The Son then followed the Wife to one of the rooms in the flat. About 10 minutes later, the Husband charged towards them and took out his belt and tried to beat the Son. The Wife managed to block him from doing so. By then, the Son got scared and hid behind the Wife to protect himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband then shouted at the Son to get out of the flat and stand at the lift area. The Son followed his instructions. He then closed the main door forcefully while the Son was still at the lift area. The Wife pleaded with the Husband not to do that to the Son just because the Son didn’t want to go with him. He should not punish the Son and asked him to stand at the lift area. She asked, what if when the Husband were to go out and see that he had already fallen down the building. To that the Husband retorted “I told him to go, he cannot say no &quot;.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Fearing for the Son’s safety, the Wife proceeded to quickly open the main door and asked the Son to return to the flat as she felt that children should not be out of parent’s sight even when they were punished especially in this case when the Son at that young age. The Husband then shouted at the Son to get out again, and the Wife again asked the Son to return back to the flat. This happened three times. The Husband got angrier and more shouted “the more you want to protect your son, the more I will show you what I will do to him&quot; to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Husband then carried the Son back to the flat, went into one of the rooms and locked the door. The Wife got very worried and searched frantically for the spare key. While doing so, she heard the Husband screamed and shouted at the Son who was crying loudly. She managed to find the spare key and when she opened the door, the Husband left the room abruptly. She then closed the door to be with the Son and found him panting breathlessly. She asked him to calm down and asked the Son what happened. She was horrified to be told that the Husband had strangled him and lifted him up towards the wall fan. In her state of shock and anger, she confronted the Husband who denied the allegations. The Husband then ran back to the room and tried to kick the Son but was prevent from doing so by the Wife who managed to block his kick. She then told the Husband that she would be calling the police. Despite that, the Husband tried to grab the Son from the Wife. She panicked and ran out of the flat, bumping into a stranger along the way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     She then went downstairs and called her church mates for help. Her church mates persuaded her to call the police. She decided not to call after some consideration and went back to the flat. When she could not locate both the Husband and the Son there, she packed some clothing into 2 bags and was just about to leave the flat when the Husband came back. He told her that he wanted to talk but she informed him that she felt fearful at that stage and did not wish to talk. He then snatched one of the bags and threw it down the building. When she wanted to take the Son with her, the Husband stopped her. She then went down to the ground floor to retrieve the bag and went to a police station to seek assistance. After being told that her report would be investigated, she decided not to pursue as she was afraid that the Husband may end up in jail and that she wanted to hold her family together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In cross-examination, she was asked why she did not make a police report or send the child to seek medical attention as he was strangled. She replied that she did not do so as the Son was not at home after she came back. She also did not do so on the next day as she did not see any bruises. She also did not want the Husband to get into trouble. She clarified that the Husband had tried to kick the Son, but he did not succeed as she managed to block the kick.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     When asked about the CCTV in the living room, her response was that it was installed a “long time ago” when they had a new maid<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. The CCTV was switched off when she was home as she wanted to save electricity. She never thought of keeping any footage as she did not expect that “it will come to this .. one day”. She only kept one recording which was given to the Husband’s counsel which was after she filed the application. The CCTV could not capture anything that happened in her room or corridor, just the living room. She disagreed that she had withheld the footages as they did not support her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the following acts by the Husband amounted to family violence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_i\"></a>i.     Took out his belt and tried to hit the Son with it and in doing so, he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Son in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Locked up the Son against his will for his mere refusal to go with him and in so doing, he had wrongfully confined or restrained the Son against his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     Strangled the Son and lifted him up towards the wall fan and in so doing, he had caused hurt to the Son by an act that is known (or ought to have been known) would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As to the Husband’s claim that he had a shoulder injury and could not have done the acts alleged, the counsel submitted that the Husband did not adduce any evidence to support his assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     On 17 June between 2 pm and 3 pm, AW3 received a call from the Wife who informed him that the Husband had strangled the Son in one of the rooms in the flat. He advised her to call the police. AW3 then called the same three church mates to inform them of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The 3 church mates gave evidence that each of them received a call from AW3 at around 4 pm. AW3 informed them that he received a call from the Wife that the Husband had strangled the Son in one of the rooms in the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’ version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     He denied that he strangled the Son and had not caused any physical harm on him. At 9.53 am, the Wife asked him to buy 2 packets of pork lard for her to cook noodles<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. As the supermarket did not sell the item, he told the Wife that he wished to bring the Son out while she cooked. He brought the Son out at 2 pm and was informed by the Wife that she might joined them shortly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     When the Wife did not inform him of her whereabouts, he tried to call her but did not get any response. He then brought the Son back at around 7 pm. He submitted WhatsApp chats and screenshot photos taken with the Son<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> showing that the Son gave him a kiss on his cheek at 4.58 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In his cross-examination he confirmed that he did bring the Son to Punggol SAFRA, and they had a fun day. He also claimed to have a hand injury and did not have the strength to do the acts alleged<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. In his affidavit he stated that his hand has suffered ligament injury and a dislocated finger whereby his hand strength is limited<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. He was also referred to the medical memo dated 25 April 2023 which stated that he “has a right wrist injury and is currently on a splint which stops the rotation of the wrist”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. There was another memo dated 11 May 2023 that he “is suffering from a right wrist ligament injury” and the doctor also asked that he be excused from right upper limb exercises for the next 3 months. He also claimed to have a shoulder injury but did not get any doctor’s memo but could do so if needed. He disagreed that his right wrist had recovered since August 2023. He reasoned that he had defaulted in his medical appointments and that the physiotherapist had actually told him that there was nothing that could be done for his hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Husband counsel also submitted that there should have been CCTV footages which could clearly show the living room and the hallway of the rooms in which the incidents took place. The Husband had requested for CCTV footages of not only this incident but also of the other incidents which the Wife had indicated in her affidavit. However, he was only provided with one CCTV footage dated 7 August 2024, which was not from the date of any of the incidents that were the subject matter of the Wife’s applications and also after the first application was filed for SS1475.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In this regard, it was submitted on behalf of the Husband that an adverse inference be drawn against the Wife for not providing evidence which would clearly go towards supporting her case, had these events occurred. In support of that, the Husband submitted the case of <em>WRX v WRY</em> and another matter [2024] SGHC(A) 224 at [37] wherein the court noted that the drawing of adverse inference should be considered if the evidence withheld could contribute to the factual conclusion of the matter which could be significant to the ultimate apportionment of liability. Ultimately, the Court has to be satisfied that the evidence omitted is important based on the circumstances of the case. In the case at hand, contemporaneous evidence like this CCTV footage would have been undisputably helpful to ascertain which of the version of events was correct. The dispute in this case was largely factual and could have been resolved with the presence of the CCTV footages on the incidents which occurred at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     As regards the photograph of the Husband and the Son that was taken at 4.58 pm on that day, the Husband’s counsel submitted that it was unusual and unlikely for a child who has been allegedly subjected to that level of abuse to still be able to have a lovely day with the person who had allegedly subjected him to the said abuse just a few hours after the incident. The pictures did not seem to depict a bruised neck on the Son and again, the Son did not seem to be in distress being in the Husband’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">CCTV footages</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Section 116 Evidence Act 1893 was raised by the Husband’s counsel. The section and illustration (g) provide:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    that evidence could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In <em>WRX v WRY</em>, at paragraph 37, the court said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“In civil litigation, an adverse inference can be drawn that “evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it:” illustration (g) of s 116 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed). The drawing of an adverse inference is part of the process by which the court reaches a factual conclusion, which may be significant to the ultimate finding of liability (or the absence of liability) in civil actions which can involve a wide variety of breaches of rights and issues. However, importantly the court must be satisfied that the circumstances of the case, including the evidence before it, justify the adverse inference to be made.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     No evidence was led by the Husband as to the exact location of the CCTV, where it was directed and what it was capable of recording. Being occupant of the flat, it would also be within his power to access the recordings and if he had been prevented from doing that, he should have raised that in his evidence. Whilst both counsel had provided in their submissions what the CCTV was capable of, these were not in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In cross-examination, when asked about the CCTV in the living room, the Wife’s said that the CCTV was installed when they had a new maid and that was a “long time ago”. It was switched off when the Wife was home to save electricity. The Wife never thought of keeping the recordings as she did not expect that parties will end up in litigation. She only kept one recording which was given to the Husband’s counsel after she filed the PPO. She also explained that the CCTV could not capture anything that happened in her room or corridor in view of its positioning. She also disagreed that she had withheld the footages as they did not support her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I accepted the explanation given by the Wife that she did not have the footages of the incidents and why she had not kept the recordings of the incidents. Having considered the circumstances of the case and the evidence presented I refused to draw any adverse inference against her. The absence of any CCTV footages of the incident did not weaken her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     While the Wife's counsel explained in the submissions why the CCTV footage would not be useful, the reasons given in the submissions were not in evidence and thus inadmissible. One footage of the CCTV was also shown by the Husband in his submission which was also not in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     What the Son related to the Wife was hearsay evidence and inadmissible. The Son was not called to give evidence. What was left was the evidence of the Wife. If I accept the evidence of the Wife as to what actually took place, the Husband would have committed family violence by hurting the Son and confining him in the room against his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Wife gave a very elaborate account of the incident that took place and did so in a coherent and convincing manner. I was satisfied that her accounts were true and whilst the Husband, had pointed out discrepancies in her evidence, they could be due to lapses due to passage of time and thus not fatal to her case. The Wife could not have fabricated such an elaborate plot, including making a call to AW3, to pin the Husband down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Husband had produced WhatsApp chats and screenshot photo of him and the son taken at 4.58 pm. The photograph showed that the son appeared normal and happy at that moment. Whilst the son mood appeared to have changed subsequently as shown by the photograph, from the evidence given by the Wife I was satisfied there had been family violence committed against Son by the Husband earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">23 April 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     At about 8 am, the Husband threatened to report the Wife to the police and “Anti-scam” unit for withholding his monies. The Wife claimed that the Husband had asked her to manage his monies due to his online gambling addiction. He rebuked her for giving him only a daily allowance of $20, though she reminded him that she did so at his request. He again threatened her the second time to report her to the police, the “Anti-scam” unit and the bank.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Wife stated that his addiction started years ago and that he had been similarly threatening her as above. She sought her church leader’s advice, and he asked her to arrange for a discussion on 25 April with her church mates to feed his addiction. On hearing this, the Husband continued with his threat to call the police and the bank. He also told her that he had called up her office and asked to speak to her manager. He also sent the Wife a WhatsApp screen shot showing an email to her employer and the CPIB<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> with intent to harm her employment status. The Wife alleged that he then sent her multiple threats via WhatsApp and calls but she declined to answer them. She also did not give him any monies from his savings for fear that he would use them for online gambling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     At about 7 pm, the Wife went to her church to seek assistance and returned to the flat with a few church mates with a view to have a discussion with the Husband. At the flat, the Husband refused to sit down to discuss and went into one of the rooms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     After about 5 to 10 minutes, the Husband came out of the room hurriedly, burst into anger and scolded the Wife for bringing the church mates against him. The Wife froze in fear while the church mates tried to calm the Husband down and told him that they were just trying to settle matters between the parties amicably. The Husband got angry again and proceeded to the kitchen to look for a knife. She informed that the Husband had in the past threatened to kill her with a knife after he found one in the kitchen. Since then, the Wife had hidden all the knives in the kitchen. That was the reason why the Husband was unable to find a knife in the kitchen then. The Husband then dashed out of the kitchen towards the Wife in the living room and tried to beat her while uttering in Chinese the following words:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Today I want your life.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Two male church mates managed to hold the Husband down and tried to stop him from attacking the Wife. AW3 then told the Wife to transfer the Husband’s monies back to him and let him settle his gambling addictions himself. She did as told and after the Husband had checked that she had done so, the Husband left the flat. The Wife informed that the following day the Husband told her that he had gambled all his money away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     On the Husband’s multiple non-stop threats via WhatsApp and calls to the Wife, the Wife’s counsel submitted that these amounted to continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     On the Husband’s uttering of the words “Today I want your life”, he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt. The Husband had also attempted to hit the Wife but was stopped by the church mates. In so doing he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     At about 9 am, AW3 received a call from the Wife that the Husband had shouted and threatened the Wife that he would call the police and the “Anti scam” unit as the Wife had wrongfully withheld his monies. At about 6 pm he called the other 2 church mates and his wife (AW2) about the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In relation to this incident, all the 4 witnesses stated that they recalled an incident where the Husband had asked the Wife to control his spending due to his online gaming and gambling addiction and that the Husband had told the Wife to hold on to his monies and to only give him a daily sum of $20.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     AW3 informed that he asked the 3 other witnesses to meet up at the Wife’s flat to pray for the Wife and attempt to settle the matter amicably with the Husband. According to AW3 and the other 3 members, on reaching the flat, AW3 asked the Husband to sit down and have a talk. The Husband ignored him and went into the master bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     At about 10 minutes later, without any warning the Husband came out and shouted angrily at the Wife alleging that she had brought her church friends to go against him. Seeing the Wife very frightened, AW1 and AW3 quickly approached the Husband to calm him down and informed him that they were only trying to help the two resolve their problem. The Husband got very angry, hit the sofa, ran into the kitchen, opened and closed the drawer as if to look for something.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     When he came back into the room he tried to hit the Wife and said in Chinese the undermentioned words which was also heard by AW1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and AW3<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Today I want your life.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     AW4 stated in her affidavit that during the incident, she was distracted by two of the parties’ children who had looked out of their room and caused her to quickly approach and comfort them. AW2 clarified in her cross-examination that she actually heard the words from her husband (AW3) as she was beside him at that time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     AW1 and AW3 managed to get hold of the Husband and prevented him from hitting the Wife. Eventually, AW3 told the Wife to transfer back the Husband’s monies and upon doing so, the Husband left the flat with his bag.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Husband denied the allegations and that he did not call or scold the Wife or attempted to harm her with a knife. He did however send her a WhatsApp message at 8.36 am to express his unhappiness about her withholding his monies. He also did threaten to email her company if she continued to withhold his monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Husband’s counsel submitted that the Wife’s responses did not show that she felt threatened by the Husband’s messages or that she was feeling fearful. The Husband’s position was that he merely wanted the Wife to take him seriously and to transfer his money over to him so that he could use the money. He never intended to email the Wife’s supervisor and cause issues with her career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     As regards the witnesses’ evidence, there was no evidence of any threat with a knife involved and one of them did not in fact heard the Husband uttered the words alleged but learned that from one other witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Wife also failed and/or refused to provide the CCTV footage of this incident which took place at the parties’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     The Wife alleged that the Husband had threatened to call the Police and Anti scam unit as well as the bank as he alleged that she had withheld his monies. He allegedly bombarded the Wife with non-stop threats via WhatsApp and in so doing had continually harassed her with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Subsequently, the wife brought some church mates to the house where the Husband allegedly went to the kitchen to look for knives, attempted to hit the Wife and then uttered the words “today I want your life&quot;. He was restrained by two of the church members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The act of Husband threating to call the Police, “Anti scam” or bank does not amount to family violence. However, his attempt to hit her and the utterance of the words “Today I want your life&quot; amounted to family violence. His utterance of the threat was also heard by two of the witnesses present. There was thus family violence committed on this day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13 April 2024 incident </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     At about 2 pm, before the start of the church service, the parties went to shop for office wear for the Husband. On that day, the Wife told the Husband not to eat his &quot;Epam&quot; pills which he had bought off the street (in Geylang) instead of from a registered doctor. She was worried he would get an overdose. He got agitated and informed her that he was going to get beer instead. After some beers the Husband hurled vulgarities and abused her for restricting him from taking the pill. Due to the conduct of the Husband, she told him that she did not wish to continue shopping and decided to return home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Husband followed her back and upon reaching home, he got angry again and refused to let her leave the room. He told her not to challenge him and disallowed her to go to church anymore. Traumatized by his angry face, she quickly closed the door of the room. The Husband then lighted a piece of paper and pushed it beneath the opening of the door of the room she was in. Seeing that, she quickly opened the door as she thought that the Husband was trying to set the room on fire and burned her alive. For fear for her safety, she told the Husband that she would not stop him from taking his pills anymore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     The Husband then told her to change her clothes to “home” clothes as he was not going out anymore. She did as tell. He then told her to change back to “going out” clothes. She also did as told and this “change parade” was repeated four times on the instructions of the Husband. She then begged the Husband not to mentally torture her further and that she wanted to leave the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     At that point and to her horror, the Husband carried her up against her will, went to the corridor railing outside the flat, and wanted to throw her down the flat. She held on to the corridor rail and after much struggle, the Husband released her causing her to drop on the corridor floor, after which the Husband returned to the flat. The Wife then tried to call the church mates for assistance but unable to get any as they were all overseas at that time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Wife sent audio messages to her group via WhatsApp during the incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. Two messages read as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“I am locked in the room now. He does not allow me to go to church”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“He made me feel that he was going to kill me. He asked me to sit in the room until 9 pm. He said if I dared to go to church today, he would kill me. He was threatening me.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    In cross-examination, she stated that incident involving the lighted paper took place at about 4 plus in the afternoon and the “whole thing” ended at 5 plus in the afternoon. She did not take any photographs or video of the incident that happened earlier though she had her phone with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    When confronted with a photo taken from the Husband’s handphone at 5.02 pm which showed his location at the study corner of Ponggol library, she did not disagree that they were then at the library and that they must had left home prior to 5 pm and added that he was there only for 15 minutes. She was also shown another message from the Husband – “I will be at here de sofa” at 5.07 pm and “I’m at level 1” at 8.51 pm. Her evidence was that both parties went to church at 7 pm on that day. She disagreed that her evidence was fabricated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    Counsel submitted that by the Husband’s action of carrying the Wife against her will to the corridor railing outside the flat, his act of wanting to throw her down the flat and causing her to be dropped on the floor, he had caused hurt to her by an act that was known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Between 4 pm and 5 pm, while overseas, AW3 received a call from the Wife. She told him that the Husband had confined her in the master bedroom and refused to allow her to attend church. He further lighted a piece of paper and pushed the same beneath the door. AW2(AW3’s wife) gave evidence that at about 2 pm while overseas, he saw AW3 received a call from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    In cross examination, AW3 was shown the photo at page 32 of RA1 which showed a photo of the library and the message from the Husband stating “I at the study corner here” at 5.02 pm. AW3 commented that the church timing was 7 pm and that the Wife did not go to church as the Husband wanted to lock her in her bedroom until 9 o’clock. AW3 was referring to the message sent by the Wife to his group exhibited at page 41 Tab D which reads “He made me feel that he was going to kill me. He asked me to sit in the room until 9 pm.” AW3 was in Taiwan then and he stated that the Wife did not go to church on the basis that the other group members would inform him if she did not go<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    The Husband denied the allegations. He stated that it was not realistic for him to slide a piece of burning paper without burning himself. He did not suffer any burns that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    As he had ligature injuries and dislocated his shoulder twice, he would not be physically able to carry the Wife as alleged without injuring himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    On that day, the parties did go out at 2 pm to buy new clothes for him and that he did consume beer before walking back. On the way back, he told the Wife that he did not feel like going to church and instead wanted to go to the library to read some books. The Wife agreed and after reaching home thereafter, he had a short nap and thereafter went to the library together at around 4 pm. Thereafter they went for dinner and went home together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    His case was that the Wife had fabricated her version of what took place that day. Based on the Wife’s evidence during the cross examination and her affidavit, the parties had gone out around 2 pm to shop and subsequently returned home. There an argument ensued, and she averred that the lighting of the paper event happened at around 3:30 pm to 4 pm and the whole incident ended around 5:00 pm. However, the Husband had contemporaneous evidence to show that he was not at home on that day at 5:00 pm as he was already in the library. As per the Wife’s evidence, the library was located in Punggol. Based on this information, the time the Husband would have taken some time between 20 to 25 minutes to travel from the parties’ home to the Punggol library located at 1 Punggol Drive One. In this regard, the Husband should have at least left the house around 4:40pm. The Wife’s witnesses’ affidavits did not state that she went to Church after meeting the Husband at the library. More alarmingly, AW3 had mentioned during his cross examination that the Wife did not attend church on this day as he mentioned he would always be informed of who was in attendance for service on that day despite not being around physically.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    AW2 gave evidence that she saw AW3 received a call from the Wife at about 2 pm while AW3 gave evidence that it was between 4pm to 5 pm. I was of the view that the discrepancy in the timing was not fatal to the Wife’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    The Wife evidence was that she called her church mates for assistance after the Husband had dropped her at the corridor and went back to the flat. This would have taken place before the parties went together to the library. As regards the Husband’s photo showing “I’m at level 1” at 8.51 pm, it did not state the Husband’s location when this message was sent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    On the evidence given by AW3 that the Wife did not attend church that day, his assumption was likely due to the message he received from the Wife that the Husband had asked that she sat in room until 9 pm. He reasoned that his church group would inform him if she did not attend church. However, neither he nor the other witnesses were asked if the Wife did, in fact, not attend church on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    As regards the Husband claim that he could not have committed the acts due to his shoulder injury, I disbelieved him in view of the absence of any medical evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    I accepted the wife's version that the incidents happened before 4 pm after which the husband had ample time to make it to the library by 5 pm. I am of the view that the acts alleged by the Wife did take place and the Husband had committed family violence on this occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">29 February 2024 incident </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    On this day at about 7.48 pm, the Husband started accusing the Wife via WhatsApp that she had gambled, lend monies illegally and stole his money. He also demanded that she returned him his monies. Between 7.48 pm to 8.10 pm, he sent her a total of 13 WhatsApp messages. Between 8.13pm to 8.15 pm, the Husband further called her 8 times via WhatsApp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    The Wife got very afraid from the above acts and decided not to return to the flat and planned to do so only past midnight. She then called up the Husband’s mother to seek her assistance. The Wife was told that the Husband had gone up the parent’s house and immediately went to the kitchen to look for things. After the Husband had taken those things and put them into his bag, he dashed out of the parent’s house to look for the Wife. The Wife knew that the Husband was attempting to look for a weapon because she had personally witnessed him doing so many times previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    When the Wife returned to the said flat, she chanced upon his opened bag and found a can opener, a pair of scissors and a bread knife inside it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    The Wife’s counsel submitted that by making the repeated messages, the Husband had tormented, harassed and caused distress to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    On the sending of multiple messages, the Husband’s stated that the reason for his repeated messages was because he did not have enough money to eat, and the Wife was unwilling to transfer some monies to him. He was initially messaging the Wife to request that she provide him with his money for lunch as the Wife had been withholding his monies under the guise of wanting to limit his spending habit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    Counsel submitted that this was an isolated incident which did not meet the threshold of family violence as at no point in time during the tirade of text messages did the Husband threatened to cause harm on the Wife. It also did not seem that the Wife was intimidated by the Husband’s messages as she seemed to have stood her ground and asserted her position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    The Wife also elaborated in her 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit that she called the Husband’s mother for assistance and was told by Husband’s parents that he had went up their house and headed straight for the kitchen to look for things. Bearing in mind that the Wife was also not there to witness this, she stated that she immediately knew that the Husband was looking for a weapon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My Decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    On this day, the Husband was alleged to have sent the Wife 13 WhatsApp messages within 22 minutes and made 8 calls within 2 minutes. The Wife found out from the Husband's mother that the Husband had gone to his parent’s home and went to the kitchen to look for things. The Wife stated she knew that the Husband was looking for a weapon as she had personally seen such actions before. When she returned to the flat, she chanced upon his bag which contained a can opener, a pair of scissors and a bread knife. The Husband took the position that this incident is contrived and baseless.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    In my view, the continuing acts of the Husband sending repeated WhatsApp messages and calls did not amount to family violence. It was likely that his intention was to ask her for some monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    As for the items found in the bag by the Wife, there was no evidence that it was the Husband who had placed the bag there or the items found therein. I did not find any family violence committed based on this alleged incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">7 January 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    On 7th January 2024, the Wife received a WhatsApp message from a woman claiming to be the Husband’s girlfriend. She apologized to the Wife for intruding into their marriage. When questioned by the Wife on the message, the Husband grabbed hold of the Wife’s arm very tightly and instead of admitting his mistake, he turned very aggressive and threatened the Wife that he would kill the said woman.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    The Husband’s act of grabbing the Wife’s arm caused her to suffer bruises. Photographs of the bruise were exhibited in her affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. In cross-examination she confirmed that the Husband had repeatedly grabbed her arm in many places and caused multiple bruises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    The Wife subsequently made an appointment with the said woman to have a talk at the flat to clarify matters. The Husband agreed with the Wife but informed that he was going to kill the said woman and thereafter leave the country. On hearing this, she quickly knelt down and begged him not to do silly things and that she would forgive him and start over again. Later, she called her church mates to the flat and 4 of them went there before the appointed time. The said woman turned up as arranged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    When the said woman asked the Husband a simple question, he flared up, turned violent and randomly picked up an object nearby and tried to throw it at her. The Wife’s church mates managed to wrestle the said object from him. The Husband then kicked the said woman. The church mates tried to grab hold of him and pushed him away from the said woman to prevent him from hurting her further. This event was witnessed by the 4 witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    AW3 received a call from the Wife that a woman had contacted her and informed that she had a relationship with the Husband. AW3 then informed the other 3 church mates to meet up at the Wife’s flat as the Wife had told CW3 that she was afraid that the Husband might kill or hit the woman or even the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    The woman came to speak with the Wife and Husband. The 4 witnesses noted that the Husband was very angry and tried to pick a random object to throw at the woman but was stopped from doing so. He however managed to kick the woman before being restrained by AW3. He then heard the Wife telling the woman that it was impossible to hold any meaningful conversation with the Husband as he was mentally unstable. The woman thereafter left the place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    None of the 4 witnesses stated in their affidavit that they noticed any bruise on the Wife’s arm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    However, in cross-examination, AW2 was asked about the incident of 7 January, and it was pointed out to her that she did not state in the affidavit that she saw any bruise on the Wife. She confirmed that she had not stated so in her affidavit. However, in re-examination, when shown the photograph of the bruises<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> she stated that she did see the bruises on the Wife at the church. When further asked by the court, she clarified that she saw the actual bruise on her arm but could not remember when that was<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    The Wife’s counsel submitted that by the Husband’s act of grabbing the Wife’s arm very tightly and aggressively that caused her to arm to bruise, he had caused hurt to her by an act that he knew or ought to know would result in hurt. Counsel also submitted that by the Husband’s threat of wanting to kill the woman, he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    The Husband denied that he had grabbed the Wife’s arm and caused the bruises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    Counsel submitted that the photographs of the bruised arm did not have any date indicated and as such it could not be ascertained for sure that the bruises were caused by the Husband during the incident on that day. There was also no medical report to substantiate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My Decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband's act in threatening the wife that he was going to kill the woman and flee the country amounted to family violence. I was of the view that there was no family violence committed under the current definition when he threatened to kill the woman, a third party and a non-family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    However, on this day, the Wife had alleged that Husband caused her arm to bruise when he became aggressive and held her arm very tightly. She submitted photographs of the bruises which I accepted as evidence of his conduct. One of the Wife's witnesses, AW2 also confirmed that she saw the bruises on Wife 's arm at church. The absence of medical evidence was not fatal to her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    I was of the view that family violence had been committed by the Husband's act in holding the wife's hand so tight that it caused the bruises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">19 September 2021 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    On this day the parties had not been married. At around 9 pm, the Husband allegedly punched the Wife’s head causing her to sustain a laceration above the left eyebrow. She confirmed in cross-examination that she was punched once. In the medical report dated 29 August 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> obtained by her, it was stated that she sought medical attention at the hospital at around 9.55 pm where she was found to sustain a 1-cm laceration wound above her left eyebrow, treated and was given 3 days of medical leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    The Wife stated that she covered up the Husband conduct by informing the doctor that she tripped and fell at her home and her head hit the window frame. She did so as she wanted to preserve their relationship and was also afraid that the Husband may be arrested by the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    The Wife produced the following WhatsApp messages made with the Husband on the day of the incident as follow<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From the Wife at 21.54 pm:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Doctor said my injuries is very deep have to go for stitching, Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And it will leave a scar no matter how long, the scar will still be there. Thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">May have to go x-ray as my head scale goes in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please stop ruining people’s life. Go away far from me, plsss!!!!. 21.58</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From Husband at 22.27 pm:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“U know I never mean to injure u</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>What can I do to amend</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>I am sorry.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Kelly u say I ruin ur life</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Now u inside hospital, I sit down here wait for u.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    She disagreed with the Husband’s version that there had been a quarrel that day and she tripped and hit the left side of her head against the window ledge. He then took her to the hospital and had apologized as he felt guilty and that their “fight had indirectly caused (her) to hit”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    The Husband stated the parties were involved in an argument. The incident happened as mentioned in the medical note, that she had tripped and fell and her reason that she did not want the Husband to be in trouble should be weighed against her “constant inconsistencies” between her own affidavit and oral evidence and even with her witnesses during her cross-examination, and in view of that, there were reasons to believe that her version was doubtful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    Further, it was pointed out that she suffered a laceration and normally, it would be consistent to have bruising around the area if she was in fact punched. However as noted in the medical memo, there was no mention of any bruises or contusions. In this light, the Husband’s counsel submitted that her evidence was a contrived version of the events.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    Whilst there was inconsistency between the Wife’s narration of how she suffered the injury in the medical memo, the police report and her evidence at the hearing, what was telling was that in the WhatsApp messages between the two parties on the day of incident, the Husband had impliedly admitted to the alleged wrongdoing when he said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot;U know I never did mean it. I don't mean to injure u. What can I do to amend. I am sorry.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    I rejected the counsel’s contention that the Wife should have suffered bruises or contusions from the single punch instead of laceration as these were matters for expert medical opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_147\"></a>147    I noted that the parties were only married on 14 September 2022. While this occurred when the parties were not yet &quot;family members”, I was of the view that I could still take this incident into account in considering whether family violence &quot; is likely to be committed against a family member&quot;, that is, the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s application against the Wife (SS1511)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">30 July 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_148\"></a>148    In paragraph 30 of RA1, the Husband alleged that the Wife pushed him causing him to hit his head against the wooden door. This was during the time when the Wife felt suspicious of him going out to meet girls and also due to her being very controlling. At about 9 pm, as the Husband was about to go out to meet his friend, the Wife hit him on his stomach as she did not like his friend<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_149\"></a>149    In cross- examination, an issue of discrepancy was brought up relating to the version of events, whether the punching came first or the hitting of the head, or if they occurred at the same time. The Husband averred he might have been confused, and that the incident would have been captured by the CCTV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_150\"></a>150    She denied the allegations which was set out in a single paragraph of the Husband’s affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_151\"></a>151    Counsel submitted that there were factual discrepancies that indicated that the Husband was not truthful. In his police report of 2 August 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, he stated “she then walked past me and gave me a punch to my stomach and also pushed me on my chest causing me to hit my head on the wooden door. I felt pain but was not injured”. However, in his affidavit he stated “the (Wife) pushed me causing me to fall backwards and hit my head on the wooden door of our house and hit my head on the wooden door of our house. …. At around 9 pm on the same day, I was about to head out to meet my friend (A) when (the Wife) hit me on my stomach as she did not like my friend.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_152\"></a>152    As regards the injury, he stated that he felt pain only and was not injured in his police report. However, in cross-examination he stated that he was injured but the police report writer typed “was not injured” as he had told the officer that he had not seen a doctor yet<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My Decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_153\"></a>153    The Husband gave only a scanty detail of his allegations found in the 3 sentences in paragraph 8 of RA1. Despite that, they differed with the version he gave to the police in his police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_154\"></a>154    I was of the view that the discrepancies were material as they created doubts as to firstly, whether the two assaults took place at the same time or at separate times and secondly, whether he was punched before being pushed. The Husband reliance on the CCTV did not assist his case for the same reasons given earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_155\"></a>155    On the evidence I was not satisfied that there was family violence committed against the Husband on this day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1 August 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_156\"></a>156    This incident was dealt with in paragraphs 37 to 48. My decision was that there was no family violence committed by either party on this date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">21 August 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_157\"></a>157    It is to be noted that the complaint by the Husband in SS1511 was filed on 8 August 2024 and this allegation that took place on 21 August 2024 and the next incident mentioned below, took place on 18 September 2024. As the Wife’s did not raise any objection, I proceeded to hear these 2 allegations, instead of asking the Husband to file a fresh complaint which would further require part-heard or fresh hearing dates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_158\"></a>158    On 21 August 2024 at about 1.16 am, the Wife found the Husband standing outside her door when she came out and accused him of recording her conversations with the children. She forcibly snatched the handphone he was holding<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. This was admitted by the wife in her cross-examination. He claimed to have heard the Wife telling the children that he was dangerous and that they should stay away from him. He had audio recordings to prove the matter which were submitted in RA2. The Husband sought to show, in the audio recordings, that the Wife was the aggressor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_159\"></a>159    The Husband also pointed out that the Wife had not sought to provide her responses with regard to this incident in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit filed on CA2. The Wife had also agreed that the snatching of the phone could potentially cause harm and hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_160\"></a>160    While there was no response by the Wife in her affidavit, it was submitted on her behalf that she only did so because the Husband was recording her conversation with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_161\"></a>161    The Husband’s claim of being intimidated, fearful and emotional distressed as stated in paragraph 10 of RA1 were bare allegations which the Wife denied in its entirety and that there was no family violence committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_162\"></a>162    In this incident, the Husband main complaint was that the Wife had snatched his phone forcefully. The Wife admitted doing so as the Husband had secretly recorded her conversation with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_163\"></a>163    The Husband had raised that she failed to respond to his allegations made in his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit in RA1. I noted that RA1 was filed only on 6 January 2025, long before the Wife filed her affidavit on 25 September 2024 in response to SS1511. As the Wife had also addressed the matter in her submissions, such failure was not taken against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_164\"></a>164    I was of the view that the conduct of Wife in snatching the phone from the Husband whom she thought was recording conversations she was having with the children did not amount to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">18 September 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_165\"></a>165    The Husband claimed that the Wife had a tendency of being verbally abusive towards the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> On this day, his Stepdaughter send him a WhatsApp message to inform him that the Wife had been yelling at her for no reason and asked him to return home as soon as possible as she was feeling “really frightened”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_166\"></a>166    The messages <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> read as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From Stepdaughter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>19.26- Missed video call</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>23.11 Mummy keep on scolding me</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>23.13 This message was deleted</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23.35 I want you come back home [with Crying emoji]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From Husband:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23.51- dont cry girl you sleep early</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_167\"></a>167    In cross-examination, the Husband informed that at 7.26 pm, he did not know where the Stepdaughter was or what she was doing but agreed that at 11 pm, she was with the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_168\"></a>168    The Husband had also alleged that the Wife had verbally abused him in front of the children on many different occasions, calling him derogatory names, questioning his competence and making demeaning remarks. She also yelled at the children, called them names and use vulgar language<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. These had created an environment of fear and insecurity in the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_169\"></a>169    To support the Husband’s allegations, he submitted 3 audio recording in support of his case in all three applications <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_170\"></a>170    As regards the incident of 18 September, the Husband similarly pointed out that the Wife did not respond to this allegation in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_171\"></a>171    The Wife’s counsel submitted that the allegation of verbal abuse was twisted by the Husband for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_171-p2_i\"></a>i.     The Stepdaughter did not mention “yelling”. Her exact words sent at 11.11pm to the Husband were “mummy keep on scolding me.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_171-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     The Stepdaughter also did not state that she was feeling really frightened by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_171-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     After almost half an hour later, it was only at 11.51 pm that the Husband sent two messages to her and asked her not to cry (in response to her crying emoji) and to sleep early. On this, it was submitted by the Wife that the Husband must had felt so assured that he only sent two messages to the daughter instead of calling her or rushing back home, even though he was at work then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_172\"></a>172    The Wife’s position with regards to the allegations was that these were bare allegations which were denied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_173\"></a>173    This incident allegedly took place at 7.26 pm that day and continued till 11 pm. In gist, the Husband case was that the situation seemed to be dire enough and caused his Stepdaughter to have a significant amount of distress to have called the Husband. The Stepdaughter was not called to give evidence by the Husband. No vulgar words were used by the Wife in the incident. The Wife actions, in my view was insufficient to meet threshold of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_174\"></a>174    As regards the allegations raised in paragraph 7 of RA1, I agreed with the Wife these were bare allegations which had not been substantiated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_175\"></a>175    As regards the 3 audio recordings submitted in RA2, these did not assist the Husband in the three applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17 October 2023 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s Version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_176\"></a>176    The Husband alleged that there had been instances where the Wife would physically punish the children in an inappropriate and harmful manner citing that two of her children would be hit by a hanger by her if they disobeyed her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> He narrated that on 17 October 2023, the Wife had used a clothes hangar on the Son when he disobeyed her to the extent that the hangar broke into half and that he had to stop her to diffuse the situation. He also raised that the Wife had not refuted or address this allegation in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_177\"></a>177    The Husband also alleged that the Wife had vented her work stress on the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_178\"></a>178    The Wife submitted that the allegation of hitting the Son with a hanger as stated was a bare allegation without evidence and which the Wife denied in its entirety. She did not commit family violence on the Son as alleged. The allegation of venting out stress was also a bare allegation without evidence which the Wife denied in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_179\"></a>179    The allegation of family violence committed on the Son on 17 October 2023 was denied by the Wife. The allegation was made in just one sentence and thus scanty and devoid of particulars such that it was impossible for me to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Particulars of incidents not included in complaints.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_180\"></a>180    The Husband had also, in his closing submissions, raised the point that the Wife had relied on other incidents which were not included in her application in C1 and C2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_181\"></a>181    Unlike pleadings in civil cases, applicants are not expected to list all instances in their complaint. The Wife was thus not precluded from citing other past incidences for the purposes of the hearing. There was also no prejudice to the Husband as he had the opportunity to respond to those allegations which were not raised in C1 and C2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether a protection order is necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_182\"></a>182    In respect of SS1511, as I found that no family violence had been committed in all the allegations made, the Husband's application was wholly dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_183\"></a>183    In SS1475, the wife had applied for a protection order for herself and the Son. In SS1532 the Wife had applied for a protection order for herself as well as a domestic exclusion order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_184\"></a>184    There were 5 incidents of family violence committed by the Husband within a period of 9 months, that is, 7 January, 13 April, 23 April, 17 June and 9 August 2024 against 2 family members. I was satisfied that a protection order was necessary for the protection and safety of the Wife and the Son in respect of SS1475.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_185\"></a>185    In respect of the Wife’s application in SS1532 for a domestic exclusion order, I was of the view that the Husband’s acts of violence and the threats uttered involving the taking of one’s life, not on one but two occasions, were serious enough to warrant the issuance of a domestic exclusion order in addition to a protection order. Based on the circumstances of the allegations that had been proven, I was also satisfied that Wife would continue to be at risk if the Husband remained in the home and so ordered a domestic exclusion order against him for the whole flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_186\"></a>186    I also ordered both parties to attend counselling. No order as to cost was made as the Husband was legally aided.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>In section 58B(4)(a)-“Emotional or psychological abuse” means conduct or behaviour that-(a)torment, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>At RA1 at paragraphs 16 to 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (NE) at page 29 line 16 onwards.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>At RA1 page 28 Tab D.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid page 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE page 108 line 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>At RA1 page 7 para 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Ibid page 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, the law enforcement arm dealing with corruption.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>AW1 affidavit at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>AW3 affidavit at para 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE at page 76 line 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>CA1 at Tab D pages 39 to 42.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>NE at page 88 line 7 to line 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>CA1 at pages 50-53.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>CA1 page 50.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>NE page 90 line 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>CA1 at page 57.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Ibid at page 58.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>NE at page 25 line 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>RA1 at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Ibid page 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>NE page 137 line 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>The allegations could be found in paragraphs 10 and 11 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>This can be found in paragraph 12 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>These can be found at Tab-B at RA1 page 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>NE page 161 line 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_28_1\" id=\"Ftn_28\">[note: 28]</a></sup>These can be found in paragraph 7 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_29_1\" id=\"Ftn_29\">[note: 29]</a></sup>In his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit RA2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_30_1\" id=\"Ftn_30\">[note: 30]</a></sup>This incident could be found in paragraph 13 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_31_1\" id=\"Ftn_31\">[note: 31]</a></sup>In paragraph 14 of RA1.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement of show-payment orders – Applicable considerations"],"date":"2025-07-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS No. 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024","title":"WOC v WOD","citation":"[2025] SGFC 72","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33472-SSP.xml","counsel":["Applicant and Respondent in person."],"timestamp":"2025-07-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>WOC v WOD</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WOC <em>v</em> WOD </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33472-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 72</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

To enforce the payment of these arrears and the payable maintenance, the judge made the following orders (“<b>May Order</b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent was to pay the Proven Arrears by monthly instalments of $600/month for child maintenance (MSS 2158/2024) and $600/month for mutaah (MSS 2519/2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, the Respondent was to pay the payable maintenance at $1,063/month (MSS 2519/2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The above payments (totalling $2,263/month) were to be paid on the first day of each month, commencing from 1 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Respondent was to show payment for the payments in (a) and (b) above on three occasions – namely, 6 June 2025 (first show-payment), 7 July 2025 (second show-payment) and 6 August 2025 (last show-payment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In default of each show-payment for MSS 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024, the Respondent will have to serve one day’s imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Failure to comply with show-payment order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 2 June 2025 (i.e., four days before the first show-payment), the Respondent requested, via email, the Court to allow the relevant payments to be made on the 10<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> day of each month because of his company’s payment structure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 9 June 2025, the Court replied to the Respondent, via email, that he was to attend court on 12 June 2025 to show payment. In the email, the Court highlighted two things. <em>First</em>, that the Respondent could file an application to vary the May Order. <em>Second</em>, and importantly, that a “[f]ailure to attend Court proceedings will attract the usual consequences”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 12 June 2025, the Respondent failed to attend court. He did not provide any explanation for this absence either before or after the 12 June show-payment. A warrant to arrest was duly issued against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Respondent was arrested on 24 June 2025. He appeared before me on 1 July 2025 to explain his absence from court on 12 June and to address the show-payment issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At this juncture, I wish to make a few observations about show-payment proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     First, a show-payment order serves an important purpose. It allows a Court to monitor whether a person who has been ordered to pay maintenance (“<b>payor</b>”) complies with the order. The Court’s power to imprison a payor for failing to show payment can be a powerful incentive for obeying maintenance orders. For show-payment orders to serve their intended purpose, they <em>ought to be strictly enforced</em> unless there are good reasons not to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Second (and this point follows from the first), a <em>payor has the burden to prove</em> to the court’s satisfaction that he/she has duly complied with a show-payment order. For instance, if the order requires the payor to pay a specified amount into a specified bank account by a specified date, then he/she must be able to prove in a straightforward manner that these directions have been duly complied with. These requirements can be easily met, e.g., by producing the relevant bank transaction record. If a payor fails to clearly show such proof, then a court may find that payment has not been shown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Third, if a payor fails to show payment, then he/she must show <em>good cause</em> (i.e., good reason) for such a failure. Otherwise, he/she will have to serve the imprisonment term that has been imposed in default of show-payment. A <em>bare assertion</em> – e.g., that the payor cannot afford to pay – is not enough. There are at least three reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>One</em>, the amount of maintenance and arrears to be paid would have been determined either (i) with the payor’s consent or (ii) after a court has scrutinised his/her financial circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Two</em>, a relaxed attitude towards enforcing show-payment orders – e.g., allowing payors’ applications (i) to defer show-payment proceedings multiple times or (ii) to pay smaller amounts for each show-payment proceeding – can prejudice the beneficiary of a maintenance order. This is because “[m]aintenance orders are premised on the ongoing and immediate needs of the particular family; hardship may arise where arrears remain unpaid”: <em>VWB v VWA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29432-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 13</a> at [23]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Three</em>, a finding that good cause is shown so long as payment is made – even if it is made after the show-payment date – can allow vindictive payors to deliberately and repeatedly delay payments for the purpose of causing hardship to the beneficiary or for other ulterior motives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Finally, during show-payment/show cause hearings, payors sometimes claim that there has been a material change in their circumstances, and that this makes it difficult or impossible for them to comply with the maintenance orders or show-payment orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Often, such claims may be bare assertions or unmeritorious as the alleged new circumstances were already existent at the time of the enforcement order. In such cases, the Court will proceed to enforce the default imprisonment term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, if there is a genuine change of circumstance that makes it difficult or impossible to comply with the maintenance orders or show-payment orders, then the payor should consider applying to <em>vary</em> the maintenance order expeditiously. This is because a show-payment/show cause hearing is not suited to assess (i) the credibility of a claim of a material change in circumstances, and (ii) the payor’s financial circumstances. A variation application, on the other hand, will allow the payor and the beneficiary to properly present the relevant evidence and to effectively address the relevant issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applying the considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent has failed to show cause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having summarised the applicable considerations, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     At the outset, I note that the Respondent had given conflicting reasons for failing (1) to comply with the direction to show-payment on 12 June and (2) to attend court that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Initially, the Respondent claimed that he did not receive any notice to attend court on 12 June 2025. This claim is clearly untrue – as the Court had sent him an email in response to his own request for a postponement of the 6 June show-payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     When the Respondent was questioned regarding the Court’s email, he shifted his position. He admitted to having seen the email but claimed that it did not state that he had to attend court. Again, this claim is contradicted by the text of the email which I reproduce below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Dear Sir,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">We refer to the above matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    Please note that the matter was mentioned on 6 June 2025 and the Judge has directed you to show payment on the said date and time as below:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.89842031593681%\"><col width=\"39.4721055788842%\"><col width=\"28.9342131573685%\"><col width=\"23.6952609478104%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court Event</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Date/Time</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>Venue</em></b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Show Payments</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($1663.00 in MSS2518/2024 and $600.00 in MSS2519/2024)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>12 June 2025</em> / 10.30AM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>FJC Service HUB (Counter 8)</em> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Note: The Court has provided this one-time exception for you to <em>attend Court</em> for Show Payment on the above date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"> <em>You may file for a Variation online</em> using your Singpass <em>to vary the terms of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.     <em>Failure to attend Court proceedings will attract the usual consequences.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[italics added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the Respondent was referred to the above text, he changed his position, again. This time, he claimed – astonishingly – that his intention was to show payment only when he had sufficient funds to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In my view, the Respondent had failed to show cause. Based on his explanations, it appears that the Respondent (a) did not give due regard to court orders and court emails, (b) did not take his obligation to pay maintenance and show payment seriously, and/or (c) was making up excuses along the way. In the circumstances, I find it appropriate to enforce the default imprisonment term on the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In coming to this finding, I am mindful that the Respondent did <em>eventually</em> make payment of –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,000 on 13 June – i.e., after the Court had ordered a warrant of arrest to be issued against him, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $1,263 on 30 June – i.e., on the eve of the show cause hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     When questioned about the late payments, the Respondent claimed that he was facing financial difficulties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, the Respondent has failed to show good cause for making the payments late.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent did not provide any evidence to substantiate his bare assertion about his alleged financial difficulties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Indeed, I note that the Respondent had made a similar assertion before the trial judge in May 2025. The judge disbelieved it. This is because – according to the judge – the Respondent had intentionally failed to disclose the full extent of his income and liabilities in the proceedings before her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, the Respondent has multiple food businesses. There is no evidence to show that he was completely unable to comply with the May Order – even if his business was not doing well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     That said, I did grant a concession to the Respondent for having made the June payments (although belatedly) – by ordering the two terms of imprisonment for MSS 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024 to run concurrently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s request</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     During the hearing, the Applicant requested that I make an order to enforce the payment of the Proven Arrears in full. She made this request because she is stressed that the Respondent had repeatedly failed to pay maintenance and had dragged out the enforcement process. She also highlighted that despite being allowed to pay the Proven Arrears in instalments, he has defaulted on the very first instalment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am not prepared to make the order that the Applicant had requested. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I note from the records that when making the May Order, the trial judge <em>had in fact considered – and decided against</em> – ordering the Respondent to pay the Proven Arrears in one lump sum. This is because she had found that he would be unable to do so and had thus ordered him to pay the arrears by instalments instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, in the absence of evidence and a proper investigation into the Respondent’s current financial circumstances, I have no basis to arbitrarily decide that the Respondent can now pay the Proven Arrears in one lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, it bears highlighting that the purpose of a show-payment proceeding is to enforce a show-payment order made by an earlier court. Such a proceeding is neither intended nor equipped to conduct a full hearing to determine afresh how payment of the Proven Arrears is to be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the show-payment order by the trial judge is <em>still subsisting.</em> There are two more show-payments – on 7 July and 6 August. In the circumstances, that order will have to run its course.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     During the hearing, parties had expressed dissatisfaction with the present status. The Respondent claimed that he did not have the means to comply with the May Order and would end up having to repeatedly serve imprisonment in default of making the instalment payments. On the Applicant’s side, she found the May Order to be ineffective in ensuring that the Proven Arrears will be paid fully and in a timely manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Regarding the Respondent’s dissatisfaction, the Court had already informed him on 9 June 2025 that he can apply to vary the May Order: see [15(b)] above. When I reminded him of this option during the hearing, the Respondent gave a surprising reply – that he had businesses to run and could not afford to take time off to make a variation application. It appears that the Respondent is prepared to be imprisoned rather than prove that he genuinely cannot afford to pay the Proven Arrears.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As for the Wife, she can apply to enforce the full payment of the Proven Arrears after the show-payment order lapses – which will be soon, in about a month’s time. It bears noting that such an application will be governed by the enhanced maintenance enforcement framework. Under this framework (which was introduced in January 2025), a maintenance enforcement officer has extensive powers to assist the court to scrutinise the Respondent’s finances and means to pay both the Proven Arrears and the ongoing maintenance. Such an application, if made, can allow the relevant issues to properly ventilated and the evidence rigorously scrutinised in a hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Finally, I wish to stress that Courts take a serious view regarding non-compliance with maintenance orders and show-payment orders. Such non-compliance has a corrosive effect on respect for court orders and confidence in our maintenance regime. Further, a failure to pay maintenance can cause hardship to their intended beneficiaries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It is aggravating if a payor <em>can</em> make pay the maintenance but <em>refuses</em> to do so or <em>deliberately delays</em> making timely payments. Such conduct is especially reprehensible where child maintenance is involved – as it directly harms a child’s interests. Payors who engage in such conduct can expect to receive longer imprisonment terms.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Interlocutory applications – Family Justice Rules 2014"],"date":"2025-07-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2012 of 2024 (Summons Nos 578 and 1003 of 2025)","title":"XOK v XOL","citation":"[2025] SGFC 71","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33471-SSP.xml","counsel":["Pang Khin Wee (Peng Qinwei) and Leong Zhen Yang (I.R.B Law LLP) for the plaintiff","Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma (Fleet Street Law LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-07-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Allen Chong","html":"<root><head><title>XOK v XOL</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XOK <em>v</em> XOL </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33471-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 71</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2012 of 2024 (Summons Nos 578 and 1003 of 2025)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">01 July 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Allen Chong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Pang Khin Wee (Peng Qinwei) and Leong Zhen Yang (I.R.B Law LLP) for the plaintiff; Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma (Fleet Street Law LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XOK — XOL </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Affidavits</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interlocutory applications</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Justice Rules 2014</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">1 July 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Allen Chong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The two present interlocutory applications raise a narrow point in family procedure: is <em>leave of court required when affidavits are filed in support of a summons application?</em> This is governed by r 42 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR 2014</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In <em>WWM v WWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> (“<b><em>WWM</em></b>”), the High Court held in the context of ancillary matters (“<b>AM</b>”) proceedings that any non-party affidavit outside the parties’ respective affidavits of assets and means (“<b>AM affidavits</b>”) (and, in particular, a child’s affidavit) can only be filed with the court’s prior leave pursuant to r 89(3) of the FJR 2014.

The outcome of this application determines whether the children’s affidavits filed in SUM 578 (being the 17 and 18 April affidavits filed for the purposes of SUM 1003) can even remain on the record when this Court decides on SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1003</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Leave of court is not required to file non-party affidavits (including children’s affidavits) in support of a summons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Rule 89(3) of the FJR 2014 governs the filing of affidavits in AM proceedings and requires parties to obtain leave of court before filing affidavits apart from the AM affidavits. This rule provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Filing of Affidavit of Assets and Means and reply affidavit</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">89.—(1)    Where there is an application for ancillary relief by a plaintiff or defendant, the parties must, if the Court so orders, file and exchange an Affidavit of Assets and Means —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    in such manner as the Registrar may direct; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    within such period as the Court may direct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    On the exchange of the Affidavits of Assets and Means, a party may file and serve on the other party a reply affidavit to the other party’s Affidavit of Assets and Means within such time as the Court may direct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    An application for leave under paragraph (3) must be by way of summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Rules 63 to 77 apply to any application for discovery, interrogatories or inspection relating to an Affidavit of Assets and Means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    An order for the filing of an Affidavit of Assets and Means must not be made before the granting of an interim judgment, unless the Court is of the view that such an order is necessary or desirable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The High Court has in <em>WWM</em> held (at [4]) that the plain wording of rr 89(2) and 89(3) of the FJR 2014 provides for a total of two rounds of AM affidavits by each party and any further affidavits beyond these require the leave of court. Accordingly, this means that leave is required for the filing of non-parties’ (<em>eg</em>, children’s) affidavits in court, at least for the purposes of AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Stepping outside the context of AM proceedings and for the purposes of SUM 1003, the provision applicable for the filing of affidavits for <em>summonses</em> (and originating summonses) is r 42 of the FJR 2014 which provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Filing of affidavits in originating summons or summons</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42.—(1)    Unless the Court otherwise directs, a plaintiff or an applicant who intends to adduce evidence in support of an originating summons or a summons in Form 4 must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The plaintiff or applicant must —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    file the affidavit at the time of filing the originating summons or summons, as the case may be; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    serve a copy of the originating summons or summons together with the supporting affidavit, on every defendant or respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The defendant or respondent who intends to adduce evidence with reference to the originating summons or summons served on him must file an affidavit-in-reply and serve a copy of it on the plaintiff or applicant not later than —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    in the case of an originating summons, 21 days after being served a copy of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s affidavit under paragraph (2); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    in the case of a summons, 14 days after being served a copy of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s affidavit under paragraph (2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where the defendant or respondent has served a copy of an affidavit-in-reply in respect of an originating summons filed by a plaintiff or applicant, the plaintiff or applicant may not file a further affidavit without the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Unless the Court otherwise directs, where the defendant or respondent has served a copy of an affidavit-in-reply in respect of a summons filed by a plaintiff or applicant, the plaintiff or applicant may file a further affidavit and serve a copy of the affidavit on the defendant or respondent within 14 days after being served with the affidavit-in-reply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    This rule shall not apply to any Affidavit of Assets and Means or reply affidavit filed under rule 89.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   The restrictive and permissive readings of r 42 of the FJR 2014</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The fork in the road is whether r 42 of the FJR 2014 establishes the requirement for a party to obtain the leave of court before filing any affidavit sworn/affirmed by a deponent who is not a party. Two contrasting positions emerge:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Leave is required:</b> Rule 42 of the FJR 2014 confines affidavits to those sworn by the parties <em>themselves</em>. A non-party affidavit may be filed only with the court’s prior leave. I call this the “restrictive reading” of r 42. I understand this to be the defendant’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Leave is not required:</b> Rule 42 of the FJR 2014 regulates the sequence and number of rounds of affidavits, not the identity of the deponent. At each round, parties may file non-party affidavits without first seeking the leave of court. I refer to this as the “permissive reading” of r 42. I understand this to be the plaintiff’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   The permissive reading of r 42 ought to be preferred</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In my view, the <em>permissive reading</em> of r 42 ought to be preferred. Before I set out my reasons below, I note that r 42 governs the procedure for the filing of affidavits for <em>both</em> originating summonses and summonses. The present dispute in SUM 1003, however, arises solely from the filing of non-party affidavits in a <em>summons</em> (<em>ie</em>, SUM 578). My analysis and more specifically, any construction I place on r 42, therefore, relates to the operation of the rule in the context of a <em>summons</em> filed in the course of an existing action. To the extent that my views touch on how r 42 applies to affidavits filed for the purposes of originating summonses, these views are made by way of <em>obiter</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   The purposive interpretative approach applies to r 42 of the FJR 2014</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The FJR 2014 are subsidiary legislation. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>IA</b>”) provides that the starting point for ascertaining the meaning of such legislation is the ordinary meaning of its words, taking into account its context: <em>Reignwood International Investment (Group) Co Ltd v Opus Tiger 1 Pte Ltd and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26165-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHC 133</a> at [64], citing <em>Tang Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the outset, I note that according to the Table of Derivations in the FJR 2014, r 42 is derived from Rule 5A of the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules 2006 (Cap. 353, R4) (“<b>MPR</b>”). This rule was introduced via r 19 of the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) (Amendment) Rules 2013 (G.N. No. S 676/2013) and which came into operation on 2 December 2013. There appears to have been no preparatory materials released on the formulation of this specific rule in r 5A of the MPR (save for one article written about the rule which could potentially shed light on the intent behind this rule, which I deal with below at [25]). The further submissions of both counsels have also not referred me to any such materials. As has been observed by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <em>ANB v ANF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0001.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 1</a> at [22] relation to the Rules of Court 2014 (“<b>ROC 2014</b>”), such rules are typically drafted and introduced by a Rules Committee and the proceedings of this committee are confidential. There is no equivalent of the Hansard or other preparatory materials that can be used to interpret any particular provision of the Rules of Court (or the MPR or the FJR 2014 for that matter). In such circumstances, resort must be had to case law or academic commentary, where relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Rule 42 of the FJR 2014 governs the sequence of steps for the exchange of affidavit evidence and does not speak to the identity of deponents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, the ordinary meaning of r 42, read within its <em>context</em>, establishes the <em>sequence</em> of steps for the exchange of affidavit evidence in applications begun by summonses. The sequence is as follows (see <em>Chong Yeo and Partners and another v Guan Ming Hardware and Engineering Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0030.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 30</a> (“<b><em>Chong Yeo</em></b>”) at [67], as to how applications for summary judgment under O 14 r 2 of the Rules of Court 1996 (and by extension, ROC 2014) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> establishes a “three-stage process” for the filing of affidavits for such applications):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The plaintiff or applicant must file any evidence together with the summons by way of a supporting affidavit (rr 42(1) and 42(2) of the FJR 2014). This represents the first step in the sequence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Next, the defendant or respondent has 14 days from service of that summons to file and serve an affidavit-in-reply (r 42(3)(b) of the FJR 2014).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, if such affidavit-in-reply is served on the applicant, the plaintiff or applicant is entitled, and within the next 14 days, to put in his final reply affidavit (r 42(5) of the FJR 2014).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Rule 42 is silent as to whether any leave of court is required before non-parties’ affidavits may be filed. In other words, r 42 is silent as to the <em>identity</em> of a person who may depose to an affidavit to be relied on for the purposes of a summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I would distinguish <em>WMM</em> on the basis that, it is a decision relating strictly to the filing of affidavits for the purposes of AM proceedings. There, the High Court held that according to r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 there is a requirement for leave to be granted before a party may file any affidavit beyond the parties’ respective AM affidavits. In my view, that decision does not take the defendant’s case for the restrictive reading very far. Rule 89 concerns the procedure for the filing of AM affidavits <em>in the context of AM proceedings</em>. These are matters intrinsically personal to the parties in the sense that only the assets and means of the parties concerned. These are matters which the parties should be able to shed light on by way of their own evidence. A related point of observation is that the family court’s powers under s 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed), which often features in AM proceedings and is a key provision apart from the other powers of the family court under Chapter 4 of the same Act, is limited only to the division of matrimonial assets belonging to the <em>parties of the marriage</em>, not property belonging to third parties. This point was the subject of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <em>UDA v UDB and</em> another <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]. To my mind, these pointers explain why affidavits for the purposes of AM proceedings should rightly be generally limited to affidavits sworn by the parties themselves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     By contrast, r 42 governs a <em>broader</em> type of proceedings (namely, summonses) as opposed to the determination of ancillary matters. By its very nature, summonses can come in much more varied forms, involving a broader set of legal issues than merely issues arising in the context of ancillary relief. Typically, ancillary relief is confined to division of matrimonial assets, maintenance and children’s issues. Thus, it is conceivable that in summonses, evidence from a wider pool of sources with personal knowledge of the facts (for example, solicitors, parents, children, teachers, among other possible individuals) may potentially be useful to deal with the varied issues that arise. This aligns with the rationale underlying the regime for summary judgment applications under O 14 r 2 of the ROC 2014 (see below at [21]) which permits the filing of multiple affidavits on the premise that no single person would likely have knowledge of all the facts. This is quite unlike that of the AM proceedings, where matters may sometimes even proceed based on the AM affidavits of one party (<em>eg</em>, where the other party is absent). Hence, I do not think that this logic, which underpins r 89, transposes perfectly onto r 42.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Furthermore, there is, in any case, a <em>contrast</em> in the wording employed in r 42 and r 89. Rule 89(3) employs mandatory, exclusionary language: “No further affidavit <em>shall be received in evidence</em> without the leave of the Court.” (emphasis added). The formulation in r 89(3) goes so far as to make leave of court a precondition to the <em>admissibility</em> of any additional affidavit on top of the parties’ respective AM affidavits into <em>evidence</em>. This provision can be arguably said to extend as far as to regulate the evidential status of any affidavit filed that is not an AM affidavit of the parties and the <em>identity</em> of the deponent of affidavits. The High Court in <em>WMM</em> was thus quite right when it held that r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 requires parties to obtain leave of court before non-party affidavits may be filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Rule 42, in contradistinction to r 89(3) of the FJR 2014, is drafted differently. First of all, any parallel wording to that found in r 89(3) is found <em>only</em> in r 42(4) and that this is a provision that, strictly speaking, applies to the filing of affidavits in <em>originating summonses</em>. Further, the language used is framed in a non-mandatory manner: “the plaintiff or applicant <em>may</em> not file a further affidavit without leave.” (emphasis added) and appears, at least based on the express wording, to speak only to the <em>filing</em> of such affidavits, not their reception into evidence. In any event and more critically, when we look at the provisions in r 42 that are applicable to <em>summonses</em>, <em>ie</em>, r 42(1), 42(2), 42(3)(b) or 42(5) of the FJR 2014), none of these provisions even contain express language suggesting that plaintiff or applicant may not file a further affidavit without the leave of the Court (as is provided for in the case of originating summonses). Indeed, this is an argument forming a core part of the plaintiff counsel, Mr Leong Zhen Yang’s submissions before me at the second tranche of the hearing on 26 June 2025. This argument further weakens the defendant’s case for the restrictive reading which is based on an analogy with the High Court’s decision in <em>WMM</em> and its reading of r 89(3), a provision which does contain such language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The silence in the text regarding whether leave of court is required for the purposes of affidavits filed in <em>summonses</em> suggests that a lighter touch may have been adopted for summonses than for AM proceedings. Such silence mirrors the position in summary judgment applications under O 14 of the ROC 2014, which are themselves commenced by way of summons. Order 14 rule 2(1) requires the plaintiff to support the summons with “an affidavit or affidavits”, while O 14 r 2(6) imposes a leave filter only after each side has filed their affidavits as prescribed in the three stages (supporting affidavit (O 14 r 2(2)), reply affidavit (O 14 r 2(3) and (4)) and finally, final reply affidavit (O 14 r 2(5)) under O 14 r 2. Commentary on O 14 explains that there is no limit on the number of supporting affidavits precisely because no single person would have knowledge of all the facts: see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</em> vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020) at para 14/2/6, citing <em>Chong Yeo</em>. In other words, this provision recognises that interlocutory evidence may often come from multiple witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     A comparison with trial procedure also reinforces the point. At trial, parties are not confined to affidavits sworn by themselves; they are left unrestricted to file (and exchange) factual witness affidavits (or Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief) originating from persons with relevant evidence, subject only to the opposing party’s right to seek the exclusion of such evidence where, for example, the prejudicial effect outweighs probative value or the evidence is otherwise inadmissible under any ground recognised at law. The permissive reading of r 42, to my mind, better aligns the procedure applicable to summons (and also perhaps, originating summonses) with that already established for the trial process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To build on the point that a lighter touch may have been adopted for summonses with regards to the filing of affidavits, I observe that such applications deal primarily with procedural matters which must often be heard on short notice (<em>eg</em>, Mareva injunctions), and crucially, produce findings which are typically interlocutory in nature (and hence are strictly speaking, non-binding) on the eventual hearing of the merits. To accommodate this unique nature of interlocutory applications (which includes summonses, and in some cases, even originating summonses provided that they do not determine the rights of parties: for the test to determine an “interlocutory proceeding”, see <em>MUI Bank Bhd v Alkner Investments Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/41523-M.xml')\">[1990] 3 MLJ 385</a> at 387–388; <em>“The Ocean Jade”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0354.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 354</a> at [86]; see also <em>Gobi a/l Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25180-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 883</a> at [56] (“<b><em>Gobi a/l Avedian</em></b>”) at [61], where an originating summons (<em>vide</em> HC/OS 111/2020) involving an application for leave to commence judicial review was treated as “interlocutory proceedings”), the law takes a relaxed approach to the evidence admitted in this context by providing that hearsay is admissible at the interlocutory stage such that affidavits may even be sworn on the information or belief of a deponent provided the deponent discloses the grounds and source of said information or belief: see r 646(2) of the FJR 2014; see also O 41 r 5(2) of the ROC 2014; <em>State Bank of India Singapore v Rainforest Trading Ltd and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0182.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 182</a> at [43]; <em>Gobi a/l Avedian</em> at [56]. If the law is prepared to accept such hearsay evidence from a deponent lacking personal knowledge of matters, it would be quite inconsistent and also against judicial economy to insist that a deponent with first-hand knowledge of matters of concern to an interlocutory application (even if it may be a child) can only be heard after a <em>separate</em> leave application and potentially, another contested hearing has been heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In a related vein, I highlight Part 3 of the FJR 2014 which mandates a judge-led approach in family proceedings aimed at the just, expeditious and economical disposal of proceedings. While not quite enshrined at the same level of O 3 r 1 of the Rules of Court 2021 (“<b>ROC 2021</b>”) under which the “Ideals” such as expeditious proceedings (O 3 r 1(2)(<em>b</em>)) serve as the lodestars in the interpretation of those Rules, I highlight that a permissive reading of r 42 of the FJR 2014 nonetheless aligns with the judge-led approach which enlivens the approach to family proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In connection with the point on the expeditious and economical disposal of proceedings, there is an article published on the Singapore Law Gazette by then-District Judge and Deputy Registrar of the Family and Juvenile Justice Division of the Subordinate Courts, Ms Regina Ow-Chang Yee Lin, “The Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Amendment Rules 2013” (https://v1.lawgazette.com.sg/2013-12/919.htm). While not qualifying as a preparatory material of the MPR, this academic commentary sheds light on the intent behind the introduction of the r 5A of the MPR (from which r 42 of FJR 2014) was derived to “allow the summons to be managed more effectively and be heard expeditiously”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Affidavit in Support to be Filed with the Originating Summons/Summons</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A new rule r 5A(1) has been introduced to provide that the affidavit in support of an originating summons or summons must be filed at the time of the filing of the originating summons or the summons. Filing the affidavit in support together with the application reduces any delay in fixing the case for either pre-trial conference or hearing. Adjournments which may be occasioned by the late filing of the affidavit in support will be reduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Changes Affecting Timeframes</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Timeframe to File the Affidavit in Reply to an Originating Summons</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A new r 5A(2)(<em>a</em>) prescribes the timeframe of 21 days for the defendant to file and serve the affidavits in reply to an originating summons. No further affidavit is to be filed without leave of Court. This mirrors the procedure in the ROC which is applicable to an originating summons filed under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Mental Capacity Act (which are also heard in the Family Court). This consistent approach for all types of originating summons in the Family Court will make it easier for lawyers and parties. </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Timeframe to File the Affidavit in Reply to a Summons</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Most of the summonses under the MPR are for applications for interim maintenance, interim custody, care and control of children and for the variation of ancillary orders. These applications touch on the financial needs of parties and the welfare of children. As such, they are best dealt with expeditiously without any delay.</em> Pursuant to new r 5A(2)(b), the respondent to a summons has to file an affidavit in reply within 14 days after service of the affidavit in support. Thus when the summons is discussed at the Case Conference (fixed within four weeks from the filing of the summons), the positions of both parties are laid out in their respective affidavits and the Court may assist the parties in discussing settlement of the disputed issues. <em>This will also allow the summons to be managed more effectively and be heard expeditiously.</em> Any affidavits to be filed subsequently require the leave of Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I make three observations. First, the commentary above appears to support the analysis that r 5A of the MPR goes towards only the <em>timeframe</em> of the affidavits to be filed. This is consistent with a reading that the rule governs only the <em>sequence</em> of affidavits to be filed, and the time mandated for doing so. Second, the point that “Any affidavits to be filed <em>subsequently</em> require the leave of Court.” (emphasis added), also lends support to the permissive reading of r 5A (and in turn r 42) in that only affidavits filed past the sequence delineated by the rule would be caught by the leave requirement. Third, the observation that of applications touch on the financial needs of parties and the welfare of <em>children</em> and that they are best dealt with expeditiously without any delay. A permissive reading of r 42 better serves this imperative. It allows evidence from non-parties (especially children) with direct personal knowledge to be placed directly before the court. This avoids satellite litigation over leave applications that would arise under the restrictive reading of r 42, enabling the court to deal with the application expeditiously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Seen in the wider jurisprudential context as set out above, I am of the view that reading r 42 of the FJR 2014 permissively would better align family law procedure with the approach taken in the wider civil procedure practice (or at the very least, summary judgment summonses). There is sense in allowing a litigant to choose the deponent best placed to prove the relevant facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It may be plausibly argued that O 14 r 2 of the ROC 2014 permits the filing of multiple affidavits (including those of non-parties) <em>only</em> because the express text of those rules provides for this through its reference to “affidavits” in the <em>plural</em> (“affidavit or <em>affidavits</em>”). By parity of reasoning, an argument may thus be advanced as the defendant’s counsel, Mr Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma, had done at the hearing before me, that the omission of “affidavits” in the plural under r 42 of the FJR 2014 means that only <em>one</em> affidavit (<em>ie</em>, the parties’ affidavit) may be filed at each sequence of the process. To assist the reader, I reproduce O 14 r 2 of the ROC 2014 which reference “affidavits” in the plural:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Manner in which application under Rule 1 must be made (O.14, r.2)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.—(1)    An application under Rule 1 must be made by summons supported by an affidavit or <em>affidavits</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The summons and the supporting affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> must be filed at the same time, and must be served on the defendant within 3 days from the date of filing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The defendant on whom the summons and the supporting affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> have been served may show cause against the plaintiff’s application by affidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    If the defendant wishes to show cause against the plaintiff’s application by affidavit, he must file and serve his affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> on the plaintiff within 14 days after service of the plaintiff’s summons and affidavit or affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The plaintiff must, if he wishes to reply to the defendant’s affidavit or <em>affidavits</em>, file and serve his affidavit or affidavits on the defendant within 14 days after service of the defendant’s affidavit or affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>6</em>)     <em>No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)    Where a party files or serves an affidavit beyond the period of time specified in this Rule, the Court may make such order as to costs against that party as it considers fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(8)    An affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> for the purpose of this Rule must contain all necessary evidence in support of or in opposition (as the case may be) to the claim, or a part of the claim, to which the application relates, and unless the Court otherwise directs, may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and grounds thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, I do not consider the absence of any reference to “affidavits” in the plural in r 42 to be fatal to the permissive reading. Again, r 42 merely governs the <em>sequence</em> of affidavits to be filed by the respective parties (see above at [(4)]) and does not speak to the identity of the deponent of any affidavit relied on. Further, and in any event, s 9 of the IA provides that “words in the singular include the plural”. The reference to “affidavit” in the singular thus does not preclude the same from being read in its plural sense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Notwithstanding my finding above that the permissive reading should apply to r 42 of the FJR 2014, I remain cognisant of the concerns raised by the defendant’s counsel regarding the hesitance which the court must have in admitting children’s affidavit given concerns over whether such evidence have been given voluntarily. As to this, I observe that even after a further affidavit (in the form of the children’s affidavit, as in this case) has been admitted filed, the court is not obliged to lend full weight to its contents. In <em>Equatorial Marine Fuel Management Services Pte Ltd v The “Bunga Melati 5”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0193.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 193</a> at [65], the learned AR observed that a court is not required to treat every affidavit filed as true and at face value. The court may in appropriate circumstances reject the evidence contained therein, even in the context of an interlocutory application, citing <em>Paclantic v Moscow Narodny Bank</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/15203-E-M.xml')\">[1983] 1 WLR 1063</a> at 1067. Likewise, the High Court in <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0008.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 8</a> at [24] approved the proposition from <em>Microsoft Corporation v Electro-Wide Limited</em> [1997] FSR 580 (at 594) that a court is not obliged to suspend its critical faculties merely because a defence (in the context of a summary judgment application) is supported by a sworn affidavit. Where the affidavit is contradicted by contemporaneous documents or is inherently implausible, the court must find so. Indeed, even for cases before the family courts, r 647 of the FJR 2014 vests the court with the power to strike out affidavits or any part of the same which are “irrelevant”. These authorities underscore that admitting a child’s affidavit under the permissive reading of r 42 does not compel the court to accept its contents uncritically. The defendant’s concerns regarding the reliability of the children’s affidavit filed in this case can therefore be addressed through the application of these principles. There is no need to adopt a restrictive reading of r 42 of the FJR 2014, which would require leave of court (and possibly a contested hearing) for <em>all</em> non-party affidavits filed for the purposes of summonses (or perhaps, originating summonses).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Finally, insofar as the defendant suggests that only <em>children’s</em> affidavit should be given special treatment due to the dangers of relying on such evidence, I do not agree that any interpretation of r 42 can be contingent on the nature of affidavit concerned. The dispute over r 42 is a binary one: <em>does the provision permit an applicant to file a non-party affidavit without leave of court (the permissive reading) or does it forbid any such filing without leave of court (the restrictive reading)?</em> That fork operates at a broad level of procedure concerning whether a non-party affidavit may be filed without leave of court; it does not operate at the level which touches on the specific identity of said non-party. To this, nothing in the text of r 42 suggests that its operation turns on whether the deponent is a child or any other possible categories of witnesses such as parents, teachers, an account, or a solicitor. Again (as stated above at [16]), r 42 is silent as to the identity of the deponent of affidavits filed. Accordingly, whichever construction one adopts of r 42, it must apply across the board to all non-party affidavits. The decision in <em>WWM</em> illustrates this. Although the affidavits at issue there happened to originate from children, the High Court had held (at [4]) that in the AM context, r 89(3) only envisages the AM affidavits of the parties themselves. “Any others” (which I highlight includes both children’s and even non-children’s affidavits) may only be filed with the leave of court. This appears also to have been the case pitched by the wife’s counsel in that case as the argument advanced there was that “that on a purposive interpretation of r 89 FJR, no leave is required for <em>non-parties</em> to file affidavits in court.” (emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For the reasons above, I hold that the permissive reading applies to r 42 of the FJR 2014. No leave of court is required before a party may file a non-party (including children’s affidavit) for the purposes of a summons application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     One may then ask: <em>what is the position for whether leave of court is required for the filing of non-party affidavits for summonses under the new regime under the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 (“</em><b><em>FJ(G)R 2024</em></b><em>”)?</em> This will be an important issue for a future court to decide as most summonses proceeding through the courts will be under the new regime. As this issue is not necessary for my decision, I would only point out that P 5 r 15(7) of the FJ(G)R 2024 which governs summonses in originating applications appears to substantially adopt the same language used in r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 in providing that “Except in a special case, no further affidavit is to be received in evidence without the Court’s approval.” I leave the question of whether this mandatory language means that a similar interpretation adopted for r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 should also apply to summonses filed under the FJ(G)R 2024 regime, namely, that the filing of non-party affidavits requires the leave of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(5)   No determination on the issue of whether the leave granted by the AR on 3 April 2025 covered the children’s affidavit filed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Before leaving this section and for completeness, I address the defendant’s argument that they had, in any event, obtained such leave at the case conference on 3 April 2025 for the filing of the children’s affidavit. While the AR had granted leave for the filing of a reply affidavit, I note that there is a dispute as to whether such leave was <em>restricted</em> to the plaintiff’s filing of a reply affidavit or whether it takes into account the filing of the children’s affidavit. Both the plaintiff and defendant’s counsel take diametrically opposing positions based on their own notes of the case conference of 3 April 2025 as to whether or not such leave was granted in view of the plaintiff’s intention to file children’s affidavit. Without the formal record of proceedings tendered into evidence before me, I am unable to determine this issue and would say no more on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The portions of the affidavits of Tammy filed on 18 April 2025 and Cassandra filed on 17 April 2025 which are irrelevant to SUM 578 are to be struck out</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Notwithstanding that I’ve found that leave of court is not required for a party to file non-party affidavits for the purposes of a summons application, as I have noted above at [30], the court retains the power to reject affidavits that are irrelevant. I would exercise this power in this instance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The crux of SUM 578 is a confined procedural question: <em>should the 16 January 2025 affidavits of Tammy and Cassandra remain on the record for the AM hearing?</em> That enquiry can be answered by a straightforward application of r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 and the test of relevance and necessity as laid down in <em>WWM</em> to the impugned affidavits of Tammy and Cassandra dated 16 January 2025. In my view, the parties’ own affidavits and written submissions are more than sufficient for the court to make a finding on this limited issue. No additional affidavits deposed by the children is required for the Court to decide that issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Viewed against that yardstick, not only are the two children’s affidavits filed in support of the plaintiff in SUM 578 (<em>ie</em>, Tammy’s affidavit filed on 18 April and Cassandra’s affidavit filed on 17 April 2025) <em>but also</em> the affidavit filed in support of the defendant by way of Nancy’s affidavit of 28 March 2025 are superfluous. To my mind, they merely echo or embellish assertions already set out in their parents’ affidavits and dwell largely on matters <em>tangential</em> to the issue in SUM 578. I refer to a few of such assertions to illustrate this:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Cassandra’s affidavit</b>: “I have decided to live with my father because I am closer to him. I can see for myself that my father keeps the family environment stable and he has been the one supporting me in all areas of my life … I would like to continue to stay with my dad as he cares for us fully. He is always available to help and never ignores our phone calls or texts or argues or interferes with my friends.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> This relates to Cassandra’s preference as to who she would like to stay with; a matter irrelevant to SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Tammy’s affidavit</b>: “I would like to continue to stay with my dad as he makes sure we get regular meals. He cleans the house every day and cares for us in all areas of our lives. He is always available to help and never ignores our phone calls or texts or argues or interferes with my friends.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This also relates to Tammy’s preference as to who she would like to stay with which is irrelevant to SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Nancy’s affidavit</b>: “My younger sister [Tammy] in her affidavit has stated that my mother was asleep when she was involved in an accident when scalding hot water was splashed all over her. This is not true. This is not true because I am a witness to the scalding episode involving [Tammy].”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This relates to assertions made regarding the defendant’s caretaking of [Tammy] and is not for this Court’s determination in SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The above assertions in the Tammy, Cassandra and Nancy’s affidavits which bear on the questions of the parties’ indirect contributions are to be explored, if at all, at the substantive hearing of the AM rather than in the summons application in SUM 578. These assertions should have been left out of the affidavits filed for the purposes of SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I acknowledge that there are potentially <em>relevant</em> assertions in Tammy, Cassandra and Nancy’s affidavits, particularly where they talk about the <em>voluntariness</em> of their affidavits affirmed for the purposes of the AM proceedings and which therefore can assist this Court in the determination of SUM 578. These portions of the children’s affidavits assert that Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits affirmed for the purposes of the AM proceedings were either made <em>voluntarily<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></em> or <em>non-voluntarily</em> after having been coached by the plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In this regard, I note that no substantial supporting evidence by any of the children in support of these contrasting assertions and indeed, it is difficult to see how such evidence can be offered. This evidence may not be strictly necessary for the Court in determining SUM 578. This Court is capable of coming to a conclusion as to the issues engaged even <em>without</em> the benefit of Tammy, Cassandra or Nancy’s affidavits filed in SUM 578. Their admission complicates what is otherwise a straightforward interlocutory application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Be that as it may, considering that these are relevant to SUM 578 and that the court’s powers of striking out does <em>not</em> appear to extend to striking out affidavits where they are not necessary (<em>cf</em> an application for leave for adduce further affidavit where the court considers whether an affidavit is relevant or necessary: <em>WMM</em> at [5]), I allow these portions of the affidavits to remain on the evidential record for the purposes of determining SUM 578. For avoidance of doubt, the following paragraphs of Tammy, Cassandra and Nancy’s affidavits are allowed to remain because they speak to the core issue in SUM 578, <em>ie</em>, the <em>voluntariness</em> of Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Tammy’s affidavit filed on 18 April 2025: Paras 1 to 7, 9 and 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Cassandra’s affidavit filed on 17 April 2025: Paras 1 to 8, 10, 13 and 16 to 18.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Nancy’s affidavit filed on 28 March 2025: Paras 1 to 3, 8, 9 and 15.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Finally, the defendant has relied on an alternative ground in the form of Rule 647 of the FJR 2014, which the defendant submits provides the court with the discretion to strike out documents that are “otherwise oppressive”. Rule 647 provides that the Court may order any matter, in an affidavit, which is “scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive” to be struck out. The defendant submits that in interpreting the scope of the oppression limb, reference to the parallel provision in O 9 r 16(4)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC 2021 is helpful. This rule provides that the Court may order any affidavit or other document filed in Court to be struck out or redacted on the ground that the party had no right to file the affidavit or document. I do not rule on whether the term “oppression” covers a situation where a party has filed an affidavit where he had no right to do so. Based on my finding above at [32] that no leave of court is required for the filing of non-party (including children’s) affidavits for summonses, the defendant’s argument cannot stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 578: Children’s affidavits sought to be adduced for AM proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I now deal with SUM 578. For avoidance of doubt, I deal with SUM 578 based on the following affidavits which remain on the record:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s supporting affidavit in SUM 578 dated 14 March 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The defendant’s reply affidavit in SUM 578 dated 28 March 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The plaintiff’s final reply affidavit in SUM 578 dated 17 April 2025; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The portions of Cassandra and Tammy’s affidavit filed on 17 and 18 April 2025 and Nancy’s affidavit filed on 28 March 2025 which remain on the record (see above at [40]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The key issue before me is whether Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits dated 16 January 2025 are relevant and necessary for the AM proceedings. This follows from <em>WWM</em>, which established that leave of court is required for the filing of children’s affidavit in AM proceedings and that relevance and necessity are the primary touchstones in determining whether to grant such leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The defendant contends that these affidavits are tainted with “grave inaccuracies, involuntariness and intended to be self-serving”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and that they are “not true and correct”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> She points to various alleged discrepancies and inconsistencies in the affidavits to argue against their admission. However, with respect, the defendant’s submissions misconceive the proper inquiry at this stage. The question before me is not whether the affidavits are accurate or true. On the face of the affidavits, they have been properly affirmed with the Tammy and Cassandra appearing before the Commissioner for Oaths via a live video link. It is the function of a Commissioner for Oaths to verify that deponents understand the documents they are being deposed to: see <em>eg</em>, <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Evidence</em> vol 10 and 10(2) <em>(LexisNexis, 2023 Reissue)</em> at para 120.489.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     If anything, the defendant’s dispute as to the <em>truth</em> of the assertions made in the children’s affidavits is a dispute to be adjudicated on by the judge hearing the AM proceedings. As to the concerns of inaccuracies, this also goes towards the weight to be accorded to these affidavits rather than their admissibility as evidence. It would be quite inappropriate at this interlocutory stage to conduct what would effectively be a mini trial on the truth of the children’s evidence. The proper approach is to allow the evidence to be admitted if it is <em>relevant and necessary</em>, leaving questions of credibility and weight to be determined at the substantive hearing where the full context can be properly examined. The questions to be answered are therefore:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether the evidence contained in the affidavits is <em>relevant</em> to the issues to be determined in the AM; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     whether such evidence is <em>necessary</em> to assist the court in making those determinations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits filed on 16 January 2025 are relevant to the determination of the AM</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The defendant raises several arguments against the relevance and necessity of Tammy and Cassandra’s 16 January 2025 affidavits. In particular, she contends that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The children’s evidence would only be helpful for the periods of their teenage years (2017 to 2024 for Tammy and 2019 to 2024 for Cassandra), not the entirety of the parties’ 24 years of marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The onus should be on the parties, not the children, to prove their respective cases regarding indirect contributions. The children’s evidence merely provides “additional support” to claims and rebuttals against factual allegations, similar to <em>WWM</em> where such evidence was found irrelevant and/or unnecessary.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Courts are generally slow to admit children’s evidence in issues not directly involving children, such as division of matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I find that Tammy’s and Cassandra’s evidence are relevant to the ancillary proceedings for several reasons. For one, the parties have taken drastically opposing positions regarding their respective roles and contributions over the marriage. The defendant claims she prioritised the children’s needs since their birth and that her life revolved around her family and children. Conversely, the plaintiff contends the defendant had minimal involvement in caregiving and household duties. The children’s evidence about the parties’ respective roles is highly relevant to testing the parties’ positions on their indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The defendant’s argument that the children can only give reliable evidence about their teenage years is unpersuasive. While memories of early childhood may understandably be less detailed, I find that the children would remain able to speak about the pattern of caregiving and household responsibilities they observed <em>throughout</em> their lives. At ages 20 and 18 respectively, they are mature enough to provide meaningful evidence about their lived experience with both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits filed on 16 January 2025 are necessary for the determination of the AM</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On the question of necessity, I am satisfied that this is to be answered in the affirmative. The dispute about indirect contributions spans 24 years and relate primarily to one party’s words against the other. In this connection, the children are uniquely positioned as direct observers of the family dynamic and the parties’ respective roles. Their evidence is not merely “additional support” but provides independent first-hand testimony about matters that go to the heart of the ancillary issues. It is also not lost on me that the stark contrast between the parties’ positions makes independent evidence particularly valuable to the court’s assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The fact that Tammy and Cassandra are the parties’ <em>children</em> does not, by this fact alone, make their evidence of any less assistance to the court if it is both relevant and necessary. The defendant’s citation of academic commentary in the form of the late Ms Malathi Das’ article entitled “Court in the Crossfire — Children as Witnesses” which was published on the Singapore Law Gazette (Malathi Das, “Court in the Crossfire — Children as Witnesses” (https://v1.lawgazette.com.sg/2003-11/Nov03-feature.htm) is unpersuasive. The article urges caution but does not lay down any rule that children should generally be excluded from giving evidence (nor that their affidavits may only be filed with the court’s leave). Indeed, the prevailing law adopts a more calibrated approach: where, and how, a child’s evidence should be received in court and taken into account depends on a multitude of factors to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. This, I explain below at [52]–[53]. In this connection, the defendant has relied on s 120 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>EA</b>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> which provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Who may testify</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">120.  All persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Explanation</em>.—A lunatic is not incompetent to testify unless he or she is prevented by his or her lunacy from understanding the questions put to him or her and giving rational answers to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This appears to be a suggestion that Tammy and Cassandra are “prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions” whether by reason of their purportedly “tender years” or any other cause of the same kind. There is no merit to this submission. Assuming that the provision is applicable, Tammy was 20 years old and Cassandra, 18 years old, at the time their affidavits were affirmed. No specific age limit is defined in the EA as for what tender years mean and indeed, I do not think any hard and fast rule applies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     While there has been one case in <em>Ng Kwee Piow v R</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33909-M.xml')\">[1960] MLJ 278</a> in which a 17 or 18-year old person was found to be of insufficient intelligence to be sworn or affirmed, I do not consider this case to go so far as to lay down the ages of 17 and 18 as the bright line below which a person is to be considered incapable of providing their evidence. Even if this was the implication of this case, the antiquity of this decision leaves room to doubt whether this remains an acceptable proposition. The modern approach in the law towards the assessment of the evidence of children has taken on a more nuanced complexion. I refer by way of illustration to the Court of Appeal’s approach towards children established in <em>Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0569.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 569</a> at [67] that such evidence should not be discounted as a matter of course but is to be scrutinised for the purpose of ascertaining its reliability and whether there is a need to rely on supporting evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     More recently and more directly in the context of proceedings before the family court, I refer also to <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a>, one of the rare cases which have leapfrogged the Appellate Division to reach the apex court for a matter arising from the family courts. In dealing with the care and control and access arrangement of the child concerned, the Court of Appeal held (at [60]) that reliance that a judge places on the content of a judicial interview depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. Some of the factors relevant include the age, emotional and intellectual maturity of the child, the relationship of the child’s parents, whether there were concerns of alienating conduct and whether there was existing material before the court, such as child welfare reports. The long and short of what this case illustrates is this: there is no hard and fast rule against a court discounting a child’s views merely on account of their age. Ultimately, the test for a person to be found competent to testify is whether the individual is capable of understanding questions put to him and of giving rational answers. There is no question that Tammy and Cassandra fulfil this threshold. Their evidence relates strictly to the parties’ involvement in the household. Matters include whether the plaintiff took care of the children, the housework and the defendant’s involvement in the children’s lives more generally. These are matters which children of 18 and 20 years of age would be perfectly able to take a rational view on. I accordingly do not agree with the defendant’s reliance on s 120 of the EA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     As to the defendant’s firm belief that “[Tammy] has been coached to make her affidavit” and that she “suggest[s] that the Court interview her”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> this is something I leave to the defendant to take up before the AM judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     For the reasons above, I find that the January 2025 affidavits of Tammy and Cassandra meet the threshold requirements of relevance and necessity for their filing to be regularised for the purposes of the AM proceedings. I allow prayers 3 and 4 of SUM 1003. For the record, I make no orders as to Prayers 1 and 2 as they concern a <em>blanket</em> request for leave to adduce the evidence of Tammy and Cassandra in the AM proceedings. Without having sight of the evidence sought to be adduced, I refrain from granting such leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For the reasons above, I <b>partially allow</b> the defendant’s application in SUM 1003 by striking out the irrelevant portions of Tammy’s affidavit filed on 18 April, Cassandra’s affidavit filed on 17 April 2025 and <em>also</em> Nancy’s affidavit of 28 March 2025 (see above at [37]–[40]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For SUM 578, I <b>allow</b> this application on the terms as I have stated above (see above at [55]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The parties are to file submissions on costs, if they are unable to agree on the same, within 14 days.

time-barred</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I begin by noting that the Applicant had sought to recover maintenance arrears of about 10½ years (in MSS 160) and about eight years (in MSS 1057).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       According to s 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Maintenance arrears are not recoverable in any proceedings ... from the defaulter if the amount accrued due <em>more than 3 years</em> before the commencement of the proceedings, unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    other proceedings to recover the amount from the defaulter had previously been commenced within 3 years (or any longer period that the court in those proceedings may have allowed) after the amount accrued due; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For the avoidance of doubt, I find that despite seeking to recover maintenance arrears of more than three years before the commencement of these proceedings, MSS 160 and MSS 1057 are not time-barred. I say this because the Applicant had applied to enforce the relevant maintenance order way before the time-bar kicked in: s 91R(4)(a). Arising from these applications, warrants to arrest were issued in 2017 and 2020 against the Respondent for failing to attend court for these proceedings. Since 2020, the Applicant had been checking with the authorities annually on the status of her enforcement applications. MSS 160 and MSS 1057 were commenced after she had been given a positive response after her visit to the Warrant Enforcement Unit at the Cantonment Police Complex in 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Declaration of amount of arrears</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Respondent accepted that he had failed to pay maintenance, and did not dispute the Applicant’s quantification of the arrears in MSS 160 and MSS 1057. Accordingly, pursuant to s 81(2)(a) of the Charter, I find that the applicable maintenance orders have been breached, and declare that the amount of arrears as at the date of this judgement to be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.52150430086017%\"><col width=\"59.7919583916783%\"><col width=\"32.6865373074615%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Applicable maintenance orders</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Maintenance arrears</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Originating Summons No. 44535 (xxx)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$20,750</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Maintenance Order No. VO 206/xxx</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$54,480</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Mode of enforcement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Applicant requested that the Respondent’s earnings to be attached to enforce the applicable maintenance orders. The latter did not object to this request.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In my view, it is appropriate to make an attachment of earnings order in this case. <em>First</em>, the Respondent is gainfully employed and is receiving regular earnings. <em>Second</em>, the identity of his employer is clear. <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent has a long history of defaulting on maintenance payments. (For a discussion of the relevant considerations for imposing an attachment of earnings order, see <em>XFB v XFC</em> [2024] SGFC 100 at [14].)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Amount of earnings to attach</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Although the parties agreed that there be an attachment of earnings order, they disagreed on the amount of earnings to attach. The Respondent proposed that the sum of $1,200/month. The Applicant requested that $1,500/month be attached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What are the relevant considerations for determining the amount of the earnings to attach? To answer this issue, the starting point is s 91C of the Charter. According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The amount that the court may order in an attachment of earnings order is a sum that seems <em>reasonable</em> to the court, after taking into account the resources and needs <em>of the respondent</em> and the needs <em>of persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I make a few observations regarding s 91C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The provision requires a court to consider the following factors when determining the appropriate amount to attach:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The respondent’s resources,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       His personal expenses, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “[T]he needs of persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Regarding (iii) above, it appears from the phrase “persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide” that the class of persons coming within s 91C is restricted to the respondent’s dependants.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When a respondent claims that he needs to cover the expenses of his/her dependants, it is necessary to scrutinise such claims carefully. This is because the efficacy of attachment of earnings orders can be undermined if respondents can easily avoid them by making bare claims that they have insufficient earnings for attachment due to their financial commitments to other persons. The relevant inquiries can include the following: Is the dependant gainfully employed? What is the dependant’s earning capacity? Does the dependant have other sources of income apart from the respondent? Are the dependant’s expenses – for which the respondent is providing – reasonable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, in determining what is a “reasonable” amount of earnings to attach, it is necessary to <em>balance</em> three competing interests – those of (i) the party seeking to enforce a maintenance order, (ii) the respondent, and (iii) his/her dependants. One consequence of this balancing exercise is that the amount of earnings that is eventually attached may be lower than the amount of maintenance sought to be recovered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">MEO report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having set out the relevant considerations for determining the amount of the earnings to attach, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In undertaking this determination, I am greatly assisted by the maintenance enforcement officer’s report (dated 8 May 2025) (“<b>Report</b>”).

According to him, he gives an allowance of $250 to $300 per month to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When questioned by the Applicant as to why he chose to give allowance to his mother but not a single cent to their children, the Respondent gave two reasons. <em>First</em>, his mother had given birth to him. <em>Second</em>, he claimed that the Applicant had prevented him from seeing the children unless he paid maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I cannot accept the Respondent’s reasons as amounting to sufficient cause for breaching the maintenance orders. It bears highlighting that he has the burden to show sufficient cause. In this regard –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Even if the Applicant had disallowed the Respondent from seeing their children unless he paid maintenance, this does not justify his refusal to pay child maintenance. This is because as their parent, he has both a legal and moral duty to maintain them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, the Respondent has failed to provide evidence (i) on what his mother’s monthly expenses are, and (ii) why his allowance of $250 to $300 is necessary to tide her over every month. The Respondent has thus failed to explain why he cannot give a lesser amount of allowance to his mother – so that he could give the balance to his children with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, it bears noting that the Respondent has three siblings whom his mother can turn to for financial support. (On the other hand, the Applicant had to support three young children on her own for the past eight years.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Given the above, I find that the Respondent can reduce his monthly allowance to his mother to $100 – so that the balance $150 to $200 can be given to his children with the Applicant for their maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s son with the current wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     According to the Respondent, he pays $345/month towards the maintenance of his one-year-old child with his current wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This amount is used to pay for the child’s diapers ($65/month) and milk powder ($280/month).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I find these expenses to be reasonable and accordingly deduct them from the Respondent’s disposal income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s stepson</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Respondent currently pays a total of $279/month towards the maintenance of his current wife’s son with another man. This consists of (a) the child’s handphone bill ($29/month), (b) his school transport ($50), and (c) school allowance ($200).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     During the trial, I could sense the Applicant’s bitterness when she asked the Respondent why he was maintaining the child of another man when he had not been maintaining their own children. The Respondent did not give an adequate response to this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I note that it is not necessary <em>at this moment</em> for the Respondent to reduce his financial support to his stepson to pay the maintenance for his children with the Applicant. This is because there is sufficient balance from his monthly disposal income to support both his stepson and the Applicant’s children: see [26] below. Accordingly, I allowed $279/month to be deducted from his disposable income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s current wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Finally, the Respondent pays for his current wife’s phone bill at $35/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He explained that his wife – who was an infant-care teacher – is now a homemaker taking care of their one-year-old child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given that the wife is currently unemployed, and the small amount involved ($35/month), I find it appropriate to deduct this amount from the Respondent’s disposal income. It bears noting however that where the financial need arises, the Respondent and his current wife must be prepared for the latter to return to the workforce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     To sum-up, based on the Respondent’s income and financial commitments, I find that the Applicant’s request to attach a sum of $1,500/month from his earnings is reasonable.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.28%\"><col width=\"54.82%\"><col

His ex-Wife (“XNZ”) is the respondent. This was the essence of XNY’s complaint: that despite his attempts to move on in life after the divorce, XNZ had engaged in a pattern of conduct that caused him no small amount of stress and grief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 7 May 2025 and allowed the XNY’s application in SSP 374. In addition to ordering the PPO sought, I also made a no contact order (“NCO”) and called for a preliminary assessment report (“PAR”) (see s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The New Family Violence Regime </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is useful, at this juncture, to briefly canvass the new family violence provisions that came into force on 2 January 2025. These legislative amendments came in the wake of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Family Violence (the “Taskforce Report”) and were meant to strengthen legislation to “better protect survivors and enhance the rehabilitation and accountability of perpetrators”: Second Reading of the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and other Matters) (Amendment) Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 February 2023) vol 95) (Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling) (“Second Reading”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The most significant of these amendments comes in the form of the updated definitions of family violence. The previous definition of family violence had four limbs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under the new legislative architecture, family violence has been defined in more granularity along the lines of physical, emotional or psychological, and sexual abuse. This change to the definition of family violence was also made to “align how abuse is defined in other acts such as the Child and Young Persons Act 1993 and the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018” (see Second Reading; for an example of how the definitions of “abuse” have been applied in the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018, see also <em>Re GEQ and another matter</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 376 at [26] where the court found that the respondent was guilty of “verbal, emotional or psychological abuse of” the vulnerable adult).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Physical abuse is defined as (s 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    “Physical abuse” —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    includes conduct or behaviour that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    causes, or threatens to cause, personal injury or physical pain to a person; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   threatens a person with the death or injury of the person; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    also includes wrongfully confining or restraining a person against the person’s will; but</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    does not include any force lawfully used —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    in self-defence; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   by way of correction towards a child below 18 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As for sexual abuse, that is defined as (s 58B(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    “Sexual abuse” includes conduct or behaviour that coerces, or attempts to coerce, a person to engage in sexual activity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Finally, emotional or psychological abuse is defined as (s 58B(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    “Emotional or psychological abuse” means conduct or behaviour that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    torments, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causes or may reasonably be expected to cause mental harm to a person, including thoughts of suicide or inflicting self-harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In addition, the new provisions also provide that abuse can either take the form of a single “instance of conduct or behaviour” or a “course of conduct of behaviour” (s 58B(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961). It also provides that the conduct or behaviour that amounts to abuse “need not be directed at the family member in question” but it has to be “capable of being seen, heard or otherwise perceived (directly or indirectly) by the family member in question” (s 58B(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961). The accompanying illustrations also provide guidance as to what constitutes physical, and emotional or psychological abuse:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"center\">Illustrations</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    X spreads false rumours to third parties about X’s spouse being promiscuous. X’s spouse finds out about the rumours and is distressed. X has committed emotional or psychological abuse against X’s spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    X is prone to smash furniture in X’s house when X is angry. This behaviour causes X’s child to be distressed and in fear of personal injury. X has committed physical abuse, as well as emotional or psychological abuse, against X’s child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    X repeatedly makes demeaning comments to belittle and humiliate Y in front of their children. X threatens to stop giving Y a monthly allowance if Y contacts Y’s family or friends or seeks help. Y suffers mental harm as a result. X has committed emotional or psychological abuse against Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Notwithstanding these changes to the definitions of family violence, the two requirements that an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, to succeed in their application (s 60A(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961), remains broadly the same. <b><em>First</em></b>, it must be shown that that the respondent has committed or is likely to commit family violence against the person sought to be protected. <b><em>Second</em></b>, that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Apart from ordering a PPO, the court can also grant additional orders. Under the previous family violence provisions, the court could only grant, in addition to a PPO, a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) and a counselling order (“CGO”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     With the amendments to the family violence provisions of the Women’s Charter, the suite of orders that the court may grant in addition to a PPO has been greatly expanded. For instance, apart from a DEO and a CGO, the court may also grant a stay-away order (“SAO”), a no-contact order (“NCO”) (see s 60B of the Women’s Charter 1961) and a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) (see s 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">XNY's application for a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     XNY’s complaint was that he had suffered emotional and psychological abuse because of XNZ’s behaviour. He complained of the following incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The first incident took place on 14 February 2025. XNZ had, in the days prior, applied for a PPO against him. On the 14<sup>th</sup> of February, XNY received the summons to attend court. He says this caused “significant emotional and mental stress” on him and his current wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The second incident took place on 3 March 2012. XNZ had taken out a PPO application against XNY. Consequently, XNY received a summons to attend court. XNY said that the complaint was false. He could not have committed family violence against XNZ as he was on reservist training. Although the case was dropped, XNY says he suffered “significant stress and fear of [XNZ]’s unpredictable behaviour and random baseless accusations”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The third incident occurred on 2 April 2021. XNY received an unsolicited message on Whatsapp. XNZ said that she had slept with another man. She sent him a picture of an unknown man sleeping in her bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The fourth incident took place sometime in April 2017. XNZ had managed to track down and get in contact with XNY’s former boss (“C”). She told C that XNY and his mother had been using black magic on C’s wife. The use of such black magic, according to XNZ, caused C’s wife to fall ill. C subsequently contacted XNY to inform him about this incident. In XNY’s words:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">XNY:  And that’s where she contacted and just out rightly told told him that, you know, she has, like, a kind some kind of a secret and she would like to tell him now that, “Your wife actually passed away”, due to the doing of my late mum. And that’s how I got to know because my ex-boss was shocked to hear such a thing. I think he contacted me in a way to demand to know whether it’s true or not. Because, you know, it’s very sensitive, like, he just lost a wife, and then somebody just, out of nowhere, come and say such a thing, where I’ve not met her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Back then, it happened maybe 10 years or 11 years ago. And after I explained and I was shocked to hear that, of course, and I…and I have to explain, of course, you know you know, my mum is quite is very religious person and we come from a reputable family…And, of course, we are religious, and we will not do condone such a thing that what she mentioned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And I was lucky enough that my ex-boss, like, convinced that, of course, she’s…she’s trying to pull a false one. Whatever her motive of doing that, we are not sure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XNZ had committed family violence on XNY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I found that XNZ had indeed committed family violence on XNY – specifically, that her conduct or behaviour had harassed and/or distressed XNY (see s 58B(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I arrive at this conclusion based on the incident which had taken place in April 2017 (see above at [18]). XNY’s account of the incident was corroborated by C who testified at the trial before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     C confirmed that XNZ had indeed contacted him and told him that XNY and XNY’s mother had put a black magic spell on his wife, and that had caused her to become bedridden. In his words:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"13.96%\"><col width=\"86.04%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">C:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">At the time, my wife was---2017, my wife had already been bedridden for a good almost 8 years, alright? When she was bed…the time when she first got bedridden, [XNY] was still working with me. So that’s how---that---that---that’s how probably the knowledge of---of my wife being bedridden came out. And we were having very long hours, okay, when were at [XXX], and this was back in 07, 08, 09, 2010. It was very long hours. I was covering long hours as well. So apparently, the caller told me that [XNY] was not happy with spending so many hours at work, bearing in mind that this was 2017, 7 years after we parted ways in terms of our---our---our working together. So caller told me that the reason why my wife was bedridden was because [XNY] and his mother put a black magic spell on---on my wife, which I---I found very strange, but I didn’t want to say too much. I said, “Okay, noted. Thank you very much”, and along those lines. Conversation lasted maybe about 5 minutes or so. I was a little bit busy, and I did not really want to entertain this call because I hardly know the caller. And I just didn’t want to pursue it further because it was very distressing for me. So after we hung up, because I had made this call on my mobile, the---the caller sent me a---a---a message to follow up on what she said, and that’s what I printed out. So at the time, I knew that [XNY] was not in Singapore, and I sent him a message, “Call me straightaway.” Because we---we belong to the same professional organisation, and he was representing the organisation in a congress overseas. So I knew he was out of town. So he called me while, I think, he was in Greece or <em>en route</em> from Berlin to Greece, and I told him about the whole thing. And that was where he told me that his uncle or---or some relative was also contacted along the same lines to---basically just to mention negative points about [XNY]. So I also asked him if he wanted to make a police report, because if he wanted to make a police report, I would also follow up with mine. But when he came back, he decided not to. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Alright, [C], the caller in this case, could you tell me who was it?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">C:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">She identified herself as [XNZ], [XNY]’s ex-wife. That was how she identified herself, and that’s how I saved her number in my phone.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     C also produced a text message from XNZ. In that text message, XNZ identifies herself and also states that XNY had performed black magic on C’s wife. XNZ goes on to state that XNY had done so to take revenge on C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I found that XNZ had indeed contacted C, in this incident in 2017, to spread false rumours about XNY and his mother having performed black magic on C’s wife. That much was evident, not only from C’s testimony, but also the text message which C had produced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I also concluded that XNZ’s act of spreading such false rumours about XNY fell squarely within the definition of emotional or psychological abuse. It is clear from the words of s 58B(4) that whether a respondent’s conduct or behaviour amounts to emotional or psychological abuse is to be assessed with reference to the <b><em>impact</em></b> such conduct or behaviour has on the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This is further reinforced by the explanatory statement contained in the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and Other Matters) (Amendment) Bill which states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(iv)  the definition of emotional or psychological abuse <b><u>refers to conduct or behaviour that distresses an individual</u></b>, and not to conduct or behaviour that is offensive to an individual;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As to the sort of conduct that could constitute emotional and psychological abuse, one example may be found in Illustration (a) to s 58B of the Women’s Charter 1961. Another example was also given by the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling in the Second Reading:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Stakeholders have shared situations where perpetrators threaten to withhold monthly allowance from their spouses, constantly call their spouses to check on their whereabouts and isolate them from their friends or family, including disallowing them to leave the house. If the spouses do not comply, they may be threatened by the perpetrator. These egregious forms of controlling behaviour – which falls within the definition of what some other jurisdictions call &quot;coercive control&quot; – can cause distress or mental harm to a survivor and would be considered emotional or psychological abuse under the new Bill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     While such examples provide a useful illustration of the sort of conduct or behaviour that could constitute emotional and psychological abuse, it is important to not lose sight of the fact that an applicant must <b><em>prove</em></b> the impact of such conduct or behaviour. For example, if the allegation is that the conduct in question had either tormented, intimidated, harassed or distressed the person sought to be protected (to cite the words of s 58B(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961), the applicant bears the burden of proving this. That much is made clear by ss 103 and 104 of the Evidence Act 1893 which state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Burden of proof</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">103.—(1)    Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability, dependent on the existence of facts which the person asserts, must prove that those facts exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    A desires a court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">A must prove that B has committed the crime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    A desires a court to give judgment that A is entitled to certain land in the possession of B by reason of facts which A asserts and which B denies to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">A must prove the existence of those facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>On whom burden of proof lies</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">104.  The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    A sues B for land of which B is in possession, and which, as A asserts, was left to A by the will of C, B’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">If no evidence were given on either side, B would be entitled to possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Therefore the burden of proof is on A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    A sues B for money due on a bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The execution of the bond is admitted, but B says that it was obtained by fraud, which A denies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">If no evidence were given on either side, A would succeed as the bond is not disputed and the fraud is not proved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Therefore the burden of proof is on B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the present case, I found that XNY had indeed established that XNZ’s conduct had caused him distress. There were two factors which pointed me to this conclusion. First, I believed XNY’s account that he was staunchly religious, and in that vein, I inferred that such accusations must have distressed him greatly. Second, it was also clear to me from C’s testimony that the both of them shared a close relationship – this meant that XNY was also privy to C’s personal struggles, namely, that C’s wife was seriously ill and needed care. Further, XNY had evidently looked up to C as a mentor, and C clearly had high regard for XNY’s abilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Viewed against this backdrop, it is clear how XNZ’s actions of spreading these allegations of black magic would have distressed XNY. It could have potentially ruined XNY’s reputation and relationship with someone whom he was not only close with, but who he also considered a personal mentor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For completeness, I turn now to deal with one other aspect of XNY’s complaint – that XNZ filing a PPO against him on 13 February 2025 had amounted to emotional abuse. In his testimony, XNY described how he was “emotionally and mentally” stressed because he had been hauled back to court for something that he did not do.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I do not consider that the stress which XNY had experienced as a result of XNZ taking out a PPO application against him could amount to emotional abuse. Parties are, after all, entitled to file their complaints, and there are safeguards to minimise the filing of frivolous or meritless complaints. PPO applications start life as a Magistrate’s Complaint, and if the judge hearing the complaint decides that if there is insufficient reason to proceed, the complaint may be dismissed: P 3 r 7(<em>c</em>) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. To give a few examples, a complaint may be dismissed in the following cases:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where it is plainly clear that the complaint is being made for a collateral purpose. It is, after all, well established that the bringing of an application for collateral purposes does amount to an abuse of process, and the court possesses the inherent power to “prevent an abuse of its processes”: <em>Ho Kiang Fah v Toh Buan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 3 SLR(R) 0398.xml')\">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 398</a> at [8] and [23]; <em>Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0348.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 348</a> at [22] citing <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9595-SSP-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</a> at [34]; <em>Heng Joo See v Ho Pol Ling</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0763.xml')\">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 763</a> at [21] (see Goh Yihan, “The Inherent Jurisdiction and Inherent Powers of the Singapore Courts” (2011) Singapore Journal of Legal Studies 178 at p 207 citing <em>Emilia Shipping Inc. v State Enterprises for Pulp and Paper Industries</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0411.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 411</a> at [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the applicant has no standing to apply for the PPO (see s 60 read with s 58A of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where it is clear that the complaint is bound to fail even if one assumes that all the facts complained of are indeed true (<em>ie</em>, where the incidents complained of clearly do not fall within the definitions of family violence as set out in s 58B of the Women’s Charter 1961, or where it is plainly not necessary to make the order for the protection or the personal safety of the person in question).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     However, the fact that a complaint is accepted does not mean that the allegations contained within it are true. All it means is that the judge hearing the complaint has, in their assessment, considered that there is sufficient merit to the complaint. The respondent has a right to be heard. To facilitate this, the summons will be served on the respondent. And while this may cause some stress, which was XNY’s experience in the present case, this is an unavoidable consequence of the applicable procedural rules that govern PPO applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XNZ was likely to commit family violence on XNY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In addition to finding that XNZ had committed family violence on XNY, I also found that XNZ was <b><em>likely</em></b> to commit family violence on XNY, specifically, that she was likely to continue to cause emotional or psychological abuse to XNY. There were, in my judgment, five factors which spoke to this:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident which took place in April 2017 which, as I have found (above at [19] – [29]), did cause XNY distress and thus amounted to emotional and/or psychological abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The incident in November 2021 where she had texted XNY to say that she was sleeping with a man. XNY had exhibited the message from XNZ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It showed a picture of an unknown man in a bed followed by a text: “[XNY], I sleep with a man.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     XNY also testified that XNZ had called him when she was warded at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and asked him to visit her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In this vein, there is also evidence that XNZ has a psychiatric condition for which she had been receiving treatment at IMH. XNZ had produced invoices from IMH which spoke to the treatment she was receiving from the psychiatrists as well as the medications which she had been prescribed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_e\"></a>(e)     XNZ’s filing of the PPO applications against XNY, first, back in 2011, and subsequently in 2025. There are also the police reports which XNZ had filed against XNY. She alleged that she had seen XNY in the public areas that she frequents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Taken together, these five points demonstrated a clear pattern of conduct on XNZ’s part. Despite XNY having resolved to go his own separate way after their divorce, XNZ continued to harass him. This ranged from contacting his former boss to sending him unsolicited text messages about her sleeping with another man.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To be clear, XNZ’s pattern of conduct did not appear to be a campaign of harassment which she had consciously mounted against XNY as part of a vendetta that she had against him. There was nothing on the evidence to suggest that this was indeed the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     There was, however, evidence to show that XNZ was not well. She was seeking treatment from IMH for an undisclosed psychiatric condition. That XNZ was not well was also clear from her testimony where she described how she would regularly dream of XNY and his family members,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> and how she would see XNY in places that she frequented which led her to believe that A was following her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">It was necessary to grant the PPO </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having found that XNZ had indeed committed family violence, and was also likely to commit family violence, I turn now to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The previous family violence provisions provided that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and <b>that it is necessary for the </b><b><u>protection </u></b><b>of the family member</b>, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In contrast, the newly enacted s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 makes it clear that the applicant must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected. The legislative changes thus appear to have altered the necessity requirement by stipulating that a PPO may also be ordered if it is necessary for the <em>personal safety</em> of the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This must be the case because while the word “protection” is conceivably wide enough to cover the ambit of “personal safety”, it is a well-established principle that because Parliament “shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain”, the court should “endeavour to give significant to every word in an enactment”: <em>Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [38] citing <em>JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/50060-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 484</a> at [43]; <em>Shanmugam Manohar v Attorney-General and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25741-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 3 SLR 600</a> at [25]; <em>WCG v WCH</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 45 at [19]; <em>EQ Capital Investments Ltd v Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20810-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCR 15</a> at [30] citing <em>Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0874.xml')\">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 874</a> at [12]. The word “protection” must, therefore, have a different meaning from the phrase “personal safety”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As to what “protection” and “personal safety” means, no mention is made in the Second Reading of what these terms mean, and exactly what the scope of each was meant to cover.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That being said, I am of the view that “personal safety” has a broader scope than “protection”. For one, it is clear that the legislative amendments were made with a view to strengthening the measures available to those who have suffered from family violence. For example, the Taskforce Report had recommended:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Recommendation 11B: Amend the Women’s Charter to specifically empower the Courts to make additional types of orders to ensure the safety of the survivors of violence, including non-visitation, non-communication, and non-access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">92.    Under the Women’s Charter, the Court may grant a DEO to perpetrators of family violence in addition to a PPO. This DEO will require the perpetrator to be excluded from part of or the entire family home to better ensure the safety of the family violence survivor. However, under the Vulnerable Adults Act, there are further provisions for the Court to grant other types of orders in addition to the protection order to better protect the survivor of violence. These include orders prohibiting the respondent (i.e. the person whom the protection order was made against) from visiting or communicating with the applicant, or from entering or remaining in an area outside the applicant’s place of residence or any other place frequented by the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">93.    The Taskforce recommends that <b>the Government amend the Women’s Charter to specifically empower the Courts to make </b><b><em><u>additional </u></em></b><b>types of orders, such as the above-mentioned non-visitation, non-communication, and non-access orders</b>, <b><em><u>to better ensure the safety of the person who applied for a PPO</u></em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     These recommendations from the Taskforce Report were indeed adopted, and have found expression in the new provisions which empower the court to make a SAO or NCO: s 60B(2)(<em>b</em>) and s 60B(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Following from this, I consider that the notion of “protection” would only be confined to matters which directly impact an individual’s physical and mental state whereas the notion of “personal safety” must necessarily extend to, and encompass, an individual’s environment and their living circumstances that has an impact on their well-being. It is for this reason that the court now has the additional powers to grant a SAO or an NCO – both these orders go further than a PPO in that they severely limit any possible interactions between a respondent and the person protected by a PPO (“Y”). This ensures that Y has an environment in which they can enjoy a normalcy of life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Having dealt with the definitions of “protection” and “personal safety”, I turn now to address two other related points of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The first is whether “or”, as is used in s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, is to be read conjunctively or disjunctively. This point arises because s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) states that a PPO may only be ordered if it is necessary for the protection <b><em><u>or</u></em></b> personal safety of Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The plain and ordinary meaning of “or” produces a disjunctive result – however, in the context of statutory interpretation, “or” may be read conjunctively in order to give effect to the intention of Parliament”: <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53560-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 123</a> at [68] – [72]; <em>Peh Hai Yam v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20194-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHC 69</a> at [65].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In the present case, given my observations above on Parliament’s intent to broaden the scope of protections available to those who have suffered family violence, and the difference in the scope of what “protection” and “personal safety” means, I do not think that “or”, as it is used in s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 should be read conjunctively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The second is the requirement of the requirement of necessity. I consider that the key inquiry here must involve a risk assessment. The court considers the “likelihood of the respondent committing family violence against” the person sought to be protected: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19] – [20]. It is only in cases where the court has assessed there to be a sufficiently high risk of family violence being committed in the future, that a PPO will be necessary. After all, there are criminal consequences that follow from the breach of a PPO, and “ordering one is not a decision that a court would take lightly”: <em>XIO v XIP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32867-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 18</a> at [5] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In this vein, the court can also consider whether the PPO is necessary to deter family violence – this was a point noted in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [23]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23    Finally, it is also relevant to consider whether there is a need for a PPO to deter future family violence. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The possibility of arrest and being investigated by the Police can be a powerful deterrent against the commission of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    However, such a possibility may not be available if the offence arising from such violence is a “non-arrestable offence” in law. Examples include family violence which involve (i) assault / using criminal force under s 352 and (ii) voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code 1871. What this means is that the perpetrators of such offences cannot be arrested without a warrant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    A PPO can address this issue. This is because the breach of a PPO is itself an arrestable offence: s 65(11) of the Charter. Thus, a respondent who voluntarily causes hurt to an applicant after the latter has been given a PPO may be arrested for breaching the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As to the indicators which speak to the likelihood of family violence being committed, they include, <em>inter alia</em>, unresolved causes of family violence and whether there would be continued future interactions between the parties: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the present case, I found that it was indeed necessary to order the PPO for XNY’s personal safety. It was clear to me that the present case was one where XNZ’s conduct had impacted XNY’s living circumstances and thus exacted a toll on him. The way XNZ had acted was clearly affecting XNY’s personal life, as well as his professional relationships. I accepted XNY’s evidence that XNZ’s conduct had indeed taken an emotional toll on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Despite XNY’s best attempts to cut off any and all contact with B, she still found ways to get in touch with XNY and his colleagues. This resulted in an unenviable situation where XNY had to deal with the fallout from XNZ’s actions, with the clearest example of this being the false rumours XNZ had spread to C about XNY and his mother having performed black magic (see above at [18] – [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The evidence also showed that XNZ’s conduct was not a one-off event, but rather, a consistent pattern of behaviour over a period of several years. This suggested that there was some unresolved issue on XNZ’s part, and that this was the root cause of her continuing to act out in this manner against XNY. Until that issue was identified and resolved, it was likely that XNZ’s pattern of behaviour would continue into the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Having decided to grant XNY’s application for a PPO, I also considered it necessary for his personal safety to order a NCO: s 60B(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. It was clear that XNY wanted nothing more to do with XNZ. The NCO was needed to ensure that XNY could put his past with XNZ behind him, and continue with his life, without living in anxiety that XNZ would try to make contact with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     That being said, and for completeness, I add that having ordered a NCO, I did not find it necessary to order a SAO. Such an order would require XNZ to stay away from XNY’s home or any other place frequented by XNY: s 60B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter. In order for XNZ to comply with a SAO, the addresses of XNY’s home, and other areas frequented by him would have to be disclosed to XNZ. I considered that doing so would frustrate the very purpose of making a NCO – and that was to lay down, and enforce a clear separation between XNY and XNZ, and to ensure that there was no further opportunity by which XNZ could continue to try and maintain contact with XNY.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that the evidence before me indicated that XNZ was receiving treatment from IMH, I also saw fit to order that a PAR be produced pursuant to s 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961. While the court is empowered to make a MTO, there are several steps that must be taken before such an order may be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     First, the court must have reasonable grounds to believe that: <b>a)</b> the respondent is likely to be suffering from a psychiatric condition and <b>b)</b> that psychiatric condition is likely to be a contributing factor for the respondent’s conduct or behaviour that was the basis for making the protection order against them in the first place: s 60F(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961. To that end, the court <b><em>may</em></b>, before deciding if such reasonable grounds exist, call for a PAR: s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Notably, the language used in s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 suggests that it is not mandatory for the court to call for a PAR, and that the decision to call for a PAR lies solely within the court’s discretion: see also s 60F(8) of the Women’s Charter which states that there is no appeal against “any decision of the court to call for or not to call for a” PAR. One reason why it is not mandatory for the court to call for a PAR is that, in some cases, there may already be evidence before the court which establishes the requirements set out in s 60F(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Such evidence could take the form of an expert opinion (see generally P. 10 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, and in particular, P. 10 r. 3(1) which stipulates that leave of court must be obtained before expert evidence may be adduced).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Second, once the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it <b><em>must</em></b> call for a formal assessment report (“FAR”). The MTO can only be granted if the FAR certifies all the following matters (s 60F(16) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    X is suffering from a psychiatric condition;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    the psychiatric condition is a contributing factor for X’s conduct or behaviour that was the basis for making the protection order against X;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    the psychiatric condition is susceptible to treatment;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    X is suitable for the treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the present case, and given the available evidence before me, I deemed it necessary to call for a PAR to assist me in ascertaining whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that XNZ had a psychiatric condition which was a contributing factor for her conduct or behaviour that was the basis for granting the PPO. As I had noted, above at ([53]), XNZ’s conduct was clearly due to some unresolved issue on her part. And while that unresolved issue could likely be a result of a psychiatric condition, the evidence before me only suggested a correlation between the psychiatric condition and XNZ’s behaviour towards XNY. It did not suggest, or establish, a causative link (<em>ie</em>, that her psychiatric condition was likely a contributing factor for her conduct or behaviour).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     To sum up, I allowed XNY’s application for a PPO in SSP 374. In addition, I also ordered a NCO, and called for a PAR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As for costs, XNY asked for $1000 in costs to “act as a deterrent”. In response, XNZ said that she was unemployed and could “maybe pay only $500”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Given that XNY did succeed in his application, he is, as a starting point, entitled to costs: P. 22 r. 3(2) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     An order of costs, however, does have practical implications. For example, in the context of divorce proceedings, it has been noted that an order of costs may only serve to “aggravate the acrimony between the parties”: <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> at [32]. In other words, a costs order may also negatively affect the state of the relationship between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     One other practical implication insofar as costs are concerned is that details would have to be provided in order for payment to be made. For this to happen, there must necessarily be correspondence between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In the present case, I considered that the circumstances warranted a departure from this starting point. Ordering costs would, in my judgment, frustrate the very goal for which I had ordered the PPO and NCO (see above at [55]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     To be clear, I must emphasise that I am not laying down a bright line rule that if a NCO is ordered, the court will necessarily make no order as to costs.

Since then, there have been protracted proceedings before the Court. Shortly after a case conference on 23 October 2024 and before the 1<sup>st</sup> hearing of the ancillary matters (AMs) on 19 December 2024, the Husband filed an application for a personal protection order (PPO) on behalf of the three (3) children of the marriage, C1 (14 years old), C2 (10 years old) and C3 (7 years old) on 4 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The PPO application was heard on 23 January 2025 (with written submissions filed on 17 April 2025) and dismissed on 8 May 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing for the AMs, specifically the custody, care and control of and access to the children, was fixed on the same day i.e. 8 May 2025. Counsel for the Husband sought an adjournment, communicating the Husband’s hope and wish for reconciliation with the Wife. Given the lengthy course of proceedings, counsel for the Wife objected to the adjournment. I stood the matter down for counsel for the Wife to confirm with his client that there is no possibility of reconciliation. After speaking with the Wife, counsel confirmed that his client was firmly against any reconciliation and wished to proceed with the divorce to its conclusion. I proceeded to hear the AMs and now make my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and History of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties were married on 25 March 2010. Interim judgment was granted on 7 September 2022 based on the Parties’ respective claim and counterclaim of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the other Party. The effective length of the marriage is about 12.5 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Both the Wife and the Husband had filed applications for interim orders in these proceedings. Since July 2022, the Wife has interim care and control over C2 and C3, while the Husband has interim care and control of C1. The background and context as to why such orders were made were set out in a separate judgment dismissing the Husband’s PPO application and shall not be repeated (see <em>XMB v XMA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33229-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 52</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Under two interim maintenance orders, the Husband is to pay the Wife:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $250 per month for October and November 2023 and $1,000 per month with effect from 8 December 2023 as her maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $670 per month as maintenance for C2 ($380) and C3 ($290) with effect from 11 February 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There were also backdated maintenance ordered to account for the failure and neglect to pay maintenance before the interim maintenance orders were made. At the hearing on 8 May 2022, counsel for the Wife informed that the Husband has yet to make a single payment of maintenance to the Wife and the arrears are standing at $44,500 (as of May 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The issues before the Court are as follows: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Custody, care and control of and access to the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Division of matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the Wife;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Maintenance for the children; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed by the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The following are the affidavits filed by the Parties for the hearing of the AMs: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"28.5342931413717%\"><col width=\"35.9128174365127%\"><col width=\"35.5528894221156%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Affidavit</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Wife’s Affidavits (if any)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Husband’s Affidavits (if any)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Affidavit of Assets and Means </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA1</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HA1</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA2</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HA2</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA3</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>-</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There are numerous other affidavits filed by the Parties for their applications for interim orders and for the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories. The Parties also filed affidavits to explain the circumstances leading to the cessation of access sometime from February/March 2024 onwards. Where necessary, these affidavits will be referred to by the date on which they are filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s father, Mr [T] filed an affidavit in support of the Husband’s case that he had given loans to the Husband totalling $275,000 over the span of more than 10 years and that upon the sale of a commercial property (referred to in this judgment as the “ST property”) in September 2022, he had been repaid the sum of $235,000 from the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Custody, care and control of and access to the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Parties are agreed that there should be joint custody of the children, save that the Wife sought to have the final say on the children’s educational matters. They are also each seeking care and control of all three (3) children. While the Husband proposes reasonable access (in the event that he has care and control of the children), the Wife’s position is that the Husband should have supervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A Child Representative (CR) was appointed based on the Parties’ agreement. Mr Yap Teong Liang, who was the appointed CR, submitted his report to Court on 9 December 2024. This was done after a prolonged delay in which he attempted to arrange for interviews with the Husband and C1 to no avail between the period from 22 August to 8 November 2024. So as not to delay the matter any further, the Court had directed the CR to submit his report, notwithstanding that he had not been able to interview the Husband and C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The CR was of the view that there should be joint custody of the children. Although the Wife sought to have the final say in the children’s education up till tertiary education, the CR took the view that excluding the Husband from educational decisions is not in the best interest of the children and potentially sends a wrong signal to the other parent, which discourages co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The CR recommended for the Wife to have care and control of all 3 children. The events since July 2021 to date had shown that the split care and control arrangements have not worked well in the children’s interest. There has been a lack of co-operation between the parents, and access has not been at a level where the siblings have regular contact time with each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The CR also recommended reasonable unsupervised access with detailed proposals set out in his report and other orders such as: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An order that neither parent shall speak ill of or disparage the other parent to the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Counselling orders for the parents and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To ease the transition of the care and control to the Wife and the access arrangements, the CR is of the view that it would be helpful for the children to have a session with a Court Family Specialist to explain the orders that the Court would eventually make. Further consideration may also be given for the appointment of a Parenting Co-ordinator to ease the transition of access for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     At the outset, I wish to state that I agree with the CR and the Parties themselves that the siblings should not be separated. This is in line with the case authorities that where there are siblings involved, it is generally desirable to have them stay together (see for example, <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>). The split care and control arrangements, which were intended to be interim in nature, have indeed not worked well for the children. Because of the deep level of mistrust between their parents arising from the incidents in February/March 2024, the siblings have had no opportunity to interact with one another for more than 1 year and this has worked against their welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     From the CR’s report, it is clear that C2 and C3 are doing well under the Wife’s care and they share a warm and loving relationship with her. It is important to note particularly that in the CR’s interactions with C2 and C3, he did not observe or note any adverse comments made by C2 or C3 against the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In my view, this shows that the Wife had not triangulated C2 and C3 in her deep conflict with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The same cannot be said for the Husband. Since C1 started living with his father, there has been an increasing strain in the relationship between him and his mother. C1 blocked the Wife on Whatsapp and refused meaningful communication and access with her. There was also increasing hostility on the part of C1 towards the Wife, with him calling her “evil” and a “liar” in his text messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. He also made alarming statements to her about making her life miserable and bringing her to hell with him if she comes back to the matrimonial home and takes his siblings away.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This contrasted with his more loving messages towards his mother and his willingness to go for access with her at the beginning of his time staying with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0029.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 29</a>, it was stated by the High Court (at [29]) that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[29] Having said that, it is clear that switching care and control is a remedy that can be adopted if a judge finds that the parent having care and control has been either deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parent. This remedy would be most suitable in a situation in which the child begins to show animosity towards a parent with whom he previously had a loving relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although this is not a case of reversing final orders on care and control, I find the passage helpful to determine who should be granted final care and control of C1. In the present case, the Husband had either been deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between C1 and the Wife such that C1 now views the Wife negatively and puts the blame on her entirely for leaving the Husband and breaking apart the family. If the care and control arrangements during the interim period (which had gone on far longer than anticipated due to the delay in proceedings that are largely caused by the Husband having at least 8 different sets of counsel and harbouring hopes of reconciliation) are allowed to perpetuate, C1 is at great risk of losing one of the most important human relationships i.e. that of mother and son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am of the view that it is in the best interests of all 3 children to be placed under the care and control of the Wife and I so order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife and C1 would require a time for rebuilding their relationship without interference from the Husband and to this end, I am of the view that it would be helpful for there to be tiered access between the Husband and C1 in the following manner: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Phase 1: No access in the first 3 weeks from the time of handover<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Phase 2: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days for a period of 4 weeks;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Phase 3: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and supervised visitation for a period of 8 weeks (or more, if recommended by the relevant case worker);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Phase 4: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and fixed access on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for 8 weeks; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Phase 5: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and fixed access on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband shall have video access for 20 minutes on alternate days to C2 and C3 and fixed access to C2 and C3 on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for 8 weeks and thereafter on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the physical access is not to commence until the supervised visitation sessions for the Husband and C1 have been completed and there has been some rebuilding of trust between the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Parties and the children shall also be ordered to undergo counselling. C1, in particular, would require counselling to understand that there is no need for him to undertake the burden of aligning with his father in his parents’ dispute and for him to accept and come to terms with their marital breakdown. The parents would also need counselling to repair the trust between them and to learn how to co-parent moving forward. As recommended by the CR, I shall also order that neither parent shall speak ill of or disparage the other parent in the presence of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     This leaves the relatively more straightforward issue of custody of the children. Although the Wife had sought for her to have the final say in the children’s educational matters, I see no reason to depart from precedents awarding joint custody to parents to promote co-parenting. Both Parties shall therefore have joint custody of all 3 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Before moving to the other issues, it remains for me to thank the CR, Mr Yap for his commendable efforts in trying to engage with the family, particularly with the Husband and C1 and producing a comprehensive report to assist the Court. Mr Yap has asked for the usual first-tier costs of $1,000 and I so order; the costs of $1,000 shall be borne by the Parties equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The matrimonial pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Parties have three joint assets, namely the matrimonial home and two joint bank accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I determine the size of the matrimonial pool as $<b>1,592,762.81</b> (not including assets of unknown value); the full list is found at [52]. I elaborate on the disputed assets below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife took the view that the market value of the matrimonial home is $1,308,000. This was based on the latest available transacted prices as at the time WA3 was prepared for a unit in the same block of flats.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s valuation of the matrimonial home is $1,200,000 as at the time he filed HA1. In HA2, he stated that in reply to the Wife’s then valuation of $1,238,888 in WA2, he would rely on the latest resale flat prices for the value of the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Given that the Wife’s figure of $1,308,000 is the most updated, I shall use this as the market value of the matrimonial home. The outstanding loan as of May 2025 is $390,212.36. The value of the matrimonial home to be added to the matrimonial pool is thus $917,787.64.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">QR Pte Ltd and ST Property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Husband is the sole shareholder and director of QR Pte Ltd (“QR Company”). Notwithstanding the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar for the Husband to produce the necessary documents relating to this company, all that the Husband had produced is the ACRA profile dated 14 April 2022, an outdated profit and loss account statement for 2009 and 2010 and some bank statements of a Maybank account belonging to QR Company. The bank statements showed a balance of $247,424.42 as of 31 December 2022 with a depletion to $7,503.58 as of 30 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Given the paucity of documents, the Wife originally indicated in her affidavit that she wished for $247,424.42 to be notionally ascribed as the value of QR Company and added to the matrimonial pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> At the AM hearing on 19 December 2024, counsel for the Wife submitted that it is unclear whether the amount of $247,424.42 included the sale proceeds of a commercial property owned by QR Company (the “ST property”); to avoid double-accounting, he suggested that it may be fairer to add the latest and reduced amount in the bank account into the matrimonial pool and to account for the sale proceeds of the ST property separately. He further submitted that there is no other way to account for the value of QR Company, save to use the paid-up capital of $185,000 as reflected in the ACRA profile<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As for the ST property, it was submitted that the Husband had sold it at below market value while the Parties are in the midst of divorce proceedings and that the Court should ascribe a value of $350,000 to that property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband did not deny the sale of the ST property during the divorce proceedings but asserted that he had used its sale proceeds to repay his father a sum of $235,000 for loans that were extended to QR Company from time to time since 2010.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Given that there is no documentation to show the extension of loans from the Husband’s father to QR Company and that the affidavit of the father, Mr [T] is self-serving in nature, I am minded to add the sale proceeds of the ST property into the matrimonial pool. As the Husband is the sole shareholder and director of QR Company<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> which owns the ST property and he appears to be able to transfer the monies to his father at will, I am not convinced that the Husband should be allowed to hide behind the corporate veil.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to the EdgeProp document produced by the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, there was only one unit in ST sold in September 2022. The sale price was reflected as $270,000. In HA2, the Husband alleged that the ST property was sold in “September 2022 for $243,424.03”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I am prepared to accept that there are costs and expenses involved in the sale and will therefore take $243,424.03 to be the net sale proceeds for the ST property. I am not convinced by the Wife’s argument that I ascribe $350,000 as the true market value of the ST property, given that there is only one other unit in ST sold for $350,000 in April 2022 and it is speculative as to whether the ST property belonging to QR Company would also have fetched the same price.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband asserted that the sum of $185,000 is the paid-up share capital and not the value of the company and objected to this characterisation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Since he had not produced <b><em>any documents</em></b> relating to the company which may show the true value of the company (especially given that it is a local company), it does not lie with him to object to this characterisation. The Court is left in the dark as to what the true value of the company is, and therefore has to agree with counsel for the Wife that there is no other objective way to put a value to the company. That being the case, I will add $185,000 notionally to the matrimonial pool as the value of QR Company. Since this $185,000 is supposed to represent the whole value of the company, I will not add the further bank balance of $7,503.58 in QR Company’s bank account to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mercedes Car</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband declared his ownership of a Mercedes car in HA1. This was bought on hire purchase after IJ was granted on 7 September 2022. In the circumstances, I would not consider the car as part of the matrimonial pool. Contrary to the Wife’s position, the car is not to be regarded as part of the matrimonial pool even though the car loan has since been fully discharged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Withdrawals from the Husband’s UOB account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife took issue with the Husband’s withdrawals from his UOB personal account amounting to $164,421.47. She has tabulated a breakdown in WA2.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Her table included sums that do not appear significant i.e. $80, $137, $200 etc. While most of the individual amounts do not appear significant, there are some substantial withdrawals which I am of the view that the Husband should account for: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     24 September 2018 - $13,818.05</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     16 November 2018 - $21,516.68</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     7 February 2019 - $21,840</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Husband did manage to show that he had deposited $21,840 into the joint account of the Parties on 7 February 2019 (the same day on which the sum was withdrawn from his UOB personal account).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However, there was no documentary proof of how he had used the other two sums of $13,818.05 and $21,516.68 withdrawn in September and November 2018 respectively. Although his explanation was the same in respect of all three sums, only the sum of $21,840 was deposited in the joint account of the Parties. That being the case, I am of the view that he had not accounted satisfactorily for the other two sums and shall add the sum of $35,334.73 notionally back into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     For completeness, the sum of $85,355.99 reflected in the table tabulated by the Wife (though substantial) appears to be an accumulation of unposted debits. It would not therefore be fair to the Husband for him to have to account for this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Condominium in Malaysia </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband owns a condominium unit in Malaysia (referred to in this judgment as the “M Condo”). It is his case that this property was acquired before marriage and therefore not a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     However, it appears that although the M Condo is a pre-marital asset, it was enjoyed by the family as a holiday home or as a place to stay when they were in Kuala Lumpur. I am of the view that it falls within the definition of a matrimonial asset under section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), that being:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am strengthened in the view that the M Condo is a matrimonial asset by the fact that the property is still subject to a loan and has not been fully paid off before the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband had listed this property for sale; the Wife took objection to this given that the divorce proceedings are not yet over. The Wife valued the property at RM600,000 while the Husband valued it at RM400,000. I shall use RM500,000 as the value of the M Condo given that it is the average of the two values submitted by the Parties and within the sales price range found in the PropertyGuru document tendered by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     There appears to be a debt due to the bank in the amount of RM439,080.63 in relation to the M Condo<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. As such, the net value (which is to be added into the matrimonial pool) is RM 60,919.37 (S$18,629.78 – using an exchange rate of S$1 = RM 3.27<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s other companies </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband’s other companies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> are:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Re H – a company registered in the British Virgin Islands;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     AB Ltd – a forex brokerage company registered in Vanuatu;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     CD Ltd – a holding company registered in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Husband claims that the above companies are no longer active. They have no monies and/or assets and are presently being wound up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> However, he has not produced any documents to substantiate his claims, notwithstanding the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar on 5 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The total value of these companies is therefore unknown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alliance Bank account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Alliance bank account was used by the Husband to pay the mortgage and other expenses for M Condo.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Similarly, no bank account statements were produced by the Husband, notwithstanding the discovery order of 5 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Monies alleged to be taken by the Wife when she left the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Husband alleged that the Wife took monies up to USD20,000 and S$30,000 from his safe when she left the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> However, such an allegation was not substantiated by the Husband.

I also accept that before the Parties started living separately, he was also a relatively hands-on father to all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife has been the primary caregiver of the children throughout the marriage, from their education to health and their general upbringing. She has also assisted the Husband in the operations of the companies he had set up. Although the Husband had attempted to downplay her role and her contributions towards his businesses, I accept that she had been involved significantly, based on her detailed accounts and knowledge of the businesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I also acknowledge that the Husband’s mother had helped towards the caregiving of the children and in fetching them back from the childcare centre, especially during the time when the Parties were still residing with the Husband’s parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Given the length of the marriage and the factors above, I am of the view that a fair and proper ratio to be attributed for the Parties’ indirect contributions would be 60:40 in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Share of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Applying the structured approach laid down in <em>ANJ v ANK</em>, the Parties’ average percentages work out to be: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"47.8295659131826%\"><col width=\"25.3450690138028%\"><col width=\"26.8253650730146%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.

As the controlling mind of the companies which he had set up, he would have access to the financial documents to show the status and value of the companies. Yes, despite being ordered to produce such documents, he had failed, refused and/or neglected to do so to date. I note that nearly two years had elapsed since the order had been made. He had also not disclosed the bank statements for the Alliance Bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I agree that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband. Given that the values of such companies are unknown and there is no information as to the Alliance Bank account, the uplift approach should be applied: see W<em>RX v WRY and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32094-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 851</a> at [39]-[40]. I therefore grant an uplift of 5% to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alleged debts/loans from friends and maintenance arrears</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife had asked for the debts/loans owed to her friends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> to pay for the rent and living expenses of C2, C3 and herself (as a result of the Husband failing to pay maintenance since she moved out of the matrimonial home) to be taken into account in adjusting the final ratios. I decline to rely on her alleged debts/loans to adjust the final ratios; instead, I will look at the maintenance arrears owed under the interim maintenance orders to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     As at the date of the Written Submissions, the Wife claimed that the Husband was in arrears of $19,000 for interim spousal maintenance and $16,750 for interim child maintenance. Counsel for the Wife informed at the hearing on 8 May 2025 that the Husband has continued not to pay under the interim maintenance orders since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The total amount of arrears would therefore be $45,770 (including month of June 2025). This is equivalent to about 2.9% of the matrimonial pool. I grant the Wife an uplift of 2.9% to account for the maintenance arrears; no further arrears as of June 2025 shall be owing by the Husband to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Final adjustment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The final ratio as adjusted between the Parties is therefore 48.4: 51.6 in favour of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is thus $770,897.20 while that of the Husband is $821,865.61.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Consequential orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Wife had originally asked for the Husband’s share in the matrimonial home to be transferred to her. However, she now takes the view that she is unable to take over the Husband’s share and is applying for the matrimonial home to be sold in the open market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Wife shall be at liberty to close both the joint accounts and retain the monies within. With these sums accounted for, the following will thus be each Party’s respective share in the matrimonial home: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"50%\"><col width=\"50%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$686,309.66</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$231,477.98</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">74.8%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">25.2%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The matrimonial home is to be sold on the open market within 6 months of the Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 74.8% to the Wife and 25.2% to the Husband after the payment of the outstanding housing loan, the HDB resale levy (if any) and costs and expenses incidental and related to the sale of the property. The requisite CPF refunds in accordance with the applicable CPF Rules and Regulations to the Parties’ respective CPF accounts shall be made from the Parties’ respective share of the sale proceeds in the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Given the Husband’s conduct in these proceedings and his lingering hope of a reconciliation, the Wife is concerned that the Husband would delay the sale of the matrimonial home. I am minded to order that the Wife have sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial home. She is to consult the Husband on the sale price of the matrimonial home but in the event of any disagreement, the Wife shall have the final say on the sale price. The mortgage payments shall be borne by the Parties equally before the matrimonial home is sold. The Registrar/Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts shall also be empowered to execute, sign or endorse all necessary documents relating to the sale of the matrimonial home on behalf of either Party should either Party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the Party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Wife has asked for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home in the interim period before the matrimonial home is sold. This is so that she can reside at the matrimonial home with the 3 children. Given that she has been granted the sole conduct of sale of the matrimonial property and the care and control of all the children, I do not think this is an unreasonable request. I therefore order that the Husband shall vacate the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> without C1 by 12 July 2025 giving the Wife exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home with the 3 children. I accept the suggestion of counsel for the Wife and order that the handover of C1 to the Wife shall be at the matrimonial home on the date set for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home; this will cause the least disruption to C1, who can continue to stay at the matrimonial home until it is sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Parties shall retain all other assets in their sole names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Maintenance for the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The Wife has asked for continued spousal maintenance at $1,000 per month. However, considering her share of the matrimonial assets and her relatively young age, I am of the view that there should not be an order of maintenance that is aimed at creating a life-long dependency on the Husband (see for example, <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a>, at [31]). Instead, I shall award her a lump sum maintenance of $18,000 calculated by multiplying the monthly amount of $1,000 by a period of 18 months. This approach provides the Wife with transitional support while encouraging financial independence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Husband is to pay the Wife the lump sum maintenance from his share of the sale proceeds. If there is a shortfall, the Wife may enforce in the usual manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 4: Maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Wife submits the following breakdown of the children’s monthly expenses (with estimates provided for C1)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note:

update some of the expenses. Since C3 is now in Primary School, he would require pocket monies (at $50), school bus expenses (at $100) and ad-hoc school activity expenses (at $20) but not milk powder or diapers anymore. There would also not be any child care fees but school fees for C3 (at $7).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     C2 will also not require milk powder but should have ad-hoc school activity expenses (at $20).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     For transport expenses, I am of the view that they should be pegged at the price of a monthly concessionary pass for primary and secondary students, that being $39 and $49 respectively.

Since I am ordering the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home in order for the Wife and the children to move in and for the mortgage loans to be paid equally in the meantime before the matrimonial home is sold, I am of the view that the accommodation expenses of the children should only be factored in as part of the maintenance order when the matrimonial home is sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I turn now to the incomes and earning capacity of the Parties. I had earlier made a finding on the earning capacity of the Wife to be approximately between $2,200 to $2,700 per month in the interim maintenance application. Notwithstanding that the Wife had resigned from her employment as a Customer Service Officer and is currently self-employed with the assertion that her business has yet to generate sufficient profit to provide her with a sustainable income, I am of the view that for the purpose of this AM hearing, her earning capacity remains at between $2,200 and $2,700 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Wife submitted that the Husband had attempted to paint himself in poor financial straits, alleging that he owes debts to multiple parties (including his parents). The Wife disbelieved this and submitted that the Husband’s earning capacity is in the region of $12,000 per month. The nature of the business that the Husband was the controlling mind of were sophisticated in nature, operating in forex trade. Coupled with the extremely comfortable lifestyle that she and the children had enjoyed up until the breakdown of the marriage, it was her submission that the Husband was earning more than what he had disclosed in his affidavits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She also contended that the notices of assessment produced by the Husband for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2024 are not a truthful representation of the Husband’s actual income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Husband averred that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in failed business ventures and his loss of employment. He took on multiple jobs, including work as a safe distancing ambassador and a chef apprentice. He became an M &amp; E Assistant Project Manager in October 2021, earning a monthly salary of $4,000 for about 3 months before resigning to join another company as a Senior Engineer (Electrical) in January 2022. He was earning a monthly gross salary of $5,800 per month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> He resigned from this job in February 2023 due to a dispute over project budget and liquidity issues in the company and claims to be unemployed ever since while receiving financial help from his parents. He had taken courses and sought employment opportunities, but none were successful.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Husband’s last drawn salary was $5,800 per month. I accept that he was also a businessman and had a side income from his businesses. I am unable to make a finding that he had earned as much from his businesses as from his employment, given that a full-time job will require his time and resources. As such, I decline to accept the Wife’s submission that the Husband was earning in the region of $12,000 per month. In my view, although the Husband had claimed that he had no employment and no income since February 2023, the Court can take into account his earning capacity, which shall be assessed to be about $8,000 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Given the differing levels of earning capacity, it would be fair for the Husband to bear 75% of the children’s expenses. I therefore order that the Husband pay the Wife the following monthly maintenance for the children with effect from 12 July 2025: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,100 for C1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $930 for C2; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $830 for C3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     After the matrimonial home is sold, the Husband shall pay the Wife the following monthly maintenance for the children: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,400 for C1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $1,270 for C2; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $1,170 for C3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     All maintenance payments shall be deposited into the Wife’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Wife is represented by counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau. Her counsel has indicated that he would be asking for costs on behalf of the Director of Legal Aid. Counsel for the Parties shall provide the Court with their submissions on costs (capped at 10 pages) within 10 working days from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This set of divorce proceedings has gone on for far too long and both Parties had suffered immensely and gone through much emotional turmoil. It is regrettable that the Husband had not come to terms with the marital breakdown and at different junctures of the proceedings, his various counsel had raised his hope of reconciliation. The Husband had raged against the Court, counsel for the Wife and even his own former counsel for “speeding up” the divorce and breaking apart his family. I must emphasise to the Husband that no one involved in these proceedings takes any satisfaction in the dissolution of a marriage, and the protracted duration of these proceedings clearly demonstrates that there has been no undue haste.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The profound mistrust between the Parties has had serious consequences, most notably on their children. For the past 1 ½ years, C1, C2 and C3 have been deprived of meaningful interaction with at least one parent. Moving forward, it is imperative that both Parties set aside their past grievances and work to overcome their conflicts, redirecting their energy towards rebuilding the parent-child relationships and the well-being of their children.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The PPO which the Wife obtained for herself against the Husband by consent on 27 May 2021 remains in force.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [39]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [40]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [46]-[47]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [36]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>WA3, at [201] and Tab 54</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s affidavit filed on 19 March 2024, at [38]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>See [73] on orders relating to the handover.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>WA3, pp 614-615</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>HA2, at [121]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>These are not the real names of the company or the property.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>HA2, p 184</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>WA2, at [15]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>HA1, p 170</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>WA2, at Tab 4</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>WA3, at Tab 44</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Page 33, para 120c.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Para 122 of HA2</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>See para 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Page 292 of HA2</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>HA2, at page 245</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>HA2, at page 246</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>As at 8 May 2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Although the Wife asserted that there is another company (EF Pte Ltd) over which the Husband was the controlling mind, it was owned and operated by another individual.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>HA1, at [9]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit filed on 9 June 2023</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>HA2, at [18]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_28_1\" id=\"Ftn_28\">[note: 28]</a></sup>Two of the investors had made statutory declarations (exhibited at Tabs 31 and 32 of WA3) on the circumstances under which the undertaking was signed.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_29_1\" id=\"Ftn_29\">[note: 29]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions, at [140]-[142].

The applicant, who was 22 years old, is the daughter of the respondent. I shall refer to them as the “Daughter” and the “Father”. The Daughter was subject to family violence from the Mother as a child (though she said that the Father had also perpetrated violence against her, which he denied) and was placed in a safe home. The Daughter had then returned to stay in her parents’ home. However, the home was due to be sold and the Daughter would not have a place to stay. Further, she was attending university and had to work while studying to make ends meet. Against this background, she sought maintenance from her Father. I ordered the Father to pay her a modest sum of $500 a month.

Her big-ticket expenses were rent ($728), food and groceries ($550) and utilities ($160).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father did not challenge the Daughter’s list of expenses. The Father also did not dispute that he had not been paying maintenance for the Daughter. His written case was that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Year 2015 [the Daughter] intent to leave parents’ house and wanted to stay with one of her friend who stay at CONDO, in order to enjoy freedom life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I did talk to her that time and told her that if she wants to do so she has to be adopted by the friend parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">After that we will not [bear] any responsibility of her and she will not be entitle for any asset from parent.

However, a Court may order maintenance to be paid to a child above 21 in some specific circumstances, including when: “the child is or will be or … would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment …, whether or not while in gainful employment”: section 69(5)(<em>c</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The quantum of reasonable maintenance is determined by having regard all relevant circumstances including the earning capacity of the parent and the standard of living enjoyed by the child: section 69(4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Father had failed to provide reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father’s case appears to be that the Daughter had chosen to run away from home and in a sense “waived” her right to be maintained. Leaving aside the legal issue of whether a minor can waive her right to maintenance, the Father’s case is not even supported by the facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father accepted that around 2015, the “following week” after the Daughter had purported run away, “Child protection officer then send her to child home and she continue to stay there until 2019”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It is difficult to see why the Child Protection Service would place a child in care if the Daughter had run away to pursue “freedom”. That family violence was committed against the Daughter was confirmed by the PPO that was subsequently granted in her favour. Further, in Syariah Court proceedings, the Father had also filed an affidavit accusing the Daughter’s mother of physically abusing her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I thus did not hesitate to reject the Father’s argument had the Daughter had chosen to leave the family home and thus “waived” her right to maintenance”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father also claimed that he was not working and thus could not afford to pay maintenance. It is trite that beyond the actual income of a parent, the earning capacity of a parent is also relevant: s 69(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. His IRAS Notice of Assessment of Years 2023 showed that his employment income was $ 26,701, while for 2024 it was $28,918.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father explained that his job was project-based and the last project ended in December 2024.

From the beginning, she is with me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It is clear from the above that the Father did not think he should “torture” himself (<em>ie</em>, make the effort to find a new job) given his perceived personal grievances with the Daughter, whom he felt had left her. He also did not think that he should provide for the Daughter’s education, since it was her decision to pursue her studies. However, these are not legitimate reasons to refuse to pay maintenance. In any event, it was not even borne out by the evidence that the Daughter had abandoned him for “a better life”. As explained above, the Daughter had good reason to leave the house – she was the victim of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Further, the Father was 53 years old and there was no evidence that he was medically unfit to work. I thus found that the Father failed to pay reasonable maintenance to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I now turn to the sum of maintenance that the Father should be ordered to pay. The Father consistently maintained that he would not pay a single cent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As stated above, according to his most recent Notice of Assessment, his income exceeded $2,000 a month. The Daughter argued that he also earned rental income from properties in Bangladesh.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> However, I found that she had not discharged her burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I note that the Father has declared in his statement that his own personal expenses amounted to $720 a month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Father also claimed that his other daughter (19 years old) whom he needed to maintain was physically and mentally ill. However, he accepted that he had not tendered evidence to substantiate this argument.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I had also considered whether the Daughter should also seek maintenance from her mother as well. To be clear, this argument was not raised by the Father but it was one which I thought was relevant. Nevertheless, the Father gave evidence that “I was the only single working person and maintaining the family.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The clear inference that the daughter’s mother was not working during the marriage and hence it would not be reasonable to expect her to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Thus, taking into account the Daughter’s needs, the Father’s ability to pay, including his personal expenses, earning capacity, past salary and his need to maintain another daughter, I found that it was reasonable for him to pay $500 a month in maintenance to the Daughter, and I so ordered. To be clear, it was not even necessary to scrutinise the Daughter’s list of expenses because $500 is already a very modest sum which would not even cover the Daughter’s accommodation expenses. It should also be noted that the Father’s obligation to pay would also cease by operation of law once the Daughter graduates. Considering all the circumstances, the sum ordered is, if anything, on the low side.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>PPO XXX/2020, granted in SS XXXX of 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at pp 2 and 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Daughter’s documents at pp 13 and 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Daughter’s documents at p 90 (her Mother’s reply affidavit responding to the Father’s allegations).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Father’s documents at pp 23 and 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at pp 14 and 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Certified Transcript pp 18 to 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Father’s documents at pp 12 and 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Contested Divorce – Unreasonable behaviour – Section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2025-06-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3557 of 2022","title":"WPF v WPG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 67","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33403-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff-in-person","Defendant-in-person"],"timestamp":"2025-06-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>WPF v WPG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WPF <em>v</em> WPG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33403-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 67</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Husband, for his own reasons, contested the divorce strenuously. Much delay was caused by his purported heart condition, which saw repeated adjournments at first instance and on multiple appeals. As the Husband refused to proceed with cross-examination during the contested divorce hearing, I directed for an exchange of questions and answers to be conducted in writing, and proceeded to grant interim judgment on 5 March 2025. He now appeals against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties were married in 2009. They have two children, a female aged 15 and a male aged 4 at the date on which I granted interim judgment in the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife claimed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably due to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. Some background to her prayers is provided to provide the context for the events that have transpired. In the Wife’s prayers for ancillary orders, she asks for sole custody of the children, with supervised access to the Husband every alternate Saturday. With regards to financial matters, she requests that the matrimonial home (a HDB flat in Ang Mo Kio) be transferred to her with no CPF refunds or cash consideration, and that their car be transferred to the Husband. No spousal or child maintenance was requested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s Pleadings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife pleaded the following particulars with regard to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had alleged she was having an affair and demanded a paternity test to prove that their younger child was his, which allegation was eventually proven to be wrong;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had applied domestic violence against her on 23 October 2019 (kicked her stomach and pushed her against the window), on 4 February 2021 (held her neck and pushed her against wall), and on 29 November 2021 when he attempted to break down the master bedroom door and subsequently destroyed two CCTVs in the master bedroom;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     He had harassed and humiliated her by entering into altercations before her friends and making a report against her to the hospital where she worked;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He had pawned her jewellery and demanded money to pay for his car loan, and had failed to support the family since 2018;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     He had tried to forcefully take their young baby away on 1 February 2022; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_f\"></a>(f)     He had continually threatened to report her to the authorities for alleged tax violations that he claimed would send her to prison.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife went on to provide particulars of how the marriage proceeded towards divorce. She had filed an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Husband in January 2022. The Husband then requested for two church members to help them mediate for reconciliation in the marriage on 5 February 2022. This however ended in failure and another altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       According to the Wife, the parties then signed a Mutual Agreement on 16 March 2022 witnessed by a solicitor, Mr Foo Ho Chew of H C Law Practice (“Mr Foo”). The Mutual Agreement is exhibited in the Wife’s supplementary Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief (“AEIC”). Under the agreement, the Wife agreed to withdraw her PPO application, but if the Husband breached the good behaviour clauses contained therein, the divorce would proceed by consent with the HDB property being transferred to the Wife and her two children, in exchange for which she would compensate him $50,000, with no child maintenance required thereafter. On the basis of that agreement, Wife withdrew her PPO application SS 199/2022 on 22 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       However, the relationship broke down soon after with another altercation near the lawyer’s premises on 28 March 2022. The matter came to a head when the Husband allegedly breached isolation policy during the Covid-19 pandemic and came home despite being Covid-19 positive on 18 July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       According to the Wife, parties have not been living together since October 2019. Wife asserts that Husband would only come home whenever he wants money, did not contribute financially and instead collected rental from the two rooms that were rented out in their matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s Pleadings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In his defence, the Husband denies all incidents prior to 5 February 2022. He denied harassing her at her workplace thereafter and said he spoke to her boss only to ask for her withdrawal of the PPO application. As for the agreement on 16 March 2022, the Husband avers that the settlement agreement was only in relation to the PPO application. He also denies the various incidents thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In sum, the Husband denies having acted unreasonably towards the Wife and asks for the divorce application to be dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Striking Out Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband’s next step in the proceedings was to file SUM 734/2023 to strike out the exhibited mutual agreement from the record. This was heard on 12 June 2023, and dismissed by Assistant Registrar (“AR”) Keziah Simon. He claimed the agreement was invalid as he had received no legal advice, its contents were not translated to him in Mandarin, and he had signed it under pressure due to the Wife’s pending PPO application. The AR found that this was not the correct forum to set aside the Mutual Agreement, as it was a private agreement that was not the subject of a court order. She also declined to strike out the Wife’s pleadings in respect of the Mutual Agreement, as it could not be said to prejudice the fair trial of the divorce. Its inclusion merely served to put the Husband on notice of the Wife’s case in relation to the divorce and ancillary matters. Accordingly, SUM 734/2023 was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband then filed RA 11/2023 against the dismissal, which was heard by my brother District Judge Chia Wee Kiat. At the hearing, the Husband alleged that the Wife had conspired with his lawyer Mr Foo to deceive him into signing the Mutual Agreement. He also asked the court to rule on the reasonableness of the Mutual Agreement pursuant to section 96 of the Women’s Charter 1961. The court found his reliance on section 96 to be misplaced, as the issues raised in challenge related to the validity of the agreement. Accordingly, the court held that the question of reasonableness should only arise for consideration during the ancillary stage to the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband appealed further to the High Court in RAS XX/2023, but this was dismissed by Teh Hwee Hwee J on 29 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 9 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Following the Husband’s failed attempt to strike out the Mutual Agreement, the contested divorce proceeding was fixed for hearing on 13 August 2024. However, no substantive hearing was held until 9 September 2024, due to three adjournments that were granted on the basis of the Husband’s alleged heart condition. The details of these various adjournments can be found in my written grounds for the recusal application that the Husband was later to file in SUM 3015/2024, which was prepared pursuant to his further appeal in RAS 14/2024 (see <em>WPF v WPG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32334-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 91</a>, at [14]-[19]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The contested divorce hearing finally proceeded on 9 September 2024. It had been moved from an in-person to a remote hearing, in deference to the Husband’s alleged heart condition, so that he could be at liberty to call for or arrange medical assistance if needed. At the start of the hearing, the Husband protested against its commencement, revealing that he had <em>pre-ordered</em> an ambulance some four to five days before the hearing to take him away during the hearing. Nevertheless, as he was able to cogently advance his position with regard to his medical condition and answer the court’s questions, I allowed the Plaintiff to proceed with her examination-in-chief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the hearing before me, the Wife affirmed the facts averred to in her Statement of Particulars, which I summarise as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 23 October 2019, the Husband accused the Wife of having an affair with her degree classmate RG. He lost his temper and kicked her in the stomach, held her by the neck and pushed her forcefully against a window without a grill, which made her fear for her life. A police report was made by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In January 2020, under constant demand by the Husband for a paternity test on the allegation that the younger child was not his, the Wife finally agreed to a prenatal paternity test, which proved that the child did indeed belong to the Husband. She also alleged that he had prevented her from going on holiday to China, and had earlier told her friends and church members that the baby was not his, causing her humiliation, embarrassment and stress. When she learned that the Husband had pawned her jewellery and used the money to pay for the paternity test, she made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 30 April and 1 May 2020, she alleged that he asked for $100 from her, called her office and threatened to make her bedbound. She made a further police report as she was concerned about her children if something should happen to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 6 July 2020, the Husband allegedly followed the Wife and her daughter to a coffeeshop near their residence, asking money for the car insurance, shouting loudly, scolding her while pointing his finger at her, and threatening that he would send messages or videos of her allegedly having an extramarital affair to her workplace Facebook page. This left her emotionally distressed as it was a crowded premise and she was heavily pregnant at the time. The following day, the Husband allegedly shouted at her again, leading the Wife to be distressed and in pain. She delivered her younger son later that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 2 January 2021, the Husband allegedly drove to the Wife’s friend’s home while she was there and created a disturbance. The Husband informed her other friends not to contact her anymore, or he would otherwise make trouble for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On 4 February 2021, when the Wife kept silent in response to his request that she pay the monthly car loan, he allegedly held her neck and pushed her to the wall in the master bedroom, threatening her and accusing her of having a relationship with RG. Thereafter, the Wife was informed that the Husband had called her office to request to meet up with her boss, and had also called her close friends. His behaviour placed her in fear that he would harass her by airing their family issues with her friends and colleagues. Accordingly, the Wife applied for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_g\"></a>(g)     In September 2021, the Wife saw the Husband having a meal with another lady, who told her that the Husband had treated her to the meal. The Wife was upset that he would treat another to a meal when he had not supported the family since 2018. She thereafter requested the car to be returned to her but this was refused, which led to her filing a further police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On 29 November 2021, the Wife claimed that the Husband again accused her about the alleged affair with RG and threatened to report her for tax offences. He kicked the master bedroom door continuously and destroyed the CCTV in the master bedroom, which led to her calling the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On 30 November 2021, the Wife claimed the Husband followed her around until she was forced to make a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_j\"></a>(j)     On 24 January 2022, the Wife claimed the Husband called the hospital in her daughter’s presence and asked where to make a report against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_k\"></a>(k)     On 28 January 2022, the Husband allegedly pointed his finger at the Wife and made his usual allegations until she had to lock the master bedroom door to prevent him from entering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_l\"></a>(l)     On 29 January 2022, he came back to the house, and followed her around the house, until she had to call the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_m\"></a>(m)     On 1 February 2022, the Wife alleged that the Husband tried to take her young son from her, and followed her around outdoors, where he again tried to take the son away from their helper. When the Wife stopped him, the Husband allegedly pushed her very hard over her shoulder. This led to her calling the police for assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_n\"></a>(n)     On 2 February 2022, the Husband allegedly told the helper to leave the house and sat in the master bedroom, which made the Wife and daughter sleep in the helper’s bedroom. The police were called again for assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_o\"></a>(o)     On 3 February 2022, the Husband allegedly accused the Wife of having an affair again, grabbed her wrist forcefully, and only left when the helper made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_p\"></a>(p)     On 5 February 2022, the Wife agreed to meet the Husband’s two church friends to mediate. When she refused to withdraw her PPO application, he starting shouting and pointed his finger at her in front of the church friends, accusing her of stealing another person’s husband, and threatening to take the children away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_q\"></a>(q)     On 7 February 2022, the Wife stated that her boss texted her, as her Husband had reported her to the hospital where she worked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_r\"></a>(r)     On 16 March 2022, the parties signed a Mutual Agreement, on the basis of which the Wife withdrew her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_s\"></a>(s)     On 25 March 2022, the Wife claimed the Husband again shouted at her and scolded her while pointing a finger at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_t\"></a>(t)     On 26 March 2022, the Husband allegedly again accused the Wife of having an affair with RG, and threatened to report her to the authorities for tax offences which would result in her imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_u\"></a>(u)     On 28 March 2022, after consulting with her lawyer, the Wife alleged that the Husband followed her around, again accusing her of being a shameless woman and threatening to let others know what she had done on social media. While passing a coffee shop, he pulled her bag over her back harshly to get her to discuss with him at the coffee shop. He then followed her to the bus stop, while continually harassing her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_v\"></a>(v)     On 29 March 2022, the Husband again intercepted and harassed her at the bus stop in front of passers-by.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_w\"></a>(w)     On 28 June 2022, he came back to the matrimonial home, lost his temper, and again threatened to report the Wife to her workplace and IRAS, in front of her tenants and her children. She called the police thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_x\"></a>(x)     On 17 July 2022, the Wife claimed he came back to the matrimonial home with Covid-19, placing her and the children at risk, rather than submitting himself to quarantine under prevailing the prevailing rules of isolation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife had also tendered video and voice recordings (with accompanying transcripts) in relation to the incidents on the following dates:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     3 February 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     26 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     28 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     29 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     28 June 2022; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_f\"></a>(f)     17 July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In her supplementary affidavit, she further exhibited the Mutual Agreement which she claimed parties had entered into on 16 March 2022, which was signed by both parties and witnessed by Mr Foo. I note that handwritten amendments were made to clauses 6(c) and (d), to specify for joint custody, and also to make clear that the $50,000 compensation was contingent on there being no breach of clauses 1 and 3. The amendments were signed by all three parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In summary, the Wife claimed that she was drained after four years of emotional torture from and physical aggression by the husband, with whom she had not lived together since October 2019. She also pointed out that he made no financial contribution to the household, while collecting rental from the two rooms which were tenanted out in the matrimonial home. He would also appear to make trouble in the house whenever he needed money, and his actions had resulted in the loss of her circle of friends and embarrassment before her colleagues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At the conclusion of the Wife’s evidence-in-chief, the Husband refused to cross-examine her on account of his alleged poor health. After repeated requests for him to proceed, I took his continued refusal to mean that he had no questions in cross-examination and directed him to proceed with his evidence-in-chief. The Husband then proceeded to testify that he was “conned” into singing the Mutual Agreement. I informed him that it was no point disputing the Mutual Agreement at this stage as it was immaterial to the issue of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Whether the Mutual Agreement was valid and carried any weight would be germane to the ancillary proceedings. At this point, the ambulance that the Husband had pre-ordered arrived and the hearing was terminated prematurely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I would note at this point that the Husband had in his AEIC denied the alleged incidents on 23 October 2019, November 2019, 30 April 2019, 1 May 2020, 6 July 2020, 2 January 2021, 4 February 2021, August – September 2021, 29 November 2021, 30 November 2021, 24 January 2022, 29 January 2022, 1 February 2022 and 2 February 2022. He claimed that these were bare assertions, and as to any police reports made, no action was taken. He also submitted in his affidavit that incidents occurring more than six months before the filing of the Writ for divorce (dated 4 August 2022) should not be relied upon. I note that this position arises out of his erroneous reading of section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (which is now rephrased as the new section 95A(3) that came into force after the filing of the writ). Section 95(6) states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the plaintiff and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of subsection 3(b) whether the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant if the length of that period or of those periods together was 6 months or less.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The above provision has no relevance in the present case because parties had essentially ceased to live together since October 2019, and all the alleged incidents of unreasonable behaviour had taken place after that date. There is therefore no question of the Wife having acquiesced to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour by continuing to reside with him for more than six months after the fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In his AEIC, the Husband also provided his explanations for the series of incidents raised in the Wife’s Statement of Particulars. In summary, his explanations were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 5 February 2022, during a mediation session held with his two church friends, he did not lose his temper, point or yell at the Plaintiff, and the mediation was intended to help restore their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 7 February 2022, he denied threatening the Plaintiff through her boss at the hospital where she worked, and explained that his intent was to seek the boss’ help to persuade her to withdraw her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 16 March 2022, he claimed that he was unduly influenced by the Wife to sign the mutual agreement, did not receive independent legal advice, and did not understand is terms as he was English illiterate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 25 March 2022, he denied pointing his fingers at the Wife in the master bedroom, or yelling or scolding her in front of their daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 26 March 2022, he explained that he had told the Wife that the settlement agreement only applied to the PPO application, and should have no effect on the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On 28 March 2022, he explained that he had confronted the Wife to tell her it was not right of her to use Mr Foo as he had approached the said counsel first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_g\"></a>(g)     On 29 March 2022, he denied telling the Wife she was evil, that she would go to prison, or that he had shouted at the Plaintiff. He claimed they just walked and talked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On 28 June 2022, he claimed he did not threaten to report the Wife to her employer or to IRAS for tax offences if she refused to give him monies to pay the car insurance premium. He also explained he had simply removed the CCTV camera as it was faulty and had not forcibly removed it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On 17 July 2022, he denied threatening the Plaintiff in relation to asking her for financial help for his car insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_j\"></a>(j)     On 17 and 18 July 2022, he denied that he had returned to the flat with Covid-19, and claimed that he just had a normal flu bug.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 30 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     After the first hearing date of 9 September 2024 was disrupted due to the planned arrival of paramedics, the Husband filed a recusal application (SUM 3015/2024) against me. On the resumption of the hearing on 30 September 2024, I heard and dismissed the recusal application. However, the Husband refused to proceed thereafter with the divorce proceedings, on account of his health condition. I therefore directed that parties exchange a list of questions to be asked of the other party via correspondence copied to the court by 7 October 2024, and that if no further questions were tendered, I would take it that there would be no questions to be raised in cross-examination. I further directed that each party file their final reply affidavits, to be limited to answers to the questions raised, by 18 October 2024. The hearing of the contested divorce was then adjourned to 22 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In making these unusual directions, I note that under the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”), the court has the ultimate discretion to decide whether a party is to be orally cross-examined at trial. In particular, Rule 590(1) of the FJR specifies that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">590.—(1)    Without prejudice to the generality of rule 589, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    evidence-in-chief of a witness must be given by way of affidavit; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>unless the Court otherwise orders</b> or the parties to the action otherwise agree —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <b>such a witness must attend trial for cross-examination</b>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Further, Rule 591 allows the Court to give evidence of any particular fact by a statement on oath:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">591.—(1)    Without prejudice to rule 590, the Court may, at or before the trial of any action, order that evidence of any particular fact shall be given at the trial in such manner specified by the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In particular, the Court may order <b>that evidence of any particular fact may be given at the trial —</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)     <b>by statement on oath of information or belief</b>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    by the production of documents or entries in books;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    by copies of documents or entries in books; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    in the case of a fact which is or was a matter of common knowledge either generally or in a particular place, by the production of a specified newspaper which contains a statement of that fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I considered that given the manner in which the Husband repeatedly replied on medical certificates in relation to his heart condition to brazenly delay or avoid court proceedings, the only way to move the matter forward was to convert oral cross-examination to the written process described, since the Husband was simply unwilling to cross-examine the Wife nor allow her to cross-examine him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I would add that it was essential to take this case firmly in hand as by September 2024, more than two years had passed since the filing of the divorce writ. It would be an abuse of process to allow the Wife to be continually stymied by the Husband’s refusal to proceed with court testimony, in spite of every accommodation being made to allow him to participate remotely from a clinic or hospital if need be. I also note that allowing the Husband to write and respond to questions in his own time outside of trial would surely not tax his constitution. To date, he has not complained of any inability to file documents, and indeed has pursued appeals relentlessly during periods covered by his medical certificates. Nor would he suffer any prejudice by way of written exchange, since any issue which merited closer examination could have been followed up with a request for further questions and responses in writing. For these reasons, I was of the view that proceeding by way of written questions and answers would be the most expeditious and fair way to move forward given the Husband’s refusal to proceed with oral cross-examination in the contested divorce hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Written Cross-Examination Questions and the Wife’s Reply</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Both parties filed their cross-examination questions to the other on 7 October 2024. However, only the Wife replied with her reply affidavit dated 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the Wife’s reply, she made the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mutual Agreement was initiated by the Husband to get her to withdraw the PPO application, and he had pressured her to enter into the proposal. The lawyer Mr Foo was appointed by her Husband, and she had no prior contact or discussion with Mr Foo prior to its signing. Neither had she paid for Mr Foo’s services. She also denied that the Mutual Agreement was intended as a warning, and that they would reconcile after its signing. She subsequently employed a lawyer from PKWA Law Practice to file for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, she pointed out that Mr Foo was fluent in Mandarin and that the Husband had received independent legal advice from his counsel before entering into the Mutual Agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     She denied that the discussion with two church members on 5 February 2024 was for the purposes of reconciliation, and that the Husband’s request was for her to withdraw the PPO application against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 14 February 2024, the Husband had sent her an email in relation to his report against her to the hospital at which she was employed. The email reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Thank you (XXX Hospital) for a thorough internal investigation… I have evidence on my side that some of the actions of Nurse Manager (Wife) have seriously damaged the reputation of (XXX Hospital). If these actions of Nurse Manager (Wife) were published on the electronic network of mass communication, if they were published in mass media, the nurse manager (Wife) is going to jail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In 2024, the Husband had promised to send the car to the scrapyard by 12 January 2024 but failed to do so. He instead demanded that the Wife pay $5,274.69 that was owed by him to the car dealer. She had no choice but to make this payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To date, the Husband has failed to file a reply in response to the Wife’s cross-examination questions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I would also point out that the Husband was not labouring under the misapprehension that his intervening appeal filed on 7 October 2024 against my dismissal of his recusal application operated as a stay of proceedings. I had reminded the Husband of this point at the hearing of 30 September 2024, and the Husband had actually filed a separate application for a stay pending appeal in SUM 3232/2024, which was dismissed by my brother District Judge Chia Wee Kiat on 23 October 2024. Nevertheless, in the interest of natural justice, the hearing of the contested divorce was adjourned to allow the Husband’s appeal regarding the recusal application to be heard. After two fixtures on 19 November 2024 and 11 December 2024 before the High Court were adjourned, again on account of the Husband’s heart condition, the appeal was heard and dismissed on 28 February 2025 by Choo Han Teck J.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 5 March 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     At the reconvened hearing of the contested divorce on 5 March 2025, I considered that the Husband had had more than four months since the deadline of 18 October 2024 to file his reply affidavit. I could only take his failure to do so as a clear indication that he did not wish to respond to the Plaintiff’s questions in cross-examination. Indeed, from his conduct through the course of these proceedings, it did not seem that the Husband had any serious intent to contest these proceedings, apart from causing incontrovertible delay and inconvenience to the Wife. With regard to his explanation that his purported medical condition necessitated the delay, I repeat the observations made in my grounds of decision in the recusal application that the court has provided sufficient accommodation to his medical condition (<em>WPF v WPG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32334-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 91</a>, at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the present case, every reasonable accommodation has been made in view of the Defendant’s medical issues, including multiple adjournments and a shift in the modality of hearing, first to a remote hearing, and finally to an exchange of questions and answers by way of affidavit. There is no indication that the Defendant is unable to pen thoughts to paper to further his case, and these special directions have been given to move proceedings along in a manner that minimises any risk posed to the Defendant’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I further note that it had at this point been 2 ½ years since the writ had been filed on 4 August 2022, and an immense amount of latitude that had been granted to the Plaintiff at both the Family and the High Court on account of his alleged medical condition. This contested divorce hearing had itself been adjourned nine times over ten fixtures on 13 August 2024, 27 August 2024, 9 September 2024, 18 September 2024, 26 September 2024, 30 September 2024, 22 October 2024, 2 December 2024, 2 January 2025, and 5 March 2024. As mentioned, special arrangements had been made to ensure that proceedings could move forward while giving the Husband the option of arranging for medical assistance as needed during the hearing. Instead, the Husband had cynically taken advantage of this latitude by scheduling an emergency pickup by paramedics some four to five days in advance of the first hearing date of 9 September 2024. There can, to my mind, be no clearer indication of his intent to thwart and delay these contested divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As I had observed in my written grounds for the recusal application, justice delayed would be justice denied. In family matters, this adage carries even greater weight as the welfare of parties and their children may be irrevocably prejudiced by lengthened proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Indeed, as a general principle of litigation, once trial dates are fixed, the expeditious resolution of the matter before the court is paramount. It is not for a party to dictate timelines by its own default. This was recognised by the High Court in <em>Affert Resources Pte Ltd (in compulsory winding up) v Industries Chimiques du Senegal and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30495-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 305</a>, where the appellant had disregarded multiple court deadlines backed by an unless order to file its expert affidavit. In that case, Goh Yihan J dismissed the application for an extension of time to file the affidavit, which would have necessitated an adjournment of the trial, noting at [37] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is the respondents’ prerogative to want the matter to be determined as expeditiously as possible. Indeed, it is also the court’s prerogative for the expeditious determination of the matter in order to uphold the due administration of civil justice, where a party cannot hog a court’s time and resources for adjudication. Therefore, the appellant should not be allowed to dictate timelines by its own default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     This sentiment finds expression in English authority as well, in the case of <em>Wallersteiner v Moir</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/12194-E-M.xml')\">[1974] 1 WLR 991</a>. The plaintiff in that matter (Dr Wallersteiner) had his claim dismissed for want of prosecution, and judgment was entered on a counterclaim against him, as he had delayed proceedings by failing to file his pleadings for 12 months. On appeal, Lord Denning MR upheld the decision, emphasising that intentional prolonging of proceedings undermined the course of justice and would bring the legal system into disrepute. The learned judge noted at page 1017 that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The evidence shows that Dr. Wallersteiner has grossly abused the process of the courts. He has staved off the hour of judgment by one shift after another. He has fabricated documents in an attempt to deceive the courts. Even now he would seek more delay so as to put in a defence. If it were given to him, the case might go on for ever. It would so exhaust &quot;courage, finances, patience, hope&quot; that those who have lost their money would say of this court: “Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than go there.” I know there has been no trial of Dr, Wallersteiner. These proceedings are only interlocutory. But, even so, something must be done now. We must brook no further delay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In a similar vein, the present proceedings for an interim order for divorce should not be delayed any further. On the basis of the pleadings and affidavits filed, as well as oral evidence given at the earlier hearings, and the Wife’s reply affidavit to the Husband’s written cross-examination questions, I considered that there was ample evidence to proceed to decide the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     At the close of the hearing on 5 March 2025, I found that there was incontrovertible evidence of harassment by the Husband of the Wife over the course of the marriage in the years leading up to the filing of the divorce on 4 August 2022. The Husband had clearly threatened the Wife in relation to reporting her for alleged tax offences. He had seen through his threats to air their grievances to her friends, colleagues and her boss, the latter of which was clearly evidenced in his email of 14 February 2024. His behaviour had resulted in an investigation that had taken place at her workplace, which would have caused the Wife considerable embarrassment and humiliation. Further, the Husband’s explanation that he had written to the Wife’s boss merely to seek his help to get her to withdraw the PPO is specious and flies in the face of reason. There is no justification whatsoever for raising their familial dispute in the workplace context, except to humiliate her and pressure her to bend to his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I further observe that in the course of their disagreements, both at home and in public, the Husband’s tone had been consistently threatening and aggressive. This was evident in the various audio and video recordings tendered by the Wife. The numerous police reports made by the Wife also speak to the clear breakdown of their relationship in the years prior to the filing of her writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Financially, the Husband had also not provided for the household for many years, and despite taking the rental proceeds for the rental of two spare rooms in the matrimonial home, he continually badgered the Wife for financial assistance, most notably in respect of payment of the car insurance and related expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband had also left the matrimonial home since October 2019 and the parties had not had any meaningful relationship as husband and wife since that date. Quite to the contrary, it was abundantly apparent that the Wife lived in constant fear and trepidation of his harassing and controlling behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I also did not accord any credence to the Husband’s bare denials regarding the multiple incidents raised by the Wife in her pleadings. His refusal to subject himself to oral cross-examination or to provide answers to her written questions casts serious doubt on his credibility and motivation in contesting these proceedings. His intent is clearly not to preserve the marriage, but to inflict maximal pain and punishment against the Wife for her temerity to seek a divorce against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Given the compelling and overwhelming evidence, I had no doubt that the marriage had irretrievably broken down on account of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. It was also evident that there was no possibility of reconciliation given the failed interventions by mutual friends and the pattern of hostility exhibited by the Husband over the years. I therefore granted interim judgment in the Wife’s favour. As she did not request for costs, I directed that there be no order as to costs in these contested divorce proceedings.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Whether property is considered to have been “acquired” before marriage if it was purchased and partially paid for before marriage while the balance of the purchase price was paid for during marriage via the property’s rental income – Applicable considerations – Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Whether property which had been occupied for a total of about 16 months (in two periods) during an 8½ year marriage is considered to have been “ordinarily used ... by both parties ... while the parties are residing together for shelter” – Applicable considerations – Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Care and control – Child – Whether there should be an order of shared care and control on the facts","Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Child placed under shared care and control of his parents – Applicable considerations","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Applicable considerations – Difference with maintenance for wife – Sections 69(1) and 114(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Appropriate multiplier and multiplicand to compute maintenance for former wife in an 8½ year marriage who is gainfully employed and has one child"],"date":"2025-06-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1469 of 2023 (Ancillary Matters)","title":"XCR v XCS","citation":"[2025] SGFC 64","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33368-SSP.xml","counsel":["Eugene Chan Qi Ming (M/s Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the Husband","Malcus Poh June Zhe (M/s Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-06-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XCR v XCS</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCR <em>v</em> XCS </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33368-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 64</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Suppose that <em>before</em> marrying “W”, “H” purchases a property and pays for it partially using his own funds. Suppose further that “H” then pays the balance of the purchase price <em>during</em> marriage by using (a) his parents’ funds and (b) the property’s rental income. Has “H” “acquired” the property before or during marriage? Is the property a matrimonial asset? These issues arose in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the background facts. The Plaintiff (“<b>Husband</b>”) and Defendant (“<b>Wife</b>”) grew up in the People’s Republic of China and were married there in February 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Later that same year, they came to Singapore because the Husband had found employment here.

It was purchased in 2011, i.e., about four years <em>before</em> the marriage (2015). The Husband had paid the bulk of its purchase price <em>before</em> the marriage. The balance of the purchase price was paid <em>during</em> marriage via (a) funds from his parents (between 2016 to 2017) and (b) rental income from the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that the Wife did not make any payment towards the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       According to the Wife, the Beijing property is a “matrimonial asset” and she should thus be given a share of it.

They continued to reside there after the marriage, until the Plaintiff’s relocation to Singapore in May 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Beijing property was jointly renovated and prepared specifically for marriage, with the Wife personally overseeing the renovation, choosing furniture, fittings and interior design, with clear evidence of intent to use the property as the first matrimonial home have been provided by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Even after the parties moved to Singapore, the Wife continued to reside there for a period with her mother, and the parties returned to live in the Beijing home from May 2017 to August 2018 during the Husband’s employment in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties also hosted both sides of the extended family in the Beijing home for festive celebrations, including Chinese New Year and birthdays — affirming its role as the central family dwelling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Even after relocating to Singapore, the parties resumed residence at the Beijing property when the Husband worked in China between May 2017 and August 2018. It is significant that they did not lease out the property prior to this period, a telling fact that shows the property was held back for personal use rather than treated as an income generating investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The family’s use of the property was consistent and deeply embedded. The couple celebrated multiple Chinese New Years, birthdays, and reunions in this home with both sides of their family. It was a site of joyful family gatherings and shared tradition, further cementing its emotional and symbolic status as the nucleus of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The parties deliberately left the property vacant for the bulk of the marriage rather than leasing it out — a significant financial sacrifice that underscores the symbolic and practical role of the Beijing home as a family sanctuary, not an investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_h\"></a>(h)     It is further not disputed that the parties have resided in the matrimonial home during the significant months leading to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Husband submitted that the Beijing property is not a matrimonial asset.

Such works were carried out by the Husband with the assistance of a home designer and a foreman. As the parties were dating at the material time, the Wife would occasionally visit the renovation site and he would seek her inputs on the renovations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband had allowed the Wife and her mother to stay in the Beijing property shortly after the marriage. This was because he did not want them to incur rental expenses for their short stay in Beijing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Contrary to the Wife’s evidence, the parties did not have the 2015 Chinese New Year reunion dinner at the Beijing property. This dinner took place before the marriage and was held at the property for convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     When the Husband was working in China, the Wife had lived with him at the Beijing property for only about <em>nine months</em> – in June 2017 and from January to August 2018. Contrary to her evidence, she did not stay there in May and July to December 2017 as she was studying at NTU at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Apart from the periods stated in (d) above, the Beijing property was either rented out by the Husband or used to house him, his relatives and/or his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband was the sole party who dealt with the Beijing property. He did not need to account to the Wife for such dealings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Wife did not make any mention about the Beijing property in her first ancillary matters affidavit. This showed that she did not regard the property as their matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife’s case that the Beijing property is matrimonial asset is based on s 112(10)(a)(i) of the Charter. Accordingly, the issues are as follows. Was the Beijing property “acquired” by the Husband before the marriage? If the answer is yes, then was the property “ordinarily used by both parties ... while [they were] residing together for shelter”. If the answer to also yes, then the Beijing property is a matrimonial asset. I will now address these issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Beijing property acquired before the marriage</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     At the outset, I note that the parties took the position that the Beijing property had been acquired before their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I have difficulties accepting this position. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to s 112(10)(b) of the Charter, matrimonial assets include “any other asset of any nature <em>acquired during the marriage</em> by one party or both parties to the marriage”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) as referring <em>not merely to the point of purchase</em> of an asset, but to the entire course of its acquisition. See, for instance, <em>BHN v BHO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0091.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 91</a> (“<b><em>BHN</em></b>”) at [36] where the court accepted the following observations in <em>Chee Kok Choon v Sern Kuang Eng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/48907-M.xml')\">[2005] 4 MLJ 461</a> (“<b><em>Chee Kok Choon</em></b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">9    ... The word ‘acquired’ is not the same as ‘purchased’ as ordinarily understood. In a family law setting, especially in terms of division of matrimonial assets, a down-payment may have been paid, and one party may continue mortgage instalments for the next 15 or 20 years. <em>In such a case, the ‘acquisition’ continues until the asset is fully acquired.</em> ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Courts have applied the above interpretation of “acquired” to cases where the property was purchased by the owning spouse <em>before</em> marriage and the mortgage instalments were paid using the owning spouse’s <em>CPF funds during</em> marriage. Here are some examples.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>BHN</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">39    ... <b>even if</b> Lagoon View was <b>purchased before</b> the marriage, the plaintiff continued to service the housing loan through her CPF contributions <em>during</em> the marriage, until 1998 when the property became fully paid up. If the plaintiff had not been paying for the housing loan, any CPF contributions earned by her during the marriage <b>would have remained in her CPF account and would have to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets</b> for the purpose of the determination of ancillary matters. As such, at least a portion of Lagoon View should be viewed as having been “acquired during the marriage” and a matrimonial asset. Simply put, the fact that the defendant made no financial contribution to Lagoon View is irrelevant as matrimonial assets rightly include assets acquired by <em>either</em> spouse’s personal efforts during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>[emphasis in italics is in original text; emphasis in bold is added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>BGT v BGU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0050.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 50</a> (“<b><em>BGT</em></b>”) –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">29    ... it is well established that any contributions to [the husband’s] account from moneys earned <em>after</em> the marriage would form part of the matrimonial assets. If the husband had not been paying for the Tanamera property, his monthly contributions during the marriage would have remained in his CPF account and there would have been no doubt at the end of the marriage that those contributions would have to be included as part of the matrimonial assets. ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In our case, the Husband did not, during marriage, use his CPF funds to pay the mortgage loan for the Beijing property. Instead, the loan was paid with (i) funds from his parents and (ii) <em>rental income</em> from the property. Does the source of funds used to pay the mortgage loan affect the identity of the person “acquiring” the property?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In <em>THL v THM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18154-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 11</a> (“<b><em>THL</em></b>”), the court answered the above question in the negative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">41    ... The question which next arises is whether, on the Father’s argument, the London Properties should nevertheless be taken <em>out</em> of the scope of s 112(10)(<em>b</em>) because, as he says, <b>the funds used for repaying the mortgage loans come primarily from the rental income generated on those properties</b> and, to a lesser extent, his pre-matrimonial income. In other words, <em>BHN</em> only applied where the acquisition is serviced by “active earnings”; in <em>BHN</em> the acquisition was paid with salary earned. The unarticulated premise of this argument is that notwithstanding that an asset appears to have been acquired during the course of a particular marriage, the court should go on to scrutinise the <em>source of funds</em> for the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">42    In my judgment, this does not accord with the wording of s 112(10)(<em>b</em>), which <b>simply directs the court’s inquiry to the </b><b><em>timing of the acquisition</em></b> <b>of the property concerned</b>. ... Whether he funds a specific investment within this portfolio out of his salary or a pre-existing pool of money is arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis in italics is in original text; emphasis in bold is added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f\"></a>(f)     To sum-up –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) as referring not merely to the point of purchase of a property, but to the entire course of its acquisition. A property is “acquired” only when it has been fully paid for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       If the owning spouse continues to pay for the property during marriage for the purpose of acquiring it, then it is a matrimonial asset pursuant to s 112(10)(b). This is so regardless of the source of the spouse’s payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g\"></a>(g)     This leads to the next issue. Should the above interpretation of “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) similarly apply to the same word in s 112(10)(a)(i)? In my view, the answer should be yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, it is settled law that a piece of statute should be construed as a whole and purposively. It is well accepted that “the Parliamentary draftsman would not indulge in elegant variation, but would keep to a particular term when wishing to convey a particular meaning”. In line with this, a word or a phrase has the same meaning throughout the statute unless the contrary intention is shown. See e.g., <em>Chng Gim Huat v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0360.xml')\">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 360</a> at [101]; <em>Fernandez Joseph Ferdinent v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0065.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 65</a> at [24]; <em>Woon Brothers Investments Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 461</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/13184-SSP-M.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 777</a> at [19]. In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that Parliament had intended the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(a)(i) and s 112(10)(b) is to have different meanings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, to interpret the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) and s 112(10)(a)(i) differently will mean that the <em>same</em> property in the scenarios in [11(c)] and [11(e)] above is simultaneously (1) a matrimonial asset (when construed under s 112(10)(b)) and (2) not a matrimonial asset (when construed under s 112(10)(a)(i)). This is absurd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I am mindful that there is <em>dictum</em> in <em>USB v USA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“<b><em>USB</em></b>”) that <em>may suggest</em> that a property can be treated as having been “acquired” even though it has not been fully paid for. For ease of reference, I reproduced substantively [19] of <em>USB</em>. Note in particular [19(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19    ... Section 112 of the Charter contemplates that assets in at least three categories may be subject to the court’s powers of division. The classes of assets that the parties may possess are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    “Quintessential matrimonial assets” ...: these are assets which either spouse derived from income earned during the marriage or to which either spouse or both spouses obtained legal title during the marriage by applying their own money, and the matrimonial home, whenever and however acquired. The <em>entire value</em> of these assets assessed as at the ancillary matters date (generally) will go into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    “Transformed matrimonial assets”: we use this term to denote assets which were acquired before the marriage by one spouse (or, more rarely, by both spouses), but ... which were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. Once transformed, the <em>whole asset</em> goes into the pool but <em>if there is no transformation then, subject to (c)</em> below, any asset acquired before the marriage even if acquired by both parties would be dealt with in accordance with <em>general principles of property law.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    “Pre-marriage assets”: these are assets that either spouse <b><em>acquired </em></b><em>before</em> the marriage and ... which are not used for family purposes. These stay out of the pool unless ... they are <b><em>partially paid for </em></b><em>during</em> the marriage by the owning spouse with income that would have been a quintessential matrimonial asset had it been saved up rather than expended on the pre-marriage asset. Then, the proportion of the value of the asset that was<b><em> acquired </em></b><em>during</em> the marriage should go into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, <em>USB</em> do not preclude the view taken in [11(g)] above. <em>First</em>, the court there did not seek to lay down a definition for the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(a)(i). <em>Second</em>, there is nothing in its judgement to show that the court had been alerted to the caselaw and considerations in [11] above on the interpretation of the word “acquired”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Thus, in line with well settled caselaw, since the purchase price of the Beijing property was paid by the Husband (via funds from his parents and the property’s rental income) <em>during</em> the marriage, the property is a “matrimonial asset” pursuant to <em>s 112(10)(b)</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Did the parties “ordinarily use” the Beijing property together for shelter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given the above, there is no need for me to further determine whether the Beijing property qualifies as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     However, since the parties had made substantial submissions on this issue, I will make some observations regarding this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I begin by setting out the applicable principles. To qualify as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i), a property must satisfy three requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     “<u>Residing together</u>”. <em>First</em>, both parties must have resided “together” at the property. Section 112(10)(a)(i) is not met if only one of them had resided there: <em>UZK v UZL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24585-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 1248</a> at [35]; <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> at [66].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     “<u>For shelter</u>”. <em>Second</em>, the property must have been used “for shelter”. Unlike s 112(10)(a)(ii) (which provides for the transformation of solely owned assets into matrimonial assets by way of “substantial improvement”), it is <em>not</em> necessary under s 112(10)(a)(i) for the property to have been used for shelter “during the marriage”. In other words, a property may be transformed into a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i) even if the parties’ residence at the property had occurred <em>before</em> their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “<u>Ordinarily used</u>”. <em>Finally</em>, the parties’ residence at the property must be of “sufficient regularity and frequency”: <em>USB</em> at [24]; <em>CLB v CLC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27504-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 1 SLR 658</a> at [26]; <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19114-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1172</a> at [18]; <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> (“<b><em>BJS</em></b>”) at [23] and [24].

Put in another way, the purpose of this requirement is to prevent a party from acquiring a pre-marriage property by simply staying there “casually” or “occasionally” without contributing to the “marital partnership”: <em>Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0405.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 405</a> at [43]; <em>WQP v WQQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32591-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 2 SLR 557</a> at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In line with this, courts have held that a property is not a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i) in the following cases: (1) it was occupied only occasionally during a two-year marriage (<em>BJS</em> at [23] and [24]), (2) it was a holiday home that was occupied for only 21 days in a 14-year marriage (<em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0647.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 647</a> at [59] and [60]), and (3) it was occupied on only two occasions during a 10-year marriage (<em>JAF v JAE</em> [2016] 3 SLR(R) 717 at [15]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       At this juncture, it bears noting that while the length of stay at the property is relevant in determining whether it is a matrimonial asset – this is not a decisive factor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> What is more important is whether the property had been used as a <em>matrimonial home</em> – or, to put it more elegantly, as the “cradle of the family”: <em>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0605.xml')\">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 605</a> at [33].

According to him, when the son was an infant, he would take turns with the Wife to wake up at night to attend to the child and with the bottle feeding. It is also the Husband’s evidence that he had, among others, (i) coordinated the son’s weekly sessions with a speech therapist from September 2021 to February 2023, (ii) got the child ready in the morning and sent him to the childcare centre, (iii) picked up the son from the half-day childcare, (iv) enrolled him in full-day preschool, and (v) brought the child to the early intervention centre for four days a week since March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The foregoing evidence shows that the Husband is a hands-on father.

According to him, (i) he is able to work from home and be on flexi-hours, (ii) he will continue his arrangement of spending entire mornings with the son and bringing him for therapy sessions, (iii) he plans to buy an apartment close to the Wife’s future home to readily reach out and support the son when needed, (iv) he will enlist the help of his parents (who have a strong bond with the son) to help care for the son, and (v) he intends to hire the existing domestic helper (who is familiar with the son’s routines) to help with the household chores so that he can be freed up to care for the child. I find the Husband’s care plan to be “sound” and “practical”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) The Wife had failed to convince me that the above evidence should be rejected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(4)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whether the parents can cooperate within an arrangement of shared care and control?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – Yes</em> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>Parties’ positions</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) The Husband believes that he and his Wife can co-parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) The Wife is less optimistic. According to her, there is significant acrimony between the parties. Furthermore, the Husband had allegedly kept her out of important matters relating to the son. Specifically, he had (i) concealed from her information regarding the son’s diagnosis and recommended treatment, (ii) unilaterally made decisions on the child’s education and intervention methods without consulting her, (iii) failed to inform about the child’s field trips and a parent-teacher’s meeting, and (iv) failed to give her access to the son’s school communication app account until after she requested for it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) I am not persuaded by the Wife’s reasons as to why the parties cannot cooperate within an arrangement of shared care and control. These are my reasons.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i) <em>First</em>, the matters raised by the Wife do not prove that co-parenting is not possible. Specifically, these matters do not show that the parties clearly cannot (1) discuss and agree on the son’s daily activities and (2) ensure that his daily life is seamless even when he switches homes: <em>XLS</em> at [9(d)]. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) <em>Second</em>, the mere fact that there is acrimony in the parties’ relationship does not preclude a shared care and control arrangement: <em>XLS</em> at [9(e)]. In my view, the Wife can co-parent. I note the following evidence from her:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Although my marriage with the [Husband] is coming to an end, my only wish is to create a nurturing and secure environment for [the son] to grow up in. [The son] requires more love and support from his parents than other children, and I hope that, as his parents, we can both share this responsibility and work together to provide the support he needs for his life and development.

I accept the Husband’s submissions that the claims were raised only in the Wife’s last affidavit in February 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> and that he did not have the opportunity to respond to any of them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Given that the Husband had sought a shared care and control arrangement as far back as in his first affidavit (March 2024), the Wife could (and should) have raised her claims earlier as to why the Husband cannot be trusted to co-parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) For completeness, I wish to add that the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests. The <em>Husband is to note</em> that should he fail to involve the Wife in matters relating to the son, then this can affect, e.g., a court’s assessment as to whether such an order should be varied to a sole care and control order in favour of the Wife.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(e) <em>Finally</em>, I note the parties have been attending counselling to assist them in co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> This can help to reduce the acrimony between them. Counselling can also remind them that the son needs them to be able to work together in his best interests.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(5)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Has there has been attempt to alienate the son?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – Yes</em> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>Parties’ position</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) The Husband submitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_88\" id=\"Ftn_88_1\"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">... there are real concerns that the Wife will not be facilitative of the Husband’s access in the event where she has sole care and control. The Wife has a history of gatekeeping the child and preventing the Husband from spending time with the child.

s 114(2)(f) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iii)       The Wife had suffered economic prejudice as a result of her sacrifices for the family. To support the Husband’s career, she had given up her own career in China to follow him to Singapore. The Husband accepted that despite having a master’s degree from China, the Wife had found it difficult to get a job here based on her qualifications. The situation became so untenable that she had to undertake a course lasting for a few months to improve her job prospects in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Further, the Wife had to relocate from Singapore to China, and then back to Singapore again, so that the Husband could seek better career opportunities. During the marriage, the Wife had also stopped work for about 18 months to care for the son. Such a lengthy period of unemployment would surely have an impact on her career. To be clear, in deciding to order spousal maintenance for the Wife, I am mindful that such maintenance is not intended to compensate her for loss of employment or for income that she might have had the opportunity to earn: <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> at [43] and [44].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The multiplicand</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Having determined that it is appropriate to order spousal maintenance, the next issue is <em>how much</em> should be the amount in the present case. On this issue, s 114(2) of the Charter directs that if a court decides to order maintenance under s 113(1), then –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... the court is to endeavour to <em>place the parties</em>, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, <em>in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down</em> and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation: <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> at [31]. In my view, one way of achieving the objective in s 114(2) is to consider (a) what additional expenses a former wife would have to bear on her own, and (b) what income she would lose, as a direct result of the divorce. After considering these matters, a court will be in a better position to determine the amount of financial relief needed to help a former wife weather the transitions brought about by the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     It bears highlighting that when determining the quantum of the maintenance to order, a court is not required to ensure that a former wife is put in the same financial position as she was pre-divorce. Instead, a court is simply required to “endeavour” to minimise the financial disruption to her in “so far as it is practicable”. In this regard, s 114(1) stipulates that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>114.</b>—(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>a</em>) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>b</em>) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>c</em>) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>d</em>) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>e</em>) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>f</em>) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>g</em>) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Applying these principles to the present case, I make the following findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The maintenance sought by the Wife is unreasonable. <em>First</em>, she had failed to prove that if the marriage had not broken down, the Husband would have ordinarily paid for her expenses at $7,580/month. <em>Second</em>, I find that a number of the expenses that she had claimed for – e.g., transport (at $1,000/month), clothing (at $200/month), accessories (at $300/month), and holiday (at $1,000/month) – is excessive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span><em>Finally</em>, I fail to understand why she is unable to pay for her personal expenses given that her income is $3,009/month: s 114(1)(a).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the divorce, the Wife will have to incur rental expenses: s 114(1)(b). She would not need to bear such expenses “if the marriage had not broken down”. Accordingly, I find it appropriate for the Husband to pay the Wife <b>$2,500/month</b> as financial relief to help cover her likely monthly deficits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The multiplier</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The next question is for <em>how long</em> the maintenance should last.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Husband had submitted that the maintenance be limited to only six months. I am unable to accept the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The period of maintenance proposed by the Husband is sufficient to cover the Wife’s rental expenses for only half a year. Her income is unlikely to increase by $2,500 in that time. After this period, is she supposed to dip into her share of the matrimonial assets to cover the deficits?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, a short multiplier (such as six months) is generally ordered where there is a need to tide a former wife over for a short period to meet her immediate financial needs. One example is <em>UYD</em>. In that case, the High Court had ordered the man to pay his former wife six months’ maintenance to tide her over until he transferred $384,006.27 (of matrimonial funds) to her. Pursuant to the divorce, she had received four properties worth more than $15M. One of them was for her residence, and she could receive rental income from the other three properties as a substitute for maintenance: <em>UYD</em> at [65] to [67].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In my view, the period of maintenance should give the Wife sufficient time to adapt to her new circumstances post-divorce and to stabilise her finances. In this regard, applying s 114(1), I note the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife has a take-home income of about $3,009/month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, she has the capacity to earn more income because she (i) is relatively young (about 38 years old),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> and (ii) has a master’s degree in sports science and a Master of Arts’ degree in teaching Chinese as an international language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the marriage is about 8½ years. The duration of the marriage is important to ensure that the period of maintenance is not excessive. See e.g., <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [55] where the High Court rejected a prayer for a multiplier of three years of maintenance as being excessive when the marriage had lasted for only three years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Considering the factors wholistically, I find that a multiplier of <b>four years</b> of maintenance is reasonable. Such a multiplier is consistent with the following precedents:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col

On 2 December 2024, they had set ablaze the door of an apartment and had scrawled “O$P$” in indelible ink on an adjacent wall. They had done so in response to a job offer on a social media platform that promised payment of $2,000 upon the completion of these tasks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 5 February 2024, the youth pleaded guilty to the offence in the Youth Court, which called for a probation suitability report to assist its formulation of dispositional orders for the youth. While that report was prepared, the court extended the bail that had been granted to the youth on conditions that included a curfew from 9:00 pm to 6:00 am and a requirement to attend school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 30 April 2025, a probation officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development submitted the probation suitability report. Therein, she assessed the youth to have a “High” risk of re-offending. He led an “unbridled and unstructured lifestyle” marked by “chronic school absenteeism since 2017”, associated with negative peers, and minimised the effects of his actions. His family provided “inadequate supervision, permissive and neglectful parenting” that left unaddressed his behavioural issues. Given these factors, the probation officer concluded that the youth was unsuitable for community-based rehabilitation such as probation and instead recommended a 21-month placement at the Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (the “JRC”) of the Singapore Boys’ Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The prosecution endorsed these recommendations and submitted that a 21-month placement in the JRC was in the best interests of the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The youth and his parents asked he be placed on probation. The youth desired to reside with his family and promised to submit to electronic monitoring and the supervision of his parents to secure his compliance with a probation order. The parents of the youth aligned themselves with this position and were confident that the youth could comply with a probation order because they had “observed positive changes in him since the offence”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Everyone thus accepted that rehabilitation was to be the predominant consideration and was in the best interests of the youth, whose welfare was paramount concern in these proceedings pursuant to s 4(b) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”). I agreed. The offence, although serious, was not grave. The harm caused was limited to a charred door. The youth was just 14 years of age. Focusing on his rehabilitation was justified given the characteristically impulsive nature of his adolescent decision-making. Further, society was keen on his reform given the years that he had ahead of him (see <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> at [37]). What remained was for me to decide whether that rehabilitation would be realised better by placing him on probation or in the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As VK Rajah JA observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v Mohammad Al-Ansari bin Basri</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 1 SLR(R) 0449.xml')\">[2008] 1 SLR(R) 449</a> (“<em>Al-Ansari</em>”) at [55], a probation order is a community-based dispositional order. Even as it seeks to “protect society through the supervision to which the offender is required to submit, it both minimises the restrictions placed upon him and offers him the help of society in adjusting his conduct to its demands.” It aims to “strengthen the offender’s resources so that he may become a more responsible member of the community, which must also play a part in rehabilitating him.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As the Youth Court observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v XML (a minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33193-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGYC 1</a> (“<em>XML</em>”) at [8], two conditions must exist for a probation order to be viable. First, the characteristics of the offender must render him amenable to community-based rehabilitation. He must accept responsibility for his actions, desire to change for the better, and possess the self-discipline to bring that desire to fruition. Second, the offender must have adequate family support because probationary supervision takes place substantially in the natural setting of the offender and not in a closed institution. The probation officer is “never going to be able to supervise the offender closely on a day-to-day basis” (see <em>Public Prosecutor v GCB (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22932-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGYC 1</a> at [24]). It is thus incumbent on the family of the offender to ensure that he remains on the straight and narrow. In the words of Choo Han Teck J in <em>WLK v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29618-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 22</a> (“<em>WLK</em>”) at [12], “a disciplined home is essential”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Given the characteristics of the youth and his home environment, I agreed with the prosecution and the probation officer that the structured environment of the JRC would best realise the rehabilitation of the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     First, the youth tended to disregard rules while in the community. His school records from 2017 to 2024 revealed unjustified absences for between 38% and 91% of each academic year. In the limited time that he spent in school, he was disruptive during lessons, had altercations with his peers, used profanities, and was frequently late. Outside school, he had in 2024 paid a composition fine of $300 for using an e-vaporiser in breach of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed). Subsequently, he perpetrated the acts of mischief by fire that were the subject of these proceedings and was arrested by the police. But these events did not deter him. In February 2025, he was found to be in unlawful possession of an article resembling a tobacco product and paid another composition fine of $300 for it. This recidivism demonstrated a resistance to authority that would compromise community-based probationary supervision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Second, even as the youth professed remorse, he showed limited commitment to reform. He expressed unwillingness towards working with social service professionals on his rehabilitation but promised to do so “if it meant he would be able to be placed on probation”. He claimed that he would abide by the terms of a probation order but offered few substantive details on how he would do so. Indeed, compliance with even the conditions that secured his release on bail (see [2] above) proved beyond him. In April 2025 alone, he was absent at least 16 of the 21 school days that month and was late on four of the remaining school days. And he fared little better on the curfew despite the reminders of the probation officer. I excerpt the observations of the probation officer, which observations were not challenged by the youth or by his parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Irregular compliance to trial time restriction (TR) of 9pm to 6am imposed by PO [<em>ie</em>, the probation officer] since 7 Feb 2025. Was present at home during video call checks on 22 Feb, 8 Mar 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    It was noted that [the youth] was behind time in sending his live location on various occasions. Attributed his lapses to forgetfulness and being preoccupied with other tasks like showering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Returned home at 9.57pm on 15 Mar 2025 after visiting his maternal grandmother in the hospital. Both [the youth] and parents did not seek prior approval from PO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Was not present at home during a video call check on 25 Apr 2025. [the youth] explained to PO that he had misplaced his phone and transportation card during his commute home from school. Returned home at 11.19pm. However, according to [the youth’s school], [the youth] was absent from school without a valid reason that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Returned home at 9.38pm on 27 Apr 2025. Father only informed PO at 8.55pm that [the youth] was out visiting and caring for his sickly great grandmother at her house. [the youth] did not seek prior approval from PO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    In addition, paid no heed to PO’s instructions to regularly attend school during the period of social investigations. It was noted that it was a school-going day during a scheduled interview with PO on 1 Apr 2025, but [the youth] did not attend school. Reasoned that he had overslept that day and found it pointless to attend school as he would be eventually sent home due to latecoming anyway.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Attributed his failure in attending school to persistent ill health (that were not covered by valid MCs) and him oversleeping.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Third, the inability of the youth to work with the probation officer as she prepared the probation suitability report showed his unfitness for community-based rehabilitation. He missed interviews that she had scheduled with him to assess his suitability for probation. He evaded her questions on his school attendance and general conduct. And he disregarded her instructions to obtain medical certificates and to undergo a medical examination to determine if his health had affected his conduct. I reproduce the observations of the probation officer, which observations were not disputed by the youth or by his parents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Defaulted a scheduled interview with PO [<em>ie</em>, the probation officer] on 14 Mar 2025 as he claimed that he was unwell. However, despite PO’s instructions to obtain a valid medical certificate (MC), he did not do so. No reason was provided for his failure to provide a valid MC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    Defaulted another scheduled interview with PO on 20 Mar 2025, citing persistent ill health from the week before. PO had instructed parents to accompany [the youth] to obtain a valid MC, but they did not do so until 21 Mar 2025. Father claimed that [the youth] was so ill to the point that he could not leave the house to visit the doctor, and parents were unable to assist him out of bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">·    PO had also directed [the youth] to undergo a comprehensive medical checkup on 1 and 9 Apr 2025 to rule out underlying health concerns. However, there were no further updates provided to PO by [the youth] and parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On their part, the parents of the youth struggled to supervise him. First, they were “uncooperative” with the probation officer. They were “unforthcoming about their history with social service professionals” and “presented to have difficulties recollecting past events, including [the youth’s] attendance and conduct in school.” Second, they failed to enforce the curfew and the attendance of the youth in school despite the reminders of the probation officer, even as this failure was a breach of the conditions of the bail that the mother of the youth had furnished to secure his release in these proceedings. Third, their proposals on supervising the youth on a probation order lacked substance and were limited to “trusting him, checking his bags whenever he returned home, and locking the house gate by a stipulated time to ensure that he would return home before his curfew hours”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under a probation order, an offender is “conditionally entrusted with freedom so that he may learn the social duties it involves” (see <em>Al-Ansari</em> at [55]). But the youth lacked the discipline of his self and of his home environment to be entrusted with such freedom. The option that would best secure his rehabilitation was the closed and structured environment of the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     For completeness, the two accomplices of the youth were dealt with respectively in YC-900005-2025 and YC-900006-2025. The former accomplice was motivated to change his ways, was responsive to authority, and had strong family and community support that conduced to his rehabilitation. He was thus placed on a probation order for 18 months. The latter accomplice, by contrast, showed limited commitment to reform, was poorly supervised by his family and his community, and needed a structured environment for his rehabilitation. He was thus placed in the JRC for 21 months, with the Youth Court recording its grounds for this decision in <em>XML</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Parity in sentencing between co-offenders in a joint enterprise serves the penal objectives of retribution (ensuring just deserts) and deterrence (discouraging future offending). But these objectives held reduced significance in these proceedings. Here, the “first and paramount consideration”, as in all proceedings under the CYPA, was the “welfare and best interests” of the child or young person before the court (see <em>WLK</em> at [10] citing s 4(b) of the CYPA). My concern was thus less on ensuring utilitarian sentencing symmetry between the youth and his accomplices, and more on crafting dispositional orders that best rehabilitated the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having found that the institutional environment of the JRC would best rehabilitate the youth, I turned to consider the length of the time that he should spend there. In <em>XML</em>, the Youth Court had observed that the welfare of the latter accomplice was served by a 21-month stint that involved three sequential stages: 3 months to introduce discipline and structure in his lifestyle; 12 months to build his capacity for change and strengthen his support networks; and 6 months to re-integrate him into the community (at [4]). In my judgment, the characteristics of the youth and of his home environment were not unlike those of the latter accomplice. His best interests would be promoted by a similar stint in the JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I thus ordered the youth to reside in the JRC of the Singapore Boys’ Home for a period of 21 months, with effect from 14 May 2025. The youth is dissatisfied with this decision and has filed an appeal against it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I record my appreciation to Mr Philip Leong and Mr Jasper Yap, the advisers whom with me constituted the Youth Court for these proceedings pursuant to s 38 of the CYPA, for their service and their advice in these proceedings.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial Assets – Division","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife"],"date":"2025-06-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 2058 of 2023","title":"XNQ v XNR","citation":"[2025] SGFC 65","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33354-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Connie Kuan and Mr Tan Jin Song (Havelock Law Corporation) for the plaintiff","Mr Daniel Atticus Xu (Exodus Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-06-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Phang Hsiao Chung","html":"<root><head><title>XNQ v XNR</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XNQ <em>v</em> XNR </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33354-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 65</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

These were affidavits filed in relation to the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories in FC/SUM 1770/2024 and FC/SUM 1771/2024, respectively. On 13 September 2024, an Assistant Registrar ordered the Husband to make certain clarifications, on affidavit, in relation to 2 withdrawals (of $5,000 and $25,000 made on 1 and 3 June 2023, respectively) from the Husband’s bank account, and to provide documents in support of these transactions or, if the Husband was unable to do so, to provide an explanation on affidavit and disclose any documents in support of the explanation.

class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under the Interim Judgment, the following ancillary matters were adjourned to be heard in Chambers:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     division of matrimonial assets (including the Matrimonial Home);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Wife’s claim for maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     costs of the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As regards the division of matrimonial assets, the parties agreed that the structured approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> should apply. The parties also agreed that the parties’ direct financial contributions ratio should be 51.3 : 48.7 in the Husband’s favour. However, there was no agreement on the ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions. The Wife argues that the indirect contributions ratio should be 70 : 30 in the Wife’s favour. The Husband asks the Court to consider a 50 : 50 ratio for the parties’ indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife also submitted that there should be a further uplift of at least 3% of the average ratio in her favour. After the Wife commenced the divorce on 5 May 2023, the Husband withdrew a sum of $5,000 on 1 June 2023, and a further sum of $25,000 on 3 June 2023, from his OCBC bank account. The Husband claimed, in DA4, that the withdrawals were made “completely for [the parties’] son”, to “help [the parties’] son defray his expenses towards his tuition fees and the initial payment of his BTO (Built to order) flat”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Husband also exhibited certain documents in DA4 in support of this claim. The Wife submitted that those documents did not show that the combined sum of $30,000 was transferred to the parties’ son or used as payment for the son’s tuition fees or HDB flat, and that therefore an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband, and there should be an uplift in the Wife’s favour of at least 3% of the average ratio of the Wife’s direct and indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As regards the Wife’s claim for maintenance, the Wife sought maintenance of $800 per month for 3 years. The Husband submitted that there should be no maintenance for the Wife. However, the Husband listed in DA1 and DA2, among his direct financial contributions towards the Matrimonial Home, a monthly payment of $300 described as “Loan repayment on behalf of Plaintiff”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Husband also reiterated, at paragraph 26 of DA1, that he was “currently repaying” a “Loan of S$20,000.00 taken up by the Plaintiff”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of the matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I deal first with the division of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife explained in considerable detail at paragraph 15 of PA1 why she was the main caregiver of the son, and why she should be regarded as having made the larger proportion of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the matrimonial assets. The matters set out in paragraph 15 of PA1 that are relevant to the Wife’s indirect financial and non-financial contributions include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 1989, the Wife set up a printing business called APG using her savings. In order to take over the premises to be occupied by APG, the Wife paid the landlord around $20,000 of outstanding rent owed by the previous tenant. The Wife purchased machinery and equipment, including 4 cameras that cost more than $30,000 each. The Wife also paid for renovations costing around $15,000. The Wife estimated that she spent over $100,000 to set up APG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties registered their marriage on 3 March 1992. The Wife paid for the parties’ first matrimonial property on her own, using her CPF moneys and cash. The Wife also paid for the renovations to, and furniture for, the matrimonial property. The Wife made all of those payments, as the Husband was then unemployed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband was assisting the Wife with the running of APG by the time the Wife became pregnant in 1995. However, the Wife still had to go to work during her pregnancy, because the Husband was not familiar with the running of APG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties’ son was delivered by caesarean section, had jaundice after he was born, and had to be hospitalised for over 10 days. The Wife also had to return to the hospital after she was discharged, when the “wound split”. The Wife paid for the hospitalisation fees of over $20,000 using cash and her CPF moneys.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Wife continued to cook and do household chores after giving birth to the parties’ son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_f\"></a>(f)     After the parties’ son was discharged from the hospital, the Wife brought the son out for “suntan” every morning. The Wife also brought the son for check-ups at the polyclinic for 18 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_g\"></a>(g)     As the Husband was unfamiliar with aspects of APG’s business, the Wife would return to the office with the parties’ son to finish the work. While running APG’s business, the Wife topped up $30,000 into the Husband’s “Medishield account” (sic) for him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_h\"></a>(h)     In 1997, the Husband refused to let the Wife go back to running APG full-time, even though the Wife wanted to do so. The Wife therefore found a job, and engaged a domestic helper to look after the parties’ son while the Wife was at work. The Wife paid for the domestic helper’s salary and related expenses on her own, without help from the Husband. The Wife also took care of the parties’ son, and cooked dinner, after returning home from work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_i\"></a>(i)     In 1998, whenever the parties’ son fell sick while attending daycare, the Wife attended to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_j\"></a>(j)     In 1999, when the son was in kindergarten, the Wife would send the son to school and pick up the son from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_k\"></a>(k)     The Husband left everything concerning the education of the parties’ son to the Wife. The Wife visited several schools before enrolling the son in a kindergarten that the Wife thought would provide a better environment for the son. The Wife also enrolled the son in an English course that cost around $1,600, which the Wife paid for using her salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_l\"></a>(l)     When the parties’ son started primary school in 2003, the Wife would wake him up, get him ready for school, and wait with him for the school bus. The Wife also took leave to accompany the son on the first 3 days of school. When the son attended primary school in the afternoon, the Wife would go to work later, and pick up the son after work. The Wife cooked the family’s meals when she did not have to work on Sundays. The Wife helped the son with his homework until he was in Primary 4, when she could no longer help him. The Wife attended all the meet-the-parents sessions of the son’s school on her own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_m\"></a>(m)     Until 2007, the Wife continued to go back to APG after work to complete tasks that the Husband did not know how to do. When the parties’ son was young, the Wife would bring him along, and watch over him while she finished tasks. Throughout the years from 1989 to 2007, the Wife would liaise with APG’s clients, take orders, give quotations, and meet with APG’s clients after work, on Saturdays or while she was on leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_n\"></a>(n)     The Wife paid for the family’s expenses without help from the Defendant, including car-related expenses for 5 cars purchased over 12 years and registered in the Husband’s name. The car-related expenses included monthly instalments, road tax, petrol, car park charges, insurance, ERP (or “Electronic Road Pricing”) charges and fines. The Wife paid for the expenses using her salary and the moneys in APG’s bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_o\"></a>(o)     The Wife gave the parties’ son pocket money (on top of what the Husband was giving) all the way until the son was in National Service. The Wife also paid for the son’s toys and other items while he was growing up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_p\"></a>(p)     When the Wife injured her spine in 2005, she had to pay for her surgery on her own. The Husband did not care for her after the surgery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_q\"></a>(q)     In 2007, when the Husband told the Wife that his friend wanted to join APG for $25,000, the Wife agreed and transferred the business to the Husband’s name. However, the Husband did not pay the Wife for the business, even though she followed up with him a few times; the Husband kept telling the Wife that the business was not making money and he could not pay her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_r\"></a>(r)     In 2009, when the parties’ son started attending secondary school, the Wife would send him to school. The Wife continued to send the son to school until he completed polytechnic education. She also sent him to his campsite, and sent him home when he booked out from camp, until he almost finished his National Service in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In contrast, paragraphs 18 and 19 of DA1 merely contained particulars of the Husband’s direct and indirect financial contributions. The indirect contributions particularised in paragraph 19 of DA1 comprised the son’s school expenses, pocket money, handphone charges, and expenses for weekend meals and healthcare. The bulk of those expenses were incurred after the Wife was retrenched in January 2010. The Husband repeated those particulars at paragraphs 18 and 19 of DA2. Although the Husband stated at paragraph 21 of DA2 that he had “devoted a lot of time and shared all caretaking responsibilities during the course of [the parties’] marriage”, the Husband provided no details of his indirect non-financial contributions. The Husband did not deny any of the Wife’s statements concerning her indirect financial and non-financial contributions. The Husband in fact acknowledged the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions when he stated in paragraph 21 of DA2 that “both parties have expended huge efforts towards the upbringing of [the parties’] son during the course of [the parties’] marriage”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The parties’ son made certain allegations concerning his upbringing in paragraph 6 of SA1. However, I disregarded those allegations, and similar allegations made by the Husband in paragraph 6 of DA4. To begin with, none of those allegations were relevant to the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories, or to the Husband’s compliance with the orders made on 13 September 2024. Any allegations disputing the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions should have been contained in DA2, and should have been made within the time allowed by the Court for the filing of DA2 (i.e. by 29 February 2024). Those allegations appeared to be an attempt to introduce belatedly, without the permission of the Court, evidence that is designed to prejudice the Court against the Wife, on an occasion where the Wife had no opportunity to respond to those allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having regard to the evidence contained in PA1, PA2, DA1 and DA2, it is clear that both parties have made indirect financial contributions over the course of the marriage. Given the course of time, and the lack of documentation, it will not be possible to say with certainty whether the Husband or the Wife made more indirect financial contributions. The Husband did not dispute the Wife’s contentions that she supported him and the family financially during the marriage. It appeared that the Husband stepped up after the Wife encountered difficulties with her health, employment and undertakings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     However, the Wife appeared to have made significantly more indirect non-financial contributions than the Husband over the course of the marriage. For instance, the Wife appeared to have been the son’s main caregiver until the Wife started to drive a taxi full-time in 2011. The bulk of the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions were made in the early years of the parties’ marriage, during the formative years of the parties’ son. The details of the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions, which were asserted in paragraph 15 of PA1 and summarised at paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Plaintiff’s written submissions, were not denied by the Husband in DA2. The Husband made vague statements, such as that he had “devoted a lot of time and shared all caretaking responsibilities” and “expended huge efforts towards the upbringing of [the parties’] son”, but provided no particulars of his indirect non-financial contributions, in DA1 and DA2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     All things considered, I assigned the parties’ indirect contributions the ratio of 60 : 40 in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I agreed with the Wife’s submission that the Husband had failed to properly account for the total of $30,000 withdrawn from the Husband’s OCBC Account on 1 and 3 June 2023. The Husband did not explain how the documents exhibited at pages 5 to 13 of DA4 supported his claim that the withdrawals were made completely for the parties’ son, to help the son defray the son’s expenses. The exhibited documents did not suggest that the parties’ son was required to pay any amount of his tuition fees, or to repay any amount of his tuition fee loan, on or about 1 or 3 June 2023. Nor did the documents suggest that the son was required to pay any amount to the HDB for the son’s flat on or about 1 or 3 June 2023. The writ for divorce, statement of claim and statement of particulars were received by the Husband on 13 May 2023. The withdrawals were made just a few days before the Husband filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 7 June 2023, and appeared to be timed to reduce the amount of matrimonial assets available for distribution. Even if the son ultimately benefitted from the withdrawals made on 1 and 3 June 2023, that did not change the complexion of those withdrawals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, I did not think I should make an arbitrary uplift of 3% in the Wife’s favour on account of the Husband’s failure. If the Husband had properly accounted for that sum of $30,000, it would have formed part of the Husband’s direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets, and enlarged the pool of matrimonial assets available for distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The parties arrived at the direct financial contributions ratio of 51.3 : 48.7 in the Husband’s favour on the basis that the Husband’s direct financial contributions amounted to $287,533.62 while the Wife’s direct financial contributions amounted to $272,785.35. If the sum of $30,000 was added back to the pool of matrimonial assets for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the Wife’s share of the Joint Assets, then notionally the Husband’s direct financial contributions would increase to $317,533.62, or 53.8% of the parties’ total direct financial contributions of $590,318.97. The direct financial contribution ratio would then be 53.8 : 46.2 in the Husband’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As I have assigned the parties’ indirect contributions the ratio of 60 : 40 in the Wife’s favour, after averaging the parties’ direct and indirect contributions, I would arrive at a final ratio of 53.1 : 46.9 in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     If the sum of $30,000 was added back to the pool of matrimonial assets for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the Wife’s share of the Joint Assets, then notionally the matrimonial assets available for distribution would be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

However, there were other expenses listed by the Husband that appeared reasonable. For instance, the Husband claimed, when DA2 was affirmed on 11 March 2024, that he was paying the following monthly expenses (which collectively would expend most of the Husband’s monthly take home salary): (a) $837 for the housing loan for the Matrimonial Home; (b) $67.50 for service and conservancy charges; (c) $40 for water; (d) $100 for electricity; (e) $13 for property tax; (f) $100 for transportation; (g) $450 for food and beverages; and (h) $300 for “Loan repayment on behalf of Plaintiff”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It was not disputed that the Wife had borrowed at least $18,000 under a loan for which the Husband had acted as a guarantor, and that the Husband had made monthly repayments of $300 towards the loan, at least until 28 April 2023,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> before the Wife filed the writ for divorce.

However, the Husband declined to reciprocate when the Wife was in poor health and unable to work, primarily on the ground that he lacked the means to support her. While the amount to be paid by the Husband to the Wife for her share of the Matrimonial Home may go some way to meeting her expenses, a part of that amount would have to be refunded to her CPF accounts in accordance with the applicable CPF legislation, and another part of that amount would be required by her for alternative accommodation. I was mindful that both parties had limited financial resources. As the Husband claimed that his monthly expenses included a repayment of $300 a month towards the discharge of the loan taken by the Wife (for which the Husband was a guarantor), there would be no increase in the Husband’s monthly expenses if he was ordered to continue the monthly repayments, for a period of 2 years, in satisfaction of the Wife’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the matters listed in section 114(1)(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>), (<em>d</em>), (<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, I ordered the Defendant to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Wife, in satisfaction of the Wife’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     At the hearing on 21 January 2025, the Wife’s counsel applied for the Husband to pay costs of $1,500 to $2,000, as the Court had agreed with the Wife’s submissions for indirect contributions and her claim for maintenance. The Wife’s counsel also sought costs for the original hearing of the ancillary matters on 18 December 2024, which had to be adjourned when the Husband’s counsel failed to attend the hearing. By a letter dated 18 December 2024 sent after the hearing, the Husband’s counsel apologised for his absence, and explained that due to an oversight following the departure of a paralegal, the Husband’s counsel was scheduled with 3 other matters (including a mediation at the State Courts) that clashed with the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband’s counsel left the issue of costs to the Court. He pointed out that this was a “small family matter”, and asked for the costs of the adjournment to be awarded against him (instead of his client) as the adjournment was caused by his error.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I am mindful that in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17741-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 6</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>, at [32] and [33], the Family Division of the High Court observed that there are usually good reasons in the context of matrimonial proceedings to depart from the guiding principle that costs should follow the event. Citing rule 852(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as in force at the time that <em>JBB v JBA</em> was decided), the Court also observed that the principle that costs should follow the event may be departed from where it is appropriate to do so. In the context of divorce proceedings, the Court gave as examples (of when this would be appropriate) cases where the judgment of divorce was obtained based on a “neutral” fact such as “living apart” or upon compromise by the parties to proceed on an uncontested basis (whatever the fact relied on), or where an order of costs would aggravate the acrimony between the parties and it was important in the circumstances to reduce the risk of increasing hostility. The Court also observed that in the context of the hearing of ancillary matters (which may be considered to be discrete from the divorce proceedings), it is the conduct of the parties in the proceedings which will have greater relevance in the exercise of the discretion in determining costs, and that a party who has been uncooperative in disclosing his or her assets and means would be unlikely to receive a favourable costs order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Under rule 852(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as in force immediately before 15 October 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> if the Court in its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings, the Court shall order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made. The hearing of the ancillary matters before me was not one to which any of the usual reasons (for departing from the principle that costs should follow the event) applied. As the Wife had substantially succeeded in obtaining the share of the Joint Assets that she was seeking, and as the Husband was also ordered to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Wife in satisfaction of Wife’s claim for maintenance, the Wife was the successful party at the hearing of the ancillary matters, and should therefore in principle be awarded the costs of that hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     For the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Wife and the Husband filed 2 affidavits each. These were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     PA1 (16 pages of statements and 126 pages of exhibits);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)     PA2 (5 pages of statements and 6 pages of exhibits);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_c\"></a>(c)     DA1 (7 pages of statements and 174 pages of exhibits); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_d\"></a>(d)     DA2 (8 pages of statements and 87 pages of exhibits).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The main hearing of the ancillary matters on 14 January 2025 lasted from 2:30 pm to 3:13 pm. The short hearing was made possible by the prior filing of a 14-page written submission on behalf of the Wife (the page count excludes the cover page, the table of contents and the Annex to the written submissions) and a 13-page written submission on behalf of the Husband (the page count excludes the cover page). This was followed by a hearing on 21 January 2025 lasting from 8:30 am to 9:35 am, at which I delivered an oral judgment and received submissions on the form that the order for maintenance should take and on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     All things considered, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the costs of the ancillary matters fixed at $1,500 all in. I also ordered the Husband’s counsel to personally bear the costs of adjournment on 18 December 2024, fixed at $100.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See DA1 paragraphs 2 and 6(b), and DA2 paragraphs 2 and 6(b).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3 and Annex A, DA1 paragraph 3, and DA2 paragraph 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraphs 3 and 4 and Annexes A and D.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3, Section B paragraph 8 and Annex C, DA1 paragraph 12, and DA2 paragraph 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3, Section B paragraph 8 and Annex B.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>See PA1 Section B paragraph 9 and Annex F.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>See DA1 paragraph 12.

Both the Mother and the Father were unrepresented at the hearing before me. The Mother had one witness at the hearing: her current Husband (“X”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I reserved judgment after hearing oral submissions from both parties. On 2 April 2025, I delivered judgment, dismissing the Mother’s application. These are my grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The law makes it clear that to succeed in an application for a PPO, the applicant must establish two things.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       First, that the respondent had committed an act of family violence (as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> or that the respondent was likely to commit family violence. What this means is that the applicant does not actually have to show that the respondent had committed family violence – rather, it is sufficient to show that the respondent was likely to do so: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Second, the applicant must show that the PPO is “necessary for the protection” of the family member that is sought to be protected. This is, in essence, a risk assessment: <em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [70] citing <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19]. The court will consider factors such as the likelihood of interactions between the parties, whether the underlying cause for family violence remains unresolved, and respondent specific factors (<em>eg</em> where the respondent has displayed a propensity for violence).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The applicant must establish both these aforementioned elements on a balance of probabilities. As to what the “balance of probabilities” means, a useful definition may be found in <em>Lua Bee Kiang (administrator of the estate of Chew Kong Seng, deceased) v Yeo Chee Siong</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22830-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 145</a> where the Court of Appeal observed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">65    Proof on a balance of probabilities is a standard of proof that is applied in civil cases generally to discern whether a past event happened. Such proof is necessary for the court to determine “whether [the plaintiff’s] case is more probably true than untrue” (see Jeffrey Pinsler, <em>Evidence and the Litigation Process</em> (LexisNexis, 6th Ed, 2017) at para 12.092). <b>In the absence of an exhaustive historical record, the notion that an event was more likely than not to have happened is an epistemic proxy for whether it did in fact happen…</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It is with these principles in mind that I turn now to consider the Mother’s application in SS 1477.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Alleged incidents of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 29 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The latest incident of family violence which the Mother complained of took place on the 29<sup>th</sup> of July 2024. This was the Mother’s account of events as set out in her complaint form.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to the Mother, when she was arriving at her parent’s residence, she saw the Father grabbing the son forcefully by his shoulder. At this time, the Mother’s niece was next to the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother was shocked to see the Father. Although there was a court order granting care and control of the son to her, the order also provided for the Father to have access. However, the Father had to give two weeks advance notice. The Mother says that the Father never gave such notice and would simply turn up unannounced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother confronted the Father as to where he was taking the son. The Father ignored her and simply asked why she cared before heading off with both the son, and the Mother’s niece, to the carpark.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Not wanting to confront the Father (because she was pregnant at the time and thus feared for her safety), the Mother went up to her parent’s home to ask why the Father had taken the son. Her parents told her that they were unaware of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Afraid that the Father would take the son away to Malaysia, given that he had mentioned doing so previously, the Mother called X for help. X sought police assistance and made his way down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     When the Mother went down to the foot of the block, she saw the Father “provoking and instigating” her Husband to a fight with “vulgar actions and verbal abuse”. The Mother called out to the son and her niece to come with her. The Father, and his girlfriend, pulled the son away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father kept mocking and taunting the Mother’s family members. The Mother claimed that the Father had grabbed the son by the neck, which caused the son “fear and hurt”. The son was traumatised and “started crying all the way”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother pleaded with the Father to let the son go. The Father refused. He continued to hurl insults and instigated X to fight him. The Mother alleges that the Father was “behaving like a wild insane person as he has always done before”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     X began to record the incident. This deescalated the situation somewhat, although the Father continued to “grab on” to the son’s neck.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     When asked to let go of the son, the Father pulled the son “even tighter” and told the Mother to keep her hands off the son otherwise he would hit her. The Mother says that this caused “fear in [the] son, [her] niece and other family members” as she was “26 weeks pregnant” and “all feared that [the Father] would harm [her] and [the] baby”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The situation was defused when the police arrived on the scene. The Mother says the officers advised her to apply for a PPO after hearing why they had called for police assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I do not find that the Father had committed an act of family violence on the son in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother had produced a set of images and videos which were taken by X. The images and videos show a tiny snippet of what had taken place during that incident. It was clear that the son had, unfortunately, been caught up in the heated argument between the Father, and the Mother and her relatives (including X). Both sides were shouting at each other, and any verbal abuse which the Father had hurled, was certainly not directed at the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As to the Mother’s specific allegation that the Father had held the son by his neck during this incident, I do not find this to be the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For one, the Mother had considerable difficulty describing exactly how the Father had allegedly grabbed the son by the neck. Initially, the Mother said:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Yes. And my son’s face was frozen up because when I called---when <b>I called him then he was actually holding my son over the neck, like over the shoulder like that.</b> So, I’m not so sure what was that. So, when I went back home then my ha---uh, I called my husband immediately, then my sister also realised that, uh, it was not a access date or---so, she went down to bring my son back, lah. And I also went down together to see---to bring my son back. Then what I noticed is I saw---uh, my hus---when my husband arrived, I saw my husband below also, ah. So, I saw [the Father] is like, you know, scolding my husband in vulgarities. <b>He was holding my son’s neck like that, grabbing my son neck when I saw him also, ah.</b> So, I---he was---and scolding my husband vulgarities and taunting him to fight in front of the child, lah. Then I---immediately I went in front of him and---and told him, “Please leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go. That I’m here already, I’m the mother, I’m here already. You let him go.” But he insists not to let go, and he asked me to move away before he hit me. I’m actually pregnant that time, ah. I was 7, 8 months pregnant, lah. So, he was saying that he will hit me if I come nearer or touch my son. So, my husband was a bit---my husband was very, uh, upset with this, ah. Then my mum also came down because it was a big commotion down---it was so loud, the neighbour also was there. And he was dragging [the son] by the neck, pulling him here and there, not letting him go. So, I was like wondering why he’s doing this? But when I want to approach him, he keep on saying that he will hit me and hit me, ah. Then, uh, he keep on, like, you know, mocking, threatening, you know, all this, what he used to do he was doing it on that day, ah. He---he stopped when the police arrived. Until then he was just dragging my son here and there. So, this was---happened on that day, huh, then, uh--- yah, then my husband took a video and some shots like, uh, some shots that he’s been---he threatening my son and scolding my son, and---and he also like, uh, telling me that he will hit me, repeating again and again, approaching me. The girlfriend was actually stopping him, ah. In the video, you can see, yah. Then, uh, when I went back home, I had a conversation with my son. So, my son was actually very traumatised by the incident. I’m calmed him down and you know, we had a talk over this incident. He was saying that he was very upset. I asked him why---like when I was---I saw you below under the lift why didn’t you just come? Then he said that he was grabbing him very hard here, not letting him go. Then he---he also very worried that he might harm me. So, because I’m also pregnant. So, he---he’s very scared he will harm me so, he just followed him. Then when, uh---then he said that---uh, he was very upset that he was not letting him go when he was---<b>he was grabbing during the incident when he saw my husband, right, so, he was in pain also, ah</b>. So, the next day he didn’t go to school because he was very traumatised that he will appear again and create this, uh---this, uh, this unpleasant scene again, ah. So, he was very scared to open the door also then, uh, I let him rest. He was---he was very, um, threatened and he was full of fear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     However, it soon became apparent that there were gaps in the Mother’s memory when she was asked to describe, in detail, how the Father had grabbed the son by the neck.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even if one accounts for the erosion of memory with the passage of time, one cannot ignore the context in which the Father had allegedly grabbed the son by the neck. It was clear that this had taken place amidst a heated quarrel between the Father, the Mother and her relatives. The videos and the images that had been produced showed that there was a tussle over the son, and the Father was trying to hold on to him by his left shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Considering the above-mentioned points together, I found it highly unlikely that the Father had grabbed the son by the neck, in a manner that would have caused the son hurt, as the Mother had alleged. In my judgment, this incident on 29 July 2024 was a dispute over whether the Father was entitled to see the son pursuant to the access order. Simmering tempers had boiled over and erupted into a full-blown argument, with both sides shouting at each other and tussling over the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 11 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In this incident, the Mother alleges that the Father had made a phone call to her parent’s house, knowing that the son was there. The Father had scolded the son and asked why he did not want to stay overnight with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The son had told the Father that he was afraid of being beaten by him if he stayed overnight. The Mother intervened when she saw the son crying and shivering in fear. She told the Father that the son did not want to stay overnight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Father was incensed. He began to hurl vulgarities at the Mother over the phone. The Mother hung up. At this point, the son had gone to close the house door, fearing that the Father would turn up to cause trouble.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Mother says that the Father had, through his actions, placed the son in fear of hurt. She also alleges that his actions constitute continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Father’s account is markedly different. He says that the son was not speaking properly to him when he called. He asked the son to ask the Mother why he could not come and see him on his birthday. The son kept quiet for a while, and then began to cry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     That was when the Mother picked up the phone. The first thing she asked was: “why did you make my son cry?”. The Father was puzzled. He said he did not know. He also confronted the Mother for interrupting the conversation he was having with the son. The both of them started arguing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I do not find that the Mother had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Father had committed family violence in this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother’s evidence of what the Father had said to the son, and the manner in which he had spoken to the son was based on what she claims the son had told her. The Mother testified that she had asked the son what the Father had said to him, and the son had shared that the Father was forcing him to stay with him overnight, and was scolding him harshly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The basic point is that the Mother did not actually hear what the Father had said to the son. She had only seen the son crying, before she stepped in to intervene. She did not actually hear what the Father had said to the son, nor did she hear how the Father had spoken to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Even if I were inclined to accept the Mother’s account, that this was how the Father had spoken to the son and that he had tried to force the son to stay overnight with him, this would not, in my judgment, constitute family violence as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961. One might say that the Father should have, and could have, handled his disappointment at his son’s refusal to stay overnight with him a little better. But the mere act of scolding the son for refusing to stay overnight, and trying to force him to do so, does not, in my judgment, fall within the definition of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 24 October 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The next incident complained of happened on 24 October 2023 – this happened a day before the son’s birthday. The Mother claims that the Father had called the son and shouted at him. The Mother also claims that the Father had told the son that he was going to kill her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I do not find that the Mother had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that the Father had actually told the son that he was going to kill her, or that the Father had indeed shouted at the son. Again, the Mother did not actually hear what the Father had said to the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident on 6 November 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I deal next, with the incident on 6 November 2023. The Mother’s complaint is that the Father had gotten angry when she rejected his requests for access to the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> She says that she had rejected his request for access because the son was uncomfortable being with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Father had not committed any family violence on the son in this incident. The crux of the Mother’s complaint was that the Father had gotten very angry when his request for access was denied. There is nothing, even on the face of the Mother’s complaint, to suggest that the Father had done anything to the son on the 6th of November 2023. In any event, it is evident, from both the Father’s and the Mother’s account, that the Father did not speak to the son on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Father was likely to commit family violence on the son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Having dealt with the specific incidents complained of, I move now to consider whether it is likely that the Father would commit family violence on the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I do not find that the Father is likely to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     While the Mother had sought to characterise the Father as a violent individual, the evidence put before me had not gone so far as to establish that any propensity for violence that the Father may have had would make it likely that he would commit family violence on the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Further, while it was alleged that the Father was physically abusive towards the son (for example, the Mother alleged that the Father would hit the son with a belt), there was no evidence put before me to corroborate this (<em>ie</em>, medical reports showing that the son had been physically abused).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Finally, both the Mother and X had given evidence about the Father’s drinking habits. Specifically, the Mother had given evidence that the Father would get drunk, and when he did, he would lose all sense and control and become violent. Even accepting that the Father does have a drinking problem, and would turn violent when he becomes drunk, there was no evidence before me to suggest that this posed a demonstrable risk to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On the contrary, the video which the Father had put in evidence, in my judgment spoke to the affection he had for his son. While I am conscious of the possibility that the son may have been encouraged to act as though he was happy in front of the camera, I do not find that to be the case. The son’s demeanour in the video does show that both the Father and the son were genuinely happy in each other’s company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether it was necessary to order a PPO </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In considering the necessity of ordering a PPO, it is well established that the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment as to the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence on the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In the present case, I did not consider it necessary to order a PPO. For one, the present arrangement was that the son would live with the Mother and her family, and the Father would have access. The Father is allotted a period of time every week to see the son. If there were any signs of family violence on his part, that would be easily picked up when the son is returned to the Mother upon the end of the Father’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Further, I do not find any hint of animosity or ill will directed by the Father towards the son. As I have mentioned, it was apparent to me from the video the Father had produced, that he does, indeed, love his son. One other piece of evidence pointing to this conclusion was the Father’s recollection of happy moments he had spent with his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I thus dismissed the Mother’s application in SS 1477. I would add that if one takes a step back and considers the evidence in totality, the real dispute at hand was over access arrangements to the son. It was clear to me that there was considerable frustration on both the Father’s and Mother’s part as to the practical aspects of the access arrangements as reflected in the court order. That had led to repeated arguments between them. The son had, unfortunately, been caught in the middle, and that thus gave rise to the basis for the Mother’s complaint.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I will conclude with some brief remarks to the Mother and the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     You are both an important part of your son’s life. While you may have chosen to each go your own separate ways after the divorce, your son is inextricably bound to the both of you by ties of kinship. That means you have but one choice: you must work together to give your son the best possible start in life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The law makes it abundantly clear that parenting is a joint obligation. I would strongly encourage the both of you to take this opportunity to start on a clean slate – set aside your differences, and see how you can both work together for the sake of your son.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 2 at p 18, lns 22 – 23.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at pp 9 – 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 1 at pp 12 – 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript, Day 2 at pp 31 – 32.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript Day 1 at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript Day 1 at pp 34 – 35.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Equity – Defences – Acquiescence","Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-05-27","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1306, 1308 and 1462 of 2024","title":"XMS v XMR and other matters","citation":"[2025] SGFC 56","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33324-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Husband in person and unrepresented","Abdul Rahman Bin Mohd Hanipah (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) and Patrick Fernandez (Fernandez LLC) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-06-02T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XMS v XMR and other matters</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XMS <em>v</em> XMR and other matters </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33324-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 56</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1306, 1308 and 1462 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">27 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Husband in person and unrepresented; Abdul Rahman Bin Mohd Hanipah (Abdul Rahman Law Corporation) and Patrick Fernandez (Fernandez LLC) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XMS — XMR </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Equity</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Defences</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Acquiescence</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">27 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties to these applications are Husband and Wife. They have three young children aged 14, 12 and 5. These were their respective applications that came before me:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 1306/2024 (“SS 1306”). This was the Wife’s application. She sought a PPO for herself. The Husband is the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 1462/2024 (“SS 1462”). This was the Wife’s application. She sought a PPO for the three children. The Husband is the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     SS 1308/2024 (“SS 1308”). This was the Husband’s application. He sought a PPO for himself as well as the three children. The Wife is the respondent. In addition, the Husband also seeks a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”), to exclude the Wife from the matrimonial property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of all three matters. The Husband was self-represented. The Wife was initially represented by Mr Abdul Rahman, and subsequently, by Mr Patrick Fernandez (“Mr Fernandez”) who took over conduct of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After the trial, I reserved judgment and directed parties to file written submissions. I delivered judgment on 29 April 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       These are the applicable legal principles relating to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       To succeed in an application for a PPO, the applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, two things (see <em>XEN v XEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32386-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 94</a> at [5] – [9]). First, that the respondent had committed an act of family violence (as is defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> or that the respondent was likely to commit family violence. Second, that it was necessary for the court to order the PPO. In assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There was, however, one other point which I had to consider. Both the Husband’s application in SS 1308, and the Mother’s application in SS 1306 were also premised on incidents that took place a decade ago. In light of this, I called for written submissions on whether acquiescence could be invoked in the context of an application under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Mr Fernandez argued, in relation to the Wife’s application, that acquiescence does not apply to a PPO application based on continual harassment. That is because, to establish continual harassment, the applicant must show that the acts complained of are sufficiently repetitive in nature. Application of acquiescence would therefore “prejudice every PPO application based on continual harassment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> In this connection, Mr Fernandez argued that applying the law on acquiescence would also limit the court’s ability to determine whether “family violence is likely to be committed”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Mr Fernandez, however, argued that acquiescence should apply to the Husband’s application, given his allegations that the Wife had caused him hurt, or placed him in fear of hurt. In this connection, Mr Fernandez argues that the Husband’s inaction to “file a PPO application for an incident that occurred between 2023 and 2025 constituted a waiver or an abandonment of rights”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I take, as my starting point, the concept of acquiescence as has been sketched out in our local jurisprudence. This was a point recently canvassed by the Appellate Division of the High Court in <em>Salaya Kalairani v Appangam Govindhasamy</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30736-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 40</a>, and a useful summary may be found in that judgment at [49] – [56].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In particular, the court noted (at [55]) that cases such as <em>Tan Yong San v Neo Kok Eng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0030.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 30</a>, <em>Genelabs Diagnostics Pte Ltd v Institut Pasteur</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0530.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 530</a>, and <em>Ho Yew Kong v Sakae Holdings Ltd and other appeals and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22066-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 333</a> appeared to illustrate that acquiescence could be used as a defence against statutory claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The court also noted (at [56]) that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">56    In this context we note that the term acquiescence has been used in varying contexts by many courts and for that reason has been described as possessing “a chameleon-like quality” (see <em>Orr v Ford</em> [1989] 84 ALR 146 at 157) or a “mongrel concept that is drawn from other doctrines, but does not have a distinct breed of its own” (see Lusina Ho, “The Importance of Being Earnest: The Doctrines of Laches and Acquiescence” in <em>Defences in Equity</em> (Paul S Davies, Simon Douglas and James Goudkamp eds (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2018) at p 326). For the purposes of these grounds of decision, we define acquiescence as the Court of Appeal defined it in <em>Sakae Holdings</em>, as circumstances founding an estoppel, a waiver or an abandonment of rights. In <em>Sakae Holdings</em>, the Court of Appeal held at [188] that “<b><u>[t]he essence of acquiescence is that a plaintiff who knows about the conduct which it complains of and yet does nothing to object to or prevent such conduct may be taken to have made a representation to the defendant that it does not object to that conduct, which representation may found an estoppel, a waiver or an abandonment of rights</u></b>” [emphasis added]. Therefore, in considering whether acquiescence was made out on the facts, we considered the key question to be whether the plaintiffs had made a representation which may found an estoppel, a waiver or an abandonment of rights.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Adopting the definition of acquiescence as set out by the Court of Appeal (“CA”) in <em>Sakae Holdings</em> and affirmed by the Appellate Division of the High Court in <em>Salaya</em>, it appears, at first blush, that acquiescence could be invoked in the context of applications for PPOs. Simply put: if an applicant is aware of incidents of family violence, but takes no steps to file an application for a PPO until several years have passed, this conduct could be taken as representing that the applicant has no objection to such conduct, and this representation may found either an estoppel, a waiver or abandonment of rights (to borrow the words used by the CA in <em>Sakae Holdings</em>). For example, such a representation could amount to a waiver in that the applicant had “voluntary[ily] or intentional[ly] relinquish[ed] a known right,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> claim or privilege”: <em>Salaya</em> at [58] citing <em>Audi Construction Pte Ltd v Kian Hiap Construction Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21409-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 317</a> at [54].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     However, that a representation had been made by the applicant in choosing not to file an application for a PPO is only half of the equation. As was noted in <em>Salaya</em> at [65], there must also be reliance by the defendant. In the familial context of PPO applications, one might argue that such reliance could manifest in the form of the defendant taking active steps to correct their behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     That being said, I do not find that acquiescence is applicable in the context of PPO applications under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     It must be remembered that family violence typically occurs in the context of our most intimate and personal relationships. There are reasons why one might be hesitant to file an application for a PPO – to quote the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Sun Xueling (Second Reading of the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and other Matters) (Amendment) Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 February 2023) vol 95):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The third cause as to why family violence is complex is because it often happens behind closed doors which makes it harder to detect. <b><u>Survivors may hesitate to seek help due to shame, stigma, fear of breaking up their family and the perception that family violence is a personal matter. Similarly, individuals who observe family violence may remain as passive bystanders because they also consider it a private family matter.</u></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In this vein, I would add that the architecture of the family violence provisions impliedly excludes the application of acquiescence (see also the reasoning of the court in <em>Teh Siew Hua v Tan Kim Chiong</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2010] 4 SLR 0123.xml')\">[2010] 4 SLR 123</a> at [46]).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> For one, there is no time bar as to when an application under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961 may be brought. This is consistent with the various speeches made in Parliament over the years which demonstrate a clear parliamentary intent to encourage victims of family violence to avail themselves of the PPO regime.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Second, the sort of conduct that is dealt with by acquiescence is already captured by the requirement of necessity. For example, the court will consider whether the act of family violence is a recent occurrence: <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [46(b)(ii)]. In particular, the courts have declined to issue a PPO where “a significant amount of time had passed (since the family violence) by the time of the hearing”: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20(b)] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [38] (more than two years had lapsed); <em>GFS v GFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29939-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 21</a> (“GFS”) at [113] (between one to 17 years had lapsed); <em>VFM v VFN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26547-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 91</a> (“VFM”) (more than two years had lapsed) at [79].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     For these reasons, I do not find that the equitable defence of acquiescence may be invoked in the context of applications for a PPO under Part 7 of the Women’s Charter 1961. To do so would be to go against the very spirit of those provisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 1306 should be allowed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I turn now to first deal with the Wife’s application in SS 1306. The essence of her application is based on the fourth definition of family violence found in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961. Her case is that the Husband had, by his actions, committed continual harassment “with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish” to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To establish that there was “continual harassment”, the following three requirements must be established (<em>XFL</em> at [37]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    The respondent has carried out the continual harassment with the intention or the knowledge that it is likely to cause “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness – to the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Wife had indeed established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Husband’s conduct over the years, amounted to continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     First, there is the incident in 2015 in which the Wife says the Husband had not only harassed her by saying that he wanted to marry another woman, but that he had also pushed her when she was pregnant, causing her to fall, and subsequently, miscarry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband does not deny having done so. His explanation, rather, is that he cannot be responsible for this because of black magic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I do not accept his explanation. As was noted by the court in <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [103], although “[a]llegations of black magic have from time to time been raised in criminal cases…the Courts have not recognised black magic as a defence”. I would also add that insofar as the Husband also says that he is not responsible for what had happened in 2015 because he was “sick and mentally unstable”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> he had not adduced any evidence to prove this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In this connection, I would add that the fact that the Husband had pushed the Wife, and caused her to fall (which, as I noted above, he does not deny), would fall within the definition of family violence. By doing so, the Husband had caused hurt to the Wife “by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Second, the Wife also alleges that the Husband would not only insult her, but also use religious teachings to “gaslight” her into thinking that she was “wrong in the eyes of the [r]eligion”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I find that the text messages which the Husband had sent to the Wife did constitute continual harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     There was a screenshot of a text message from the Husband. The messages show the Husband comparing the Wife to another woman, whom he described as being much “[more] responsible [and] lovely”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Husband also went on to verbally insult the Wife in the subsequent messages, calling her “selfish”, “irresponsible”, “stupid”, and “stubborn”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In another series of text messages,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> the Husband had sent some religious teachings to the Wife. To be absolutely clear, I express no view as to the correctness of those religious teachings. What is apparent to me, however, is the Wife’s response: she expressed her frustration with the Husband and made it clear that his conduct was causing her stress, and that if he continued to cause her stress, she would have to speak with her lawyer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Then there is also what the Husband had set out in his own affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> He does admit to sending the Wife religious teachings, but with the intention of “being grateful on all that we have achieved” and that the Wife had misconstrued his actions as “harassment”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     That being said, as I have noted above (at [28]), the Wife did express her frustration with the Husband sending her religious teachings during a time where she was clearly under immense stress and pressure, and especially when their marital relations were under strain. It is thus apparent, to me, that the Husband must have known that continuing to send her such messages, in these circumstances, would cause her no small amount of unhappiness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I thus find that the Husband’s actions did amount to continual harassment. I also find it likely that the Husband will commit family violence on the Wife in that he will likely continue to harass her. For one, it is clear to me that while both the Husband and the Wife share the same religion, their perspectives are rather different. But it is not this difference that is in issue – rather, it is how the Husband manages and responds to the Wife’s different perspective of their shared religion. For instance, according to the Husband, he can still find no basis, in the religious teachings, for his Wife initiating divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Then there are also several audio recordings. The transcripts of these recordings detail arguments between the Husband and Wife. Those transcripts are telling. They are filled with much bitterness and vitriol. They demonstrate that the Husband lacks a healthy way of expressing the difference in religious viewpoints and is unable to bring himself to find common ground with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As to the necessity of ordering the PPO, I find that it is indeed necessary to do so in the present case. It appears to me that parties are going through an acrimonious divorce, and as I had observed above, one risk factor in the present case is how the Husband manages and responds to the Wife’s different perspective on their shared religion which in turn, affects how he deals with any conflict that arises between the both of them. It is also apparent to me, and I accept the Wife’s evidence in this regard, that the Husband is not only upset by the pending divorce proceedings, but has acted in a way that affects her negatively.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Further, both the Husband and the Wife are still staying together.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> That they both still continue to share a common space makes it likely that they will continue to interact, and this, in my judgment, increases the risk of further incidents of family violence occurring.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the circumstances, I allow the Wife’s application in SS 1306. In addition, I am also ordering that they both go for counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Wife’s application in SS 1462 should be allowed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I turn now to consider the Wife’s application in SS 1462. She seeks a PPO on behalf of the three children against the Husband. She points to several audio and video recordings which she says demonstrates that the Husband had indeed committed family violence against the children, or that he was indeed likely to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In assessing whether the Husband had committed family violence on the children, or was likely to do so, one point I had to consider was whether the “correction exception” applied. That is because the definition of family violence excludes “any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age”. As I had noted in <em>XBC v XBD</em> at [14], the correction exception reflects parliamentary intent to afford parents “a wide degree of discretion when it comes to disciplining their children”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In assessing whether the acts complained of did fall within the correction exception, the court will consider: <b>a)</b> the reasons for the punishment, <b>b)</b> the nature of the punishment and <b>c)</b> the age and personal characteristics of the child: <em>VYB v VYA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26823-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 121</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Of all the video and audio recordings submitted by the Wife, two videos stand out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In the first video, the Husband can be heard shouting angrily at the eldest son. The video also shows a blue, square shaped object, being flung across the ground at the eldest son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The second video shows the Husband aggressively manhandling the eldest son by grabbing his robes and lifting him off the ground in a rough manner.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The Husband can be seen raising his voice at and berating the eldest son. The video also shows the Husband taking the prayer mat and hurling it at the eldest son twice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife explained that the Husband was angry with the eldest son for not being properly attired when conducting his prayers. She explained that this was not a one-off occurrence, and that the Husband would scold the children when they did not perform their prayers properly.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The Wife also said that she had tried to tell the Husband repeatedly to not discipline the children in this manner, but he had refused to listen to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     In his written submissions, the Husband attempts to downplay the manner in which he had disciplined his eldest son. He says that he had merely lifted the eldest son and put him down.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I find that the Husband was indeed likely to commit family violence on the children in such a manner that disentitles him from relying on the correction exception. While the Husband is well within his rights to inculcate religious values in the children, and to correct them when they have veered off course, I find that the manner in which he has chosen to discipline them has gone beyond the pale. In particular, the second video shows the Husband aggressively manhandling the eldest son. I also accept the Wife’s evidence, that the two videos that I have described (above at [39] – [40]), are symptomatic of the discipline which the Husband metes out to the children when they do not perform their prayers properly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I also find it necessary to order the PPO for the three children. It is apparent to me that the Husband has little insight into his own parenting methods, and sees no issues with how he chooses to discipline them. Absent such insight, I consider it likely that the Husband would continue to discipline his children in such a manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     For the reasons I have set out above, the Wife’s application in SS 1462 is allowed. I must emphasise that, in allowing the Wife’s application, I am not making a finding that the Husband is a bad father who does not want the best for the children. What I have found is that the Husband’s methods of disciplining the children, when considered in context of the child’s alleged misbehaviour, crosses the line laid down by the law. I have also found that because the Husband is likely to continue with such methods of disciplining the children, it is necessary to order the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this connection, I am also ordering that the Husband go for counselling so as to equip him with better methods of disciplining the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband’s application in SS 1308 should be allowed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband seeks a PPO for himself and the three children against the Wife. He also seeks a DEO to exclude the Wife from the entirety of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I shall deal first with the Husband’s application for a PPO for himself. I find that the Wife had indeed committed family violence against the Husband, in particular, that she had caused hurt to him “by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt” (to borrow the language of limb b of the definition of family violence set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961). I also find it likely that the Wife will commit family violence on the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     First, the Wife admitted, in her affidavit and testimony in court,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> to slapping the Husband on the face. She says that she was frustrated with the Husband because he had gone to someone’s fiancé and asked for her hand in marriage. In my judgment, the Wife’s act of slapping the Husband was an act of family violence in that she ought to have known, minimally, that slapping him would have caused him hurt (<em>ie</em>, bodily pain)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Second, there was also the incident on 2 July 2024. The Husband had complained of this incident. He alleges that in this incident, the Wife had hit him 3 – 4 times on the head with her phone. He also alleges that the Wife had spit on him 3 – 4 times.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     It was disputed as to whether the Wife had used her hands to hit the Husband, or whether she had hit him on the head with her phone. Mr Fernandez had cross-examined the Husband strenuously on this point.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> It was also hotly disputed whether the Husband had done an X-ray scan to check for any head injuries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I find that the Wife had indeed caused hurt to the Husband in this incident on 2 July 2024. For one, in her affidavit, the Wife did admit to hitting the Husband and spitting at him. She states:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The Husband] stopped me from leaving the house by standing in front of the door preventing me from leaving the house. This angered me further which caused me to spit at him and hit him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife also confirmed, under cross-examination, that she had indeed hit the Husband and spit at him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> She also admitted that she had hurt the Husband in this incident, but explained that she had done so because she wanted to leave the house.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In any event, I also find it likely that the Wife will commit family violence on the Husband. It is clear to me that she has built up a deep resentment and anger towards the Husband for how he has treated her over the past 15 years of their marriage. For instance, this was what she had said when the Husband had cross-examined her:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"19.3%\"><col width=\"80.7%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">I have to remind you that this is affirmed on the 6th September, that you make this statement.

She does not deny slapping and hitting him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     As to the necessity of ordering a PPO, I find that it is indeed necessary to do so. The risk factors which I have pointed out above (at [33] – [34]) are equally applicable to the Husband’s case. It was clear to me that their marriage was not a happy one, and this was only exacerbated by the fact that the both of them were unable to communicate their needs and settle their differences in a healthy and productive manner. Given their pending divorce, and the fact that they are still both living together under one roof, this would only create further opportunities for friction and further incidents of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I turn now to consider whether a PPO should be granted in favour of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Mr Fernandez argued, in written submissions, that the Wife did not, and was not likely to commit family violence on the children. The first prong of the argument is that the Wife was entitled to rely on the correction exception – that her use of force was justified given that she was disciplining the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> The second prong of the argument is that the Husband never witnessed the past incidents of family violence that he alleges the Wife had committed on the children, and that the injuries he claims they sustained were from the rough and tumble of children playing, and not from any abuse on the Wife’s part.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Having examined the evidence, I find that the Wife was indeed likely to commit family violence on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the incident on 2 July 2024, the Wife discovered that the daughter had fallen victim to a scam. The Wife discovered this when she checked her phone bill and found that she had been billed about $500. After questioning the daughter, she discovered that the daughter had shared the one-time password with an unknown person. She also discovered that the daughter had been hiding this from her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Wife, in her testimony, admitted to slapping the daughter and hitting her on the thigh area with a hanger.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> It was, however, clear to me that the Wife had done so, not with the intention of disciplining the daughter, but out of sheer anger and frustration.

This left a dent in the wall. The Wife admits having thrown the stool at the wall.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It was clear to me, from this incident, that the Wife was under strain from having to pay the bills. That the daughter had been the victim of a scam only added to her financial burden. While one can understand the pressures that the Wife must have been facing, this does not, and cannot, condone her actions. It is clear from her own testimony that she had vented her frustration on the daughter by hitting her with the hanger and slapping her. Apart from that, the Wife’s action of hurling the stool at the living room wall, not only spoke to her inability to deal with her frustration, but also demonstrated her disregard for how her actions might frighten her children who had to bear witness to her outward displays of anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In addition to this, there is also evidence that the Child Protective Services (“CPS”) had become involved in the wake of the incident that had taken place on 2 July 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> That CPS had become involved, in my judgment, also demonstrated that it was indeed likely that the Wife would commit family violence on the children. The report exhibited in the Wife’s affidavit showed that CPS was concerned with how the Wife had behaved towards the daughter in the incident on 2 July 2024. CPS was also concerned that the children would be triangulated in the conflict between the Husband and Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I also find it necessary to order the PPO for the three children. As I have explained, the Wife’s actions were driven by her inability to regulate her emotions and to deal with the stresses she faced. Given the ongoing divorce proceedings, it is likely that the Wife will continue to encounter such pressures in her life. Coupled with her lack of a coping mechanism and proper tools to manage her emotions, it is likely that she may overreact when the children misbehave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To be clear, my finding that the Wife is likely to commit family violence on the children should not, and must not, be taken as an indictment of her as a mother. Simply put, my finding is that the Wife does not have a healthy way of dealing with her own emotions and challenges that she may encounter, and that this was likely to result in her venting her frustration on the children. It may be the case that (and one certainly hopes for such an outcome) both the Husband and the Wife learn how to better manage their emotions and how to interact with their children in a healthy manner. When this day comes, and there is evidence to support such change on the part of the Husband and the Wife, there may certainly be grounds for the PPO to be revoked. Until then, however, a PPO is indeed necessary to ensure that the children are safe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In this vein, I would also order the Husband, the Wife, as well the eldest son and the daughter to go for counselling. Such an order is necessary to ensure that they have the necessary resources to deal with their emotions and the stresses they may face, especially when navigating the ongoing divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Finally, I deal with the Husband’s application for a DEO. Based on the evidence before me, I do not find it necessary to order a DEO to exclude the Wife entirely from the matrimonial home. I do not find the Wife to have such a violent temperament such that she needs to be excluded from the matrimonial home to ensure the safety of the Husband as well as the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In summary, the Wife’s applications in SS 1306 and 1462 are allowed in its entirety. The Husband’s application in SS 1308 for a PPO for himself and the three children are also allowed, but his application for a DEO is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I shall hear parties on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Finally, I conclude with some brief remarks to both the Husband and Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Stop fighting. You have come to court, and I have made a decision on your applications. Take this opportunity to start afresh. Move on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Spare a thought for your children. Your continued conflict at home will only serve to negatively affect them. They are bright children with much potential: I have seen, exhibited in your affidavits, a picture of them receiving Edusave awards. You owe it, to all three of them, to help them realise their potential, and to give them the best possible start in life. You can do so by setting aside your differences and learning to work together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Take the counselling seriously. Attend all the scheduled sessions and learn what you can from the counsellor.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Unless otherwise stated, references to provisions of the Women’s Charter are references to the relevant provisions in force prior to 2 January 2025.

The PPO has been sought to protect the following persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     His son (born in October 2016), and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_c\"></a>(c)     His daughter (born in January 2018).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To succeed in his PPO application, the Husband must satisfy two requirements on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, he must prove that the Wife had committed or is likely to commit <em>“family violence” –</em> defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter (“<b>Charter</b>”) – against the children and himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband must also prove that a PPO is <em>necessary</em> to protect the children and himself from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Husband had relied on five incidents to support his PPO application. After a trial, I allowed his application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">27 July 2023 – Caning and hitting the son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the first incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       According to the Husband, the Wife had inflicted both “physical and emotional harm on the [son] on 27 July 2023” in the following manner.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, she had “verbally abused”, hit, and caned the son because of his poor spelling results. The Husband was not at home at the material time. However, he was able to tender a video recording (obtained from a CCTV camera installed at the home) to prove his claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, during the caning, the Wife had injured the son’s left eye and caused it to be bruised and swollen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Wife’s case is as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, she was not at home on 27 July 2023 from 9.00 am to 4.00 pm. At the material time, she was attending a lecture for her nursing course. She adduced an “attendance” table from the course website to support this claim.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That said, the Wife did not deny that she was the person shown in the video recording. She explained that (i) she was disciplining the son at the material time, (ii) she had used only 10% to 15% of her strength during the caning,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and (iii) her actions did not constitute family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Wife vehemently denied having injured the son’s eye. She adduced a medical report (dated 30 July 2023) which stated that it was the daughter who had accidentally poked the son’s eye with a plastic stick while playing with him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given the positions taken by the parties, the issues regarding the 27 July incident are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Did the incident shown in the video recording take place on 27 July 2023?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Did the Wife’s actions towards the son – as shown in the recording – come within the correction exception of “family violence” (“<b>correction exception</b>”)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Did the Wife injure the son’s eye?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident had occurred on 27 July 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Regarding first issue, I find that the incident shown in the video recording did take place on 27 July 2023. These are my reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife had admitted that she is the person shown in the recording. The <em>timestamp</em> in the recording shows the date and time as 27 July 2023 and 3.50 pm respectively. The timestamp contradicts the Wife’s case that she was attending a lecture – and not at home – at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife claimed that the Husband had tampered with the recording. I am unable to accept this claim. The recording was made about <em>10 months before</em> the Husband decided to apply for the PPO against the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> There is simply no reason why he would want to tamper with the timestamp at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Second</em>, one day after the incident (i.e., on 28 July 2023), the Husband had sent a WhatsApp message to the Wife. In that message, he had told her that it was “not right” for her to “continuously hit” the son “<em>yesterday</em>”. In her replies via WhatsApp, the Wife did not deny having hit the child on 27 July 2023. She instead defended her actions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife had committed family violence – Correction exception inapplicable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       This brings me to the second (and more important) issue. The Wife’s acts of hitting and caning the son would <em>technically</em> qualify as family violence. Does such conduct come within the correction exception?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On this issue, s 64 of the Charter provides that family violence “does not include any force lawfully used … by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age”. In <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> (“<b><em>XKJ</em></b>”) at [32], I had explained that to successfully invoke the correction exception, a respondent must prove two things.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the respondent must prove that the use of force was <em>intended to benefit the child</em> – i.e., to inculcate in the child the appropriate behaviour and attitude (i) in his/her conduct as a person and (ii) in his/her relationship with others.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the respondent must also prove that the use of force is <em>neither excessive nor unreasonable</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Has the Wife satisfied the <em>first requirement</em>? In my view, the answer is <em>yes</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a preliminary point, I note that the Wife had given conflicting reasons for caning the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>One day after</em> the incident (i.e., on 28 July 2023), the Wife sent the following WhatsApp messages to the Husband to explain why she had used force on the son:<u><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></u></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"> <u>Message sent at 10.57 am</u> – “I hit him Cauz he said that study is boring and crying to do (sic) homework”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"> <u>Message sent at 11.02 am</u> – “... I hit him for his direspect (sic) behaviour and everyday crying to do (sic) homework”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>It appears from the above that the Wife had used force on the son for two reasons. <em>First</em>, for his poor attitude towards his studies. <em>Second</em>, for showing “disrespectful behaviour”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       During the trial (i.e., about <em>17 months after</em> the incident), the Wife gave different reasons for having used force on the son on 23 July 2023. Initially, she testified that it was because he had <em>lied to her</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Upon further examination, the Wife testified that it was because the son had <em>copied during spelling</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I find that each of the Wife’s reasons given on 28 July 2023 and during the trial can provide a basis for punishing the son. Specifically, I am prepared to accept her evidence (i) that the son had been showing a poor attitude towards his studies, (ii) that he done badly in a recent spelling assignment, (iii) that he had copied during spelling, and (iv) that he thus needed to be disciplined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Next, has the Wife satisfied the <em>second requirement</em> to the correction exception? In my view, the answer is <em>no</em>. This is because while she had begun the punishment with an intention to correct the son’s attitude and behaviour, the video recording clearly shows that the execution of her punishment was later fuelled by <em>anger</em>. It is settled law that the use of force on a child in such circumstances falls outside of the correction exception: see <em>XKJ</em> at [32(d)]. Evidence that the Wife had punished the son out of anger include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, at the beginning of the punishment, the Wife had screamed repeatedly, and her demeanour was filled with rage. The son can be seen to be genuinely fearful of her at the material time. Indeed, during the hearing, I observed that the Wife was herself visibly distressed when reviewing the video recording of the punishment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife continued to cane the son even though the latter had apologised for his misbehaviour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, there was a lull period in the punishment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> At about 4.18 pm, the Wife suddenly broke the lull by beginning to cane the son again <em>for no apparent reason</em>. Apart from venting the Wife’s simmering frustration, the caning does not appear to serve any other function.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No evidence that the Wife had injured the son’s eye</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The remaining issue is whether the Wife had injured the son’s eye while caning him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Regarding this issue, I note the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is <em>no</em> evidence – either from the video recording<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> or testimony from the son – to prove that the Wife had caused the injury.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there are two <em>medical reports</em> which contradict the Husband’s claim that the Wife had injured the son’s eye. The first report is based on a consultation about three days after 27 July 2023. (This report is adduced by the Wife.) The second report is based on a consultation about one week prior to 5 August 2023. (This report is tendered by the Husband.)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Both medical reports suggested that the son’s eye injury was caused “accidentally” by a plastic stick.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Despite the above, the Husband submitted that the Wife had injured the son’s eye. The sole basis for this submission is that she had failed to deny such an assertion that is implicit in the following message that he had sent to her one day after the caning incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[The son] don’t (<em>sic</em>) deserved to get hit that back (<em>sic</em>) like yest, <em>till hurt his eyes</em> and etc.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis and text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I am unable to accept the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I find that the accusation in the message – that the Wife had injured the son’s eye – is indirect and equivocal. Such an accusation could easily have been missed by her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Indeed, the Wife explained that she did not agree or deny the message because she was more focused at the material time on highlighting to the Husband that he had failed to take any responsibility to guide and discipline the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, during cross-examination, the Husband had acknowledged that the Wife did not admit to having injured the son’s eye in her replies to the implicit accusation in the message.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">2 April 2024 – Threat to kill the children – Repeated messages to the Husband</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I now move on to the next incident. It had occurred on 2 April 2024. The following facts regarding that incident are not disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband had suspected that the Wife was having an affair with X. To gather evidence of this, he had installed a voice recorder at the home without her knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 2 April 2024, via phone call over WhatsApp, the Wife had an argument with the Husband regarding the voice recorder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     At or around 7.01 pm that day, the Wife sent a message to the Husband stating, “im going to kill myself with my kids” (“<b>Threat over WhatsApp</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Shortly after receiving the message, the Husband reached home. The Wife held a knife and threatened to cut herself (“<b>Threat at Home</b>”). She wanted the Husband to disclose his evidence of the alleged affair. After a tense moment, the situation was defused. The Husband had a voice recording of the Threat at Home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The parties disagreed about the circumstances of the Threat over WhatsApp and the Threat at Home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Husband –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Wife had made both threats to compel him to produce his evidence of the alleged affair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Threat at Home was made in the presence of the children and had caused them to be alarmed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     According to the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       She had made the Threat over WhatsApp under the <em>pressure of the Husband’s accusations</em> of her having an affair. Specifically, he had kept “pushing and bullying her” to admit to the affair. During a WhatsApp phone call that day, he had even asked her to “go and die”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       As for the Threat at Home, the Wife agreed that her intention was to compel the Husband to produce the recording. When making this threat, the children were <em>not</em> present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       It is the Wife’s case that a threat to commit suicide did not constitute “family violence”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> This is because she did not cause hurt to the Husband and the children at the material time. She did not wilfully or knowingly place them in fear of hurt. In any event, she did not intend to carry out the threats. If the Husband had played the recording, she would not have made the threats.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given the parties’ position, the factual issues for determination are

me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the records in [21(1)] to [21(9)] above show that the Wife had <em>initiated</em> multiple communication with the Husband in the 20 min period before sending the Threat over WhatsApp. If the Husband had been verbally abusive and harassing her, why did she initiate such communication?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the messages reveal that the Wife was in fact <em>angry</em> with the Husband at the material time:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       About one minute before sending the Threat over WhatsApp, she had called the Husband “idiot”: see [21(1)] above.

In response to this text, the Wife sent the Threat over WhatsApp. It bears highlighting that she then followed up with a message <em>explaining</em> that she had sent the threat <em>because of</em> his “stupidity”: [21(14)]. The Wife did not make any reference to the Husband’s alleged “pressure” as being the trigger for sending the threat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Wife made it very clear during the trial that she had sent the Threat over WhatsApp and the message at [21(18)] above <em>to get the Husband’s attention</em> – as he was not answering her calls at the material time. She had simply wanted him to play the recording and had no intention to carry out the threat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This shows that the Wife was in fact the one who was exerting pressure at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Children were present when the Threat at Home was made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I find that the children were present when the Wife made the Threat at Home. This is evident from the recording of the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> In that recording, the following could be heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The children were crying, shouting “Amma” and “Mama”, and pleading, “amma, no amma”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was desperately trying to de-escalate the situation and to get the children away from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Meaning of “family violence”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The next issue is whether the Wife’s threats constitute family violence. In this regard, s 64 of the Charter states –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt; [<b>Limb A</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt; [<b>Limb B</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will; [<b>Limb C</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member, [<b>Limb D</b>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence under Limb B and Limb C had not been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Limb B and Limb C are clearly not applicable in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In the case of Limb B, “hurt” has been defined under s 64 to mean “<em>bodily</em> pain, disease or infirmity. This definition would not cover the <em>emotional</em> trauma suffered the Husband and the children because of the threats.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for Limb C, there is no evidence that the Wife had wrongfully confined or restrained the Husband and children at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This leaves us with Limb A and Limb D to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence under Limb A had not been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I start with Limb A. I accept the Wife’s submission that the Threat over WhatsApp and the Threat at Home do <em>not</em> fall within Limb A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Threat over WhatsApp involves a threat to cause harm to the children. However, there is no evidence to show that the Wife had intended the message to be read by the children, or that she would have known that the message would be read by them. Accordingly, the Wife did not wilfully or knowingly place, or attempt to place, the children in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Next, the Threat at Home. This involves a threat of <em>self</em>-harm by the Wife. She did not directly or indirectly threaten to harm either the Husband or the children. As such, she similarly did not wilfully or knowingly place, or attempt to place, them in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Family violence under Limb D had been committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In my view, the Wife had committed family violence under Limb D.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, on 2 April 2024, she had sent <em>two</em> messages in which she threatened to commit self-harm and to kill the children: see [21(13)] and [21(18)]. After sending these messages, the Wife <em>repeated</em> her threat to commit self-harm – this time holding a knife in the presence of the Husband and children at home. Such actions had <em>traumatised</em> the Husband and children. In the audio recording of the Threat at Home, the children could be heard crying. The Husband could also be heard trying to calm the Wife down. She clearly knew that her threats had caused anguish to her family members. During the trial, the Wife admitted that it was wrong for her to have picked up a knife at the material time, and that the children ought to have been protected from such trauma.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, earlier in the afternoon of 2 April 2024 (i.e., from 2.26 pm to 7.00 pm), the Wife had also sent to the Husband <em>multiple messages</em> demanding that he must (i) settle “the phone contract” and (ii) meet her at a place and time specified by her for this purpose. The Wife had made these demands despite the Husband informing her that he was busy at work and that he could meet her only after work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> The Wife would have known that her barrage of messages, calls, and demands to the Husband while he was at work are likely to cause anguish to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">22 April 2024 – Hitting and caning the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I now turn to the next incident. It is not disputed that on 22 April 2024 at about 8.40 pm, the Wife had caned the children. A video recording from a CCTV camera at home of this incident was admitted into evidence. The Husband was not at home at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The issue regarding the 22 April incident centres on whether the Wife’s use of force on the children comes within the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Wife, a day before the incident, she had already warned the children against using violence towards each other and their domestic helper. Despite this warning, the son had hit the helper and the daughter on 22 April 2024. The daughter had also fought with the son that day. Accordingly, she had caned the children to discipline them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is the Husband’s case that the Wife hit the son because of the daughter’s complaint over a minor matter – the son’s refusal to share a toy with her. The Wife had caned the daughter when the son complained that the daughter had hit his buttocks. The Husband submitted that the Wife’s use of force on the children (i) was unnecessarily severe given that the children merely had a “minor sibling conflict”, (ii) was motivated by “frustration and anger”, and (iii) was inflicted without concern for the children’s welfare and had traumatised them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Having reviewed the video recording, I find that the Wife had failed to prove that the correction exception applies to the 22 April incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reason for the use of force</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I am unable to accept the Wife’s claim that she had used force on the children because they had been physically violent towards each other and to the helper (in the case of the son).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32      <em>First</em>, such a claim is not supported by the video recording of the incident. The recording reveals the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Before the violence started, the children and the helper were in the living room, while the Wife was in the bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For more than a minute <em>before</em> the Wife started to use force on the children, the latter were apparently doing their own things in the living room. The son did not hit the helper and the daughter. Neither did the daughter fight with the son. There was also no verbal altercation between the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife started to use force only after the daughter had gone into the bedroom – apparently to complain to her about the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the complaint, the Wife went to the living room and began hitting the son. During this period, the son said something to her. The word “pigu” (meaning buttocks in Chinese) could be heard. The Wife then turned her attention to the daughter and began caning her repeatedly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <em>Second</em>, during the trial, the Wife could not recall what was the nature of the daughter’s complaint about the son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <em>Third</em>, given that the Wife did not see what the son was doing in the living room at the material time (because she was in the bedroom), there is no basis for her to claim that he had hit the domestic helper and the daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In my view, the misbehaviour by the children, if any, is relatively minor. The Wife had failed to show why it is necessary to use force to punish them for such misbehaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Manner the force was used</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Additionally, I find that the Wife’s use of force at the material time had been excessive and unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Despite the relatively minor misbehaviour, the Wife had severely punished the children for about 5 mins.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     There are several instances when the use of force is <em>clearly gratuitous</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Wife had caned the daughter repeatedly even after the latter (1) had apologised for what she had done, and (2) was screaming and crying in pain from the caning.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       While the Wife’s initial motivation for the use of force might have been to punish the children for misbehaving, she subsequently used the cane to stop them from screaming out in pain from the caning.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> Clearly, a more effective way to stop the screaming is to simply stop the caning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Despite the daughter having complied with the instructions to stop screaming, the Wife continued to cane the child. This caused the daughter to further scream in pain.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> Caning in such circumstances is clearly unnecessary. The Wife’s actions suggest that she was seeking to assert power and control – rather than discipline – over the children through the infliction of pain: <em>XKJ</em> at [32(d)(iv)].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">2 May 2024 – Kicking the Husband’s leg</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I come to the next incident. This took place on 2 May 2024 at about 1.30 am. The incident – which is captured on the CCTV camera recording<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> – occurred after the Wife had just returned home from Malaysia. The Husband was sleeping on the floor in the living room at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     According to the Husband, the Wife had harassed him (a) by kicking his leg repeatedly for about 90 s and (b) by taking away his sling back which contained items such as his wallet and phone.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife denied having harboured any intention to harass the Husband at the material time. According to her, she had merely nudged him with her leg as she felt pitiful for him to be sleeping on the floor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I find that the Wife’s actions did not amount to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is no evidence that her actions had caused “hurt” to the Husband. Put in another way, the Husband had failed to prove that he had suffered “bodily pain, disease or infirmity” because of the Wife’s actions. Accordingly, Limb A is not engaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband had also failed to bring his case under Limb D. Specifically, there is no evidence that the Wife had intended to cause, or knew that she was likely to cause, anguish to him at the material time. In the video recording, the Wife can be heard saying repeatedly in a normal tone, “Excuse me”, “I need the room”, “I am talking to you”, and “Hello”. The Husband can also be heard in the recording to have said, “Not now”. If the Wife had intended to cause anguish to him, one would have expected her to be more aggressive and forceful in waking him up – e.g., by shouting harshly at him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the recording shows that after failing to rouse the Husband to get up, the Wife took his sling bag and left. Soon thereafter, the Husband looked up in her direction, glanced at the position where his bag used to be placed, and then returned to his sleep. In my view, the Husband must have been aware that the Wife had taken his sling bag. Yet, he did not raise any issue with this at the material time. Neither did he seem to be distressed by the Wife’s actions. It is not inconceivable that the Wife had taken the bag to retrieve her room key, and the Husband was fine with this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">13 to 14 May 2024 – Harassing the Husband</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I come to the final incident. It is common ground that the parties had an altercation in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024. The altercation revolved around the Wife’s suspicion that the Husband had hacked into her laptop and her phone (“<b>hacking issue</b>”). The parties however gave very different accounts of what had transpired during the altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     According to the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had verbally abused him during the altercation over the hacking issue. At one point, she suddenly slapped his left cheek, leaving him stunned. The Husband remained calm and did not want to be provoked into committing violence against her. When he attempted to leave the home to avoid further conflict, the Wife blocked his path. In response, the Husband told her to leave him alone, or else he would punch her. (He did not have the intention to carry out this threat at the material time.) Despite the threat, the Wife continued to harass him. The Husband did not retaliate. She eventually stopped the harassment at about 2.00 am and went to her room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 14 May 2024 at about 6.00 am, as the Husband was getting ready to leave home for work, the Wife resumed her harassment. She refused to let him go to work until the hacking issue was resolved. She followed him when he left the home. When the lift reached the ground floor, the Husband told her that he was going to the police station. At that point, the Wife took his office bag (which contained his laptop) and went home. The Husband did not want to return home to face further harassment. As such, he reported what had happened to the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Wife denied the Husband’s allegations. According to her<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During the altercation, the Husband had punched her, kicked her, and pushed her against a cupboard and a wall. He eventually told her that he would discuss the hacking issue the following morning. He then went to sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The next day, the parties left home together to talk about the problems in their marriage. When the lift reached the ground floor, the Husband suddenly ran towards the direction of the police station. In the midst of running, he dropped his office bag in the middle of the road and told her –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">“I'm <em>not</em> mentally stable. Don’t make me do stupid things again. I'm going to call the police now and <em>act stupid</em>.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The Wife retrieved the Husband’s office bag and returned home. She later learnt that the Husband had lodged a police report that she had committed violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The altercation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Wife submitted that her account of the altercation should be believed for the following reasons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband did not particularise her verbal abuse towards him during the altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife’s alleged abuse did not put the Husband in fear of hurt as he was able to sleep from 2.00 am to 6.00 am.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband’s claim that she had slapped his cheek during the altercation is a bare allegation. He had failed to produce any photographs, medical reports, or persons who had seen him after the altercation to corroborate his claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On the other hand, the Wife’s evidence that the Husband had punched her is supported by an audio recording. In the recording, he could be heard saying, “I’ll punch your face now. Move”. (“<b>Husband’s Remarks</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I am not persuaded by the Wife’s submissions. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The fact that the Husband did not particularise the Wife’s verbal abuse is not fatal to his case. Based on the parties’ case, the altercation was clearly heated – with both sides alleging that family violence had been committed by the other side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife’s submission that the Husband could sleep after the altercation is also a neutral point. A similar argument can be made against the Wife that she was not in fear of hurt by the Husband at the material time. This is because (i) she had remained at home after he had allegedly assaulted her and (ii) she had chosen to leave the home together with him the next morning.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Regarding the lack of evidence to corroborate the Husband’s account of what had happened during the altercation, again, the same point can be made of the Wife’s claim. Specifically, she had failed to produce photographs, medical reports, or persons who had seen her after the altercation to corroborate her claim that the Husband had kicked her and pushed her against a cupboard and a wall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I accept that the Husband’s Remarks can corroborate the Wife’s claim that the Husband had punched her. That said, I find this evidence to be far from conclusive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the remarks can also support the Husband’s evidence that the Wife had <em>blocked his path</em> when he attempted to leave the home to avoid further conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Husband’s Remarks can be construed to be merely a <em>warning</em> of what the Husband might do <em>if</em> the Wife did not stop blocking his path.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, it is unclear from the recording whether the Husband did eventually punch the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     On the last point, I have doubts regarding the Wife’s claim that the Husband had assaulted her during the altercation. Based on the Wife’s account, the alleged assault would have been extremely violent – she was punched, kicked, and pushed against a cupboard and a wall. Despite this, the Wife did not mention about the assault until recently at the trial. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is the Wife’s case that she has a habit of texting the Husband’s brother (one S) (“<b>Brother-in-Law</b>”) to help solve her marital issues with the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Yet, there is no evidence to show that she had texted the Brother-in-Law for help soon after the alleged assault.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife also did not promptly file a police report or PPO application against the Husband for the alleged assault. Instead, she filed her police report and PPO application (SS 1138/2024) only on 20 May 2024 and 18 June 2024 respectively. It bears noting that her report and application was filed <em>after</em> – and apparently in response to – the Husband’s PPO application on 15 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, in her police report, the Wife had set out <em>comprehensively</em> her complaint against the Husband. In the report, she accused him of having (1) hacked her electronic devices, (2) stolen her identity card, (3) pawn her jewellery without her consent, and (4) <em>hit her on 26 January 2023</em>. Significantly, there is no mention in the police report that the Husband had assaulted her on in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> If the Wife could recall him having allegedly hit her on 26 January 2023 (i.e., an incident that had occurred about 1½ years before the lodging of the police report), why did she fail to mention the alleged assault during the altercation – which is a more violent and a more recent incident?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, in her PPO application, the Wife had similarly failed to mention the alleged assault during the altercation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Instead, she referred to (1) the hacking issue, (2) the incidents stated in her police report (dated 20 May 2024), (3) the Husband having allegedly slapped the son in March 2023, and (4) an alleged spousal abuse on 26 January 2023. Given that the very purpose of the Wife making the PPO application is to protect herself from family violence by the Husband, why did she fail (again) to mention in her application about the alleged assault in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In contrast, I find that the Husband’s account of the altercation to be more coherent and credible. Additionally, his evidence that the Wife was very aggressive at the material time is consistent with her own evidence that she was “particularly distress[ed]” by the hacking issue at the material time as her nursing course assignments and examinations were just around the corner. The Wife had also believed that the Husband was the culprit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> In the circumstances, it is probable that she would have been harsh and confrontational towards the Husband over the hacking issue at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Events when the parties left the home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     I now turn to the events when the parties left their home in the morning of 14 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     According to the Wife, the Husband had made two statements at the material time. <em>First</em>, that he was “not mentally stable”. <em>Second</em>, that he would <em>pretend</em> to be “stupid” (presumably, meaning pretend to be mentally <em>un</em>stable) in front of the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I find the Wife’s evidence regarding such alleged statements to be inherently incredible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it appears from the Wife’s evidence that the Husband had <em>suddenly</em> behaved in a bizarre manner. This is no evidence to show what had triggered such alleged behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, if the Husband <em>was</em> “mentally stable” and rational at the material time, why did he make the alleged statements? Put in another way, what advantage did he seek to gain by declaring his mental state and intentions to the Wife?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Further, it is not disputed that the Husband had left home that morning intending to go to work. In the circumstances, there is no reason for him to suddenly leave his laptop bag in the middle of the road while running to the police station. Without his laptop, how would he be able to work?<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Third</em>, if the Husband was “<em>not</em> mentally stable” at the material time, then I have difficulty accepting that he would still have the presence of mind to declare to the Wife his intention to “act stupid” before the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Finally</em>, based on the <em>Wife’s account</em>, the Husband <em>would not have known</em> that she had kept his laptop bag at the material time. This is because according to her, the Husband had suddenly left the bag in the middle of the road while running away from her. Yet, it is <em>not disputed</em> that the Husband knew that his laptop bag was with the Wife at the material time. This is because he had complained to the Police that she had taken his laptop bag. It is also undisputed that the bag was later found in her possession by the Police. Such undisputed facts do not square with the Wife’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Summary – Family violence committed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     To sum-up, I find that the Wife had committed family violence against the Husband and the children. Specifically –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had repeatedly caned and hit the son on 27 July 2023. Such use of force was excessive and unreasonable and had gone beyond the limits of the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife had also continuously harassed the Husband on 2 April 2024. Initially, the harassment concerned the “phone contract” issue. Later in the evening, she had repeatedly threatened to kill herself and the children. The Wife’s actions had caused alarm and anguish to the Husband and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife had repeatedly hit and caned the children on 22 April 2024. Such actions did not come within the correction exception.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, the Wife had slapped the Husband’s cheek and continuously harassed him regarding the hacking issue in the early hours of 13 and 14 May 2024. On 14 May 2024, she had continued the harassment and had also taken his laptop bag when he was going to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Having found that family violence had been committed, the next issue is whether a PPO is necessary to deter the Wife from committing further violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     On this issue, the Wife made several submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fact that the Wife loves the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55      <em>First</em>, the Wife submitted that a PPO is not necessary because she deeply loves the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     While I do not doubt the Wife’s love for the children, this fact alone does not mean that a PPO is unnecessary. The key issue is whether “family violence is likely to be committed” by the Wife against the children in the future: s 65(1) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In my view, the answer is yes. The Wife had made it clear during the trial that she did not see anything wrong with her approach to “disciplining” the children. This lack of insight on her part increases the likelihood that she will continue to use excessive and unreasonable force to discipline the children in future. A PPO is needed to remind her to exercise restraint when disciplining them: <em>XKJ</em> at [32(h)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Propensity to threaten harm to self and the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58      <em>Second</em>, the Wife had also submitted that the making of the Threat over WhatsApp and the Threat at Home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... was purely <b>situational in nature</b> and would not arise again. The evidence shows that since April 2024, which was more than a year ago, the [Wife] had not ever threatened nor contemplated suicide again. It will be speculative and against the weight of the evidence to find that the [Wife] would react in a similar fashion in future, when her conduct on that occasion was purely one-off in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[emphasis in original text; text in square brackets added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I am unable to agree with the Wife’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60      <em>First</em>, the mere fact that she has not made further threats of harming either herself or the children after April 2024 is neither here nor there. One possible reason why the Wife had desisted from making further similar threats is that the Husband had applied for a PPO against her on 15 May 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61      <em>Second</em>, there is ample evidence to show that to get attention and what she wants, the Wife has no qualm about (1) making casual references to death, and (2) threatening to cause harm to herself and/or the children. In addition to the threats made on 2 April 2024, the Wife had also made the following threats.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     During courtship days, there was an occasion where the Wife was hospitalised following a suicide attempt when the Husband wanted to break up with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 28 July 2023, the Wife had sent the following message to the Husband when he pleaded with her that the son did not deserve to be caned for making mistakes in his spelling:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">This is you, u wan us to <em>die</em> at the very last minute ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 22 April 2024 (i.e., just three weeks after the 2 April incident), the Wife had <em>again</em> threatened to kill herself and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       On that day, the Wife had sent the following messages to the Brother-in-Law.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">“I really mean it mama”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">“If he [the Husband] never come back tonight.

According to her, such feelings arose because (1) the Husband had installed a video recorder in the helper’s room, and (2) he had not returned home for some time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       I am unable to accept the Wife’s claim. According to her, she had sent the above messages so that the Brother-in-Law could question the Husband and solve her marital issues.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> In other words, she had an ulterior motive for sending the messages. During cross-examination, the Wife reluctantly agreed that regardless of the personal issues a parent was facing, the parent should not make threats with a child’s life to get what he/she wanted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     At this juncture, I digress to highlight the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The present case is <em>not</em> one involving a threat (i) made in the heat of the moment under extreme emotional circumstances, or (ii) linked to an underlying psychiatric condition. In such cases, the facts may show that the maker of the threat did not intend to cause harm: <em>TDN v TDM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16446-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 143</a> at [26].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Depending on the facts, a PPO may still be an appropriate option to deter the respondent from making similar threats in future even if the respondent is mentally unstable: see e.g., <em>UMP v UMQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21906-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 57</a> at [23] and [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fact that the Husband is facing charges</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63      <em>Third</em>, the Wife had also submitted that a PPO is unnecessary to protect the Husband. The basis for this submission is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_a\"></a>(a)     After the trial had ended, the Wife complained to the Police that the Husband had (on 14 May 2025) breached an expedited order (“<b>EO</b>”) issued against him. Specifically, he had allegedly used his elbow to press onto the back of her neck area and thus caused her pain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 23 April 2025, the Husband was charged in court for (i) breaching the EO, an offence under s 63C of the Charter, and (ii) voluntarily causing hurt, an offence under s 323 read with s 74C of the Penal Code 1871.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Arising from the above, the Wife made two submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, that I should draw the appropriate “inference” from the fact that the Police and Attorney General’s Chambers (“<b>AGC</b>”) had seen it fit to press charges against the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_64-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, that the Husband is a “violent person ... and therefore cannot be said to require a personal protection order for himself”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I am unable to agree with the Wife’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s criminal case has not concluded at the time of this judgement. The fact that he is facing prosecution does not prove that he had committed the acts alleged in his charges. At the risk of stating the obvious, he is innocent until proven guilty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In any event, whether the Husband is a “violent person” or not is irrelevant to the issue of whether <em>the Wife</em> should be deterred from committing family violence against him via a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In my view, a PPO is necessary. During the trial, it is clear to me that the parties have an acrimonious relationship. The risk of the Wife committing further violence against the Husband is heightened by the fact that they are undergoing divorce. It is likely that they will have conflicts regarding how the marriage is to be dissolved and on matters relating to the children – given their very different parenting styles and attitudes towards the use of corporal punishment: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fact that the Wife had moved out of the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66      <em>Finally</em>, the Wife submitted that a PPO is not necessary because the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     I am not persuaded by this submission. The fact that the parties are no longer residing together does not mean that family violence in the future is unlikely. In the present case, I note that the Wife appears to have a controlling personality and to tend to make inflammatory remarks towards the Husband <em>over WhatsApp</em>. This is evident, for instance, in the WhatsApp exchanges between the parties on 28 July 2023. The background to this exchange has already been set out in [5] to [16] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> To recap –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband told the Wife that her punishment of the son was unduly harsh – considering that it was just spelling. He had requested the Wife not to “overreact”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_67-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Despite the fact that the tone in the Husband’s messages was measured, the Wife responded with a barrage of accusatory statements. This included (i) asserting that the son’s poor performance was “definitely” due to the Husband’s “mistakes” (Message at 10.59 am), (ii) telling him “Don’t be stupid” (Message at 11.11 am), (iii) calling him an “irresponsible father who focus on money alone” (Message at 11.12 am), and (iv) scolding him, “shame on you” (Message at 11.15 am).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Another example of the Wife’s tendency to be controlling and to make inflammatory statements can be seen in the WhatsApp exchange between the parties on 2 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     At about 2.17 pm on that day, the Wife declared her decision to get a divorce. At about 2.25 pm, she sent several messages with <em>exaggerated claims</em> against the Husband – e.g., claiming that he might “record naked videos of me or our daughter for money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Within a minute after sending the above messages, the Wife asked the Husband to settle her “phone contract” issue. The way that she had engaged with him on this issue is very revealing about the <em>power dynamics</em> between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       When the Husband replied that he was at a meeting and that he was not free that day, the Wife insisted that the “phone contract” matter must be settled that day. Despite the Husband suggesting that she could check first with the Woodlands and Yishun branches of the service provider and that he would be free to be with her from 7.40 pm, the Wife replied “nope”, “somerset”, “Don’t instruct me to do that and this”, “you have to do – I can pay yr last 2 hours salary”, “need to get this settled”. (Messages from 3.40 pm to 3.41 pm)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       When the Husband highlighted that the “phone contract” matter was not urgent and that he would make the payment on 2 April itself, the Wife made clear that her demands were non-negotiable, stating that, “im not free”, “need to settle it”, “im planning to move out this weekends (sic)”, “U don’t decide behalf of me whether there is urgency or not”. (Messages from 4.35 pm to 4.39 pm)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       When the Husband sought to negotiate with the Wife the time and place to meet her to settle the “phone contract” (by asking the Wife to meet him at Somerset at 7.20 pm), she demanded, “u fetch me at 5.30 pm”, “at woodlands”. (Message at 4.45 pm) At this juncture, I digress to highlight that the Wife had set the meeting time at 5.30 pm despite the Husband having told her that he would be free only after 7.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Wife had also chided the Husband thereafter by texting, “Don’t behave like an idiot, can? You are very free to do all the recording and nonsense things”. (Message at 5.31 pm)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     To sum-up, the Wife’s tendency to be controlling and to make inflammatory statements towards the Husband over WhatsApp increases the likelihood of family violence being committed against him in future. In the circumstances, a PPO can remind her to avoid conduct that can constitute continual harassment against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For the above reasons, I grant the Husband’s PPO application for the children and himself. Additionally, I order the parties to undergo mandatory counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     Before concluding, I wish to address one point raised in the Husband’s closing submissions. To protect the children, the Husband had requested that (a) a domestic exclusion order be issued and (b) the matter be referred to the Child Protection Specialist Centre (“<b>CPSC</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> I do not see the need to accede to these requests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband has failed to prove that the nature of the family violence committed by the Wife is so severe that it is necessary to take the draconian step of excluding her from the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, if the Husband thinks that it is appropriate to refer the matter to the CPSC, he is at liberty to do so himself.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Complainant’s Written Submissions dated 03.05.25 at [1] to [17]; Husband’s statement dated 01.07.24 (C1) at page 4; Record of Proceedings for 03.10.24 at page 87 (line 1) to page 92 (line 27).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Respondent’s Skeletal Closing Submissions dated 27.02.25 at [30] and [32]; Wife’s affidavit dated 19.08.24 (R1) at [30] and [31].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The attendance table is in the Wife’s affidavit dated 19.08.24 (R1) at page 100.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Record of Proceedings for 20.12.24 at page 52 (line 17 to line 29).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>The medical report is at the Wife’s affidavit dated 19.08.24 (R1) at page 104.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>The Husband applied for PPO on 15.05.24.

After filing their respective papers, parties appeared for the substantive hearing on 3 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Before commencing the trial, the Court saw parties in chambers to finalise, among other things, certain housekeeping matters. At that session, both the wife’s counsel, Mr Segeram, and the husband were present. However, as elaborated below, just before the Court was about to commence with the hearing, the husband made the considered decision <em>not to participate</em> further.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Notwithstanding the defendant’s deliberate decision not to participate, the trial proceeded. On that basis, after hearing from the wife and her witness, the Court granted the wife’s application and granted interim judgment (<em>vide</em> FC/IJ 500/2025, or “IJ”) to dissolve the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Despite <em>choosing not to participate</em> in the trial, the husband has filed the present appeal against this Court granting IJ in the wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties were married in India, whereby the marriage was solemnised in October 2006, and subsequently registered in December 2007. Parties were originally from India, and the wife moved to Singapore after the marriage to be with the husband as he was already working in Singapore since 2005.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       There are two children to the marriage, both girls. The elder daughter (“C1”) was born in November 2009, and the younger daughter (“C2”) was born in November 2012.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Commencement of D 4670</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I now set out the procedural history of the divorce proceedings leading up to the hearing on 3 February 2025. As noted above, the eventual hearing was uneventful in light of the husband’s decision not to participate in the trial. However, although not directly relevant to the present appeal, I found it apposite to set out some various aspects of the procedural history which, in my view, shed light and insight on the husband’s conduct during the entire course of these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Following from the breakdown of their relationship, the wife commenced D 4670 in October 2022. In her papers, she sought for an order for the dissolution of the marriage on the ground ‘unreasonable behaviour’ under the then section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It suffices to summarise at this juncture that the wife asserted, <em>inter alia</em>, that the husband was abusive to her after the birth of C2,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> had committed family violence against her (including punching her in the face),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and was having an improper association.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Contemporaneously, in September 2022, the wife commenced FC/OSG 96/2022 (“OSG 96”) seeking orders in respect of the Children. The husband was represented in those proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Whilst the husband was represented in OSG 96, the wife had issues with serving the papers in D 4670 on the husband. Issues arose in part because the husband’s solicitors in OSG 96 had indicated that they had no instructions to accept service of the papers in D 4670 on the husband’s behalf. As such, the wife sought an order for substituted service of the divorce papers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On 11 November 2022, the Court granted the wife’s application for substituted service. On 21 November 2022, the divorce documents in D 4670 were served on the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was only <em>after</em> the wife was able to serve the divorce documents in D 4670 on the husband (by way of substituted service) that the husband filed a notice stating that he had appointed solicitors for D 4670. A review of the court records will show that the solicitors who were appointed for D 4670 were, in fact, <em>the same solicitors</em> representing him for OSG 96.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Notwithstanding the issues with service, it bears noting that on 12 December 2022, the wife filed a ‘Request for Setting Down Action for Trial’ for the divorce to proceed on an uncontested basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Separately, in light of OSG 96, the father himself separately commenced OSG 6/2023 (“OSG 6”) on 5 January 2023, seeking orders for custody and care and control of the Children, as well as maintenance for the Children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The husband’s 1<sup>st</sup> stay proceedings (SUM 21/2023)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Two days before commencing OSG 6, on 3 January 2023, the husband commenced Summons No. 21/2023 (“SUM 21”) to stay D 4670 on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em>. In this regard, the husband had, <em>after</em> the wife commenced D 4670 and OSG 96, commenced his own set of divorce proceedings in India on 29 October 2022 (i.e, Original Petition No. 1318, or “OP 1318”). OP 1318 was commenced in the husband’s home state of Palakkad, India.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     SUM 21 was initially fixed for hearing in March 2023. As noted earlier, at this time, both the wife and husband were represented in D 4670. At that hearing, it was noted that instead of filing an expert affidavit on foreign law, the husband simply included a letter from an Indian lawyer seeking to comment on aspects of foreign law. Given that the issue of Indian law (as a matter of foreign law) was an essential issue to the determination of SUM 21, directions were given for parties to properly regularise the admission of foreign law expert evidence as part of SUM 21, with a further hearing fixed in May 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     At this juncture, it is worth noting that one of the central planks of the husband’s argument in support of a stay in D 4670 was his claim of the interplay between Singapore’s and India’s laws relating to divorce. As noted earlier, parties’ marriage was registered in India, and the husband had contended that the grounds/facts for divorce in Singapore are dissimilar to those in India, such that any Singapore divorce order <em>may</em> not be recognised in India.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> That said, the husband also wants to have the divorce heard in India because of his claim that the wife had committed adultery, and assuming that that fact is established, husband has an apparent right to seek damages against the wife and/or the third party involved. Put another way, it cannot be completely discounted that the husband’s desire for the divorce proceedings to take place in India was strategic or tactical in nature. This is because the ‘fact’ of adultery as a basis for dissolving a marriage is also provided for under the WC. In short, the husband would conceivably have gotten the outcome he wanted to in Singapore as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I turn back to the procedural history. In the lead up to the May 2023 hearing, the husband filed his notice indicating that he was now acting in person. In light of this and as parties were still in the midst of negotiating a global settlement in OSG 96, the hearing fixed in May 2023 was vacated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As parties were unable to reach a resolution on the divorce, the hearing for SUM 21 was fixed for 26 June 2023. Then, on 22 June 2023, the husband wrote in requesting that the June 2023 hearing be vacated. Some of the reasons stated in the request included substantive arguments in support of his application in SUM 21. In light of this, the Court declined the husband’s request, and maintained its earlier directions that the hearing on 26 June 2023 proceed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On the day of the hearing on 26 June 2023, the husband wrote in seeking for the hearing to be adjourned on the basis that the C2 was unwell. Notwithstanding the timing of the husband’s correspondence, I found it appropriate to acknowledge Mr Segeram’s amenability not to proceed in the husband’s absence, in part because parties were still attempting to resolve the matter globally. As such, permission was given to refix the hearing to 24 July 2023. That said, in light of the filing of parties’ respect expert evidence, the Court highlighted the completeness of parties’ documents to be used for the hearing of SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On 7 July 2023, the husband filed his notice appointing solicitors for the matter. In light of solicitors coming on board, the husband made another request to adjourn the 24 July 2023 to a later date. Needless to say, the wife objected to the husband’s request to refix the matter again. That said, after hearing parties, on 17 July 2023, the Court was inclined to allow one final adjournment of the hearing. After considering parties’ available dates in their subsequent correspondence, the hearing for SUM 21 was fixed for 4 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     At the hearing on 4 September 2023, the Court heard substantive arguments from parties. After the hearing, the Court issued further directions for parties to provide supplemental submissions on a number of areas. This includes supplemental submissions on certain developments which had taken place after this Court had released its decision on <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a> (which dealt with, among other things, the interplay between our local laws relating to divorce and the law applying to parties at the time of marriage in the context of a stay application for <em>forum non conveniens</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Events after conclusion of SUM 21</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     After receiving parties’ supplemental submissions and after considering parties’ arguments, this Court dismissed SUM 21 on 26 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s submission of further arguments</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     After the Court released its decision for SUM 21, the husband sought to make further arguments on the matter, which included the wife’s purported submissions to the Indian courts <em>after</em> the Court’s decision in SUM 21. Whilst I was inclined for the husband to make these further arguments, I had specifically indicated to parties’ that in light of the dismissal of SUM 21, parties were to file their remaining pleadings for the divorce. At the time SUM 21 was dismissed, the husband had not yet filed his Defence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I pause here and note, through no fault of the husband’s solicitors, the husband’s decision to delay/refusal the filing of his pleadings after the decision in SUM 21. Despite issuing numerous directions for the filing of pleadings, the husband <em>consistently</em> chose not to file anything. This is in part because of his belief that any filing would prejudice his position in the Indian divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On 20 June 2024, after receiving parties’ submissions relating to the husband’s further arguments, the Court maintained its decision to dismiss SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s continued failure to file his pleadings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Further to the Court’s decision, parties’ solicitors appeared before the Court for a case conference of D 4670 on 10 July 2024. At that case conference, the Court noted that the husband had still not filed his pleadings. The husband’s solicitor then, Mr Koh, apprised the Court that after speaking to his Indian solicitors, the husband was advised not to comply with this Court’s directions. This is after the Court had highlighted to Mr Koh the need for parties to file their pleadings. Two important inferences arise from Mr Koh’s submissions – the first is that the husband was aware of the direction to file his pleadings, and the importance of the same. The second is that with that knowledge, and in consultation with the advice of his Indian solicitors, the husband <em>chose</em> not to file his pleadings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In light of the husband’s position, I formally determined that pleadings had closed, leaving the wife’s Statement of Claim (“SOC”) and Statement of Particulars (“SOP”) as the only pleadings for the divorce. Further to this, I issued the relevant directions for parties to file their respective Affidavit-of-Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”), the set down date for trial, and the filing of opening statements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The hearing of D 4670 was scheduled to take place on 12 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s filing of SUM 2526</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On 6 August 2024, the husband filed a notice for a change of solicitors. On 8 August 2024 (ie, the last business day before the Monday of the hearing on 12 August 2024 (in light of the National Day public holiday)), the husband filed Summons No. 2526/2024 (“SUM 2526”). SUM 2526 was the husband’s application for a stay pending (1) the outcome of HCF/OSN 6//2024 (“OSN 6”), and/or (2) the outcome of the husband’s appeal against the dismissal of SUM 21 (in the event OSN 6 was granted). For context, OSN 6 was the husband’s application for an extension of time to file his appeal against the dismissal of SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As the husband had filed SUM 2526 on the last working day before the hearing of D 4670, Mr Segeram was not in a position to deal with the application. Since SUM 2526 had to be addressed first (as it was an application to stay the proceedings pending the High Court’s determination in OSN 6), the Court was constrained to vacate the hearing of the divorce, and gave directions for the relevant responses to SUM 2526.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Dismissal of OSN 6, discharge of husband’s solicitor, and husband’s further attempt to resolve the divorce</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     On 19 September 2024, the High Court dismissed OSN 6. This meant that the husband no longer could appeal against the dismissal of SUM 21.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In other words, D 4670 would proceed in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Further to the dismissal of OSN 6, Parties attended before the Court on 20 September 2024 to receive the necessary directions to proceed with D 4670. On the same day, the husband filed another notice, this time indicating that he was acting in person, again. Indeed, at the case conference, the husband’s solicitor sought leave to be discharged. I granted leave for the solicitor to be discharged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In light of the dismissal of SUM 21 and OSN 6, the husband sought for more time to further attempt to resolve the divorce globally with the wife. The husband even sought for a further mediation, which I was not inclined to accede to. Instead, I granted the husband time to correspond with Mr Segeram for a final attempt at agreeing on the terms of the <em>existing</em> pleadings. In light of the fact that the husband was now self-representing himself, and perhaps naïvely hopeful, I granted the husband a fairly lengthy period of time for him to be able to find a middle ground with the wife. This is especially given my observations at paragraph 18 above that the husband’s primary complaint would be the wife’s infidelity, and if parties were to come to some consensus (at least on the specific fact of divorce), parties would have been able to better divert their resources to the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     However, after receiving updates from parties, parties were not able to reach a comprise. As such, a further case conference was convened on 10 January 2025. At that case conference, the husband sought to rehash the arguments substantively canvassed in SUM 21 as to the purported appropriateness of the divorce proceedings taking place in India. When presented with the reality that the Court was not minded to accede to any such arguments, the husband then shifted tact to say that he wished to file his defence and counterclaim. However, the Court had explained to the husband his specific position at the material time that he <em>did not</em> wish to comply with the Court’s directions relating to the filing of his pleadings. It is at this juncture where the husband asserted that his available options was not made known to him by his previous solicitors upon the dismissal of SUM 21. However, I was not minded to accept the husband’s reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In light of the previous directions given for the close of pleadings, I directed that parties file and serve their AEICs by 27 January 2025, with the hearing of the divorce to take place on 3 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The husband’s 2<sup>nd</sup> stay proceedings (SUM 220/2025) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Leading up to the hearing on 3 February 2025, the husband filed several notices of his intention to refer to the affidavits filed in OSG 96, OSG 6, as well as affidavits which appear to have been filed in the State Courts pursuant to an application made under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     That said, the husband had yet to file his AEICs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Instead, the husband only filed, <em>on the day</em> of the hearing, the following AEICs:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     His AEIC;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The AEIC of ‘SB’;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The AEIC of ‘BC’; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The AEIC of ‘FAR’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Additionally, on 31 January 2025 (the Friday before the hearing on Monday), the husband filed <em>another</em> application for a stay of proceedings in favour of the divorce proceedings in India. This application was made under Summons No. 220/2025 (“SUM 220”). Given the time in which the husband filed SUM 220, that matter was fixed for a case conference together with the hearing of D 4670 on 3 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Hearing on 3 February 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As noted earlier, before the start of the hearing for D 4670 on 3 February 2025, Mr Segeram and the husband attended before the Court in chambers for a pre-hearing conference for final housekeeping matters (particularly in light of the late filing of the husband’s AEICs), as well as to address the Court on SUM 220.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     With regard to SUM 220, the husband sought to highlight to this Court that there have been some developments with the various proceedings that are going on in India.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> For instance, his own divorce proceeding in OP 1318 was to be transferred from his home state in Palakkad to the wife’s home state of Kozhikode. While that in and of itself is not controversial, the point which the husband wished to make was there these proceedings happened to be going on concurrently with D 4670. In this connection and additionally, the husband highlighted that he had filed an anti-suit injunction (<em>vide</em> Originating Petition 660, or “OP 660”) to restrain parties from continuing with D 4670. For completeness, the husband had also filed an interlocutory application within OP 660 seeking for the matter to be expedited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In short, the husband contended that proceedings in India seem to be going along its own way <em>in spite of</em> this Court’s decision in SUM 21. The upshot of this is that it indicates an indecisiveness on the wife’s part, and effectively amounts to her having her cake and eating it. In those circumstances, the present proceedings in D 4670 should be stayed in favour of the proceedings in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Not surprisingly, the wife disagreed with the husband’s contentions. As regards the transfer of OP 1318, Mr Segeram acknowledged the transfer order of the proceedings to Kozhikode. However, Mr Segeram mentioned that because this order was merely in furtherance of TRP 418, and nothing substantive has been done, it is speculative as to what might happen in those proceedings, if at all. Separately, in terms of the stage of those proceedings, the proceedings in D 4670 were well ahead of any of the other proceedings in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Separately, as regards OP 660, Mr Segeram brought to my attention that the Indian courts have actually conclusively dealt with the matter, and dismissed the husband’s application. In a copy of the Indian court’s decision dated 24 December 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>, the Indian court made the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">On going through the entire records, I am of the considered view that the [husband] has approached this court without clean hands. So, considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, I am not inclined to grant any kind of injunction order against the [wife].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the result, the petition [(ie., OP 660)] is dismissed without costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The husband contends that this is not a conclusive order, because in his affidavit in support of SUM 220, there appears to be a further court date fixed for OP 660 on 1 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     After hearing parties, whilst I was not inclined to make a specific ruling on SUM 220 on the same day (in part because the wife has had no opportunity to properly respond to the application given the late filing by the husband), I was also not inclined to delay the hearing of D 4670 further. In this regard:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     D 4670 was commenced by the October 2022. A significant amount of time had passed, with parties not finding any meaningful resolution to the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     At each turn, the husband had sought to prevent and/or delay the proper progress of D 4670. This includes the filing of OP 1318, the filing of SUM 21, OSN 6, and more recently the belated filing of SUM 220.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When SUM 21 was fully disposed of following the dismissal of OSN 6, the husband sought to buy himself more time by making a final attempt at seeing if the matter can be resolved. However, it would seem that the only resolution which the husband was seeking was for the wife to stop D 4670, and to have the matter litigated in India on his grievance of adultery. Put another way, the husband’s intention to resolve the matter was on the basis that it be resolved <em>on his terms only</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_d\"></a>(d)     When it was clear that D 4670 was going to proceed, the husband chose to only file his AEICs <em>on the day of the trial</em>. In addition, and perhaps trying to get another bite of the cherry, the husband filed SUM 220.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In filing SUM 220, the husband sought to make tangential and piecemeal points on the progress of the Indian proceedings. However, despite the effluxion of time, the husband readily acknowledges that further to the dismissal of SUM 21, there was no existing court order preventing this Court from proceeding with D 4670. On the contrary, as noted above, there is, at present, an express order made by the Indian court <em>denying</em> the husband any injunction against the wife. While the husband highlighted that he was intending to appeal against that decision, it does not change the fact there is no order preventing this Court from proceeding with D 4670.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Insofar as the husband wishes to assert that he would be prejudiced with D 4670 proceeding (at least in light of him commencing SUM 220), I was not inclined to agree. As noted above, OP 1318 was commenced <em>after</em> D4670. In terms of relief (ie adultery), such recourse was available to him D 4670 (had he filed his pleadings). There is nothing which he wishes to do in India which he cannot substantively achieve in Singapore. Separate from all this, the husband has fully participated in OSG 96 in Singapore. There is nothing to be gained in India other than pecuniary relief in connection with this contention of adultery. Even then, I had provisionally indicated (in the absence of anything to the contrary) in my decision in SUM 21 that such relief appears to be a separate and distinct relief which would not be extinguished <em>even if</em> there was a divorce order in Singapore dissolving the marriage on the grounds of adultery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The real prejudice, if anything, to my mind, is the husband’s predilection to have the divorce concluded <em>on his terms only</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     It is at this point, when faced the reality that his attempts to hold off D 4670 have come to an end, the husband did what he had done previously – simply refused to participate. Whilst he had every opportunity to participate in the hearing, just before it was about to start, the husband stated the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Husband]:    I don’t want to be in the trial. Your Honour.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     For completeness, whilst indicating an intention not to participate in the trial, the husband attempted to raise an issue regarding the scheduling of when his witnesses were to file their AEICs. In this regard, the husband had written to Court by way of an email dated 27 January 2025 seeking, <em>inter alia</em>, the schedule on when his witnesses can testify, and whether they are able to give evidence remotely. For completeness, stated below is an extract of the husband’s correspondence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4.    I would like to seek the Court’s directions and confirmation on the below –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">a)    The schedule of when they can testify and whether some of them can do so by video conference via zoom or whether they must be physically present at the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">b)    The schedule of <b>by when they can file their AEIC’s</b> [sic]. I intend to file scanned copy of notarised AEICs of the witnesses on their behalf at the Crimson Logic Service Bureau, but getting the original hard copies couriered to Singapore might incur time very likely beyond 31 January 2025 [the extended deadline given by the Court following the husband’s request on 20 January 2025]. Ideally, the witnesses are asking for and will appreciate some more time to file their AEICs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I found it apposite to make a few points regarding this request (which came in one week before the hearing on 3 February 2025):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     By way of the Court’s directions on 10 January 2025 and 20 January 2025, it was clear that the deadline for parties to file and serve their AEICs was 31 January 2025. For the husband to write in seeking ‘confirmation’ of the Court’s clear directions, if anything, seeks to introduce, in my judgment, a self-created ambiguity which may be utilised by the husband for his own purposes. Indeed, at the hearing on 3 February 2025, when it was clear that the Court was not minded to adjourn the hearing any further, the husband sought to raise the issue. Separately, it is also noted that in the same request, the husband was essentially seeking leave, without any application (as provided for in the practice directions) for his intended witnesses to give evidence remotely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The underlying tenor of the husband’s correspondence, as with many of his correspondence, is prefaced with either a query or difficulty in complying with the Court’s directions. This either forms a caveat or justification for subsequently not complying with the Court’s directions. Moreover, when queried about his action (or inaction as the case may be), the husband is ever ready with a response to defend/explain his conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Put simply, the husband was creating every conceivable opportunity to conduct the proceedings <em>on his own terms</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     As I was not inclined to accede to his ultimate request for the hearing of D 4670 not to proceed (be it <em>via</em> a stay or some or procedural matter relating to his witnesses), I stood the matter down for parties to prepare themselves for the hearing to start. I also provided the time for the husband to consider his position on participating in the hearing. As I noted earlier, the husband had every opportunity to participate in the proceedings, <em>if he wished to</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     After returning from the break, the husband confirmed his choice of not participating in the trial.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> On that basis, the trial proceeded in the husband’s <em>considered and deliberate</em> absence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Documents forming part of the proceedings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     For ease of reference, the documents forming part of these proceedings are as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.78%\"><col width=\"43.78%\"><col width=\"47.44%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/N</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Documents filed by Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Documents filed by Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Pleadings</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Statement of Claim dated 6 October 2022 (“SOC”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">SOP</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Affidavits</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife’s AEIC dated 29 July 2024 (“WA1”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband’s AEIC dated 31 January 2025 (“HA”)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">4.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Opening Statement dated 7 August 2024 (“WOS”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of ‘SB’ dated 28 January 2025 (“SB”)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife’s AEIC dated 31 January 2025 (“WA2”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of ‘BC’ dated 2 February 2024 (“BC”)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6.</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of DD5 (“DD5”)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AEIC of ‘FAR’ dated 30 January 2025 (“FAR”)</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Separately, part of the record of proceedings include the hearing transcript of the hearing on 3 February 2025 (ie, the NE).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ pleaded positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As briefly stated at paragraph 9 above, the wife’s pleaded position in support of her application is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_57-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The wife had come across a suspicious text message which stated “Sorry, please don’t tell your husband”.

By doing so, neither he nor his witnesses were present for the evidence to be examined. It is appropriate to pause here and note rules 589 and 590(1) of the Family Justice Rules 2014:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>General rule: Witnesses to be examined</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">589.  Subject to these Rules and the Evidence Act (Cap. 97), and any other written law relating to evidence, any fact required to be proved at the trial of any action begun by writ by the evidence of witnesses must be proved by the examination of the witnesses in Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Evidence by affidavit</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">590.— (1)    Without prejudice to the generality of rule 589, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    evidence-in-chief of a witness must be given by way of affidavit; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    unless the Court otherwise orders or the parties to the action otherwise agree —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    such a witness must attend trial for cross-examination; and (ii) in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The aforementioned provisions are clear that in a trial of a matter commenced by writ (as is the case for D 4670), in light of the husband’s and his witnesses’ non-participation at the hearing, their evidence, <em>as a default position</em>, “shall not” be received in evidence. The provision effectively mandates the removal of such evidence as part of the proceedings for D 4670.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     That said, rule 590 provides that such evidence shall not be received except with the Court’s leave. In the present case, the husband had queried whether, if he were not to participate, whether the AEICs he had filed would be considered.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Court had clarified that the AEICs were already filed in the court its system.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     After considering the matter, and whilst the husband, strictly speaking, did not make a specific application for leave for his AEICs to be included notwithstanding his or his witnesses’ participation, I was not inclined to strike the evidence out completely. That said, I was not inclined to give it significant weight, and to be taken as bare contentions without the benefit of any form of examination either by the Court (or Mr Segeram through cross-examination). I was not inclined to wipe the husband’s evidence out completely because to do so would mean that he would have absolutely <em>no materials</em> in these proceedings. My decision to have his documents included was to ensure some integrity and completeness of the proceedings as a whole, <em>in spite of</em> the husband’s conduct. To be clear, there was nothing preventing this Court, as expressly provided for in the provisions of the Family Justice Rules stated above, from disregarding the husband’s evidence <em>entirely</em>. My decision to allow his documents to remain on record had less to do with affording the husband some form of deference, but rather, to give some completeness to the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     With those observations, I briefly set out parties’ evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">WA2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The wife’s evidence in her AEIC is broadly an amplification of the matters raised in the SOP. That said, I note the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In respect of the incident of family violence which the wife says was committed by the husband on 9 November 2021 (ie, where he had punched her in the face), the wife included documents and pictures of when she received medical attention on the injuries.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Similarly, in respect of the incident of family violence in June 2022, the wife included documents and pictures of the injuries she sustained.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As regards the allegation of improper association,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> the wife enclosed the report by the private investigator who had conducted surveillance on the husband. In this connection, it was identified that the person who the husband was allegedly having and improper association with was SB.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">YKK</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     YKK is the private investigator who signed off on the surveillance report which was adduced in these proceedings. A copy of the surveillance report was enclosed in both the wife’s and his AEIC. The period of surveillance was for 5 days in July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     At this juncture, it suffices to reproduce the conclusions made in the report:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">61    The Company had conducted 5 operations on this case with the view to verify the suspicions that the Client had on Subject-1. During these operations, the Company’s surveillance teams were able to observe that Subject-1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> had been visiting Subject-2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> at the [XXX] Condominium, No 16 [XXX] frequently and used to stay there for long period of time. As members of the surveillance team were unable to see the interior of the said unit and observe Subject-1 and Subject-2 inside, the Company cannot conclude that they were involved in any intimacy whilst alone in the apartment. Nevertheless, from the observations carried out by members of the Company’s surveillance teams, there are reasonable inferences to suggest that Subject-1 being a married man had been secretly associating with Subject-2 without his wife knowledge was truly [sic] improper.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">62    Observations by members of the Company’s surveillance teams revealed that Subject-1 was able to drive his car to the basement carpark of the [XXX] Condominium through the resident’s lane at the security checkpoint of the condominium indicates that he could frequent the place day or night without hinderance. This showed that either he has rented the unit No 16-26 for Subject-2 to reside to convenient him to see her as and when he wishes or Subject-2 had rented the place so that Subject-1 could visit her in privacy. In either way, it is unethical for Subject-1 being a married man to behave in this manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">HA</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I turn now to the AEICs filed by the husband, and start with this evidence. In this AEIC, the husband made, among others, the following contentions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The husband rehashed the state of the Indian proceedings, and sought to justify how he is not participating in the Singapore proceedings by not filing this pleadings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     How the wife had excluded the period of 2012 to 2019 from her SOP, where there were acts of “infidelity, cruelty, and harassment” towards the husband. The husband sought to adduced of how the wife had admitted to hurting him emotionally.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The wife’s apparent confession, in the papers for OSG 96, or her improper association with the husband’s brother-in-law.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The husband also contended that the wife had anger issues and alcohol addiction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He took issue with the text message she had apparently discovered in 2009.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_e\"></a>(e)     As regards the incident of family violence in November 2021, the husband allege that it was the wife who had committed violence against him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_f\"></a>(f)     As regards the improper association, needless to say, the husband denied this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> His explanation was that SB was a friend who had supported him through his trauma when he learnt about the wife’s acts of adultery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">SB</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The crux of her evidence was to highlight the long-standing friendship between herself and the husband and wife. She shared how, in 2022, when she herself was going through marital problems, how the husband supported her in establishing a new life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In response to the surveillance report, her position was the photos contained therein “are very normal photos of good friends shopping and eating together”. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> That having said, she <em>does not</em> deal with specific photos where both she and the husband had their arms on each other’s waist, and the frequency of his visits to her home during the period of surveillance. These were all matters which may have provided some context and/or explanation had the husband and his witnesses participated in the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">BC</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     BC is related to the wife and husband through his maternal and paternal families respectively. BC’s evidence was general in nature, stating his relationship with parties,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> the husband’s character,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> the wife’s affair,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> how that impacted the husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>, and recent development between parties (which include the husband attempt to resolve the divorce)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. It is noted that BCs’ evidence does not go towards the specific matters raised in the wife’s pleadings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">FAR</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     FAR is the husband’s friend from university, and has known the husband since September 1999. Similar to BC, his evidence comprises principally of broad and tangential points, dealing more with the husband’s leadership and academic capabilities, the husband’s bond with the Children, the wife’s affair and how it affected him. He does however spoke of the time the husband had visited FAR in November 2021, contemporaneous to the incident of family violence highlighted by the wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis and Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     Against the backdrop of the foregoing, I now provide my analysis and findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable legal principles in establishing the fact of ‘unreasonable behaviour’</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I start with applicable legal principles. For the purposes of the present proceedings, the legislative architecture governing the Court’s power to order a dissolution of a marriage on the fact of ‘unreasonable behaviour’ may be found in the then sections 95(1), (2), and (3)(b) WC, which provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Irretrievable breakdown of marriage to be sole ground for divorce</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">95.—(1)    Either party to a marriage may file a writ for divorce on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court hearing such proceedings must, so far as it reasonably can, inquire into the facts alleged as causing or leading to the breakdown of the marriage and, if satisfied that the circumstances make it just and reasonable to do so, grant a judgment for its dissolution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The court hearing any proceedings for divorce is not to hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The oft-cited decision setting out the applicable tests to be satisfied in order to establish the fact of unreasonable behaviour is the High Court decision of <em>Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0323.xml')\">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 323</a>, where the court held (at [8]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether the respondent’s behaviour has been such that the petitioner can no longer reasonably be expected to live with him is essentially a finding of fact and the courts have avoided categorising conduct as guilty or blameless in the abstract. The question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively: whether his attitude is reasonable is irrelevant. In dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the court, and not the petitioner, to answer it. The test becomes objective but it is not the same as asking whether a hypothetical reasonable spouse in the petitioner’s position would continue to live with the respondent. The court must have regard to the personalities of individuals before it, however far these may be removed from some theoretical norm, and it must assess the impact of the respondent’s conduct and the particular petitioner in the light of the whole history of the marriage and their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     As can seen from the above, in order to satisfy the legislative threshold envisaged in section 95(3)(b), it involves both a subjective and objective assessment. It is subjective insofar as to whether the applicant (in this case the wife) subjectively finds it intolerable to live with the respondent (in this case the husband). It is objective insofar as the Court is tasked to ascertain whether an applicant, with his or her personal characteristic and idiosyncrasies, and having regarding to the history of the marriage as a whole, can be reasonably expected to live with the respondent, with his or her own characteristic and idiosyncrasies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I pause here and note that the foregoing deals with assessing the thresholds vis-à-vis a finding that the complained conducted took place (either by assessment of the Court or by admission or consent). It necessarily requires the Court to first undertake an examination on the existence (and so its extent) of the complained conduct or ‘unreasonable behaviour’. As to what constitutes ‘unreasonable behaviour’, I found it apposite to highlight the very recent comments made by Prof. Leong Wai Kum in <em>Marriage, Spouses and Assets</em> (Leong Wai Kum, 2025, Academy Publishing) (“<em>Marriage, Spouses and Assets</em>”) at [8.167 <em>et seq</em>]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.167 The High Court in 2009 in <em>Teo Hoon Ping v Tan Lay Ying Angeline</em> clarified that it has unfortunately become common to abbreviate this fact to “unreasonable behaviour”, this is a misnomer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.168 The provision <b>does not require the applicant to prove that the respondent’s behaviour is objectively unreasonable. It suffices if the applicant proves some behaviour of the respondent that renders the expectation of the applicant to continue marital cohabitation with the respondent to be unreasonable</b>. The Family Justice Courts have to assess the personalities of the parties to find that, as a result of the respondent’s behaviour, it is not unreasonable to expect the applicant to continue marital cohabitation with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.169 Having said that, however, it is not a problem if the applicant manages to persuade the Family Justice Courts to find the respondent’s behaviour as objectively unreasonable. This will only aid the applicant in convincing the court that it is therefore unreasonable to expect her to continue marital cohabitation with such a spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.170  <b>It is not necessary to find moral culpability on the part of the respondent. Even if the behaviour complained of by the applicant were something for which the respondent cannot be held morally culpable for, it should be available for use</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The state of parties’ evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     It is against that backdrop where I revisit my earlier observations regarding the state of the husband’s evidence (see paragraphs 60 to 63 above). In light of the husband’s conscious decision not to participate in these proceedings, the default position is that the husband’s and his witnesses’ affidavits are not to be received as part of the evidence of these proceedings. Be that as it may, as explained earlier, I was not inclined to reject the husband’s evidence completely, but accorded it nominal weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     By that same token, in light of the husband’s absence and his failure to avail himself of the right to cross examine the wife’s and YKK’s evidence, their evidence, in my view, is <em>prima facie</em> unchallenged. That said, and whilst not doing the husband’s job for him, I will address certain parts of the evidence adduced by the husband and the witnesses, to see whether the affidavit evidence, in itself, is able to overcome the wife’s unchallenged evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Assessment of the husband’s conduct</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The husband’s ‘general’ conduct of being verbally and/or physically abusive</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In assessing the materials before me, I note that save for the specific incidents of violence in 2021 and 2022, the wife does not provide any specific particulars in her pleadings of the husband being verbally abusive. That said, I note in her AEIC that the wife makes mention of the husband belittling her in front of the domestic helper and Children,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> and that he expected her to obey all of his commands without question.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     In light of the foregoing, after assessing the materials before me and notwithstanding the nominal nature of the husband’s evidence, I was unable to make a definitive finding on whether these claimed events took place. Put another way, on the wife’s own evidence, I was not inclined to find that she had discharged her burden to proving the facts which she chose to assert.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     That said, and taking the husband’s own evidence of his discovery of the purported adultery by the wife, and the apparent oppression he was living under by the wife, it was not lost on this Court that minimally, such dissatisfaction would have influenced (or even dictated) how he conducted himself with the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The incident of violence in November 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I turn next to the incident of violence on 9 November 2021 where the husband had struck the wife’s face and nose. In her evidence, she adduces the discharge summary of her visit to Parkway East Hospital on 10 November 2021, as well as the photographs she had apparently taken after the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Unlike the earlier general averment of violence, I was satisfied that the wife had, on the materials before it, <em>prima facie</em> discharged her burden of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that something happened to her. Since the husband was not present to examine the wife, these facts are not substantively challenged. That said, and for completeness, I note the husband’s evidence that it was his view that it was the wife who was violent to him that day. His assertion was that it was the wife who had kicked him, causing him to apparently suffer another heart attack.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     After assessing parties’ evidence and materials, what is common ground is that parties were discussing the topic of divorce. The discussion got heated, and on each party’s evidence, they mentioned that it was the other person who committed violence on them first. Even if I were to accept the husband’s evidence, it still does not explain away the contemporaneous documents submitted by the wife. None of the husband’s evidence, on its face, is a complete answer towards the wife’s own documents in her AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     For those reasons, and on a balance of probabilities on the basis of the wife’s unchallenged evidence on the matter, I was prepared to accept that parties’ <em>undisputed</em> argument with each other on 9 November 2021 had escalated into something more serious between the two of them. Further to my earlier observations at paragraph 82 above, what can be reasonably inferred is that by then, the husband had all but checked out from the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The husband’s late nights when he was unemployed / in between jobs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     At the outset, in her pleadings, the wife just made the averment that the husband would generally return late at night or early in the morning. Subsequently, in her evidence, the wife did not provide any further particulars of the extent of these late nights. The wife also did not provide any particulars of her belief that the husband was “staying at some other place”. It was also only in her AEIC where she made the supposition that the late nights were connected with the husband’s improper association with SB.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     For those reasons, and on the materials before me, I make no specific finding in respect of this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Incident of family violence in 18 July 2022 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     I turn next to the alleged incident of violence of 18 July 2022, where the wife contended that the husband had, <em>inter alia</em>, ordered the wife to leave the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> There was also an argument surrounding the issue of a divorce, which led to the husband strangling her. In her AEIC, the points raised above are substantively similar, save that the wife highlighted that the argument that day related to the husband’s purported intention to take the Children away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In his AEIC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span>, the husband’s narrative is that it was the wife who attempted to take the Children’s passport away from him. As such, an argument ensued. In the husband’s <em>own</em> evidence, he acknowledged that the argument then <em>escalated</em> into a scuffle. While he makes mention in his police report asserting that neither party did not sustain injuries, the husband <em>does not</em> address the contemporaneous medical documents found in the wife’s AEIC. Such medical documents include the police medical form.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     After assessing the materials before me, what is undisputed is that there was yet <em>another</em> disagreement between parties on marital issues (this time about the Children). What is also undisputed in both parties’ evidence is that this disagreement <em>escalated</em> into a scuffle. Whilst the husband may deny that he caused the wife injury (which I have my reservations about), the husband does not deny there being a physical escalation between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     This is, to my mind, further evidence on the state of parties’ relationship, and how they were conducting themselves with each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The husband’s improper association with SB</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     I turn to the next the husband’s improper association with SB. Putting aside whether or not there was, in fact, an improper association between the husband and SB, the following facts are not disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the surveillance report, it was clear that the husband was, in my view, spending an immoderate amount of time with SB, going to her home as well as partaking in social activities <em>with just the two of them alone</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_93-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the husband’s own evidence, he effectively leaned on to SB as support for his “trauma” after the discovery of the wife’s alleged infidelity. By the same token, in SB’s own evidence, she acknowledges the husband’s presence in supporting her to establish a new life during the “turbulent” period of her own marriage when she was living separately from her partner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     At its very core, as a result of their own respective difficulties and challenges, they found support (and perhaps comfort and solace) from and with each other. The husband found joy in the company of another woman who was not the wife. It may not give rise to legal (or perhaps even moral) culpability, but it does gives an insight on the closeness between them, as evidenced in the surveillance report. Such closeness includes, from the documentary evidence, in the form of holding each other’s waist whilst walking<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> and their closeness whilst having meals<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>. The husband may assert that there is nothing sinister or morally culpable with his behaviour with SB, but as I had observed earlier, his behaviour with SB is a further manifestation of the underlying reality of his perspective of the marriage and how he viewed the wife. To that end, I was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the husband’s interactions with a woman who was not the wife was, at best, peculiar, and at worst, improper and unacceptable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Should the marriage be dissolved?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     When taken in its totality, and following the comments made in <em>Marriage, Spouses and Assets</em> I highlighted above (see paragraph 77 above), I was of the view that the conduct highlighted by the wife would make it unreasonable to expect her to continue marital cohabitation with the husband. In my judgment, for all intents and purposes, and to varying degrees and different points in time, the husband’s behaviour is indicative of someone who has all but given up on the marriage, and wishes to move on with his life. As noted earlier, his resistance is his subjective belief that he wishes to end the marriage only on his terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The wife’s alleged infidelity</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     For completeness, and whilst I note that this was not the husband’s pleaded case (because the husband did not file his pleadings), I found it apposite to make some provisional observations regarding the husband’s allegations of the wife’s infidelity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     I had earlier highlighted (see paragraph 39 above) that the husband had filed a notice of intention to refer to, <em>inter alia</em>, the papers filed by the wife in OSG 96. In those papers, the wife does refer to a relationship in 2016 which apparently ended in 2019. At the trial, I asked the wife about this, and she acknowledges that she was “close”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> with the husband’s brother-in-law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     To that end, even if a finding of adultery were to be made (which, for clarity, I do not make), I have my reservations whether the husband would be able to address the limitations set in section 95(5) WC given when the affair took place and subsequently ended. Even if I were to find that the wife had committed adultery, it does not change the fact the husband’s own behaviour rendered it unreasonable for the wife to be expected to continue marital cohabitation with the husband. Put another way, the wife’s alleged adultery, assuming if proved, does not wipe away the husband’s own conduct towards the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     For the above reasons, I granted the wife’s application for the marriage to be dissolved. On the issue of costs, after hearing Mr Segeram, I ordered that the husband pay the wife costs of an incidental to the hearing of D 4670, with such costs fixed at $12,500 (inclusive of disbursements). For completeness, I had also given the usual consequential directions for parties to file the necessary documents in respect of the ancillary matters.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Collectively, the children are referred to as “Children”).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>For completeness, the WC was amended pursuant to the Women’s Charter (Amendment Act) 2022 (the “Amendment Act”).

In February 2025, she applied for <em>additional child maintenance</em> of <em>$840</em> against the Husband: MSS 369/2025 (“<b>MSS 369</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Husband objected to the Wife’s application on two grounds. <em>First</em>, he “suspected” that the son was not his. <em>Second</em>, he was already paying maintenance pursuant to MO 528 and there was thus no need to pay further maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After hearing the evidence, I decided to order the Husband to pay $650/month for the son’s maintenance. In this judgement, I will provide my reasons for this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">No variation to the daughter’s maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Before explaining my reasons, I wish to touch very briefly on the daughter’s maintenance for completeness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In MSS 369, the Wife did not adduce any evidence to show that there had been a material change in the daughter’s circumstances or that the child’s maintenance in MO 528 is inadequate. This is not surprising, given that (a) the daughter is still very young (only about two years old, born in August 2022) and (b) her maintenance was ordered just about six months ago.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Accordingly, in addressing MSS 369, I saw no need to vary my order in MO 528 that the Husband is to <em>pay the Wife</em> $200 for the daughter’s food and groceries: see 2024 Decision at [10] to [17]. This order was made on the basis that the Husband is to <em>himself cover</em> two of the daughter’s expenses (instead of making payment for them to the Wife). These are, <em>first</em>, the costs of the daughter’s diapers (2024 Decision at [18] and [19]), and <em>second</em>, her childcare fees after the funds in her Child Development Account (“<b>CDA</b>”) has been depleted (2024 Decision at [21]). Presently, these fees stand at about $339/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the Husband is liable to maintain the son</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Thus, for the purpose of MSS 369, I focussed on whether it is appropriate to order the Husband to pay maintenance for the son. I begin with the Husband’s submission that he is not liable to maintain the son because he “suspects” that the child’s father is someone else.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Observations in the 2024 Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is useful to note that the Husband had made a similar submission in MSS 1306. My response to this submission is contained in the following observations in the 2024 Decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">32    With regards to the Husband’s [submission that he could not be sure that the unborn child is his], the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>First</em>, the Husband does not deny that he had sexual relations with the Wife during the period when the unborn child was conceived, i.e., April 2024. There is no evidence that the Wife had sexual relations with any other man during this time. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that the Husband is the unborn child’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>Second</em>, s 114(1) of the Evidence Act 1893 is relevant. It provides that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Where any person <em>was born</em> —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(a)    during the continuance of a valid marriage between his or her mother and any man; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-4\">(b)    within 280 days after the dissolution of the marriage, the mother remaining unmarried,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-4\">it is <em>presumed</em> that the person is the legitimate child of that man, <em>unless the contrary is proved</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-4\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Section 114(1) presumes that a man is the father of a child if it <em>is born</em> within a prescribed period. Strictly speaking, s 114(1) does not apply in the present case because the child which the Wife is carrying has not been born yet.

According to him, he would spend $200/month for the daughter’s food and snacks. In my view, this amount seems to be excessive – given that (i) the daughter is only about two years old, (ii) the Husband’s take care of her for only half a week, and (iii) the amount of $200/month is in addition to the milk powder that he is paying monthly: see item [30(f)]. Accordingly, I reduced the amount for item [30(e)] from $200 to $100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item [30(j)] – Since March 2025, the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home and has been renting a room of his own. The figure of $450 in item [30(j)] is derived by deducting the costs of renting the room ($1,050: see Exhibit C3) from the rental income that the Husband receives from letting out a room in the home ($1,500).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Item [30(p)] – According to the Husband, he gives $1,200/month as allowance to his parents. The Wife disputes this, claiming that he has in fact been siphoning this amount from the matrimonial assets. I wish to make clear that in factoring item [30(p)] into the computation, I make no finding whether the funds were in fact given to the Husband’s parents. I have included this item purely for the purpose of assessing whether the Husband can afford to pay the son’s maintenance at $650/month – <em>assuming that</em> he pays $1,200/month to his parents. I will leave it to the judge hearing the ancillary matters relating to the parties’ divorce to determine the issue raised by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Item [30(q)] – In his statement filed on 8 April 2025 (Exhibit R1), the Husband stated that he had taken loans from three banks. He however did not state how much he must repay monthly. The figure of $1,000 is based on his evidence during the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     From [30] above, it appears that after deducting his monthly expenses, the Husband has a <em>cash</em> balance of <b><em>at least </em></b><b>$695.52/month</b>, if not more. I say “at least” because it is not disputed that for –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Item [30(b)] – The mortgage ($1,978/month) is paid from the Husband’s CPF accounts – and not in cash.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Item [30(g)] – The childcare fees ($339/month) can be paid from the daughter’s CDA. This account is presently managed by the Husband. The child is now over the age of two. Under the Baby Bonus Scheme, there will be a top up of $400 every six months into her CDA until she is six and a half years old: see [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     If one were to exclude the Husband’s mortgage payment (because it is not paid from his monthly income), he will have <b><em>at least </em></b><b>$2,673.52/month</b> balance each month. In my view, the Husband can afford to pay to the Wife a sum of $650/month for the son’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Accordingly, I ordered that the Husband is to pay <b>$650/month</b> to the Wife for the <b>son’s maintenance</b>. This sum is to be paid into the Wife’s <b>UOB account xxx666</b> by the <b>15<sup>th</sup> day of each month</b>, <b>commencing</b> from <b>June 2025</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Before concluding, I wish to briefly address a point raised by the Husband. According to him, the Wife is making a “double claim” by asking him to cover the costs of both (1) hiring a domestic helper and (2) enrolling the children in childcare centres. The Husband submitted that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The helper can care for the son – there is no need to send him to childcare, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife should be made to choose either (1) or (2) – she should not have both.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Wife submitted that the Husband’s position is unreasonable:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife would not be able to care for the two children – a toddler and an infant – all by herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, while the domestic helper can assist with the household chores, she is not suitable for taking care of the children’s developmental needs. It is more appropriate to send them to childcare centres where there would be professionals to take care of their needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I find the Wife’s submission to be reasonable. Additionally, I wish to reiterate the following observations that I have made in the 2024 Decision at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>...</em> in addition to alleviating the Wife’s burden, a helper can allow the Wife to rejoin the workforce as soon as possible. This will provide the Wife with financial independence and the ability to have an income to maintain herself, the children and the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>...</em> the fact that the Wife has an income will also mean that there is less reliance on the Husband to finance her expenses. In other words, the Husband will also benefit from the employment of a helper.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>According to the Complainant’s Statement filed on 13 March 2025 (A1) at page 3, the Wife is “asking for fixed monthly maintenance of S$840”. This can give the impression that she is seeking child maintenance of $840 for both children.

Regarding Item (A), the Wife computed the son’s share by dividing the household’s monthly utilities ($150) equally between four persons. This results in the son’s share being $37.50. In my view, this is excessive. Logically, the adults’ share of the utilities (i.e., the Wife and the helper) ought to be higher than the children’s share (consisting of a toddler and an infant). Item (B) should be excluded. I had already ordered the Husband to pay $400/month towards the costs of getting a person to assist the Wife to care for the daughter and the newborn baby: see [2] above.My determination of $30/month for item (l) includes the expense items in [18(a)] and [18(f)].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>See https://www.babybonus.msf.gov.sg</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>The Husband’s monthly income can be found in Exhibit R1 pages 27 to 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Based on [(a) + (b) + (c)] divide by 6.(a)Six months of annual bonus component [i.e., $17,936.70 divide by two] (b)Six months of AWS component [i.e., $6,138 divide by two](c)Six months’ income from October 2024 to March 2025 [i.e., $38,313]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>This is based on the average of the Wife’s “net wage” reflected in her income slips from September 2024 to February 2025.

She also gave evidence about a tracker which she says the Husband had planted on her, as well as a camera which the Husband had placed in the living room in a rattan box.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife also highlighted what she says is a pattern of escalating verbal abuse on the Husband’s part in the weeks leading up to this trial, which includes a text message that the Husband had sent on 24 Feb 2025 where he had allegedly tried to get her to have sex with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       As to what constitutes continual harassment, that is usefully summarised in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">37    To prove family violence under the “continual harassment” limb, the following must be established:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.[note: 22]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    The respondent has carried out the continual harassment with the intention or the knowledge that it is likely to cause “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness – to the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Courts have recognised repetitive conduct that causes worry, emotional distress or annoyance as coming within the scope of “continual harassment” under limb (d): see e.g., Yue Tock Him v Yee Ee Lim <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a> at [33].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Examples of continual harassment include the repeated use of vulgarities (<em>XFL v XFM</em> at [38]), entering the applicant’s room numerous times despite being aware that the applicant was not comfortable with this (<em>XEN v XEO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32386-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 94</a>), and repeatedly texting an applicant and sending sexually explicit and humiliating pictures (<em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [13]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While the cases provide a flavour of what might constitute continual harassment, it goes without saying that the assessment of whether there had been any continual harassment in a given case is necessarily one that must be ascertained based on the facts and taking into account the context of those acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the present case, I found that the Husband had indeed committed family violence (specifically, continual harassment) by planting the tracker in the Wife’s handbag so as to keep tabs on her whereabouts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband did admit to planting the trackers – his reason is that he wanted to know where the Wife would go. In his words:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Husband:    Because she never tell me where she goes alright. She goes out without telling me and whenever I go home, alright, the, you know, the house is always in a mess and I was wondering, you know, as a housewife why the house is always in a mess, what have you been doing at home? Where do you go? Okay. So, I---as a husband, the husband, right, I think every husband would want to know where the ha---the wife go to and if the wife never---refuse to tell me, to tell the husband, of course the husband, you know, feels insecure and wants to find out very soon what’s going on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     While one may be able to understand the Husband’s anxiety at not knowing the Wife’s whereabouts – at the end of the day, a key element in the assessment of whether there had been continual harassment is whether the respondent <b><em>knew</em></b> that such an act would cause anguish, or was likely to cause anguish to the family member concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In the present case, I found that the Husband knew that planting the tracker was likely to cause anguish (<em>ie</em>, annoy) the Wife. This is because at the time the tracker was planted, relations between the Wife and the Husband were strained. The Husband did also acknowledge that the Wife might be distressed if she discovered the tracker.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The Husband also stated, in his own words, that the Wife would get easily distressed and “triggered” over minor incidents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Given the Husband’s knowledge of the Wife’s disposition, and her emotional state of mind given this period of elevated tensions between the both of them, it was clear to me that he would know that planting the tracker was likely to cause her anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having found that there was an act of family violence committed – I turn next to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO. This is essentially a risk assessment where the court considers the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence against the applicant in the future. Some factors that the court will consider include: the reasons for the family violence, whether the family violence is a recent occurrence, and whether there are any material changes in circumstances: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In the present case, I did not find it necessary to order a PPO. It is clear that this dispute arose out of the deterioration of marital relations between the parties. Parties did not have healthy ways of communicating with each other, expressing their needs and desires, and this torpedoed efforts to find common ground and rekindle the love that they must have once had.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     That being said, parties are going for counselling in an attempt to resolve their differences. To that end, the Husband did express his commitment to continuing with counselling sessions in the hopes of salvaging the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Husband had also stated and expressed his desire to keep the family together despite the fact that the Wife has commenced divorce proceedings in the Syariah court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> He also stated that since the Wife discovered the tracker, he has not attempted to keep tabs on her whereabouts, nor had he attempted to plant other trackers in her handbags.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This suggested, to me, that the Husband had reflected on the impact that his actions in planting the tracker had on the Wife, and had taken steps to change his behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Given the points that I have sketched out above, I arrived at the conclusion that the risk of the Husband committing family violence against the Wife, in the future, was low and the circumstances therefore did not justify the need to order a PPO. In particular, I gave weight to the fact that the Husband genuinely wanted to save the marriage and appeared to be actively taking steps to repair his relationship with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I therefore dismissed the Wife’s application in SS 2327. Given that the Husband did not seek costs, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to the Women’s Charter 1961 in this judgment are references to the version in force before 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript, p 34, lns 16 – 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript, p 34 at lns 29 – 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript, pp 34 – 35.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript, p 38, lns 8 – 10.

This is an application by the Father to vary 2 existing court orders on 3 aspects; firstly regarding access to the child, secondly regarding the disposal of the matrimonial home, and thirdly regarding maintenance to be paid for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Of the original orders, the first was issued in January 2020, and this order was about the custody care and control, as well as access of the child. The second order was issued in March 2020, and this order dealt with disposal of matrimonial assets and maintenance of the child. Under this order, the Father was to pay a monthly sum of $1,750.00 for the maintenance of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both orders were made by consent of parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In July 2024, the Father filed an application to vary the terms of the orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In December 2024, the matter came for hearing before me. The Father’s counsel appeared on his behalf. The Mother represented herself. I heard both sides. I interviewed the child and ascertained his wishes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 21 February 2025, I issued my decision via a registrar’s notice. I made orders on all 3 issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Regarding access to the child, I made an order mostly to reflect his preferences and to suit his living arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On the disposal of the matrimonial home, I dismissed the Father’s prayer for interest on his share of the matrimonial home. I ordered costs in the Father’s favour to be deducted from the Mother’s share of the sale proceeds. I made orders to facilitate the carrying out of the sale of the home as ordered in the original order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On maintenance, I ordered the Father to pay to the Mother a monthly sum of $1,200.00 as the cash portion of child maintenance. I also ordered for the following expenses to be shared equally with the Mother:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_1\"></a>1.     Tuition / enrichment classes; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_2\"></a>2.     Year-end school expenses, including school uniform, school bags, textbooks and school shoes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father appeals against only the portion of my order regarding maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In the original order of March 2020, the parties had consented that the Father to pay a monthly sum of $1,750.00 as maintenance for the child of the marriage. For the avoidance of doubt, the monthly sum of $1,750.00 payable by the Father, consists of 70% of the Child’s monthly expenses (i.e. by salary ratio) which consists of the following items:</p> <table

It was something agreed to by both parents at the time of the original order. I do not find evidence that the relative means of the parents have changed significantly enough to warrant a change in their respective shares. I do not find that the figure is beyond the Father’s means. On the Father’s argument that he will be having more access time with the child, I find that the relative amounts of time spent by the child with either parent cannot yet be specified. The child will be in polytechnic, and he is able to travel independently. During my interview with him, he envisages spending time with each parent depending on where he would be.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Regarding tuition and year-end expenses, at the time of the hearing, the child has not yet obtained a place in polytechnic, so the fixed expenses he will incur were not known. However, tuition and year-end expenses are occasional and not dependent on time spent with either parent. I agree with the Father that it is fair and just for each parent to bear the child’s tuition and year-end expenses equally. I depart from the 70% share for the Father for this item because I find that it is fair and just to do so in view of the Father bearing the child’s polytechnic and university expenses solely.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial Proceedings – Ancillary Matters"],"date":"2025-05-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1550 of 2022","title":"XMU v XMV","citation":"[2025] SGFC 58","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33280-SSP.xml","counsel":["Yap Teong Liang (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the applicant","Tan Keng Loon Clarence (UniLegal LLC) for the respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-05-23T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Patrick Tay Wei Sheng","html":"<root><head><title>XMU v XMV</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XMU <em>v</em> XMV </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33280-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 58</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 1550 of 2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Patrick Tay Wei Sheng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Yap Teong Liang (T L Yap Law Chambers LLC) for the applicant; Tan Keng Loon Clarence (UniLegal LLC) for the respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XMU — XMV </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial Proceedings</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ancillary Matters</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Patrick Tay Wei Sheng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The husband is a citizen of Singapore. The wife is a citizen of China. They married in 2018 and have no children. They fell out in or around 2022, and the husband commenced these proceedings for divorce that same year. Interim judgment of divorce was granted in 2023, and the ancillary matters of this divorce came before me for hearing. I upheld a pre-nuptial agreement between the spouses dated February 2018 that ringfenced several assets that were owed solely by the wife from division in a divorce between the spouses. I thus found that the value of the pool of matrimonial assets in these proceedings was $936,000 and divided it 55:45 in favour of the husband. I also declined to order any spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These decisions were rendered on 14 November 2024. On 27 November 2024, the husband wrote to the court expressing his intention to file an appeal against these decisions but stating that technical difficulties were preventing him from doing so. With the consent of the wife, the time for the filing of the appeal was extended, and the husband filed the appeal on 17 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I now provide my reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">2018 Agreement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the 2018 Agreement,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> which related to several assets that had been acquired by the wife before the marriage. These assets comprised three bank accounts in the sole name of the wife (two with DBS Bank and one with Citibank) that had a total value of $1,966,613 at the time of these proceedings as well as four apartments in Shanghai, China for which no valuation was provided. For convenience, I refer to these assets as the “disputed assets”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Apart from these assets, the 2018 Agreement covered a company that the wife had incorporated in 2016, which was two years before the marriage. This company operated two businesses: the sale of medical devices and the conduct of education on medical aesthetics services. For convenience, I refer to this company as the “medical device company”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The 2018 Agreement prescribed that the disputed assets and the medical device company “shall NOT form part of the Parties’ matrimonial assets liable to division whether during the course of the marriage or upon the breakdown of the marriage” (see clause 11 of the 2018 Agreement). It confirmed that the wife was the “sole owner” of the medical device company and that all proceeds therefrom including “investments made/assets acquired and/or income derived from the Company and/or investments” were likewise excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets (see clause 12 of the 2018 Agreement). It recorded that each spouse was at liberty to deal with his/her pre-marital assets “including any subsequent asset derived [there]from” and that “any subsequent increment in value” of the pre-marital assets were likewise excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets (see clause 13 of the 2018 Agreement).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The husband asked me to disregard the 2018 Agreement because it had been “procured under coercions and/or duress and in bad faith.” He explained that it had been sent to him for his review only two days before the wedding, and that he had been coerced into signing it because “he had no other choice as preparations for the wedding etc was already done”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> The wife replied that the 2018 Agreement should be upheld because the process by which it had been entered into was fair. First, she had asked the husband to seek independent legal advice on its terms prior to the marriage. Second, she had proposed to postpone the marriage had the husband required more time to consider its terms. Third, she had invited the husband to propose an addendum its terms even after the marriage, and he had declined to take up this invitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Pursuant to s 112(2)(e) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “Charter”), the court in dividing matrimonial assets may consider any agreement between the parties on the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets. Specifically, a pre-nuptial agreement that relates to the division of matrimonial assets between a set of spouses falls within the ambit of this provision (see <em>TQ v TR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0961.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 961</a> (“<em>TQ v TR</em>”) at [73]). Still, the task of the court in dividing a pool of matrimonial assets remains that of apportioning the fruits of the marriage in a just and equitable manner. Hence, the weight to be attached to a pre-nuptial agreement will depend on the circumstances of the case. Some factors that the court may consider in the matrimonial assets include the fairness of the process by which the pre-nuptial agreement had been reached and any pressure that one spouse had exerted on the other in the reaching of the pre-nuptial agreement (see <em>UKA v UKB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22133-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 779</a> at [21]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the outset, the 2018 Agreement provided that it would be governed according to the law of the People’s Republic of China and required the spouses to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chinese courts in resolving all disputes and claims arising thereunder (see clause 17 of the 2018 Agreement). Upon my directions, the wife obtained and the husband did not challenge a legal opinion by a Chinese solicitor on the effect of this clause. The Chinese solicitor opined that the Chinese courts “generally uphold pre-nuptial agreements when dividing assets, giving full effect to clear terms and respecting the written stipulations agreed upon by the parties.” Specifically, save that a Chinese court would not exercise jurisdiction over assets located outside of the geographical territory of China, “it is highly likely that clauses 11, 12, and 13 of the [2018 Agreement] would be deemed valid and enforceable” and that “These clauses conform the legal provisions regarding asset division and protection within marriage under Chinese legislation”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Based on this legal opinion and given that the husband had submitted to the matrimonial jurisdiction of the Singapore courts in commencing the divorce proceedings in Singapore, I found that the 2018 Agreement was a relevant factor in the these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     As for the weight to be placed on the 2018 Agreement, I agreed with the wife that the process by which it had been entered had been fair. First, the husband had two full days to consider the 2018 Agreement but simply insisted that the wife was “being unreasonable and ridiculous” in putting it before him. Second, the husband had been urged to take independent legal advice before signing the 2018 Agreement but did not make any effort to seek such advice. Third, the husband could have delayed the wedding until after he had reviewed the 2018 Agreement but went ahead to enter into it. Fourth, the husband had a further opportunity even <em>after</em> the wedding to propose an addendum to the 2018 Agreement but declined to avail of this opportunity. I could not therefore agree with the husband that his entry into the 2018 Agreement had been procured by coercion, duress, or bad faith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The window that the husband had to review the 2018 Agreement had also to be considered in the context of the wider relationship between the then-spouses-to-be in respect of the business endeavours of the wife. The medical device company had been incorporated in 2016 with its entire shareholding issued to the husband. Four days later, the husband executed a declaration of trust that stipulated that the wife had the beneficial ownership of those shares.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Eleven months thereafter, the husband transferred the legal title of those shares to the wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Even as the husband served as a nominee director in the medical device company in the time that followed, he did so without any legal or beneficial interest therein. In this way, the then-spouses-to-be had structured the business to ringfence to the wife the title to and proceeds from the medical device company. As the husband admitted, he had despite his nominee directorship not been involved in the operations of the of the medical device company until he lost his job in “early 2018”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The ringfencing of the medical device company to the wife through the 2016 Trust was consistent with the roles that the then-spouses-to-be played in the medical device company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The 2018 Agreement ostensibly extended this ringfencing of the assets of the wife to survive an irretrievable breakdown in the marriage of the spouses. Thereunder, the ownership of and proceeds from the medical device company were ringfenced to the wife. Thereunder, too, the disputed assets, which comprised the bank accounts into which the proceeds from the medical device company had been paid as well as other assets that had been owned solely by the wife, were likewise ringfenced to the wife. In isolation, the two days that the husband had to review the 2018 Agreement may not have been a generous window. But in the context of the longstanding ringfencing to the wife of the medical device company and its proceeds, that window and the wider process by which the 2018 Agreement had been entered were generally fair. Consequently, it was just and equitable to uphold the 2018 Agreement and thereby exclude from these ancillary matters the medical device company and the disputed assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Valuation of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The matrimonial assets of significance, as set out in the Facts and Positions’ Sheets filed by each spouse, were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The matrimonial home (and the loan thereon);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The husband’s ice cream business;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The husband’s paintings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The husband’s Mercedes Benz E200 car;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The husband’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) balances;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The wife’s collection of luxury goods;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The wife’s Porsche 911 car; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The wife’s CPF balances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Matrimonial home and loan thereon</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The matrimonial home was an apartment in Singapore that was held in the name of the husband. The wife initially submitted that it had a market value of $950,000 but subsequently argued that it had a value of $1,080,000. The husband submitted that its market value was $858,000, and, in any event, no more than $950,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To support the figure of $1,080,000, the wife adduced a valuation report from a firm of property valuers that was dated 20 September 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The valuers had compared the matrimonial home with similar properties that had been transacted in comparable localities. But the valuers did not conduct any site inspection of the premises. Instead, they based their valuation on photographs and floor plans of the premises as well as the fact that the premises had been renovated in or around 2021 at a cost of $254,481.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In my view, the valuation of $1,080,000 by the valuers on 20 September 2024 was a reasonable estimate of the market value of the matrimonial home. This was the most up-to-date estimate of its market value and represented a fair value that could be realised from its sale. Indeed, the submission of the husband that the matrimonial home had a value of $950,000 was not far from this figure. Given that a sale of the matrimonial home would inevitably incur expenses that would reduce its eventual proceeds, I used $1,000,000 as its value in the pool of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     It was undisputed that the outstanding loan on the matrimonial home was $369,510. The net value or equity of the spouses in the matrimonial home was thus <b><u>$630,490</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Vehicles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The spouses owned a car each. The husband owned a Mercedes Benz E200. The wife owned a Porsche 911.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For the Mercedes Benz E200, the husband submitted that it had a market value of $133,800 and an outstanding loan of $77,830. The wife did not dispute these figures. The equity of this car in the pool of matrimonial assets was thus <b><u>$55,970</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     For the Porsche 911, the wife estimated, and the husband did not dispute, that it had a value of $250,000 as at September 2023. But the husband pointed out, and that wife did not dispute, that two months later, the Certificate of Entitlement of the car (the “COE”) was renewed at a cost of $140,000. The husband thus submitted that the car had a value of $400,000 at the time of these proceedings, which approximated the sum of the $250,000 value of the body of the car and the $140,000 fresh COE. The wife, however, maintained that the value of the car was $250,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As Choo Han Teck J observed in <em>VQF v VQG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30984-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 4</a> at [1], the date for ascertaining the pool of matrimonial assets is the date of the interim judgment, which dissolves the marriage. On the other hand, the date for valuing the assets and liabilities in that pool of matrimonial assets is typically the date of the hearing of the ancillary matters. Nevertheless, bank account balances and CPF account balances are be valued as of the date of the interim judgment. For such money accounts, the economic fruits of the marriage are the monies in the accounts rather than the accounts themselves. The quantum of the monies that represent the fruits of the marriage crystallises when the marriage is dissolved through the passing of the interim judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The interim judgment in these proceedings was granted in May 2023. At that time, the Porsche 911 comprised the body of the car and a soon-to-expire COE. The best estimate of the value of this car body and COE as at the hearing of the ancillary matters was $250,000. That, after the interim judgment, the wife had renewed the COE at a further expenditure of $140,000 was akin to her acquisition of a fresh asset <em>after</em> the marriage had been dissolved. Such an asset would not have been acquired “before the marriage” or “during the marriage” and could not therefore be a “matrimonial asset” within s 112(10) of the Charter. This was especially when the $140,000 expenditure appeared to have been paid by the wife other than from the matrimonial assets. The fresh COE, as distinct from the body of the car, could not therefore fall within the pool of matrimonial assets in these proceedings. The value of the Porsche 911 in the pool of matrimonial assets was thus <b><u>$250,000</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Remaining matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The remaining matrimonial assets were the CPF balances of each spouse, a collection of luxury goods that belonged to the wife, the husband, an ice cream business that was owned and operated by the husband, and two paintings that belonged to the husband. Apart from those CPF balances, however, there was a paucity of evidence on the values of the remaining matrimonial assets. This paucity was consistent with the manner that the spouses had ordered their financial affairs: each operated their own enterprise and each acquired their own possessions, as seen in their execution of the 2018 Agreement and the proposal by the wife that the husband, like her, put forward a list of his assets that were to be insulated from division in the event of a divorce. In these circumstances, it was just and equitable to have the spouses retain each of these remaining assets that were in their respective names and exclude these remaining assets from division in these proceedings. Still, if I was mistaken in so excluding from division these remaining assets, I set out my observations on their values.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s paintings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the two paintings that belonged to the husband, the wife valued them at $5,000. The husband offered no value of his own on these paintings but submitted that they should in any event be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets because they were gifts from a friend. But no evidence was provided to support the fact of such a gift beyond the bare assertion of the husband. These paintings thus appeared to be matrimonial assets with a value of $5,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Each spouse’s CPF balances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The husband had a CPF balance of $111,824. The wife had a CPF balance of $0. These figures were not in dispute. I accepted these figures accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s luxury goods</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The luxury goods collection of the wife comprised bags, jewellery, and a coffee table. The husband submitted that the value of these luxury goods totalled $669,500. To support this claim, the husband adduced photographs of these items as well as receipts for four of the bags: a Dior pink saddle bag, a Dior white saddle calf bag, and Chanel bag, and a Birkin 25 gold bag. The wife replied that the value of these luxury goods was far less than $669,500 estimate provided by the husband. She claimed that the only items of value were the four bags that the husband had identified as well as a Birkin 30 blue bag with a value of $10,000 and a Van Cleef Arpels rose gold ring with a value of $1,500. She added that that the remaining items that the husband had identified were replicas without value and that the coffee table had been damaged and was likewise of limited value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the four bags for which the husband had identified, the wife made the following specific submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Dior pink saddle bag had been gifted to the wife’s mother as a birthday present while the marriage subsisted and no longer existed in the pool of matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Dior white saddle calf bag was a matrimonial asset; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Chanel bag and the Birkin 25 gold bag had been sold for $3,600 and $27,000 respectively, and that these proceeds were matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, it was convenient for the wife to claim that her collection of luxury goods comprised replicas without value apart from the four bags that the husband had identified, the Birkin 30 blue bag, and the Van Cleef Arpels rose gold ring. The husband had itemised the luxury goods (and their values)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and adduced photographs of most of these items. But the very nature of replicas made the authenticity of each item impossible to ascertain from photographs alone. Further, the values that the husband had ascribed to each item were based on his research on the internet, and did not appear to factor in the wear and tear on the items. Moreover, even though the wife did not expressly argue as such, it was uncertain which of these items had been purchased with proceeds from the medical device business and thus excluded from division in these proceedings pursuant to the 2018 Agreement. Still, insofar as the photographs depicted authentic luxury goods, it was incumbent on the wife to prove that they were replicas or were otherwise without value. With only bare assertions to that effect from the wife, I would observe that the value of the collection of luxury goods was likely closer to that put forward by the husband than that put forward by the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s ice cream business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The ice cream business of the husband had been incorporated before the marriage of the spouses. Although the husband owned the entirety of the shareholding of the ice cream business, it was not in dispute that the wife had invested at least $10,000 into the business during the marriage. The husband submitted that these investments were in “donations”, but regardless of the nature of the transfers, the monies went to the improvement of the business by financing marketing and operating expenditures.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The ice cream business was thus a matrimonial asset within s 112(10)(a)(ii) of the Charter, and the husband did not appear to contend otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     On the affidavits in these proceedings, apart from a profit-and-loss statement of the ice cream business that had been exhibited by the husband, there was little evidence on the value of the business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Still, as the husband admitted in his submissions, the business was a profitable one that earned “about $4,000 to $5,000 per month”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Annualising these figures would give a profit of at least $48,000 and possibly up to $60,000 each year. This was a stream of earnings that was not insubstantial. In all probability, such profits would have produced a business with significant value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Conclusion on remaining matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Ultimately, the evidence in these proceedings showed that the wife had a substantial collection of luxury goods while the husband had a substantial ice cream business that earned $48,000 to $60,000 each year. Taking account the likely values of these assets as well as those of the husband’s CPF balances and the husband’s paintings, and given that the spouses had throughout the marriage ordered and operated their financial affairs independently, I found it just and equitable to exclude from the pool of matrimonial assets and have each spouse retain in their own names respectively their CPF balances, the wife’s collection of luxury goods, the husband’s paintings, and the husband’s ice cream business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Based on my findings above, the pool of matrimonial assets had a value of approximately $936,460. This comprised the equity of in the matrimonial home ($630.490), the value of the Porsche 911 ($250,000), and the value of the Mercedes Benz E200 ($55,970).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The husband contributed $621,665 to the acquisition of these matrimonial assets. This sum comprised his contributions to the purchase of the matrimonial home ($238,093 in cash and $133,121 in CPF contributions), the renovation of the matrimonial home ($194,481), and the acquisition of the Mercedes Benz E200 ($55,970). The wife contributed $410,000 to the acquisition of these matrimonial assets: $100,000 towards the purchase of the matrimonial home, $60,000 to the renovation of the matrimonial home, and $250,000 to the acquisition of the Porsche 911. In my view, the renovation expenses were direct contributions to the acquisition of the matrimonial assets because the renovations that resulted were extensive and contributed to the eventual valuation of the property (see [15] above). The ratio of the spouses’ direct contributions to the purchase of the matrimonial assets was thus approximately 60:40 in favour of the husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     For the indirect contributions of the spouses towards the acquisition of the matrimonial assets, I noted that the marriage was a short one of only five years’ duration, the spouses had no children, and the spouses worked throughout the marriage. I assessed these indirect contributions of the spouses at 50:50.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Taking the average of the ratios of direct contributions and indirect contributions, a fair and just apportionment of the pool of matrimonial assets was 55:45 in favour of the husband. I so ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given the assets at the disposal of the wife after the marriage, especially the assets that had been ringfenced by the 2018 Agreement, the wife was well able to support herself. No maintenance for her was therefore necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As for the husband, there was no suggestion that he was incapacitated within s 114 of the Charter. There was thus no reason to order the wife to maintain him after the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The pool of matrimonial assets, which had a value of $936,460, were thus divided in the proportions of 55:45 in favour of the husband. To promote the amicable resolution of these matters, I encouraged the spouses to endeavour to agree on the mechanics of implementing this order of division. They were at liberty to apply for orders on such implementation were such agreement beyond them.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>1WAOM327</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>H’s Subs at pp 13–14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>W’s Subs at pp 13–15</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Junhe Opinion at [5], [7], [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>1HAOM14</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>1HAOM324</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>H’s Subs at p 12</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>NE 25/9/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Valuer’s Affidavit dated 17/10/2024</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>H’s Subs at pp 7-8</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>1WAOM24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>2HAOM at Annex C</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>H’s Subs at p 10</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Probate – Duties of Executors and Trustees – Duty to Account – Testamentary Expenses"],"date":"2025-05-15","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OSP 20/2024","title":"XLX v XLY and another","citation":"[2025] SGFC 51","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33272-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff acting in person","Defendants acting in person."],"timestamp":"2025-05-22T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Shobha Nair","html":"<root><head><title>XLX v XLY and another</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XLX <em>v</em> XLY and another </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33272-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 51</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OSP 20/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">15 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Shobha Nair </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff acting in person; Defendants acting in person. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XLX — XLY — XLZ </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Probate</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Duties of Executors and Trustees</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Duty to Account</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Testamentary Expenses</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">15 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Shobha Nair:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The plaintiff and defendants are siblings. They appeared in person for these proceedings. The defendants are the executors and trustees of their late mother’s estate. They obtained probate in July 2015. The plaintiff sought the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A fair and accurate statement of accounts relating to his late mother’s estate; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Timely execution of probate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The defendants provided accounts to the plaintiff after the application was filed. I found the information provided after such filing to be a fair and accurate account of the status of the estate of their late mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Given that no order was necessary in relation to the provision of accounts, I directed only that the defendants provide to the plaintiff his share of their late mother’s estate. There was considerable delay in the distribution of assets in no small part attributable to litigation between the parties over the ownership of 2 immoveable properties, namely, a HDB shophouse and a private residential property (immoveable properties). The ownership of these properties became an issue only after the parties’ father passed away in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As the hearing progressed, the main issue between parties appeared to be in relation to the amount the plaintiff stands to receive from his mother’s estate after testamentary expenses are paid. I had when issuing the orders, alerted them to the order of distribution so as to facilitate understanding. The plaintiff appeals against the orders made on the prayers sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The parties’ mother passed away in July 2013. She had executed a will which named the defendants as her executors and trustees. Much of the estate of their late mother was left to the first defendant including her share in the HDB shophouse and the private residential property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The grant of probate was obtained only in 2015 as the second defendant had a challenging pregnancy and took steps to obtain an order only after her child was born. A schedule of assets was filed which did not reflect the mother’s share in the HDB shophouse and the private residential property. This was because the properties were held by their parents and the plaintiff as co-tenants and they believed that the right of survivorship applied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The parties’ father passed away in June 2019. The first defendant was named the executor and trustee of his father’s estate. In the father’s will, he had stated that his share of the HDB shophouse and the private residential property were to be given to the first defendant. All other assets were provided to either the first or the second defendant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> From the tenor of the father’s will, the defendants began to understand that the parents never intended the plaintiff to benefit from the properties and that the HDB shophouse was being held by the plaintiff on trust for his parents. The defendants then filed an amendment to the schedule of assets for the mother’s estate to include her share of the 2 properties. This gave rise to a separate set of proceedings in HC/S 793/xxxx (S 793) as the defendant disputed the position. The court in S 793 found that the plaintiff held the HDB shophouse on trust for his parents and he was ordered to transfer interest, title and rights in the same to the defendants as executors and trustees of their mother’s estate and to the first defendant an executor and trustee of their father’s estate. In relation to the private residential property, the plaintiff was similarly ordered to transfer his rights in the property to the estates of their parents. Upon such transfer, the estates were to pay to the plaintiff the monies that were paid by him towards the 2 properties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It was only in late 2023 that the transfers were effected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In relation to their late mother’s estate, the second defendant and the plaintiff stood to inherit a relatively small part leaving the bulk to the first defendant. More particularly, the plaintiff stood to inherit only the monies in 2 Citibank accounts totalling $42 614.33.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Have the defendants provided a fair and accurate account?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As executors and trustees, the defendants owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, an important aspect of which is the duty to keep accounts and to provide beneficiaries with the same when called on to do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> This duty is a continuous one.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> If an order is made for the taking of accounts either on a common or wilful default basis, the process is distinct and Rules 684-686 of the Family Justice Rules (2014) would need to be complied with and consequential orders made arising from the taking of such accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The defendants had in their affidavit in reply<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> provided a table accounting for the assets collected, the date and the value of such collected assets, the expenses incurred and payable from the estate including the date of payment of such expenses and the assets not called in as yet.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> I was satisfied that this was a fair and accurate statement of accounts. The plaintiff disagreed but, in his affidavit, it was unclear as to why he took issue with the information produced. During the hearing however, he provided positions as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That there are several assets which were not put into the schedule of assets. He did not however identify those omitted assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That he paid towards the price of the immoveable properties and that should not be written as a debt. The order by the court in S 793 however speaks of the need for the defendants to reimburse from the estates, the amounts paid by the plaintiff towards the properties in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the legal costs arising from the lawsuit in S 793 should not be included as it related to the estates of both parents. I did not agree with this as both estates formed the subject matter of the lawsuit and the issue of the rights of both estates was inextricably linked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     That item 3.2 in the table provided by the defendants should reflect a figure of about $6 000. The defendants explained that this was a sum in a joint account held by their father and the first defendant and that the law of survivorship enabled the surviving account holder to keep this money, thus explaining the nil value.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     That item 8 should indicate a surrender value when the defendants had indicated that no value was in fact obtained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     That item 9 should state a value. It was explained that this item referred to a MSIG insurance policy and they had not heard from the insurance company at the time of this hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_g\"></a>(g)     That item 11 should have a value ascribed. This too related to a policy with AVIVA Ltd. and for which no information had yet been received.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_h\"></a>(h)     That the values of the 2 immoveable properties should be reflected. The 1<sup>st</sup> defendant is entitled to his mother’s share in these properties and the values are reflected in the table.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i\"></a>(i)     That no documentation of testamentary expenses have been exhibited. There is reflection of the total amount incurred supported by invoice numbers and correspondence, although it is accepted that the full set of invoices have not been produced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Are the defendants in breach of timely execution of probate?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In relation to the second prayer for the timely execution of the probate, I agree that the defendants in their fiduciary capacities need to act in a timely manner to ensure that all beneficiaries receive their shares of the estate. Having said that, it was noted that Clause 3 of the will of their late mother allowed for the defendants to postpone the sale, calling in and conversion of assets without being responsible for any loss occasioned by that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I do not believe there was an intention to avoid providing the plaintiff with his entitlement. At Clause 3 (I) of the will, all the money in their late mother’s Citibank accounts were to be provided to the plaintiff. The amounts that are contained in the Citibank bank accounts are known. The defendants have set up an estate account but no beneficiary has received his/her share yet. As the plaintiff did not seek the removal of the defendants as executors and trustees or any alternative means of obtaining his rightful share, seeking only for timely distribution of the assets, the defendants were directed to act on distribution immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I accepted that the lack of timely distribution was largely on account of the fact that the passing of their father in 2019 opened up concerns about the plaintiff’s rights to the immoveable properties. The parties were locked in litigation over the ownership of the immoveable properties which was concluded only about 6 months prior to the instant application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The actual dispute - unaddressed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Even as the plaintiff sought to identify by means of oral submissions, his areas of contention with the accounts provided and for an order that the defendants act on probate obtained, what he appeared to in fact be asking for is his entitlement to the entire sum of $43 614.33 found in his mother’s 2 Citibank accounts. In fact, the distributable amount in these accounts have increased to $43 819 as evidenced in the table produced by the defendants.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>The defendants however were of the view that it ought to be reduced on account of the net value of the assets of the estate excluding the 2 immoveable properties from the asset pool. Given the testamentary expenses indicated to be $138 112.50 which sum included legal costs arising from previous litigation, they argued that it had to be shaved off the gross value held in their late mother’s account which they say total $316 665.42, leaving a net balance of the estate to be distributed at only $178 552.92. They stated that they were advised by their lawyers that the gross value of the estate should not include the immoveable properties as the properties were not immediately available for distribution.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> It was their position that the plaintiff’s entitlement to $42 614.33 which represents 13.46% of the gross value of the estate (excluding the immoveable properties) would therefore result in only an amount of $24 028.24 of the net value of their mother’s accounts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I had when issuing my decision alerted the parties to what appears to be at the heart of their dispute. While it appears from the plaintiff’s application and supporting affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> that he wanted a fair and accurate statement of accounts and timely distribution of the assets, he appears to in fact be taking issue with the defendants’ position that the immoveable properties should not be brought into the equation when determining the net value of their late mother’s estate.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> If it were included, the net value of the assets would be significantly increased. I repeat the observations I made when issuing my decision:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Although the plaintiff had sought a fair and accurate account of the estate, the underlying dispute appears to be with regards the exact entitlement of the plaintiff. This is outside the ambit of the prayers. Parties are to refer to s 57 of the Probate and Administration Act, 1934 (PAA) which provides for the manner of administration of assets and in particular s 57(4) of the Act which provides:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <em>“Where the estate of a deceased person is solvent his estate shall, subject to the Rules of Court and section 58 as to charges on property of the deceased, and to the provisions, if any, contained in his will, be applicable to the discharge of the funeral, testamentary and administration expenses, debts and liabilities payable thereout in the order mentioned in the Second Schedule”.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Where there then is deficiency to meet the interests of all beneficiaries, it would be up to the party who says he has clear priority over other beneficiaries to show why this is so from the wording of the testator’s will or other evidence. As the plaintiff has not sought nor made any submissions with regards priority or in its absence, how the distribution is to be borne, the Court can make no further orders.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The order of application of assets where an estate is solvent is provided in the Second Schedule of the PAA as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Property of the deceased undisposed of by will, subject to the retention thereout of a fund sufficient to meet any pecuniary legacies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Property of the deceased not specifically devised or bequeathed but included (either by a specific or general description) in a residuary gift, subject to the retention out of such property of a fund sufficient to meet any pecuniary legacies, so far as not provided for as aforesaid.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Property of the deceased specifically appropriated or devised or bequeathed (either by a specific or general description) for the payment of debts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Property of the deceased charged with, or devised or bequeathed (either by a specific or general description) subject to a charge for the payment of debts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The fund, if any, retained to meet pecuniary legacies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Property specifically devised or bequeathed, rateably according to value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Property appointed by will under a general power, rateably according to value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h\"></a>(h)     The provisions shall also apply:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The order of application may be varied by the will of the deceased; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Schedule does not affect the liability of land to answer the death duty imposed thereon in exoneration of other assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     If the defendants take the position that the value of the immoveable properties called in should not be added to the pool from which the testamentary expenses are to be deducted, leaving therefore an insufficient amount in the account for all specific legatees to receive their entitlement, they would need to make an application for such determination. Indeed, the classification of the gift to the plaintiff as a specific legacy may in itself be subject to challenge. Conversely, if the immoveable properties are agreed to be brought into the pool for distribution but there is still an insufficiency to meet all the claims of the beneficiaries, there needs also to be a determination of the correct reduction for each beneficiary proportionate to the net value of the estate. The parties were somewhat limited by a lack of legal representation to advance their cases. In any event, the prayers sought were not in line with what was at the heart of the dispute. The parties are open to file an application for consideration of the issue under appropriate legislative provisions if they are not in agreement on the order of distribution. At this time, the defendants cannot decide unilaterally to hold on to the plaintiff’s share unless and until the plaintiff agrees to accept a smaller sum. There is significant guidance on how assets are to be marshalled to meet the entitlement of legatees, the issue of priority of claims and circumstances which may lead to reduction or even abatement of claims.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Appropriate prayers would need to be drafted, and submissions made if this remains unresolved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The statement of account provided by the defendants is a fair and accurate one. The legal costs incurred by the defendants for the lawsuit to determine the entitlement of their late mother to the immoveable properties forms part of the expenses to be discharged before distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The transfer of the plaintiff’s interest in the immoveable properties had taken significant time to be effected, largely on account of the litigation surrounding the status of the immoveable assets. Additionally, information relating to 2 insurance policies remain outstanding at the time of the hearing. None of the beneficiaries have received their share of the estate. The defendants have been directed to act on the probate and provide the plaintiff his entitlement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Even as the plaintiff sought for an account and the timely execution of probate, the real dispute for which an order was not prayed for nor adequately argued centred on whether the plaintiff was entitled to the full sum in the Citibank accounts. Any dispute with respect to this issue would necessitate further steps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Each party was ordered to bear his/her own costs for these proceedings. Parties acted in person, had filed one affidavit each and did not address the core concern. Even if a court is minded to provide direction to parties in person to facilitate presentation of their cases adequately and in so doing, achieve closure, it needs to be mindful of its primary role, which is to adjudicate disputes. The plaintiff appeared to be asking the court to inform him of what the law is with respect to the order of distribution of estate assets. There are various arguments that can be mounted insofar as the position parties took on this issue. It would be wrong for a court to make a decision without understanding the reasons for the position each took and the law they base those positions on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Given that the amount in question is relatively modest, I would encourage parties, and particularly the plaintiff, to agree to mediation, a step he declined when offered at an earlier case conference.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Clauses 3A and B of the will.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>FC/P4092/xxxx.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Pages 23-25 of the defendants’ affidavit filed on 14 October 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Schedule of Assets (Amendment No.1) filed on 3 March 2020 in DCP 4681/xxxx.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><b><em>Lalwani Shalini Gobind &amp;

To that end, any orders which are made, are made with only one purpose in mind, and that is to protect. These orders, for example, a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) or the Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) are not meant to punish Respondents to such applications, and that much is made clear by the jurisprudence of the Family Courts (for example, see the case of <em>WSD v WSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SS 2420/2024 (“SS 2420”) was the Wife’s application for a PPO for herself and the two children against the Husband. She also sought a DEO to exclude the Husband entirely from their residential property. The incident which formed the basis of the Wife’s application had taken place on 12 December 2024. The Husband had suspected her of cheating on him. There was an argument. In the midst of this argument, the Husband had taken a knife to threaten the Wife. The police were called. The Husband was arrested and subsequently released on bail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of the matter on 21 March 2025 and allowed the Wife’s application in SS 2420. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       An Applicant seeking a PPO must establish the following two requirements on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The first is that there was an act of family violence as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> or that it was likely that the Respondent would commit family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The second requirement is that the PPO is necessary for the protection of the family member in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In the present case, I found it likely that the Husband would commit family violence on Wife as well as the two children. The Wife had adduced text messages to show that the Husband had lost control and severely caned his son. It is clear from these text messages,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> which the Husband had sent to the Wife on the 3rd of December 2024, that he had indeed lost control and caned his son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       During his testimony, the Husband did not dispute that he had lost control. In fact, he went on to say that he estimated that he had hit his son about 20 to 30 times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Apart from this incident, in the incident on the 12th of December 2024, the Husband had admitted to stabbing the knife, which was a rather large knife (with a blade that was 17cm long),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> onto the table in a fit of rage:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"16.9%\"><col width=\"83.1%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">So, I go down and take the knife out. I didn’t hide the knife. I told the police, “You scan the knife. If got a single ounce of bath soap or anything, you catch me.” I didn’t hide the knife. I let my daughter saw but maybe she remember the wrong timing. I go down take the knife out. I pass to her. Asked her, “You want to commit suicide? Commit suicide.” She refuses. <b>She keep asking me to kill her. I got so angry, I take the knife, I stab on the table then I realised that it’s a bit dangerous. I took the knife. I asked my son to keep it.</b> My son came out, he keep---he kept the knife. Then she continued to take her eyebrow trimmer to try and commit suicide. I look at it, I thought that she is just joking, lah. The eyebrow trimmer, the blade is like maybe the size of a toothpick. It is a very small blade. I just think that she’s just joking, lah. Then I tell her, “Eh, like that won’t die one. You want to die, go and take the iron pills.” I said it as a joke.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">[emphasis added] </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is thus apparent to me from these 2 incidents, and the manner in which the Husband had described his account of these incidents, that he does have difficulty in controlling his temper, and that he is prone to violent outbursts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In addition, it is also clear that the Husband is not above resorting to means to manipulate those that he purports to love to do his bidding. He had given evidence of how he had devised means of getting the Wife to have sex with him. He would pretend to cheat on her by hiring escorts to make her jealous as he realised that if he could make her jealous, she would be willing to have sex with him. As he explained:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"20.64%\"><col width=\"79.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">As for the---as for what she said about the sex thing, when she’s angry, she cut off sex for 1 whole year. The only time that she re-established sex is when she realised that I was contacting my ex-girlfriend. And it wasn’t for any bad things. I just contacted her to say thank you for what happened 4 years ago, okay. She was so jealous that she had sex with me. So, I thought that every time I make her jealous, she will have sex with me. So, I tell her say I visit prostitute. She refuse to believe me because all the accounts, all the bank accounts are joint accounts, she have access to them and she can where the money goes. And she knows that I didn’t spend a single cent. So, I cannot be visiting prostitutes. So, I ran out on [inaudible] I thought of the best idea I can come up with, right, is just to ask my maid. Because my maid is her best friend. My maid has been with us 7 plus years. If I want to have some hanky panky with my maid, I won’t wait 7 years later, okay. As for the prostitute in Taiwan when we go on a Taiwan trip, she say that I---I go and find a prostitute. Yes, I did find a prostitute but I paid the prostitute to say that we have sex but I didn’t have sex with the prostitute. Why? Because when I come back home, she knows this very well, I have sex with her. I’m [X] years old this year, [Y] years old. I cannot have sex 2 consecutive times one. I keep telling her this now. All that I say in the past is just trying to make her jealous so that she have sex with me, and it’s true. She---she---she got so jealous, she started to started to start a tracking system to track how many time we had sex in month. So, my plan worked. You can check her phone. That is for the sex thing, I have never cheated on my wife. But it’s very difficult, I don’t know if you all can understand, that when a wife withhold sex for 1 whole year, is very difficult for a man to try to control. And this is why I come up with these funny ideas.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Apart from this, there is one other point, and that was the Husband’s need for control. It was apparent to me that the Husband was very paranoid about the possibility that the Wife may have cheated on him. The Husband spoke of how he had established a system with the Wife after he suspected her of cheating on him with his friend from the army. Under this system, he would be able to video call the Wife to check on her. And if the Wife had missed this call, she had to call him back immediately.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     That the Husband established such a system spoke volumes as to his mindset. I found it to be the case that the Husband expected the Wife to comply, and that if she did not do so, there would be consequences. Indeed, the lengths which the Husband went to, to check on whether the Wife had been cheating on him on the 12th of December 2024, spoke to the depths of his paranoia and his need for control. For example, he had asked the Wife to remove her underwear to “check for any signs of sex”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In this connection, I also believe the Wife’s account: that the Husband had indeed told her that if he could not have her, then nobody else could.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Taken together, the evidence before me painted a picture of a man who was not only controlling, but manipulative and prone to violent outbursts. It was also evident that his actions had negatively impacted those he claimed to hold most dear – the Wife’s testimony spoke to how she had tolerated his behaviour for many years, and how matters had, for her, finally reached a breaking point. This also made it apparent that the Husband had little to no self-awareness on his part. Given this, I concluded that it was indeed likely that the Husband would commit family violence on the Wife, as well as the two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     For completeness, I would add that while much was made of how the Husband may have had an underlying psychiatric condition, namely, borderline personality disorder (“BPD”), there was nothing on the evidence before me (<em>ie</em>, in the form of a doctor’s report) to indicate that this was indeed the case. That being said, I have concluded (above at [7] – [14]) that there were indeed very troubling aspects of the Husband’s personality and behaviour which pointed to the likelihood of him committing family violence on the Wife and children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I must emphasise that the law does not require an Applicant to prove that family violence had actually been committed. It suffices to show that family violence is likely to be committed, and that is set out in the words of s 65 of the Women’s Charter 1961: <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having found that the Husband was indeed likely to commit family violence, I turned to consider whether it was necessary to grant the PPO. In this vein, the law also says that once it is found that the Respondent is likely to commit family violence, a PPO is presumptively necessary: <em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [121] citing <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On the evidence before me, and leaving aside any presumption, I am indeed satisfied that a PPO was necessary to protect both the Wife and the children and that is because of the Husband’s uncontrolled displays of anger. There were, at least on the evidence before me, two examples of him doing so, in relation to him caning his son as well as him stabbing the knife onto the desk in a fit of anger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The risk of family violence, in my judgment, was further increased when one took into account the Husband’s controlling and manipulative personality.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In addition, I also found it necessary to order a DEO to exclude the Husband from the entire property. Physical separation was necessary to ensure the safety of the Wife as well as the two children. This is especially since the Husband had not only displayed a propensity for uncontrolled displays of violence, but had also told the Wife that if he could not have her, nobody else could.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I thus allowed the Wife’s application in SS 2420. In the circumstances, I also ordered that both the Wife and the Husband were to attend counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Given that the Wife did not seek costs of her application, I made no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force prior to 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Bundle of Documents at p 20.

The Respondent is 32 years old this year. The Complainant and the Respondent never married. They were in a relationship when they were teenagers but have not been in touch since sometime in 2011.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 8 May 2024, the Complainant filed an application for maintenance for her child who is 13 years old this year (the “Child”). At the start of the trial, the Respondent took the position that the Child was not his biological child. This was subsequently resolved by way of a paternity test, after which the Respondent accepted that he was the biological father of the Child. I hereinafter refer to the Complainant as the “Mother” and the Respondent as the “Father”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Having heard the parties’ evidence on 24 October 2024 and their submissions on 7 February 2025, I ordered the Father to pay the Mother a sum of $750 per month as maintenance for the Child, as well as a total sum of $6,750 as backdated maintenance for the Child. I also ordered the Father to pay costs of the proceedings fixed at $500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father has since filed an appeal against my orders relating to the maintenance payable for the Child as well as my orders relating to the backdated maintenance ordered. I now set out the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 7 February 2025, just before parties were asked to provide their oral submissions on the matter, the Father requested to furnish some documents purporting to show that the Mother was living a luxurious life, changing new cars, and carrying branded bags, including one that he said cost about $15,000. I did not allow these documents. By this time, both parties had already given their testimony on the witness stand, completing their evidence on 24 October 2024. The Father did not inform the Mother ahead of time of his intention to provide these documents, and offered no satisfactory explanation as to why he did not put forth this evidence any earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal requirements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”) provides that the court may order maintenance for a child on due proof that a parent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. In making its determination, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the financial needs of the child, and the income and financial resources of the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Mother sought payment of $750 per month as maintenance for the child. In addition, she sought backdated maintenance of $1,500 per month for a period of 200 months. The Mother estimated the Child’s monthly expenses to be about $1,900 per month, but sought $750 per month as this was what she believed the Father would be able to afford. The backdated maintenance was calculated based on what the Mother calculated to be the amount she had spent on the Child since his birth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Father objected to the Mother’s application. The Father says that he is unable to afford the maintenance sought by the Mother. The Father proposed to contribute $200 to $250 per month, being what he says is the maximum he can afford.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Child’s reasonable expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I first considered what the Child’s reasonable expenses were.

In my assessment, the Child’s reasonable expenses amounted to approximately $1,800 per month, which was not far from the figure estimated by the Mother. To explain:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I assessed the Child’s reasonably monthly expenses to be about $120 lower than that estimated by the Mother as I felt that the Child’s medical fees and clothing expenses were too high and were not supported by the objective evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the amount spent on food and groceries at $1,000 per month seemed a little high, I accepted that the Mother’s circumstances in raising the Child as a single parent may have placed certain limitations on the extent of care that she could provide for the Child, which may have consequently necessitated such higher costs. For example, not having the time to prepare home-cooked meals for the Child may have resulted in her spending more to buy meals home or to have food delivered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Similarly, I accepted that juggling two jobs may have left the Mother with less time and energies to coach the Child at home or to help him through his academic work. I therefore found her estimated expenses of $280 per month on enrichment and tuition classes for the Child to be justified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties’ incomes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I next considered the parties’ finances. The Mother worked two jobs, one as a part-time administrative assistant earning $1,500 per month, and the other from a cloud kitchen she owned, where she received a salary of $2,000 per month. In total, the Mother claims to earn an income of $3,500 per month. The Father did not dispute this. I found that the Mother’s position was more or less supported by the payslips and bank account statements she provided. I therefore accepted that she earned $3,500 per month for the purposes of this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father ran a canteen stall at a secondary school. He indicated in his statement that his monthly income was $2,500,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> but at trial he claimed to earn about $2,000 to $2,300 per month, with the latter figure being what he might earn in a “good month”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> However, this was not supported by the documentary evidence provided, and I was not convinced that the Father only earned up to $2,300 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father’s IRAS Notice of Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2024 showed that he earned $2,536.08 per month on average in the latest year of assessment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> While the Father asserted that this amount included what he earned from driving that year, he offered no objective evidence showing this to be the case. Even if this did comprise some supplementary income he earned from private hire driving, I saw no good reason why this could not continue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Further, the Father testified at trial that he paid his stall assistant about $2,400 to $2,600 per month. Again, he did not provide any documents showing this. I found it inconceivable that he would pay his employee more than he claimed to take home for himself. If this was indeed the case, he may well be financially better off working as a stall assistant instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the balance of the evidence, for the purposes of this application, I found that the Father earned a minimum monthly income of $2,500. I accordingly adopted this figure to derive the income ratio between the parties at 58% to 42% in the Mother’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Applying this ratio to what I had found to be the Child’s reasonable expenses at $1,800, I found that the Father’s share would amount to about $750 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father declared personal monthly expenses of $2,276.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> He said that he would be unable to meet the monthly maintenance payments sought by the Mother as he has various financial obligations arising from his prospective marriage and his father’s medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I did not find the Father’s claims to be made out on the evidence provided:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s declared monthly expenses included an amount of $1,000 per month as allowance for his parents. However, there was no proof that he would withdraw this amount in cash to pay to his parents each month. His mother continued to work and operate a canteen stall in the same school as the Father, and there was no proof that his parents needed or expected this much from him, considering that this amounted to more than 40% of what he says he earned. there was also no proof that his parents needed this money, particularly when his mother continued to work and operate a canteen stall in the same school as the Father. The Father also did not provide any evidence showing his father’s medical condition, or of the costs incurred by his father for his medical condition, such as to justify this amount of $1,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It was also clarified at trial that the Father’s estimates for his expenses on conservancy charges and internet, as stated in his list of expenses, were estimates for a household of four. His own share of these two expenses should therefore only be $69 instead of $276.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father also did not provide any evidence showing the extent to which his prospective marriage impinged on his ability to pay any maintenance ordered. The Father said that his flat was “coming next year”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>, but did not provide any indication of the financial outlay required, or of his partner’s ability to contribute to this undertaking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I accordingly found that the Father would be able to meet the maintenance payments of $750 per month if he were to make some adjustments to his own lifestyle and expenditure. The Mother herself would have had to make sacrifices and adjustments to her own lifestyle to meet her financial obligations, not least the expenses of the Child, who was born of both parties, but for the past 13 years has been the Mother’s sole responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As the Father had not made any financial contributions towards the Child, I found in the circumstances of the case that he had neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the Child and that it was reasonable to order that he pays the Mother a sum of $750 per month as maintenance for the Child. I ordered this to be paid on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month, with effect from 21 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     However, I did not find it appropriate to order backdated maintenance of the amounts and for the duration sought by the Mother. On the Mother’s own account, it was only in February 2024 that she obtained the Father’s contact. It appeared that it was only thereafter that she attempted to seek maintenance from him, in part motivated by her family’s financial situation. The Mother’s evidence was in fact that she could not and did not contact the Father after the Child was born, and it was not disputed that the Father had blocked her on WhatsApp and on Facebook. The Mother could have brought an application for maintenance at any time and did not satisfactorily explain why she had not done so earlier. In fact, I noted that when the parties met about three or four years after the Child was born, the Mother’s then-husband expressly told the Father to stay away from her and the Child,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> which reasonably gave rise to the Father’s impression that the Mother wanted nothing more from him in relation to the Child. I therefore did not find it fair to make the Father responsible for the expenses the Child had incurred prior to the application, where the circumstances were such that he would have reasonably assumed that the Mother did not want or require any such contribution from him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     However, despite having notice of the Mother’s intentions and of the Child’s needs since the commencement of this application, the Father did not make any contributions to the Child’s expenses, even if only of the amounts of $200 to $250 per month that he said he was able pay. I therefore ordered that the maintenance orders be backdated to May 2024, when the Mother commenced this application. Taking into account the Father’s financial resources, I ordered that the total arrears of $6,750 (being the arrears accrued from May 2024 to January 2025) shall be paid in instalments of $250 per month, payable on the 21<sup>st</sup> day of each month with effect from 21 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother sought costs from the Father of between $2,000 to $2,500. The Father objected to this, reasoning that he was unable to afford this. I found that some costs would be payable by the Father to the Mother, bearing in mind the delay occasioned by the Father’s insistence that he was not the biological father of the Child, and the fact that the quantum of monthly maintenance sought by the Mother was reasonable and ultimately aligned with what I ordered. However, I did not find it appropriate to order the full amount sought by the Mother as she was substantially unsuccessful in the bulk of her claim relating to backdated maintenance, which I did not find to be reasonable. I therefore ordered costs of $500 payable by the Father to the Mother. To give the Father more time to pay, given his new obligations, I ordered that this amount of $500 be payable by 28 February 2025.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence for the hearing on 24 October 2024 (“NE1”), p 62 lines 23 - 24</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Father’s documents filed on 2 July 2024 (“F1”), p 6</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>NE1, p 36 lines 21 - 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>F1, p 22</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>F1, p 11 - 13</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE1, p 62 lines 22 - 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>NE1, p 22 lines 9 - 12</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs"],"date":"2025-05-05","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 4805 of 2021 (Summons No 3502 of 2024)","title":"XIE v XIF","citation":"[2025] SGFC 50","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33232-SSP.xml","counsel":["Faustina Joyce Fernando, Linda Joelle Ong (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the plaintiff","Eileen Lim (OTP Law Corporation) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-05-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XIE v XIF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XIE <em>v</em> XIF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33232-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 50</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 4805 of 2021 (Summons No 3502 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">05 May 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Faustina Joyce Fernando, Linda Joelle Ong (Engelin Teh Practice LLC) for the plaintiff; Eileen Lim (OTP Law Corporation) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XIE — XIF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">5 May 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is my decision on the costs of SUM 3502/2024 (“SUM 3502”) which was the Husband’s application for discovery and interrogatories. The substantive decision in respect of the Husband’s application can be found in <em>XIE v XIF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32869-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 22</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife argues that costs should be reserved to the Judge hearing the substantive variation application in SUM 2713/2024 (“SUM 2713”). Their argument is premised on the merits of SUM 3502 being inextricably linked to the merits of the variation application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> In that vein, counsel for the Wife argues that the Judge hearing SUM 2713 is best placed to “decide if the documents and information” that the Husband had sought were necessary for the fair disposal of the variation application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In addition, counsel for the Wife also argued that she ran the risk of “severe prejudice” if she was ordered to pay costs now and the variation application in SUM 2713 was dismissed, and the hearing Judge did not “deem it necessary to consider [her] income and expenses documents”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On the other hand, counsel for the Husband argued that he should be entitled to costs given that he had succeeded in SUM 3502. However, counsel for the Husband argued that costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis, fixed at $4132.40 (all-in), as her withholding of these “standard documents and information” was “manifestly unreasonable” and had caused needless delay and wasted resources.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Husband also argues that the Wife had adopted an adversarial stance by refusing to reasonably disclose the documents sought, which necessitated the application in SUM 3502.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Costs should not, in my judgment, be reserved to the hearing Judge in the present case. I do not agree with the arguments advanced by counsel for the Wife. Their premise is that the merits of SUM 3502 are inextricably linked to the merits of the variation application in in SUM 2713. This argument, when driven to its natural conclusion, would mean that costs for applications for discovery and interrogatories, must always be reserved to the hearing Judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       That cannot be right. In assessing the merits of SUM 2713, the hearing Judge is not, as counsel for the Wife sought to suggest, assessing whether the discovery and interrogatories were indeed necessary for the fair disposal of the matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> While the hearing Judge may find, or express the view, that certain documents produced in discovery did not factor into their decision, this does not necessarily mean that the application for discovery and interrogatories had been unreasonably taken out. After all, the provision of documents and answers through discovery and interrogatories also enables the requesting party to formulate their position in relation to the substantive dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that the Husband had indeed succeeded in his application, he is entitled to costs, which I fix at $1632.40 (all-in).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> These costs are to be paid to the Husband by 9 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In arriving at this quantum, I considered the number of items sought, and that the written submissions and hearing before me were relatively short. In particular, I also took into account the fact that the Wife did have ample opportunities to make voluntary disclosure of these documents, which would not only have avoided the need for SUM 3502, but would also have facilitated mediation which may well have borne fruit. This was, in my judgment, a factor warranting an upward adjustment in the quantum of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions at para 6.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions at paras 3 – 7.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>See Wife’s Written Submissions at para 6(b) which states: “The hearing judge determining the variation application will be best placed to decide if the documents and information sought were necessary for the fair disposal of the variation application in the first place.

This application for a personal protection order (PPO) was filed by the Father on behalf of the three (3) children of the marriage, C1, C2 and C3 on 4 November 2024, at the doorstep of the hearing of the ancillary matters (AMs) fixed on and heard by me on 19 December 2024. The circumstances as to why the application was filed and the procedural history of the divorce proceedings are relevant and would be set out at the appropriate portions of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and History of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother left the matrimonial home with the 3 children on 23 May 2021. On 9 July 2021, the Father took the eldest child, C1 from his school and since then C1 has been living with the Father at the matrimonial home to date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Both Parents filed for interim care and control of the 3 children; the Mother filed her application on 11 April 2022 while the Father filed his application on 11 May 2022. Both applications were heard on 27 July 2022 with the decision rendered on 29 July 2022. The Father was granted interim care and control of C1 while the Mother was granted interim care and control of C2 and C3.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Access orders were made such that each parent was to take access of the child/children not under her/his respective care and control on alternate weekends. In line with therapeutic justice principles, both parents were asked to attend the session during which the Court delivered its decision. I explained to the parents that I was prepared to let status quo remains so as not to cause a destabilising situation for C1 in view of his near and upcoming Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE). The parents were also strongly encouraged to step away from their litigious mindset to focus on preparing C1 for the PSLE and giving him the necessary moral and emotional support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The access arrangements went on thereafter for over 1 ½ years while the case was being managed and prepared for hearing on the AMs by the case conferencing team. Sometime from February 2024, access for both parents ceased and regrettably, they have not had any access to the child/children not under their respective interim care and control since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The AMs were originally fixed for hearing before me on 23 October 2024. However, that hearing had to be converted into a case conference as the appointed Child Representative wrote in to Court to inform that he was not able to prepare his report given that he had not been able to meet up with either the Father or C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the case conference, the former counsel for the Father informed the Court that the Father would be “overseas until next year to serve God’s purposes with his body and soul”. When I enquired as to where C1 was at that time, I was informed that the Father had refused to let his counsel communicate with the Court on that. Upon the Court’s insistence and direction, counsel for the Father subsequently informed that from what he knew, C1 should be in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Given that there was some concern as to C1’s care and living arrangements (based on the information given that the Father was overseas until next year) and his emotional state, I directed that C1 be produced in Court for counselling and check-in by our Court Family Specialist on 25 October 2024 (PM). I provided instructions that C1 may be accompanied to Court by one of his school teachers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 24 October 2024 (one day before C1 was to attend before the Court Family Specialist), the Mother turned up at the matrimonial home. Both the Father and C1 were present at the matrimonial home. There appeared to be an altercation between the Mother and C1, leading to alleged injuries to C1. Less than 2 weeks later, the Father filed this present application on 4 November 2024 seeking a PPO for all 3 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The present application </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Before this Court, the Father relied on seven (7) incidents to mount the case for a PPO on behalf of the children against the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> For ease of reference, I shall use the same headings as the Father in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) in listing out the 7 incidents: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Threatened family with a knife on 3 May 2020;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Removal and restraint of the children on 23 May 2021;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     No medical attention provided to sick children on 18 February 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Self-harm and assault on 20 February 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Breaking and entering on 22 February 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Removal of C2 and C3 on 8 March 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Violence against C1 on 24 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father has two witnesses, being his mother, Madam [T] and C1.

The then section 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”) states that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>65.-(1</b>)    The Court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and that it is necessary for the protection of the family member, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Both limbs of section 65 must be satisfied before the Court will grant a PPO:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The person against whom the PPO application is made has <em>committed or is likely to commit</em> family violence; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     It is <em>necessary for the PPO to be granted</em> for the protection of the person seeking protection or the person on whose behalf the protection is sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Under the then section 64 of the WC, “family violence” was defined as:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his will; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     While the standard of proof to be applied is one of the civil standard in the PPO proceedings, the High Court in the case of <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> had emphasized (at [28]) that it is important to recognise that the protection conferred by a PPO carries with it criminal sanctions and that in light of the criminal consequences that follow a breach of a PPO, ordering one is not a decision a court would take lightly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">First incident - Threatened family with a knife on 3 May 2020</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The first incident was alleged to have occurred on 3 May 2020. The Father gave evidence that the children and he were at their flat with the Mother and the domestic helper. It appeared to the Father that the Mother was upset over matters at work and she was crying. The Mother started screaming and all of a sudden, she retrieved a knife from the kitchen. The Father told the children to quickly go into the room with the domestic helper and lock the door. According to the Father, the Mother brandished the knife and said that she wanted to “end” everyone in the family and “end everything”; he understood her to mean that she wanted to kill everyone in the family.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> While the children were in the room, the Father believed they heard the commotion outside. As the Father was trying to calm the Mother down, she verbalized that she was still young and should not be married or have children. The Mother calmed down and relinquished the knife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     According to the Father, when he checked on the children later, they were quiet and subdued. He also spoke to the Mother later that night and advised her to quit her job. The following day, the Father received a text message from the Mother asking him whether he knew why she took a knife. The Father mentioned that he did not know how to respond to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     C1 was 10 years old at the time this alleged incident happened. He testified under cross-examination that he did not remember the reason why the Mother held the knife but he did remember that she was very angry with him when he exited his room on that day. She then went to the kitchen, took a knife and then started threatening him. His father came in to protect him. As he was really scared, he took his siblings and brought them into the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> They were not aware of what was happening. He was, however, scared and could not think straight. He sat down, covered his ears and closed his eyes. Sometime later, he opened the bedroom door and peeked; he saw that his parents were still arguing and the Mother was still holding onto the knife. It was only sometime later that the Mother calmed down and they were able to leave the room.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother denied the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     While at first glance, the testimonies of the Father and C1 appear to corroborate, there are some inconsistencies which make it difficult to make a finding on the reason why the Mother had picked up the knife. If the Mother was upset over work matters and wanted to “end everything”, as the Father had said, it would be odd for the Mother to be targeting C1. According to C1, the Mother was very angry with him, went to the kitchen, took a knife and threatened him. While I accept that the Mother was clearly upset over something and did pick up a knife, given the inconsistencies, I am unable to find that she had threatened C1 with it or that she had threatened to “end everything”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On balance, I am of the view that the Father had not proven specifically that there was family violence committed against the children. Furthermore, while the parents were arguing, the children were away from them and in a room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     For completeness, I should add that even if he had so proven, I note that since 3 May 2020, the Mother remains the primary caregiver of C2 and C3 to date without any allegations of the Mother threatening to harm them. There was also a period of mutual access to the children by the Parties following the interim care and control orders made in July 2022. Unless this Court finds that the other alleged incidents disclose family violence, the Father would not have satisfied the “necessity” limb based on this incident alone. I turn now to the rest of the incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Second incident - Removal and restraint of the children on 23 May 2021</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Much was said by both Parties on the events surrounding 23 May 2021; the Mother was also cross-examined by counsel for the Father on these events and at various points, she refused to answer his questions. I informed her that I would record her as refusing to answer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is clear from the background facts and the testimonies that 23 May 2021 was the date that the Mother had intended to leave the matrimonial home with the children. The Father had received a call from his mother, Madam [T] informing him that the Mother had called and informed her that she would be taking all the children away. According to the Father, he rushed back from work to find his home “ransacked” and his safe open. Although he enlisted the help of the police, the children could not be located until the end of the June holidays when they were back in their school and kindergarten respectively.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     According to C1, on 23 May 2021, he was taken away from the matrimonial home by a male adult and a female adult whom he recognised as from his father’s office. They told him that he was to attend a special enrichment class. He was brought to a HDB flat at an unknown location. There was another male adult in the flat, known to him as [S]. He was made to play board games, and he realised that there was no enrichment class.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     When C1 saw his mother at this flat subsequently, he was told by her that he could not go back home to see his father. He tried to run out of the flat but was prevented to leave by the Mother who was grabbing his right wrist. The Mother then dragged him into the car and drove him to another HDB flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. When he was forced inside the flat, he saw that C2 and C3 were inside with their domestic helper. When he tried to run out of the flat, the Mother grabbed him by the wrist and dragged him into a room. She confined him inside and he started crying until he was tired and fell asleep.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     According to him, he and his siblings were in that flat for about a month. He was scared and did not know what the Mother would do to him or his siblings. The Mother also told him that if he tried to run away, she would call the police, and he would be in serious trouble. He recalled two occasions when his siblings wanted to go home and would be hit by the Mother; the first was when he saw both of them having red marks on their arms in the flat and the second was when he saw C2 being slapped on the face at a shopping mall. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Mother denied confining the children in her rental flat and produced photographs of the 3 children during the relevant period, showing that she had brought the children to various shopping centres and playgrounds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> She also produced some messages between herself and [S] for the period from 22 May to 25 May 2021 as a contemporaneous record of the children’s reactions when she left the matrimonial home with them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I do believe that the Mother had planned to leave the matrimonial home with the 3 children on 23 May 2021 and enlisted her friends’ help to do so. C1, being the eldest and therefore with greater understanding of his circumstances, was resistant to the idea, although the Mother had hoped that he would settle down soon to a new life with her (as seen from her text messages with [S]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Given the above context, I find it hard to find that there was any family violence committed by the Mother against the children. While the Father had, through his counsel, emphasised the deceptive manner in which the Mother had sought to take C1 away from the matrimonial home, and her evasiveness on this point during cross-examination, this does not lead to the conclusion that the Mother had committed family violence against the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In finding that there was no family violence, the Court is not necessarily condoning the acts of the Mother in taking the children away, especially C1 from the matrimonial home in the manner that she had. I agree with the words of counsel for the Father that children are often at the mercy of the warring parents and that their distress and objection towards relocation are often ignored or subordinate to the desires of the parents relocating them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> However, the remedy, when faced with a situation of a spouse leaving the matrimonial home with the children, ought to lie in the sphere of the Family Court making orders on custody, care and control over the children. Just as the Mother had taken the children away from the matrimonial home on 23 May 2021 without the Father’s consent, the Father had taken C1 away from the school on 9 July 2021 without the Mother’s consent. Both Parties filed their own interim care and control applications in this regard and orders had already been granted since July 2022, which should regulate the Parties’ affairs and arrangements in relation to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     As for the allegations by C1 that the Mother had confined and hit them whenever they wanted to return to the matrimonial home, given the contemporaneous text messages and the photographs that the Mother had produced, I am of the view that C1 had exaggerated his evidence and the extent to which the Mother had tried to prevent him or his siblings from leaving the rental flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Counsel for the Wife submitted that the evidence of C1 should be treated with caution<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, relying on the case of <em>Lee Kwang Peng v PP</em> [1997] 3 SLR 278 in which Yong Pung How CJ stated (at [62]):-</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…[I]t is well-established rule of practice in our law that where evidence is given by a child witness, that evidence is not to be accepted at face value without some measure of corroboration: see <em>Goh Liong Lam &amp; Ors</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33605-M.xml')\">[1958] MLJ 254</a>, Chao Chong &amp; Ors v PP <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33773-M.xml')\">[1960] MLJ 238</a> and <em>Ng Kwee Piow v R</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33909-M.xml')\">[1960] MLJ 278</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having heard C1 on the stand (through the video-conferencing facilities) and scrutinised his evidence with particular care, I agree with counsel’s submissions that C1 appeared influenced by the acrimonious relationship between his parents and are aligned with the Father’s views that a PPO should be granted. Through C1’s testimony, it would seem that he harboured the wrong impression that if the Court granted the PPO, this would mean that he and his siblings would get to stay with the Father; this would then teach the Mother the importance of having a family and hopefully make her change since she would get to feel what it was like not to have a family and be lonely.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> In my opinion, it is highly unlikely that C1 would have come to these views on his own without being influenced to some degree by the Father. Both the Father and C1 had expressed their hopes for the Mother to return home with C2 and C3 and for the family to be together again. That being the case, I am of the view that the Court cannot rely on C1’s evidence alone to find that the Mother had committed family violence against all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I am also not convinced that C1’s testimony is corroborated by either the police report or the medical discharge summary dated 4 August 2021. The police report was filed by C1, on the advice of the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, on 25 March 2024, nearly 3 years after the Mother left the matrimonial home with the children. As for the medical discharge summary, it merely stated “Neck pain today”, which does not prove that the Mother had caused the “neck pain”, much less a “recurring” neck pain, as alleged by the Father. C1 also did <u>not</u> mention about any recurring neck pains in his AEIC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Third incident - No medical attention provided to sick children on 18 February 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Although the Father had listed this incident in his AEIC seemingly as a failure to provide medical attention to the sick children on 18 February 2024, it would appear that his real complaint was against the Mother allegedly making a false report against him, thereby causing the police to turn up the matrimonial home and frightening the children in the process. This only became clear in the Father’s written submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to the Father, he had access to C2 and C3 on 18 February 2024 and brought them back to the matrimonial home. Upon reaching home, he discovered that they were running a fever. The children also complained of a sore throat. C2 informed him that they were sick since 14 February 2024 but the Mother did not bring them to the doctor. He brought them to see a doctor and they were prescribed medication and given six (6) days of medical leave.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     According to the Father, he had contacted the Mother and told her of the illness and medical attention but she did not respond to him. He was subsequently contacted by the police and informed that the Mother had made a police report against him, alleging that he had hurt the children. He gave evidence that later that night, about 4 to 5 police officers with “riot shields and what looked like torch lights entered [his] house and [their] bedroom, frightening the children by their sudden appearance”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It was submitted by the Father that the appearance of a team of police officers in full gear was shocking and frightening for the Children. The police officers spoke to C2 and she appeared afraid during the interaction while maintaining that she did not want to go with the Mother as the Mother was always angry and that she wanted to stay in the matrimonial home. It was further submitted that the Mother’s misconstruing the Father’s action was plainly with the intention of inducing the police to intervene and the Mother would have known that such action taken by the police would, if witnessed by the children, cause them some fear.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Given the heading as found in the Father’s AEIC, it was not surprising that the focus of the Mother was to explain that she was aware that C2 and C3 were having a cough and how she was managing their symptoms. The Mother stated that before the Father took access of C2 and C3, she had already informed him they were having a cough and gave him some instructions on the kinds of food that they should abstain from. The Mother further stated that the Father failed to return the two children that day and that he kept them with him for nearly 3 weeks. He also did not present her with the Antigen Rapid Tests upon her request.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     It was not put to the Mother that she had made a false report to the police. Given that this is a serious allegation, and she was not put on notice that this was the Father’s case against her, I am of the view that this incident cannot be used against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In any event, the “limb” that the Father appeared to be relying on is (d), that being “causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member”. Even if the Father can prove that the Mother had made a false report to the police, it is quite the leap of logic to say that she had made it with the intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the children. In fact, it was the Mother who appeared to be in some anguish herself. The Father was supposed to have returned C2 and C3 to her by 6.45 p.m. that day. The several missed calls and the text messages to the Father asking where C2 and C3 were<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> suggested that the Mother was desperate to know their whereabouts. She also stated in a text message to the Father the next day that she was “so worried about [her] children as [he] was supposed to return them to [her] by 6.45 p.m.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fourth incident - Self-harm and assault on 20 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Fifth incident - Breaking and entering on 22 February 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Sixth incident - Removal of C2 and C3 on 8 March 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I shall deal with the above incidents together as they fall within the same period during which the Father had kept C2 and C3 following his failure to return them to the Mother on 18 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43      <u>Fourth incident</u>: The Father’s case was that the Mother had come to the matrimonial home with two of her friends on this date. He was in the bedroom and heard C2 shouting that “Mama is here! Mama is here!”. When he came out to the living room, he saw that the Mother was holding onto C2’s left hand in a bid to get her to leave the flat. He instructed C2 to take C3 to the bedroom and locked the door. He then proceeded to call the police.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     According to him, the Mother seemed enraged at this point and started shouting at her. She then suddenly turned to the wall and slammed her forehead onto the wall. The Mother tried to reach the door of the room when C2 and C3 were in. The Father stood in her way; she started to grab the phone which he was using to film and his neck and also used her knee to hit his torso area. The Father stood in the doorway to prevent her from reaching the door. The Mother continued to strangle him and used her elbows and knees to hit his torso area multiple times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     When the police came, C2 and C3 were ushered out of the room. C2 told the police that “Mama came and pulled my hand away.” By her words and expression, the Father felt that the Mother’s actions caused hurt and fear to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46      <u>Fifth incident</u>: Madam [T] testified that she was at home when the Mother came with the locksmith. The Mother told her that she wanted to take the children away and tried to advance to the room but Madam [T] responded that she could not let the Mother take the children away without the Father’s consent. The police arrived shortly and when they asked C2 and C3 whether they would like to follow the Mother, they said ‘no’. The police then instructed the Mother to leave the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     C1 gave a similar account; he was afraid that the Mother would take him and siblings away so he quickly told C2 and C3 to go to their room and lock the door. The Mother was shouting at his grandmother and he told the Mother not to scold the latter. C1 pleaded with the Mother to leave them alone and not harm them. He also told the Mother to come back home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48      <u>Sixth incident</u>: On 8 March 2024, both C2 and C3 were picked up by the Mother from their respective schools before the time of dismissal. According to the Father, the Mother had told the respective schools that the children were being picked up for a doctor’s or medical appointment. The Father made a police report. He had no information on C2 and C3 until the school reopened on 18 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     To reiterate, the Father was supposed to have returned C2 and C3 to the Mother by 6.45 p.m. on 18 February 2024. She had called the Father several times to ask where the two children were. It was clear that by all accounts, the Mother had come to the matrimonial flat on 20 and 22 February 2024 in an attempt to have C2 and C3 returned to her. She could not therefore be said then to be harassing the children with the intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause them anguish. It was also unlikely that the children were placed in fear of hurt to themselves due to the Mother’s actions in turning up at the flat, though it could be emotionally distressing to them at that time. In fact, for the incident on 22 February 2024, what C1 was truly afraid of (as gleaned from his AEIC) was that the Mother wanted to take them away, leading him to quickly tell C2 and C3 to go into the room and lock the door. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Even though he also then stated that he tried to talk to the Mother and pleaded with her to leave them alone and not to harm them, he also told the Mother to “come back home”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As for the alleged removal of C2 and C3 from their school, given that the Mother has interim care and control over them, I fail to see how this can be family violence perpetuated by the Mother against them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     For completeness, I should mention that the Father had stated in his AEIC (at [9]):-</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Sometime in April 2021, the Respondent decided that she wanted to leave the family and she moved out of the Flat, leaving the Children in my care. Thereafter, the Respondent filed for divorce sometime in August 2021. Despite her leaving the Flat, I ensured that she continued to have reasonable access to the children as I believe the Children needed to have a relationship with the Respondent. However, despite having access to the Children, she repeatedly returned to the Flat, often announced and her conduct during these occasions would turn aggressive and violent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Although the Father tried to paint a picture of the Mother leaving the children under his care and of her coming unannounced to the matrimonial home and turning aggressive and violent, it is clear that this was not anywhere near the truth. She did not leave the children under the Father’s care. From the time that she left the matrimonial home, C2 and C3 had been living with her, save for nearly 3 weeks in February/March 2024 during which the Father kept them after access on 18 February 2024. As for C1, the Mother did not leave him with the Father. It was the Father who came and took C1 from his school in July 2021; C1 continued to stay with the Father to date since then. Further, the Mother had turned up unannounced at the matrimonial home during the period when the Father had kept C2 and C3 with him after his access, with the obvious reason of attempting to have C2 and C3 returned to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Seventh incident - Violence against C1 on 24 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     These are the facts which are <u>not</u> in dispute between the Parties: On 24 October 2024, as the Father and C1 were about to leave the matrimonial home, they found the Mother with a friend known also to the Father, [S] standing at the corridor leading to the lift lobby. The Mother was surprised to see the Father, having heard from her counsel that the Father was supposedly overseas. She took out her phone to start taking pictures of the Father as evidence that he had lied to the Court that he had gone overseas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     When C1 saw that the Mother was taking pictures, he came forward to either cover her camera phone or grab her phone. A struggle ensued between them, with the Mother trying to prevent her phone from being grabbed and C1 holding onto the Mother’s phone. The Father immediately took out his phone to record the incident; the video recording was submitted to Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     These are the facts that are in dispute: According to the Father, the Mother’s phone flew from her grasp in the midst of the struggle. The Mother appeared angry with C1 for this and pulled and twisted his right arm. C1 turned away from the Mother by bending slightly at his waist, and it seemed to the Father that C1 was trying to remove himself from her grasp. The Father then alleged that he saw the Mother raise her left hand and hit C1 on the back of his neck. The Father tried to block the Mother from hitting C1 further. C1 then turned around and held onto the Mother’s arms, pulling them to his waist to stop her from hitting him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Mother denied hitting C1. The Mother testified that she wanted to take pictures of the Father to present to the Court and that she was trying to protect and hold onto her phone. She explained that she had gone to the matrimonial home as she was worried that the Father “might take [C1] out of Singapore as he himself was supposed to be not in Singapore”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> Upon seeing the Father, she took a picture of him using her phone because she needed to show the Court that the Father had lied to the Court that he was not in Singapore and did not comply with the Court’s directions to have C1 interviewed by the Child Representative.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The video recording showing the struggle between the Mother and C1 and submitted to Court was about 30 seconds in length. It shows the Mother and C1 in a “tight lock” with both trying very hard to hold onto the Mother’s phone. It does <b><u>not</u></b> show the Mother hitting C1 at the back of the neck. In any event, given the background and the context, I am again hard pressed to find that there has been family violence committed by the Mother against C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In <em>AWR v AWS</em> [2011] SDGC 410, the Court found that there was family violence when the respondent snatched away the complainant’s two phones with which she had wanted to call the police and put her in fear of her own safety. In <em>AGX v AGW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGDC 0271.xml')\">[2010] SGDC 271</a>, the Court also found that there was family violence when the respondent followed the complainant and forcibly obtained her phone, when the latter refused to yield it. This case is distinguishable from the abovementioned cases as C1 was the one who approached the Mother and tried to cover her phone camera as well as grab her phone away. In the ensuing struggle, the phone did fly out of the Mother’s hand and landed on a nearby ledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Counsel for the Wife submitted that throughout the struggle, C1 was the aggressor instead.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> While not going so far as to call C1 the aggressor, I am inclined to agree that the entire struggle was initiated and caused by C1. That being the case, I take the view that he is no victim of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The Father’s PPO application is dismissed. None of the incidents relied upon by the Father justified the granting of a PPO in favour of the children, especially C2 and C3. Given C1’s testimony, it would also appear that both the Father and C1 have a misconceived notion as to what the PPO (if granted) is intended to achieve for them. The Mother is represented by counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau. I am of the view that it will be just in the circumstances for the Father to pay costs to the Director of Legal Aid. I shall hear counsel on the quantum of costs before making the order.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The orders were inadvertently left out in the extracted Order of Court; however, it is clear from the access orders that the interim care and control of C2 and C3 is with the Mother, while the Father has interim care and control of C1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>The Father alleged 8 different incidents in his AEIC.

District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff (“<b>Wife</b>”) and Defendant (“<b>Husband</b>”) are Indian nationals in their mid-40s. They were married in January 2005. In 2011, they came to Singapore, have two children, and became permanent residents. On 21 December 2022, their 17-year marriage ended with the grant of an interim judgement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Regarding the ancillary matters, the parties <em>agree</em> to the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That they shall have joint custody of the children, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That there shall be no order as to spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parties cannot agree on the rest of the ancillary matters. These matters came before me for a determination.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children – Care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I begin with the issue of the care and control of the children. The parties have –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A daughter of about 11.5 years old (D.O.B. XX December 2013).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     A son of about 6 years old (D.O.B. XX April 2019).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       By way of background, the situation regarding the children’s care and control at the time of the hearing is as follows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In June 2022, the Wife left the matrimonial home (in the Bayshore area) with the children for India. They returned to Singapore in July 2022. Since then, they have been staying in the Pasir Ris area.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In October 2022, the Wife applied for – and obtained – interim care and control of the children. The Husband was allowed to have weekly <em>supervised</em> access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In February 2023, pursuant to his appeal and by consent, the Husband was given <em>unsupervised</em> access to the children (i) every Sunday and (ii) on weekday(s) to be agreed between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In May 2023, the parties were informed that a custody evaluation report (“<b>CER</b>”) had recommended that they be granted joint custody as well as <em>“joint care and control”</em> of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In June 2023, the Wife sought a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) to protect the Daughter from the Husband: SS 1003/xxxx (“<b>SS 1003</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_f\"></a>(f)     In December 2023, pursuant to his application, the Husband was granted interim care and control of the children every Sunday (from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm), while the Wife was granted interim care and control of them for the rest of the week: FC/ORC 5379/xxxx (“<b>ORC 5379</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_g\"></a>(g)     In June 2024, the Wife withdrew SS 1003.

Each parent will be responsible for the day-to-day decision-making for the children when the children are living with him or her. The children will effectively have two homes and two primary caregivers under such an arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In assessing whether a shared care and control arrangement is appropriate, the paramount consideration is the child’s interests. The factors relevant to this consideration include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether there is allegation of family violence against the child by the parent(s)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For obvious reasons, where a parent has committed, or is alleged to have committed, family violence against his/her child, it is generally not appropriate for that parent to have shared care and control of the child. For clarity, the mere fact that one parent has a PPO against the <em>other parent</em> does not preclude a shared care and control order from being made: <em>WEM v WEN</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 247 (“<b><em>WEM</em></b>”) at [45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether both parents are equally committed to care for the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Another relevant factor is whether both parents are equally committed to care for the child. In assessing this factor, courts typically consider, for instance, whether they –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       are responsible parents,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       have been/are involved in the child’s care and development, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       have taken an active interest in the child’s life and place the child’s needs before their own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>See e.g., <em>UGQ v UGR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20965-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 125</a> (“<b><em>UGQ</em></b>”) at [39] and [41]; <em>WXA</em> at [10]; <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [62]; <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> at [18]; <em>VJJ v VJK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24683-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 57</a> (“<b><em>VJJ</em></b>”) at [37]; <em>WEM</em> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the parents are able to care for the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The extent to which the parents can care for the child is also a factor in assessing whether a shared care and control arrangement is suitable. Considerations that are relevant to this factor include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where a parent is a foreigner, can that parent remain in Singapore? If the answer is no, then courts have ordered sole care and control to the parent who can remain in Singapore: see e.g., <em>XII v XIJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33107-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 40</a> at [32] and [88].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       How will the parents juggle their work and other commitments with that of caring for the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       To be clear, the mere fact that one parent is employed full-time (Parent A) while the other parent is employed as a freelancer is not a basis for denying Parent A the benefits of shared care and control of the child. This is because “[f]ull-time employment is an ordinary part of daily life”. The more critical inquiry is whether Parent A makes time for the child: <em>XFF v XFG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32460-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 45</a> (“<b><em>XFF</em></b>”) at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       In <em>UPK v UPL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22321-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 92</a> (“<b><em>UPK</em></b>”), the court ordered shared care and control of a two-year-old child because, among others, the father <em>had a helper and his parents to help care for the child</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c-p3_ii-p4_3\"></a>(3)       In <em>XIC v XID</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32841-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 14</a> (“<b><em>XIC</em></b>”) at [9], the court denied the father’s request for shared care and control of his two primary school going children because he could not show how he would be able to care for them when (1) he had two toddlers with his new partner and (2) both his partner and him were working full-time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether the parents can cooperate within an arrangement of shared care and control</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Another factor is the degree to which the parents can cooperate with each other within an arrangement of shared care and control: <em>TAU v TAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22624-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1089</a> (“<b><em>TAU</em></b>”) at [12]; <em>WXA</em> at [9]; <em>VSF v VSG</em> [2022] SGFC (“<b><em>VSF</em></b>”) at [19] and [20]. This factor is relevant because for such an arrangement to work properly, the parents must be able to (i) discuss and agree on the child’s daily activities and (ii) ensure that the child’s daily life is seamless even when he/she switches homes: <em>XHY v XHZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32820-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 13</a> at [10].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     At this juncture, a few points bear highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the mere fact that the parents reside together – even after interim judgment is ordered – is not conclusive evidence that they can cooperate with each other within an arrangement of shared care and control: see <em>XCQ</em> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, as rightly noted in <em>XFF</em> at [6] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Although acrimony between parents is one factor that should be accounted for when considering a shared care and control arrangement, it does not automatically nullify such an option. The court has to take a close look at the facts of each case to see if a shared care and control arrangement would be unworkable because of the acrimony, and if it would be in the best interests of the children. Otherwise, parties may have a perverse incentive to increase the acrimony to gain a tactical advantage in the care arrangements of the children (<em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20688-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 213</a> at [73], [76]-[77] citing <em>AZZ v BZZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> at [40]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Thus, a shared care and control arrangement has been ordered in cases even where –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       The parties’ relationship <em>with each other</em> is acrimonious: see e.g., <em>CXR v CXQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29421-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 10</a> at [18] and [19]; <em>VJJ</em> at [27], [35] and [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       The parties disagree on the appropriate orders to be made for the child: see e.g., <em>VJJ</em> at [46]; <em>WEM</em> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iii-p4_3\"></a>(3)       The parties have different parenting styles – as such differences, which arise due to differences in each parent’s personality, can often be addressed with appropriate counselling orders: see e.g., <em>WEM</em> at [40] and [42]; <em>VSF</em> at [22], [23] and [29]; <em>VJJ</em> at [25] and [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)        <em>Third</em>, the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests: <em>CX v CY</em> [2005] SLR (R) 690 at [28]. This includes an expectation that a parent will support the child’s relationship with the other parent: <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> (“<b><em>WAH</em></b>”) at [50].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e-p3_v\"></a>(v)        <em>Finally</em>, a shared care and control arrangement will not be appropriate if the parents are <em>clearly</em> unable to even communicate with each other and compromise in making day-to-day decisions for the child: <em>XJI v XJJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32924-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 17</a> at [5]; <em>XCQ v XCP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33149-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 26</a> (“<b><em>XCQ</em></b>”) at [7].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether there has been attempts to alienate the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Another relevant factor is whether one parent has attempted to alienate the child against the other parent. If a parent has, for instance, –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       sought to remove the other parent from the child’s life: see e.g., <em>UGQ</em> at [43] to [46],</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       “methodically involved [the child] in the dispute between the [parents]”: see e.g., <em>VJJ</em> at [27], [28] and [48], or</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_f-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       restricted the other parent’s access to the child: <em>WAH</em> at [46],</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>then an order of shared care and control may be appropriate to prevent further alienation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Whether a shared care and control arrangement is likely to harm the child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_g\"></a>(g)     A shared care and control arrangement will often introduce uncertainties and disruptions into the child’s routines: <em>XFF</em> at [9]. It is important to assess the impact of such uncertainties and disruptions, and whether it will be easy for the child to live in two homes. (For instance, what is the distance that the child will need to travel between the two homes and his/her school?) This, in turn, requires a consideration of (i) the child’s age, (ii) the child’s level of maturity and independence, and (iii) the child’s needs at that stage of life. See e.g., <em>TAU</em> at [12]; <em>WXA</em> at [9]; <em>XHS v XHT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32881-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 20</a>; <em>XCP v XCQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32627-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 107</a> at [38]; <em>XFF</em> at [5].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Accordingly, a shared care and control arrangement may be appropriate if, for instance, the child (i) is adaptable to changes and (ii) will not experience significant psychological resistance if he/she is required to live with both parents on an alternating basis: <em>WEM</em> at [41]. It has been observed that a young child who has yet to commence formal education may be more suited to a shared care and control arrangement: <em>ATZ v AUA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17530-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 161</a> at [109]; <em>UPK</em> at [26]. On this note, such an arrangement has been ordered for children as young as <em>two</em> years old: see e.g., <em>WEM</em>; <em>UPK</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On the other hand, a shared care and control arrangement may not be appropriate if the uncertainties and disruptions to the child’s routines are likely to be significant. See for instance the following cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In <em>XGE v XGF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32684-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 109</a> (“<b><em>XGE</em></b>”), the court dismissed the father’s request for an order of shared care and control for his four-year-old daughter. In coming to this decision, the court noted the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i-p4_1\"></a>(1)       The mother had been the child’s primary caregiver since birth. The father had lived with the daughter only until she was about 10 months old. Thereafter, he visited the mother and daughter often until the latter was about two years’ old. From then on, the visits became rare because the father’s and mother’s relationship had broken down: <em>XGE</em> at [8], [10] to [18].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i-p4_2\"></a>(2)       The father’s proposal was for the daughter to live in two different households every three to four days. This would be too disruptive for her: <em>XGE</em> at [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_i-p4_3\"></a>(3)       The father had come from a traditional Chinese patriarchal family. The differences in the father’s and mother’s values and approaches to parenting were very severe and was a reason for the breakdown in their marriage. These differences would cause the daughter to suffer “a sense of dislocation” if a shared care and control order was made: <em>XGE</em> at [8] and [58].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In <em>XIC</em> at [9], the court declined to grant a shared care and control order because the two children (nine years old and seven years old) –</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_ii-p4_1\"></a>(1)       had been living with their mother for the past 5 years, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i-p3_ii-p4_2\"></a>(2)       did not have any overnight access with their father since he left the home when they were only three years old and one year old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_j\"></a>(j)     For completeness, the mere fact that a child shares a <em>closer bond with one parent</em> is not a bar to a shared care and control arrangement. This is especially so when the reason for such a bond is because that parent had unilaterally removed the child from the matrimonial home: <em>WEM</em> at [48].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Sole care and control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     If a shared care and control arrangement is assessed to be inappropriate, then a court will have to determine which parent should be granted sole care and control of the child. On this issue, the relevant considerations have been discussed in detail in <em>XDZ v XEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a> (“<b><em>XDZ</em></b>”) at [14] to [16]. To summarise, they include the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>The parents’ past and present interactions with the child</em>. For instance, which parent (i) has been showing greater concern, interest and responsibility for the child, (ii) has been his/her primary caregiver, (iii) has a stronger bond with the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>The parents’ future caregiving arrangements</em>. For instance, which parent (i) can provide better care for the child, (ii) can provide him/her a more secure and stable home environment, and (iii) is more willing to promote a healthy relationship between the child and the other parent? It is also important to consider the child’s wishes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Adverse considerations</em>. For instance, does any of the parent have an unhealthy lifestyle or outlook which may affect his/her ability to make rational decisions for the child? Has any of the parent acted in a way to intentionally or knowingly harm the child’s interest?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Other considerations.</em> Finally, continuity of living arrangements is an important factor for a child’s emotional well-being. Siblings should generally not be separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">CER’s recommendation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In assessing which option – a shared care and control order <em>or</em> a sole care and control order – better serves the child’s interests, a judicial interview with the child and/or a CER can be useful: <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<b><em>WKM</em></b>”) at [34], [60], [62] to [64], [67], [68], [72] and [74].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     This brings me to the CER’s recommendation in the present case – i.e., that the parties be granted “<em>joint</em> care and control” of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     What weight should be given to this recommendation? The parties took polar positions on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to the Husband, the recommendation should be accepted because there was no material change in circumstances to suggest that it was unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife disagreed. After the CER’s recommendation was disclosed to the parties (in May 2023), a PPO application was filed (in June 2023). The application alleged that the Husband had committed family violence on the Daughter from September 2022 to 28 May 2023. The maker of the CER would not have known of such violence, especially those committed around May 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After considering the matter, I declined to rely on the CER’s recommendation as a basis for deciding on the issue of care and control of the children. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <em>First</em>, I accept the Wife’s submission that the maker of the CER would not have known of the family violence allegedly committed by the Husband – especially those committed around May 2023. It is unclear whether the maker will still recommend “joint care and control” for the children if such information had been made to him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, the CER’s recommendation is somewhat dated. It was made about two years before the hearing. In view of this, I called on the Divorce Support Specialist Agency (“<b>DSSA</b>”) which was working with the parties and the children to provide an update on the family situation. The update did not touch on the PPO application. It did however state the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Daughter continued to have struggles with how to perceive the Husband’s communications,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     She was not yet comfortable to meet him more regularly at his home, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     (On a more positive note) the father-daughter relationship was improving.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether shared care and control is appropriate</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I will now apply the considerations in [8] and [9] above to the present case. My analysis is as follows.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"6.48%\"><col width=\"27.72%\"><col width=\"65.8%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Factors</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Considerations</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(1)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whether there is allegation of family violence against the children by the parent(s)?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – Yes, there was a PPO application against the Husband for having committed family violence against the Daughter.

According to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties would have discharged roughly <em>equal</em> indirect <em>non-</em>financial contributions during the marriage given that the domestic helpers had assisted with the domestic chores, and the Husband’s parents had assisted to supervise the helpers and to look after the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband’s financial contributions had allowed the Wife and children to enjoy a high quality of life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Given the above, the Husband submitted that the apportionment of the indirect contributions should be in the ratio of 30 (Wife) to 70 (Husband) because he had made significantly more indirect <em>financial</em> contributions which improved the quality of the family’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Having set out the parties’ position, I will now state my findings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Direct contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Regarding the parties’ direct contributions, I note that the difference between the Husband’s computation ([34(a)(i)]) and the Wife’s computation ([34(b)(ii)]) is <em>negligible</em> – a mere difference of 2.41%.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> Adopting a broadbrush approach, I apportion the parties’ direct contributions at <b>25% (Wife)</b> and <b>75% (Husband)</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions – Husband’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Next, I turn to the indirect contributions. The Husband had submitted that “<em>more emphasis</em> should be placed on indirect <em>financial</em> contributions, rather than indirect <em>non</em>-financial contributions”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I am unable to accept this submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband’s approach gives <em>undue</em> emphasis to indirect financial contributions over indirect non-financial contributions. Not all indirect contributions can be measured in dollars and cents. This does not however mean that such contributions are any less significant. Take, for instance, the fact that the Wife had gone through IVF procedures. I find the Husband’s submissions – (i) that “undue focus” should not be given to this “<em>minutiae</em> of family life” and (ii) that he had supported the Wife in the IVF procedures <em>by paying for them</em> – to be insensitive and unfairly diminish the side-effects and sacrifices that she had to go through to produce two children for the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, while it is undeniable that the Husband’s financial contributions had allowed the Wife and children to enjoy a high quality of life, I have serious doubts regarding his claim that he had paid “over 90%” of the family expenses. The Husband had failed to provide any proof for such an arbitrary claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the mere fact that the Husband earns a higher income than the Wife does not mean that her financial contributions towards the family are insignificant. In this regard, the following bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband did not disprove the Wife’s evidence that she had paid for some of the household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Given that her income is significant ($9,782/month), it is plausible that the Wife could have made substantial financial contributions towards the household and other expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       This is especially so when the Husband has significantly (about five times) more matrimonial assets in his sole name than the Wife: see [23(b)] and [23(c)]. This suggests that the Husband would have channeled a significant portion of his income into savings and investments – and not just for paying all the household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     There is another aspect of the Husband’s case that I have difficulty accepting. This relates to his submission that the parties would have discharged roughly <em>equal</em> indirect <em>non-</em>financial contributions during the marriage: see [38(a)] above. I am unable to see how this could have been the case given that <em>between the two of them</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife is the primary caregiver for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife probably played a larger role in managing the household. The Husband is the Executive Director of a large local bank<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> whereas the Wife works as a senior software developer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> Comparing the nature of their respective job, the Husband would likely be spending more time on his work than the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_43-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Wife was “more relaxed” about her career prospects. According to the Husband, this was because he had a stable career. This is consistent with the Wife’s evidence that she had sacrificed her career development to focus on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Indirect contributions – Assessment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Based on the evidence, it appears that the parties had made contributions in their own way to ensure the well-being of the family – the Husband by providing financial stability, and the Wife by focusing on managing the children and the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Taking a holistic view of the factors in [37], [42], and [43] above, I find that the Wife and Husband had made <em>equal</em> indirect contributions to the family. Accordingly, I apportion their respective share of indirect contributions as <b>50% (Wife)</b> and <b>50% (Husband)</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Ratio for division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Considering both their direct and indirect contributions, I find that the matrimonial assets should be divided in the ratio of <b>37.5 (Wife) and 62.5

As such, the applicant has to show that he/she needs maintenance from the date prior to the application for maintenance or ancillary hearing;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Second, the applicant should give reason(s) for the delay in seeking maintenance for the child/children. Not making interim maintenance to save costs is a good reason in explaining the delay (<em>TG v TH</em> (see above: [14]) at [43]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    Third, income and expenses of the parties in the past (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> (see above: [16]) at [12(b)]) and whether circumstances have changed since;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[…]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Fifth, potential savings in costs, time and resources in having maintenance for children dealt with in the ancillary hearing, instead of having a separate hearing for interim maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[…]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    Sixth, the detriment caused to the parent in default if backdated maintenance is ordered (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> (see above: [16]) at [12(c)]-[12(d)]). It is not difficult to appreciate why this might be the case. On the backdating of an order, the payer is instantly in arrears in respect of the payments due prior to the claim for maintenance. The payer might not have the means to pay, or if he does, at the cost of hardship to himself;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    Seventh, an order for maintenance is an order of court. If the parent in default does not pay, he/she potentially faces committal proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(h)    Eighth, difficulties or hardship that the applicant faced in trying to meet expenses prior to the claim for maintenance. These were alluded to by Kan Ting Chiu J in the High Court case of <em>AJE v AJF</em> (see above: [16]), who there described an extreme situation of hardship (see above: [16]) (at [27]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">If the [applicant] had to incur debts or sell possessions to make up for the shortfall in maintenance, that would be a strong ground for backdating the maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">But in some situations, the applicant faces no hardship. The applicant might have in fact been maintained the child with income from other sources beside his/her own. This was the concern Kan J expressed in <em>AJE v AJF</em> (at [27]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">[I]f the [payee] had been able to had been able to manage…, back-payment would be a windfall, and the case for backdating would be weaker.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    Ninth, the length of the period for which maintenance for the child is claimed, and whether the applicant sought maintenance from the parent in default to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Applying the above principles, I declined to backdate the maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, there is a genuine dispute as to whether the Daughter’s enrolment into an international school for academic year 2024 was in accordance with what the parties had planned for her. It would not be fair to expect the Husband to pay for the fees in such a school – especially when they involve a significant amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_63-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, enrolment in an international school is a good-to-have and not a must-have. There is no evidence that the Daughter would have been deprived of a proper education in Singapore by virtue of being enrolled in a local school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Before concluding, I note that the Husband has an outstanding costs order for $5,000 arising from HCF/DCA 125/2023 (heard on 22 April 2024). One year after it was made, this order remains unsatisfied. There is no confirmation as to when the Wife would satisfy the outstanding costs order. In the circumstances, pursuant to the Husband’s application, I order that the sum of $5,000 be deducted from the Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Finally, I make no order as to costs as this stage of the proceedings. If the parties wish to make costs submissions, they are to inform the court within two weeks of the date of this judgement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>_____________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u>Annex A–1</u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>MONTHLY EXPENSES – DAUGHTER [11.5 YEARS OLD]</b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"6.02%\"><col width=\"25.8%\"><col width=\"22.72%\"><col width=\"22.74%\"><col width=\"22.72%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Expense item</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife’s computation ($)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband’s</b> </p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>computation ($)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_90\" id=\"Ftn_90_1\"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span></b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court’s decision ($)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Enrichment – </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) Science – $400</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) Mathematics – $175</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) Gymnastics – $665</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(d) Tennis – $400</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(e) Swimming – $200 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,500</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Wife did not seek the Husband’s consent to enroll the child in these classes</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"right\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">575</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Items (a) and (b) are academic subjects.

This evidence has not been discredited.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_39_1\" id=\"Ftn_39\">[note: 39]</a></sup>The parties’ submissions regarding this item can be found in Plaintiff’s Reply Submissions dated 04.04.25 at [54] and [57(50)]; Defendant Father’s Written Submissions dated 25.02.25 at [72] to [77]. The Husband submitted that the Wife had dissipated the sums of $5,250 and $13,450. He relied on the presumption of dissipation (<em>UZM v UZN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a> (“<b><em>UZM</em></b>”) at [67] and [68]) to support this submission. I am not persuaded by the Husband’s submission. For the presumption in <em>UZM</em> to be applicable, there must have been a disposal of (a) a significant amount of matrimonial asset (b) at a time when divorce is “imminent”. In <em>WQG v WQF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31045-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 13</a> at [2] and [3], the High Court declined to infer that a transaction that had occurred about two months before a divorce was intended to deplete the matrimonial pool. In the present case, the two sums of $5,250 and $13,450 are not significant. In any event, Husband had failed to show that at the time of their disposal, the divorce was “imminent”. I agree with the Wife that the Husband’s submission of dissipation is based on conjecture and fanciful. He had failed to prove his allegation.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_40_1\" id=\"Ftn_40\">[note: 40]</a></sup>I am mindful that there were certain brief periods when the Wife was not working.

The Mother also applied for the Father to surrender the child's passport to the Mother or to her solicitors forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Mother alleged the Father had unlawfully removed the child from her lawful custody in China and eventually brought the child into Singapore. He had also refused to return the child to the Mother though she was granted custody of the child by the Chinese Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Pending the final determination of OSG 77, the Mother filed for an injunction in Summons No 1903/2024 to prevent the Father from bringing the child out of Singapore without the Mother’s written consent or an Order of Court. An injunction was granted to prevent both parties from removing the child out of Singapore without the consent of the Court or the written consent of the other parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 7 November 2024, the Father filed Summons 3478/2024 (“Summons 3478”) for orders that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_I\"></a>I)     The parties have joint custody of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II\"></a>II)     The Mother have care and control of the child, on the condition that the Father shall have liberal access, including overnight and overseas access, to the child as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Regular Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_a\"></a>(a)       On weekdays, the Father have access on at least two weekdays a week, with specific timings to be mutually agreed by parties in writing and in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_b\"></a>(b)       The Father have access during the weekends, from Saturday after lunch to Sunday after lunch, with specific timings to be mutually agreed by parties in writing and in advance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>Specific Access</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_II-p3_c\"></a>(c)       In addition to the regular access, both parties shall endeavour to celebrate the child’s birthday together as a family at such date/time to be mutually agreed in writing and in advance.

Having considered parties’ evidence and submissions, I granted the Mother sole custody, care and control of the child solely for the purpose of having the child return to China, that the Father shall take all required steps to facilitate the handing over of the child to the Mother and shall surrender the child’s passport to the Mother or to her solicitors within 7 days of the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Pending the handing over of the child, I ordered that the injunction issued against the Mother be discharged and made a further order to prevent the Father from removing the child out of Singapore without consent or approval of the Court or the written consent of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having made the order in OSG 77, I dismissed the Father’s applications in Summons 3478 and awarded costs against him on both applications. The Father has since appealed against the whole of my decision in OSG 77<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. I now set out the reasons for my decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The parties were married in China on 30 March 2016. A child who was born in January 2019 in China and was 6 plus years old when OSG 77 was heard. The parties and the child were Chinese citizens.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The parties filed for divorce in China which was heard by the People’s Court of Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, China (“First Instance Court”) on 26 June 2023. The First Instance Court did not make its decision immediately and deferred it to another day. Pending the decision, the Mother alleged that the Father took the child away forcefully from her on 28 June 2023. The Father denied doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 7 August 2023, the First Instance Court granted the divorce and ordered, amongst other things, that the child “shall be raised and educated” by the Mother. The following were the court’s findings<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Considering that [the Child] is only more than 4 years old, still young, and has endless dependence on his mother, it shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by [the Mother]. Therefore, [the Child] … shall be raised and educated by [the Mother].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Dissatisfied with the decision, the Father appealed to the Intermediate People’s Court of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China (“Appellate Court”). The Appellate Court, whose decision is final, upheld the decision of the First Instance Court on 23 November 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother subsequently found out that the Father and the child came to Singapore on 11 December 2023 based on a copy of the child’s Visit Pass issued by the Singapore Immigration and Checkpoint Authority. The Mother had not seen the child from 28 June 2023 till 11 December 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Consequent to the Father’s failure to comply with the two Court decisions, the Mother applied for enforcement of the court orders against the Father. A Written Decision of Detention dated 9 February 2024, and a Written Decision of Enforcement dated 27 February 2024 were issued by the Court of First Instance and the Appellate Court respectively. In the Written Decision of Detention, the Court decided that the Father be detained for 15 days for the non -compliance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. In the Written Decision of Enforcement, the Appellate Court issued an order to prevent the Father from leaving the country and cancelled his travel documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Despite these orders, the Father still did not return the child to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Further, on 8 April 2024, a Notice of Order to Fulfil was issued against the Father by the Appellate Court to hand over the child’s identity card and travel documents to the Mother for safe keeping<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. According to the Father, by this time he was no longer in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Mother filed OSG 77 on 18 June 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 9 September 2024, the Father filed an application in another court in China, the Hangzhou Xihu District People’s Court (“Hangzhou Court”) for the right to raise and educate the child to be granted to him<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> . The application was still pending when OSG 77 was heard. To date, the child remained in Singapore with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother was represented throughout the proceedings. The Father was also represented during the pre-trial proceedings but chose to act in person just before the hearing of both applications.

She had taken care of him full time from birth on 22 January 2019 to the year 2022. He was still young and dependent on her as his mother and that it would be in the child’s best interest and more conducive for his development that he be raised and cared for by her as the primary caregiver. She informed that the child had lived for most of his life in China and would benefit from her looking after him in an environment he is familiar with. She disagreed that he should be uprooted from China to settle down in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     She contended that the Chinese courts has awarded her sole custody of the child. The Father has never discussed with her and that she has not given consent for the child to be taken out of China. She also contended that having sole custody, care and control of the child is in line with the Chinese’s Court’s findings and decisions. The child also has a strong support system with her as well as with her father, a retired civil servant, who is living with her and willing to assist in taking care of and raising the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Before being taken away by the Father, the child was studying in kindergarten and could resume in an environment he is familiar with. The Mother works as an insurance agent and event planner which gave her autonomy and flexible working hours to enable her to tend to the child’s day to day needs including ferrying the child for his daily activities. This is despite her busy schedule. She has also enrolled the child in various other classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     She informed that she is more than willing to let the Father be a part of the child’s life and upbringing and willing to facilitate access in accordance with the law<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. She also offered to discuss the issue of access with the Father, but he has been avoiding the matter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Father only reached out to her via WeChat after the application was filed by her. As for the video calls sessions he arranged for her with the child, the timings were not suitable as they coincided with the child’s play time. She denied the Father’s allegations that she is the cause of the tension in the marriage and that in reality, the Father was engaged in extra-marital affair and neglected the family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The judgment of the 1st Instance Court Mother was relying on <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     With regards to the issue of custody, the following were the relevant parts of the judgement given by the 1<sup>st</sup> Instance Court on 7 August 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The focus of the dispute in this case lies in the issue of child’s custody, that is, (name of child)’s custody. Through the evidence adduced by both parties and the court investigation, the court notes that both the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as their parents, have great care and love for (the child), and that the parties have inseparable feelings for their child. Considering that (the child) is only more than 4 years old, still young, and has endless dependence on his mother, it shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by (the Mother). Therefore, (name of child), the legitimate son of the parties, shall be raised and educated by (the Mother) and the defendant shall pay the plaintiff a monthly maintenance of CNY 3,000 until (the child) lives on his own. Accordingly, as per Article 1079, Article 1084, Article 1085 and Article 1087 of the Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China, the court hereby makes the following judgments:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">1.    (The Mother), the plaintiff, and (the Father), the defendant, are granted divorce;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    (The Child), the legitimate son of both parties shall be raised and educated by (the Mother), and (the Father) shall pay child’s support of CNY 3,000 before the 15th of each month from the month when the judgments take effect until (the child) independent life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The judgment of the Appellate Court the Mother was relying on </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On the same issue of custody, the following were the relevant parts of the judgement given by the Appellate Court on 23 Nov 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> :</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The determination of custody shall be deemed on the specific circumstances of his parents and judged in accordance with the principles that is the most favourable to the minor child. From the birth to 2021, the legitimate son was raised full-time by (the Mother), the appellee and he is currently only four years old. From the perspective of the law of the physical and mental development of the young child, relatively he is more dependent on his mother at this age stage. At present his cognitive ability has not yet fully developed due to his young age. So the ownership of his custody cannot be decided with his cognition only. At the same time, according to the statements of both parties at the trial, the legitimate son is temporarily living with (the Father) during the first-instance litigation of the case due to the conflict between both parties taking care of him in turn. Therefore it is not enough to conclude that he has had a relatively stable living and growing environment. In addition, (the Mother) has the ability and conditions to raise the child. Although (the Father) advocates that (the Moher) is not suitable to raise him, he does not adduce any evidence to prove that she has obvious unfavourable circumstances for raising the child. In view of the above factors, this court holds that the court of first instance should be correct in ordering the legitimate son to be raised and educated by (the Mother) in accordance with the principle that is most beneficial to underage child and in determining that the Father should pay monthly maintenance of CNY3,000 to the legitimate son until he lives on his own on the basis of his actual needs and the level of local consumption etc. It is hoped that both parties can put aside disputes in the future, negotiate amicably on the issues such as visitation from the perspective of maximising the interest of the child, avoid conflicts, try to reduce the possible adverse effects of parental divorce on him and ensure that he can enjoy the companionship and love of both parents and grow up healthy and strong in a peaceful , tranquil and friendly living environment. In summary, according to Article 177, Paragraph1 (1) of Law of the Peoples’ Republic of China on Civil Procedure, this court decides as follows: dismiss the appeal and uphold the original judgment... This judgment is final.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s solicitor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Mother submitted her solicitor’s opinion found in the solicitor’s affidavit of 17 December 2024. The solicitor is a practicing lawyer in China whose area of expertise included dealing with civil cases such as family division and divorce. He was engaged by the Mother to respond to the legal opinion of the Father’s solicitor dated 5 September and 26 October 2024 which were found in the solicitor’s affidavit filed on 10 December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Mother posed a total of 16 questions for her solicitor’s legal opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. The more relevant questions and the responses of the Father and Mother’s solicitor are set out below for ease of comparison.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The following question is relevant on the issue of custody:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    What responsibilities and rights do the Mother has regarding the child under the Chinese court order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of Father’s solicitor: The Chinese Court order states that the Mother has the responsibility and right to raise and educate the child. This implies that the Mother is entitled to live with the child, as well as the obligation to raise and take care of, provide daily necessities to, cultivate, and educate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of Mother’s solicitor: Under the Chinese Court Judgment, the Mother has the responsibility and right to directly raise and educate the child. This includes the right to live with the child, as well as the responsibility to nurture, care for, provide for the child’s daily needs, and foster the child’s education and development. The Mother also has the right to make decisions about the child’s living arrangements and educational matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     On access or visitation rights, the solicitors’ opinion on the various issues was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(k)    What access or visitation rights does the Father have according to the Chinese court order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: The Father’s right to the child include the rights to contact, associate with, meet, visit, accompany, look after, protect, educate, and live together for short periods.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: The Father’s visitation rights to the child primarily refer to the right to visit and interact with the child (e.g., face-to-face meetings and communication). The method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In relation to the Father’s solicitor response to (k) that the Father has the right to live with the child for a short period, the Mother has asked her solicitor as to what is the upper limit of &quot;short-term&quot; and his response was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: Under Chinese law and judicial interpretations, there is no legal definition or upper limit for &quot;short-term.&quot; Living with the child for a &quot;short-term&quot; period requires the consent of the direct custodian and exceeds the scope of visitation rights. Visitation rights typically involve supervised visits during agreed-upon times, without the right to take the child away. In this case, the Father never agreed with the Mother on how visitation would occur. Instead, the Father forcibly took the child away before the court's judgment and, after the judgment was issued, left the country and refused to comply with the Chinese court’s ruling. The Mother never consented to the Father taking the child out of the country or to the child living with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(l)    What is the legal procedure for enforcing visitation rights in China?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: Chinese law grants the parent who is not directly responsible for the care of the child the right to access the child. The parent may file an application to request that the court set the schedule and terms of access. The court shall accept the application of the person who has the right of access and make a judgment on the time and manner of access in accordance with the law. If the party who directly raises the child refuses to facilitate the access rights holder in enforcing the access rights after the judgment has entered into force, the access rights holder may petition the court for execution. The execution approach taken by the court is mainly to persuade the party who directly raises the child to do so voluntarily, the court may penalise him/her by imposing a fine, detention, or other measures. Nonetheless, the court hardly ever impose fines or incarceration on the parent who is raising the child directly in order to protect the child from potential harm. Therefore, if the party directly raising the child does not voluntarily fulfill the responsibility of assisting access, the access rights of the access parent will not be realised. The enforcement of access rights has always been a challenging matter in Chinese legal practice because the party who is directly responsible for the care of the child typically does not cooperate with access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: According to Article 1086 of the Civil Code, after a divorce, the parent who does not directly raise the child has the right to visit the child, while the other parent has the obligation to facilitate this. The method and timing of visitation are to be agreed upon by both parties. If no agreement is reached, the people’s court will make a ruling. If visitation is deemed harmful to the child’s physical or mental health, the court may suspend visitation. Once the reasons for suspension no longer exist, visitation rights should be restored.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The custodial parent typically provides visitation rights twice a month. If the custodial parent does not cooperate with visitation arrangements, the non-custodial parent may file a lawsuit with the court to request a judicial determination of the visitation schedule and method. The court must accept the application and issue a ruling on the timing and manner of visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Once the ruling takes effect, if the custodial parent refuses to facilitate visitation, the non-custodial parent can apply to the court for compulsory enforcement. The court will initially attempt to persuade the custodial parent to voluntarily comply and fulfil their obligation to assist with visitation. If the custodial parent continues to refuse, the court may impose penalties, including fines, detention, or even criminal charges. The custodial parent cannot refuse enforcement measures, as failure to comply without valid reason could result in criminal liability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(n)    Under Chinese law, does the Father have any measures to prevent being deprived of visitation rights to the child?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: Under Chinese law, the Father does not have any measures to prevent being deprived of the right to have access to the child. The Father will have to take legal action to exercise his right to have access to the child if the Mother refuses to facilitate the same. However, even if the Father exercises his right of access through legal proceedings, if the Mother still does not facilitate access, the Father’s right of access to the child cannot be realised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: Visitation rights are a common issue in many divorce cases across China. As a country with a well established judicial system, Chinese law ensures that if the Mother attempts to deprive the Father of visitation rights, the Father can file a lawsuit. The court will rule on the method and schedule of visitation. If the judgment or ruling is not complied with, the responsible party may face criminal liability. Under current Chinese law, unless a court determines that visitation by the Father is harmful to the child, no one has the authority to deprive the Father of visitation rights to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In relation to the question of who could decide on the child’s care and education arrangements, the Father’s solicitor has provided his legal opinion on question “(d)” as to what are the Father’s responsibilities and rights under the Notice of Order for Performance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The Mother’s solicitor asked her solicitor to elaborate on the practical effect of the Father being the child's &quot;legal guardian&quot; and having &quot;the same responsibilities and rights to raise and educate the child as the Mother&quot; and which party has the authority to decide the child's care and education arrangements?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Father’s solicitor: According to the Notice of Order for Performance, the Father has the responsibility to hand over the child to the Mother for caregiving. Pursuant to Article 1084 of the Civil Code of the Peoples Republic of China, “The parents’ divorce does not nullify their relationship with their children. Whether the children are raised by their mother or father after the parent’s divorce, they will always be the children of both parents. Parents still have the right and obligation to raise, educate, and protect their children following divorce.” Although the Mother is currently the caregiver of the child, according to the Chinese Court Order, and has the right to live with the child, the right of caregiving is not unchangeable, and the Father has the right to apply for a change in the caregiver of the child at any time by filing an application. At the same time, even if the caregiver is not changes, the Father is still the child’s legal guardian and has the same responsibility and right as the Moher to raise and educate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response of the Mother’s solicitor: According to the Civil Code and relevant provisions, the Shangcheng District People's Court of Hangzhou issued Civil Judgment (2023) Zhe 0102 Min Chu 7390, determining that the Mother is the child’s direct custodian. The child's direct custody by the Mother is protected by the court and enforceable through compulsory measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Under the Civil Code, the direct custodian is the parent living with the child, who has the authority to make decisions regarding the child’s daily life and education. The direct custodian holds a higher guardianship status. In this case, the Mother, as the direct custodian, has the sole authority to arrange the child's living conditions and educational plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Legal guardianship based on blood relations (e.g., parents, grandparents, siblings, etc.) is supplementary. If the direct custodian is unable to fulfil their duties, other guardians have the right and obligation to take on the role of direct custodian. However, their guardianship primarily serves a supporting and supervisory role. This legislative intent aligns closely with similar provisions in Singaporean law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Mother’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In the Mother’s submission, counsel raised that the only relevant issue for the court’s determination is whether the child’s best interest is served by granting the Mother sole custody or joint custody of the child. It was submitted that it is in the best interest of the child for sole custody to be granted to her citing the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That the child’s needs are best fulfilled by the Mother who is the child’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the father has not acted in the child’s best interest at all by unilaterally and forcibly removing the child from the Mother’s care; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     That the parties and the child have no connection to Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Counsel for the Mother also pointed out that the crux of the Father’s application appeared to be his purported concern and fear about being deprived on access to the child if sole custody was granted to the Mother and he was brought back to China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Counsel also submitted that granting the Father’s application for custody would “effectively endorse and legitimise de facto child abduction by the Father” and in effect, be rewarding the Father for his blatant disregard of existing Chinese court orders. It would also create a dangerous precedent, incentivising parents to flout court orders and unlawfully disrupt their children’s lives in hopes of gaining a more favourable outcome in a different and further encourage further manipulations of legal processes. Finally, granting custody to the Father would send a troubling message that the legal system permits parents to exploit legal loopholes, uprooting children from stable environments and manipulating the law to further their own interests. Such conduct should not be tolerated, as it undermines the very principles of justice and fairness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Father informed that since the application in OSG 77 was filed by the Mother, both parties made substantial efforts to resolve the matter amicably but were unsuccessful. He denied that he had taken the child forcibly from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     During the marriage both parties and the child lived in their matrimonial home and on weekends, the child would stay with his parent’s residence and joined by the Mother at times. Since the child was born, he has been involved in caring for him as he had a stable job with fixed working hours and was able to work overtime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     After April 2021, due to the Mother’s job as insurance agent, she was frequently occupied even at night. At the hearing of the first instance court, he had submitted his evidence to show the Mother was too busy to look after the child and often left him to his care<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Father related various significant events during the marriage where they had frequent disagreements wherein the Mother would often be emotionally unstable, acted out in front of the child and in these disagreements, the Mother would take the child away from the matrimonial home to the Mother’s parent’s residence. He also related various attempts by the Mother to gain an advantage in the divorce proceedings by using the child as a pawn and other past conduct, which he had also raised before the Chinese Courts which eventually gave the right to raise and educate the child to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     On 28 June 2023, the Father had gone to the Mother’s parent’s residence to take the child according to the parties’ agreed scheduled but was refused by the Mother. Despite that, he managed to leave the place with the child and due to the Mother’s persistent conduct of denying him access, he was afraid to hand the child back to her the following weekend and thereafter. His attempt to resolve the matter through a third party also failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     After taking the child into his care, he took 2 months of extended leave to take the child on holiday, brought him and his parents to Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Huizhou and Guangzhou, enrolled him in a pre-school near his parent’s residence. In November 2023, he brought the child to Phuket Thailand and on 11 December 2023 brought him to Singapore where he intended to have him commence his formal education in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father enrolled the child into the Australian International School on 22 January 2024 which he claimed to be what the parties has agreed to some time back. He contended that the child was comfortable living with him since 28 June 2023 and performing well at school. He shared the child’s daily routine where he would send and fetch the child from school and on weekends would accompany him to swimming classes or other activities. The Father lived here with his retired mother who was on a Long Term Visit Pass and who could assist with the care-giving duties. He believed it would be in the child’s best interest that he remained in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Father informed that it was important that the access orders he was seeking in his summons are recorded in an Order of Court. This was because the 7 August 2023 Order (in China) did not specify any access for him, or any contact with the child would continue with him as his father. In view of the Mother’s past conduct of denying access he was deeply concerned that he would be excluded completely from the child’s life once the child return to China. He was advised by his Chinese lawyers and believed that the Chinese Courts do not ordinarily make specific orders on access and expect parties to resolve the issue of access on their own<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. Based on past events, both parties were not able to resolve the issue of access and thus wished for his access to the child to be crystallised in an Order of Court to be mirrored by-consent in China so that his right to have time with the child in China would be preserved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     With regards to the decision of the Appellate Court, the Father contended that the Court has erred in their judgment. He was aware of the Written Decision of Detention, the Written Decision of Enforcement and the Notice of Order to Fulfil issued against him but claimed that he was in Singapore by the time these decisions were made and was not served with these decisions. He contended that these orders do not have any extraterritorial effect though he would likely be subject to them upon his return to China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s solicitor</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Father relied on his solicitor’s opinion found in the solicitor’s affidavit filed on 10 December 2024 and 18 February 2025. The solicitor has been practicing in China for 23 years specialising in economic and matrimonial cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Father posed 9 questions set out in the solicitor’s affidavit of 10 December and a further 8 questions set out in the 18 February affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Based on the legal opinion given, in relation to the Court order, the Father disagreed that the order was clear as to the issue of the child’s custody, care and control. The words of the 7 August 2023 Order stated that the child “… shall be raised and educated by [the Mother]”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father’s reasons were, firstly, there is no mention of sole custody being given to the Mother and he was advised and believed that it was also not appropriate to equate the phrase “raised and educated” in the Order with the legal concept of custody in Singapore. It is therefore inaccurate and misleading for the Mother to allege that she had been granted “sole custody” of the child. This position completely ignores the default position in Chinese law, which he explained in the paragraph below. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     According to his solicitor’s legal opinion, the default position under Chinese law is that “the parents’ divorce does not nullify their relationship with their children.” According to Article 1084 of the Civil Code of the People's Republic of China, both parents are the joint legal guardians of the child and share a joint “right and obligation to raise, educate, and protect their children following a divorce.” As could be seen from the Chinese Legal Opinion, the Father has an equal say in long-term major decisions relating to the child ’s care under Chinese law and the Mother should not seek to deprive him of the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father submitted written submissions which were likely prepared by himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In his oral submission, on the day in question, he took the child away because the Mother did not abide to their agreement for him to see the child on alternate weekdays and rejected his request to see the child. He thus had no choice but to bring the child home on that day. He was not allowed to see the child on 25 to 27 June though the child who was sick earlier, had recovered. She had subsequently called the police and harassed his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     He reiterated that the parties had agreed to the child receiving education in Singapore due to its bilingual system, and the culture was similar to China. They also had thoughts of Australia but he encountered issues with the visa requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     He claimed that the Mother succeeded in her case in China due to her connections (which the Mother counsel denied in rebuttal). He also claimed that the Mother knew he was coming to Singapore with intent to mediate the case. The Mother didn’t want to agree on access as she knew that in China, his request would not be granted. He agreed to allow the Mother access via video call when she came to Singapore but claimed that between 23 July and 12 August, she did not make any call or visited the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     For 21 months, he solely took care of the child who became dependent on him, was very happy, made good progress in school and able to converse in 2 languages. He disagreed that he brought the child here for his own self-interest and that had resigned from his job to take care of the child with his mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As he had filed for a variation of the order in China, he made an oral application that the decision of the court in the two applications before me be deferred to after 3 April 2025 which was the date of his variation application in the Hangzhou Court in China. He relied on the rest of his written submissions and affidavits filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     In deciding the two applications, I considered the issues set out below as pertinent and relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Order made by the Chinese Courts gave custody to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If so, should the Singapore Court make another custody order when there is already one made which binds the Mother and Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As the Chinese Court Order is silent on access, how is the Father to seek recourse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Is it in interest of the child for him to be return to the Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(a)   Whether the Order made by the Chinese Courts gave custody to the Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I construed the order made by the Chinese Courts as an order for custody which was granted to the Mother. This was borne out even by the judgement of the Court as the word “custody” was used based on the translation made by a neutral third party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The relevant translated grounds of decision of the First Instance Court contained the following statement made by the court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The focus of the dispute in this case lies in the issue of child’s custody that is (“the Child”)’s custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The finding by the Court on the above dispute was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">.. it shall be more conducive to his health, growth for him to be raised and educated by Chen Li Ying. Therefore (“the Child”) shall be raised and educated by (“the Mother”) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Based on the above, I came to the view that the Chinese Courts gave the Mother sole custody of the child. This was also supported by the Mother’s solicitor’s opinion in paragraph 32 above which stated that the Mother is the direct custodian of the child and has the sole authority to make decisions regarding the child’s daily life and education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">b)   If so, should the Singapore Court make another custody order when there is already one made which binds the Mother and Father?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Singapore Courts in dealing with issues involving children which are not of local born has given guidance on the approach to be taken.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0570.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 570</a>, the Court stated that in custody proceedings, an important consideration had to be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity for the cultural and societal environment which the forum served. A child’s best interest was best determined by the forum which was best equipped to determine what was best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health care, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In this case, the issue of custody had been decided by the court in China which has the closest connection to the parties and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In matters which has been decided by a foreign Court, the Court in <em>AB v AC and Another Application</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27027-M.xml')\">[2004] SGDC 6</a>, at paragraph 15 of the decision, cited a High Court decision in <em>Igra v Igra</em> [1951] P 404 which held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It has long been accepted that the court of the domicile is the proper tribunal to dissolve a marriage. Its decisions should as far as possible, be acknowledged by other countries in the interests of comity. Different countries have different personal laws, different standards of justice and different practice. The interests of comity are not served if one country is too eager to criticise the standards of another country or too reluctant to recognise decrees that are valid by the law of the domicile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     While the above case was in relation to dissolution of marriages, the same could apply to ancillary matters. The issue of custody had been litigated extensively in China including at the Appellate Court level whose decision is final. It is important to note that the Father admitted that he had presented to the Court the evidence which he had also submitted to this Court and despite that, an order was made against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     As there is already an order made on the custody of the child by the Chinese Courts, it would not be in the interest of comity of nations if a Singapore Court is to make another order of custody. By comity I mean that there must be respect between countries shown by accepting each other’s laws, even where there is no reciprocal arrangement to recognise orders made by the two countries. The Father participated in the proceedings in both the courts which culminated in a final decision made by an appellate court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">c)   As the Chinese Court Order is silent on access, how is the Father to seek recourse?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father’s main concern was that the orders made, specifically the 7 August 2023 Order by the First Instance Court did not specify any access for him. This was also reflected in the various prayers sought in his summons including his prayer for mirror orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     On the issue of access or visitation rights, the Mother’s solicitors provided the following insights on Chinese law:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(k)    What visitation rights does the Father has according to the Chinese court judgment?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Response: The Father’s visitation rights to the child primarily refer to the right to visit and interact with the child (e.g., face-to-face meetings and communication). The method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Both solicitors informed that there are also legal grounds under the Chinese law for a variation of a child custody order. They also pointed out that there are safeguards available for the Father should he be denied access such as fines imposed by the Chinese courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Of the two, I was of the view that the Mother’s solicitor interpretation of the court orders and opinion on the relevant issues were more reliable for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s solicitor opined that the Father has not violated the Chinese Court Orders simply because they can be varied. I agreed with the Mother’s counsel that the Father’s solicitor’s opinion is non-sensical.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s solicitor must have advised the Father who was made to believe that in the Appellate Court order, there was no mention of sole custody being given to the Mother and thus it was also not appropriate to equate the phrase “raised and educated” in the Order with the legal concept of custody in Singapore. This was despite the court referring to the order as the order for custody of the child, based on the translation of the court decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father’s solicitor’s interpretation of the court order went against the grain of the two Chinese Court Order when he opined that “After divorcing (the Mother), (the Father) … has the same responsibility and right as (the Mother) to raise, take care of, and educate (the child).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I further note that the Father himself had applied to another Court in China, the Hangzhou Court, for the right to raise and educate the child to be granted to him which application was still pending when OSG 77 and the above-mentioned summons were heard. This was one of the factors which I took into account in dismissing the summons filed by the Father based on <em>Re A</em>’s case. In <em>Re A</em>’s case, the father himself had chosen to have the issues of custody and access determined by the foreign court. As such, any appeal or application in relation to custody or access should be litigated or re-litigated in China by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">d)   Is it in interest of the child for him to be returned to the Applicant Mother?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     This is the crux of the matter at hand. In OSG 77, the Mother has applied under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934. She asked that she be given sole custody, care and control of the child and for the Father to hand over the child and his travel document to her. In essence, she was asking that the child to be returned to her in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In deciding matters relating custody of children, the overarching principle is found in s 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Welfare of infant to be paramount consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration and, save insofar as such welfare otherwise requires, the father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed to have any claim superior to that of the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The welfare of the child is thus the first and paramount consideration and in particular the court ought to have some regard to the maternal bond between the mother and child as held in <em>Soon Peck Wah</em> v <em>Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a>. The Court therein emphasised the importance of maternal bond, especially for young infants who are deeply dependent on their mothers for care and emotional support. The Court, upon finding that the parents were both capable of looking after the child and had their respective families behind them to help out, stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All these things being equal between the father and mother, a very important factor to bear in mind was the fact that the child was very young. A child at a very tender young age would be most dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. This should not be mistaken as reviving the old presumption of “maternal custody” of all young infants. In the best interest of the child’s welfare, we should not deprive him of his mother’s love and care: at [44] and [45].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Further, in <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a>, the Court of Appeal outlined a non-exhaustive list of factors that the courts should consider, including the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_e\"></a>(e)     the effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Court stated that the above factors afford a sound starting basis for any court concerned with the issue of the child’s welfare and that factors (a) and (b) are closely related and should generally be considered in tandem. Further, the relevance of these or any other factors to a particular case, and the weight that should be given to each of the factors, is a matter of judgment and will turn on the specific facts and circumstances of that case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis of the child’s best interest</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the child’s physical, emotional and educational needs, and his physical and emotional safety</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The child was 4 plus years old when he was taken away by the Father and when the application was heard, was 6 plus years old. The court in <em>Soon Pek Wah</em>’s case emphasised the importance of maternal bond, especially for young infants who are deeply dependent on their mothers for care and emotional support. This was also acknowledged by the First Instance Court<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> which made a finding that the child is still young and has endless dependence on his mother and thus it “shall be more conducive to his healthy growth for him to be raised and educated by” the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     As for the child educational needs, prior to being taken away, he was in kindergarten. The Mother had enrolled the child in various other classes. After being taken away, he was placed by the Father in an international school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     While the child educational needs could be met either by him remaining in China or Singapore, the fact that the child is young weighed in favour of the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and ensure the child’s safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The Mother stated that she works as an insurance agent and event planner, and this gave her autonomy and flexibility in her working hours to attend to the child’s needs. She is supported by her retired father to attend to the child in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     The Father’s occupation after he left his company of 10 years on 22 November 2023 was not made known in his affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s mother who was on Long Term Visit Pass lived with the child who has been issued with a Student Pass. The Father informed that his mother’s Long Term Visit Pass was tied to the child’s Student Pass. The Father also informed that he had applied for a Long Term Visit Pass which was also tied to the child’s Student Pass<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. It was not clear what his long term plans are. If he were to return to China, we would have to deal with the orders made against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     Based on the above, I was of the view the Mother would be able to provide a more stable environment for the child’s needs, growth and safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the child’s relationship with each of his parents and with any other caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I did not find any evidence of any wrong-doing or anything against the Mother or any of her immediate family with regards to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the need to ensure a continuing relationship between the child and his parents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     It is well recognised that it is in a child’s best interests post-divorce for him to maintain a good relationship with both his parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. The Mother informed that she was more than willing to let the Father be a part of the child’s life and upbringing and willing to facilitate access in accordance with the law. According to the Mother’s solicitor, the method and duration of visitation are to be mutually agreed upon by both parents. If an agreement cannot be reached, the matter can be litigated, and the court will determine the specifics of how visitation rights are exercised. Typically, Chinese courts allow visitation twice a month. However, the exact duration of each visit is not explicitly specified. Importantly, the Mother has not denied the Father the right to visitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Father on the other hand, instead of going back to the Chinese courts, had taken things into his own hands and had not allowed the Mother to have access to the child for long periods after the Father took the child from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In my view, this factor weighed against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the effect of any changes to the child’s life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The child was taken out of China and brought to Singapore where he was enrolled into a school so that he could be bilingual. Whilst the child had been in Singapore since December 2023, he had lived most of his life in China and taken care of by the Mother on full time basis from January 2019 to 2022 when the Mother started work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Bearing in mind the importance of maternal bond, especially for young children as stated in Soon Peck Wah’s case, this factor also weighed against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">the parents’ character and conduct</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     This was an additional factor which the court in <em>TSF v TSE</em> took into account in determining welfare of the child. The Father clearly had brought the child out of China for his own interest after he disagreed with the two court orders. Based on the evidence, the circumstances supported the Mother’s claim that the child was taken away from her without her consent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Father’s conduct had also led to the issuance of enforcement orders against him. The Father appeared not to have taken the orders seriously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     Having considered the above factors and the circumstances of the case, in the context of our guardianship laws, I came to the view that it is in the child’s best interest for the Mother to be granted care and control of the child. To enable the Mother to exercise this right, bearing in mind that there is already a custody order made by the Chinese court, I ordered that she be given sole custody for the purpose of having the child returned to China with the Mother. I also granted the Mother her second prayer to facilitate the return of the child. Consequently, I dismissed the Father’s application in Summons 3478.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     In summary, I made the orders in OSG 77 and dismissed Summons 3478 for following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is in the best interest of the child that the Mother be given care and control of the child, and to enable the Mother to exercise this right, for her to also be given sole custody for the purpose of having the child returned to her in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the order made in the main application in OSG 77 which would result in the child being returned to the Mother in China, the child would not be within the jurisdiction requiring any other order for custody, care and control or access to be exercised by any of the parties including the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There are existing orders for custody made by the Chinese Courts that had jurisdiction when the orders were made and will continue to have jurisdiction over the parties. It would be against the comity of nations for another jurisdiction to make another or further order or others on the same matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_d\"></a>(d)     It was open for the Father to litigate the issue relating to the child including his access in China which is the proper forum. There is thus no necessity for a Singapore Court to even consider the mirror orders requested for by the Father. The Father should also deal with the orders made against him for his non-compliance with the two Chinese court orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Lastly, I did not grant the Father’s application to defer my decision on the matter pending the conclusion of the proceedings filed by him in the Hangzhou Court so as not to further prolong the separation of the child from the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     On the issue of costs, the Mother’s solicitor sought $6,000 for OSG 77 and $4,000 for dismissal of Summons 3478.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The powers of the court to fix and assess costs is found in rule 851(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”). Rule 852(2) of the FJR states that costs should “follow the event” except where the court considers that “in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as the whole or part of the costs”. I was of the view that the Father should pay the costs for both sets of applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     There was a total of 13 affidavits filed for the two applications. Several case conferences and court attendances were conducted before the hearing which took close to two hours. An application for an injunction was also made and granted. Written submissions were prepared by the Mother’s solicitors for the purpose of both applications.
