The plaintiff is the wife of the deceased, and the defendants are the lawful children of the deceased from the latter’s previous marriage. The plaintiff sought orders under Rule 786 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 and Sections 5 and 7 of the Intestate Succession Act 1967. Essentially, she applied for a declaratory order that she had rendered a just and true account of the estate of the deceased and sought permission to distribute to the beneficiaries of the estate their respective shares, after discharging the debts and liabilities of the estate. I allowed the application. The defendants appeal against the same, the notice of appeal having been filed on 22 September 2023. Leave was granted in HCF/OSP 6/2023 to extend the time to file the notice as attempts to do so within legislated timelines were unsuccessful for various reasons. There is no appeal against the order on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Factual Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The deceased passed away on 21 April 2020. The parties jointly applied for and obtained a grant of letters of administration for the estate. The order in terms of the prayer for such appointment in FC/P 2371/2020 was granted on 30 June 2020. An estate account was set up by the plaintiff for which the parties were joint signatories. The Schedule of Assets was filed 9 months later on 15 March 2021 with a supplementary affidavit signed by all parties confirming the accuracy of the Schedule. Subsequently, the grant of letters of administration was issued on 3 June 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In his lifetime, the deceased had set up an electrical engineering business which was registered as a private limited company. It ceased operations in 2018 which is approximately 2 years prior to his passing. Among the assets of this business was a property along Aljunied Road (Aljunied property). The Aljunied property comprised an office and a factory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In June 2020, the plaintiff engaged in discussions with the defendants on the sale of this Aljunied property. The parties agreed that it should be sold. This meant that there was a need to clear the property of chattels to enable delivery of vacant possession to the eventual purchaser.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 15 August 2020, there was a meeting between the parties at the Aljunied property and the defendants were informed of the need to dispose the chattels. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants agreed to let the plaintiff handle the disposal. The plaintiff accordingly engaged a contractor who disposed the chattels on 1 December 2020. The plaintiff claimed that she received $1 000 for this and deposited the same into the business account on 3 December 2020. The sale of the Aljunied property was completed on 14 October 2021 and an amount of $687 616.71 was received and deposited into the estate account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The plaintiff then took steps to divide the estate monies, but the defendants were initially unresponsive to the plaintiff’s request to endorse the accounts of the estate prepared by her and later resistant to the plaintiff’s account of how she dealt with the chattels at the Aljunied property. On 3 January 2022, the plaintiff received a letter demanding that she provide a just and true account of the estate of the deceased. The defendants disputed the position of the plaintiff that they had consented to her disposing the chattels, pointing to a lack of information on when it was to be disposed and a lack of agreement on the value that it could be disposed for. They alleged that the plaintiff must have received a much higher sum than declared as the chattels comprised more than wires and scrap material. They suggested that she may have pocketed the proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In <b><em>Tacplas Property Services Pte Ltd</em></b> v <b><em>Lee Peter Michael (administrator of the estate of Lee Ching Miow)</em></b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Court of Appeal, having considered conflicting authorities on the point, was of the view that administrators of an estate must act jointly and the act of one administrator cannot be said to be binding on the estate unless the other administrators had ratified the same.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Where an administrator and a third party enter into an agreement, the co-administrator cannot challenge that agreement if there is clear and unequivocal representation on his part that he had consented to the agreement. This consent can be implied.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Silence or a lack of action alone however would not be sufficient to indicate consent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> As seen in <b><em>Tacplas</em></b> however, there is a line recognised to exist between mere silence and silence even when there was a duty to act.

It was the contention of the defendants however, that they had seen much more than scrap material and wires when they visited the premises in August 2020. As a contractor himself, the first defendant said he was able to provide an estimate of the value and did so as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"><colgroup><col width=\"49.72%\"><col width=\"50.28%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Cables and Wires</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$6 000+</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Electrical components</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">approximately $2 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Tools and Equipment</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$3 000 to $4 000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Other metal materials</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">approximately $4 000</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the affidavit of the first defendant, he exhibited messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> sent on <em>WhatsApp</em> messenger between him and the children of the plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> Part of the exchange on 3 July 2021 is reproduced as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"44.12%\"><col width=\"55.88%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">First Respondent (1<sup>st</sup> R):</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Where are all the thing in the factory?</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Applicant’s children (AC):</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Sold and cleared</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1<sup>st</sup> R: </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>and the money recovered?</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AC:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Paid off the debts</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1<sup>st</sup> R:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>please clearly indicate thanks</em> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">AC:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Yup.

This led to the plaintiff providing the name of a representative of the management agency that ran the Aljunied Industrial Complex as an alternative. This representative informed the first defendant that the plaintiff dealt directly with the contractor. The plaintiff shared that this contractor was a “specialist collection company”. The representative shared that he informed the plaintiff that she should check with all the stakeholders before disposing the items.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The representative of the management agency did not however file an affidavit. The defendants believe that the lack of proper information on the disposal company points to the plaintiff’s mismanagement of the business assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I was of the view on the totality of the evidence that the plaintiff had discharged her obligations as an administrator and the orders reflect this position. My reasons are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 15 August 2020, the plaintiff had asked the defendants for their attendance at the Aljunied property. They were told by the plaintiff to take from the property anything that they had wanted to keep, and the defendants had accordingly taken some items. The plaintiff could not recall what the specific items were. I had asked for clarification from the defendants’ counsel as to whether there was anything taken by their clients belonging to the deceased which were not included in the Schedule of Assets. The counsel by way of correspondence to the Court on 31 January 2023 confirmed that the first defendant had taken a mobile phone and a smart watch while the second defendant had taken a gold ring. These were allowed by the plaintiff. No value was ascribed to them, and these are not reflected in the Schedule of Assets. These were in fact taken prior to the filing of the Schedule of Assets and the supplementary affidavit confirming the accuracy of the Schedule by both the plaintiff and the defendants on 15 March 2021 and before the issuance of the grant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Schedule of Assets similarly makes no reference to the chattels at the Aljunied property that is the subject of this dispute. If there was a view by the defendants that these were assets of the business and that these were of significant value, this Schedule would not have been endorsed, or should not have been endorsed, by them. They chose to confirm the accuracy of the Schedule by way of their supplementary affidavit affirmed on 4 March 2021 and filed on 15 March 2021. Additionally, other than what the first defendant says the value of the chattels seen at the property is likely to be, a view anchored in the fact that he is a contractor by vocation and appreciates the value of equipment, there is little basis to support this position. In his tabulation, he refers to items generally and estimates value without any indication of possible depreciation or whether these were working items, even on the tenuous assumption that he recalls what he saw at the meeting in 2020 with sufficient clarity. While it is clear from the <em>WhatsApp</em> messages that the first defendant did not agree that the value of the disposed items could be accepted at $1 000, he appears to have agreed to it being disposed. He appears to have been satisfied with the plaintiff doing the needful to dispose those items. It was never the desire of the plaintiff to oversee all matters. The fact that the defendants were comfortable with her handling the estate is telling. To point to the fact that the plaintiff was the sole director of the business after the deceased’s passing and was therefore better placed to handle matters relating to the business premises at Aljunied does not place on her a higher burden as co-administrator. She certainly owes fiduciary duties to beneficiaries of which she is one, to call, collect and convert assets into cash and to pay towards funeral and testamentary expenses as well as debts and other liabilities of the estate (<b><em>VIK </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>VIL &amp; Ors</em></b>).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This is equally applicable to the defendants as co-administrators. The plaintiff was not standing in the way of the defendants’ involvement as co-administrators even as it relates to the business of the deceased. What may have been a convenient arrangement for the defendants to leave it to the plaintiff given her directorship, it should not now be used to defend a lack of action on the part of the defendants on the specific issue of the chattels at the Aljunied property when there was always a duty to act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The business ceased operations for 2 years prior to the passing of the deceased. It is unclear what remained at the premises and its value. The defendants did not appear to know and instead appear to have had very little care when parties met at the premises on 15 August 2020, at least until a value that they were not comfortable with was presented. The document that was produced and which shows an amount of $1 000 having been received suggests that the items after approximately 2 years since the business ceased, had depreciated significantly. I accept that the document speaks little about the items that were disposed, who disposed it and how the value was determined. Other than the defendants’ disbelief however, there was no evidence to show clearly that the plaintiff had falsely reported the facts in particular the value of the chattels. The difference between the plaintiff’s position that they were valued at $1 000 and the defendants’ estimation of $16 000 is $15 000. The value of the items that were taken by the defendants from the premises which are not accounted for in the Schedule of Assets may be of equal or more value. If anything, the administration by all the parties may be said to be lacking in diligence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It would be practically impossible for the plaintiff to retrace steps to prove the value today. Vacant possession was delivered to the buyers with the consent of all the administrators. The timing of the deposit of the $1 000 into the business account, i.e., on 3 December 2020, suggests that the plaintiff had accounted for the money shortly after it was received and did not do so only upon the threat of legal action. The likelihood of this being a fabrication was low, especially as pointed out above, the items were not stated in the Schedule. The defendants did not question the omission in the Schedule. They were in fact allowed to retain personal belongings of the deceased and the defendants did so without any concern that these should typically be included in the Schedule of Assets, rationalising it as something that the plaintiff permitted. Even though the <em>WhatsApp</em> exchanges between the plaintiff or through her children and the defendant, more particularly the first defendant, were often tense, the defendants were content to continue relying on the plaintiff to do all that was necessary to call in the assets and prepare for distribution. What effectively stands against the plaintiff in taking steps to discharge the debts of the estate and distribute the assets is the issue of the disposal of items carried out in 2020 which is challenged on an unsupported allegation that it was valued at about $16 000. This comes after consenting to have the plaintiff take steps to dispose the items. The difficulty in going beyond what has been documented by the plaintiff and the Schedule makes any further enquiry likely to be futile while adding costs disproportionate to the value of the subject in dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The defendants took the position that there was no need for a “specialist collection company” to take away scrap material and that could have been left to a rag-and-bone man. The fact that it was not done by a rag-and-bone man, they contend, must mean that the items were much more than scrap material. There was no evidence to support such a conclusion. Having said that, it can be safely assumed that there are many disposal companies in Singapore, and they transact in different ways. While the plaintiff could certainly have done things better even though she may not have realised the gravity of poor record keeping at the time and could have insisted on better documentation from the company that disposed the items, the picture that the evidence paints is one that suggests that she had the endorsement of the defendants to act in the way she did. The timing of the disposal which was well before the letters of administration were granted and the lack of reference to the items in the Schedule accepted by all parties, provide relevant context supporting this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The defendants had effectively given the plaintiff the task of managing key matters in the administration of the estate when they could have been more actively involved in the same. The defendants as co-administrators are not spectators who sit back and approve or disapprove the performance of the main player, in this case, the plaintiff. Even if the defendants were comfortable to allow or felt compelled to allow the plaintiff to take control of matters, the plaintiff had in fact taken steps to engage the defendants on the issue of the items at the Aljunied property. The agreement to allow the plaintiff to dispose the items but later sharing their discomfort with not having been informed of the date she was going to do it or the value that was offered, may certainly suggest a lack of unequivocal representation of consent. The first defendant’s affirmative answer when asked by the plaintiff if she could dispose the items however, and by not taking any steps to have it valued himself make the challenge by the defendants, in the larger context of the other factors highlighted above, unmeritorious. The delay in administering the estate over this dispute has also stood in the way of attending to the debts and liabilities of the estate fully and the plaintiff had in my view, little choice but to seek the orders that she did.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/3814-M.xml')\">[2000] SGCA 5</a></p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraphs 38 and 39</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Paragraph 62</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See also <b><em>Foo Gee Finance Co Ltd </em></b><em>v </em><b><em>Liu Cho Chit and another action</em></b> [1998] 2 SLR 121</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Page 6 of the first defendant’s affidavit of 27 October 2022</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Similar exhibits are found in the plaintiff’s affidavit of 25 November 2022 at Tab 1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Tab 1 of the affidavit of first defendant dated 27 October 2022</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Without edits</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>See in particular page 73 of the plaintiff’s second affidavit of 25 November 2022 for full text of the discussion in this regard.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24850-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 12</a></p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Maintenance – Wife"],"date":"2023-12-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 664 of 2022","title":"WSN v WSO","citation":"[2023] SGFC 33","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30779-SSP.xml","counsel":["Mohamed Hashim Bin Abdul Rasheed and Sofia Bennita d/o Mohamed Bakhash (A Mohamed Hashim) for the Mother","Mohamed Fazal Bin Abdul Hamid (I.R.B Law LLP) for the Father."],"timestamp":"2023-12-21T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Tan Zhi Xiang","html":"<root><head><title>WSN v WSO</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WSN <em>v</em> WSO </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30779-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 33</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

I dismissed the application for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the Mother</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I first address the Mother’s application for spousal maintenance. The application was dismissed because her reasonable expenses did not exceed her income. The Mother’s estimated expenses were around $1,700 a month, or $1,300 a month taking into adjustments for joint household expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> It appeared from the Mother’s submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> that she wanted the Father to pay her expenses fully. This was despite the Mother’s own position that she was earning $1,000 a month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> It was also notable that the Mother’s declared expenses included $600 a month for allowance to parents, and $221 a month for holiday expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It bears emphasis that as divorce proceedings were underway in the Syariah Court, any order that I could have made would have been interim in nature, to address the parties’ immediate financial needs without a full investigation of the parties’ respective financial positions, and that any order would have been intended to provide modest maintenance (often calculated on a conservative basis) to tide the parties over pending the final determination of the parties’ divorce: see <em>VVQ v VVR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26548-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 97</a> at [21], citing <em>UEC v UEB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20614-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 92</a> at [10] and <em>Foo Ah Yan v Chiam Heng Chow</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 2 SLR 0506.xml')\">[2012] 2 SLR 506</a> at [22]); see also an academic view at [11] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I did not think that the Mother could reasonably expect the Father to pay for the maintenance of her own parents. The sum of $221 a month for vacations was also rather high taking into account the interim nature of these proceedings. Considering these factors, the Mother’s declared salary was sufficient to cover her expenses, whether calculated on an actual or adjusted basis. Indeed, even during re-examination by her own counsel, the Mother accepted: “the salary I’m earning is only for my---e---enough for---for my personal expenses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> I came to this conclusion without even considering the Mother’s rental income and earning capacity, which was likely to be higher than her current income given her higher past salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother’s application for maintenance for herself was therefore dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Mother’s application for the children was dismissed because she had not shown that the Father had neglected to pay reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As a preliminary point, I clarify that in coming to my decision, to give the Mother the maximum benefit of the doubt, I assumed that, save for the eldest child’s university fees, the Mother’s stated reasonable expenses of the children were reasonable. The children’s reasonable expenses were likely to be significantly lower given that for each of the four children, the Mother included $221 <em>per month per child</em> for “entertainment and holiday”, and $70 a month for “furniture and electronic”: <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> see [11] below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Mother’s case was that the Father had neglected to pay for the children’s reasonable expenses. In particular, she pointed out that her employment by the Father was terminated, and that the Father had terminated the utilities account and the tenancy at one of their properties. The Mother also submitted strenuously that the Father was hiding his income and assets and could afford the maintenance she was seeking. The Father’s case was essentially that he had not failed to provide reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The law on the reasonableness of maintenance is set out in <em>UHA v UHB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> (“<em>UHA v UHB</em>”). Aside from the reasonableness of the nature of quantum of expenses, the Court also considers the reasonableness of communication of expenses. Thus, “to find neglect or refusal to provide maintenance, the alleged non-paying party must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses”: at [48]. The Court further added at [59] and [60]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… The Mother has to communicate the child’s needs and expenses reasonably. The Father has to have an opportunity to provide reasonable maintenance before the matter is escalated to court. Regardless of how extensive court proceedings are, I do not think the request should be found only in an affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I find that despite the Father’s requests, the Mother did not provide any information on the child’s expenses before commencing the maintenance application. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It is clear from the above that the child’s needs and expenses must be communicated <em>before</em> the application for maintenance is filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Professor Leong Wai Kum has also written, in relation to maintenance for children (<em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em>, LexisNexis, 3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, 2018 at paragraphs 12.111 and 12.113):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The author suggests that the maintenance of a wife during marriage should be appreciated as the provision of emergency financial help so that the goal in assessing her maintenance must be to ensure that her basic needs are met to the extent which the husband is able to meet them. The same must be true of maintenance of a child by her parent… The relationships… between the child and her parent… are continuing. Intervention by the court into such continuing relationships should be as minimally invasive as possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Such reported cases as there are demonstrate that the amounts ordered tend to be fairly modest. The courts use the law of maintenance to order the defendant to meet the child’s modest neds to the extent that she can…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Discussion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As alluded above, the overarching issue was whether the Father had neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the children. This was the threshold issue that the Mother had to prove before the substance of her claims could be analysed. In my view, she had not crossed this threshold for two independent reasons. First, she had not proven that there was a shortfall between the Father’s contribution and the children’s expenses. Second, she had not shown that even if there was a shortfall, the Father was aware of the shortfall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether there was a shortfall between Father’s contribution and children’s reasonable expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   Lack of clarity in the Mother’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In a case like this, the usual approach would be to first determine the children’s reasonable expenses, then apportion the expenses between parents in accordance with legal principles. The Father’s determined portion (which I assumed was 100% in my analysis here to give the Mother the maximum benefit of the doubt) will then be compared against what he has been providing <em>in fact</em> to determine if there was neglect. However, the Mother’s analysis appears to have stopped at the first step.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In particular, aside from the table at paragraph 14 of her written submissions (discussed at [19] below), the Mother had not set out her own calculations or even estimates, supported with evidence, of the Father’s <em>actual</em> contributions to the children’s expenses. All the Court had to work with were bits and pieces set out below. Thus, it was not possible to even begin calculating if there was a shortfall. I explain with reference to the Mother’s evidence at trial and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the last day of trial, the Mother accepted the Father’s statement in his final affidavit R11 that “I have always paid for the children’s daily expenses, their school fees, and the family holiday”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Her evidence was that both parties contributed:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Yes, Ma’am. So sorry if I am being confusing, but I’m referring to my client’s latest affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Latest one, okay. R9, okay. Page 3, right?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Page 3, that’s correct. Item 8, can you see? The column.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Uh, yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Yes. Under children’s expenses, just for the record.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Yes. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    So, if I could repeat my question? Confronting you with this a---this---this evidence that my client have---</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    he is able to provide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Okay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Are you denying that he pays for all these?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    I’m not denying---</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    You’re not denying.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    he paying, yah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    I’m also paying also.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    That’s fine. Yes. Yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    So, this is on top of what I’ve paid. Yah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Both parties are paying, isn’t it?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Yah, correct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    That is a point. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I digress briefly to clarify that while Father’s counsel referred to R9 instead of R11 according to the transcripts, the Mother was clearly looking at the correct affidavit, in light of her answers to counsel’s questions. The Father’s counsel also specified that he was referring to the Father’s “latest affidavit”, which was R11. The same reference in R9 relates to the completely different issue of the financial documents for a property, so there could not have been any misunderstanding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother also accepted that the Father had paid at least part of the children’s expenses. In particular, the Mother also accepted that she was not able to bear witness to all the expenses that the Father spent on the children, and that the Father paid for at least some of the children’s food.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Mother also accepted that the Father passed the children money directly when asked.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In re-examination, the Mother, when pushed by her counsel, hesitantly offered a figure of $300 to $400 as the sum that the Father would spend on the children monthly. However, in the same breath, the Mother quickly added that the Father also paid for the children’s clothing when asked, and purchased for the children tickets for a Taylor Swift concert which cost more than $1,000, and that he had also bought them tickets to a Blackpink concert.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Father had also exhibited documentary proof that he had paid substantial sums for family holidays.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> Clearly, the Father was not as stingy as the Mother sometimes sought to portray him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     More confusingly, there was also a table in the Mother’s submissions where she addressed the Father’s claims on his reasonable expenses on himself<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> and the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Under the second column of the table, it was recorded that the Father claimed that he spent $3,400 per month on the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Under the third column of the same table, it was recorded that the Mother’s assessed “reasonable amount” was $2,004.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> What is this “reasonable amount”? The Mother placed this table here in her submissions with virtually no explanation. Be that as it may, this appears to be amount that the Mother accepted that the Father had been paying a month. If so, why had the Mother not given the Father credit for these payments in her calculations at paragraphs 2 and 7 of her closing submissions? Does this also not contradict her figure of $300 to $400 a month which she mentioned at trial (see preceding paragraph)? In any event, I was unable to accept the revised figure of $2,004, because the Mother’s reasons for revising the Father’s figure downwards was not put to the Father in cross-examination at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In light of the above, I considered that there was:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Lack of clarity as to the Mother’s position on extent of the Father’s contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Lack of clarity as to the extent of the Father’s contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Both were independently fatal to the Mother’s case, as the burden was squarely on her to show that the Father had failed to provide adequate maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In relation to (a), even if I had given the Mother the benefit of the doubt and accepted her position as what she had written in the letter of Court of 6 November 2023 (that the Father “was only paying the children’s meals and some expenses on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> I was unable to find in her favour because even on the Mother’s own evidence, the Father went beyond contributing to basic necessities and provided for expensive non-essential spending such as holidays and concert tickets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The lack of clarity in the sense of (b) above was more fundamental. Because of the various concessions made by the Mother that the Father had been contributing to the children’s maintenance (see [15] to [18] above), it was important that she set out her calculations on how much the Father had been actually paying, and the shortfall she had to top up. Without the numbers to back her claim, her assertion that the Father had not maintained the children adequately was nothing more than a bare assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Instead, as highlighted above, the Mother’s analysis stopped at the first step: see [13] above. At paragraph 2 of her written submissions, the Mother had claimed almost fully for the children’s reasonable expenses, without giving credit to the Father for his contributions, save for his share of the rental proceeds of a property. Insofar as the Mother sought to argue that she did not take into account the Father’s contributions because they were <em>de minimis</em>, I rejected this argument for the reasons set out in the discussion above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To be clear, it was not sufficient for the Mother to show that she had been paying part of the children’s expenses. She may had, like other loving parents, paid for expenses which went beyond what a Court would consider reasonable and necessary. It was also not sufficient for the Mother to show that her employment by the Father was terminated, or that the Father had terminated the utilities account or the tenancy at one of their properties. All these, if true, would count towards the Father’s contributions (or lack of) when the Syariah Court divides the matrimonial assets. But they did not by themselves show that there was a shortfall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Thus, on this ground alone, I found that the Mother had not proven that the Father had not been contributing adequately to the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Failure to challenge the Father’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In any event, compounding these difficulties in the Mother’s case was that almost the entirety of the Father’s cross-examination was spent on examining the Father’s assets and means, and whether parties had agreed to settle (an issue which I will address below). As a result, the Father’s evidence that he had been contributing to the children’s maintenance substantially ($3,400)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> was unchallenged in cross-examination. This is striking because the sum of $3,400 is close to the sum which the Mother claimed were the children’s reasonable expenses, a sum which was in any event significantly inflated; if necessary I would have found that the children’s reasonable expenses did not exceed $3,400: see [7] and [11] above.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I note that a brief part of the Father’s cross-examination was spent on the Father’s claims that he had been spending certain sums on the children ($1,000 on food and groceries, $200 for eating out and $1,150 for entertainment and outings).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Mother was seeking to use this aspect of the Father’s evidence to justify the Mother’s list of expenses, <em>ie</em>, because the Father was spending these sums on the children on top of the Mother’s rental proceeds which she had been spending on the children, it could be argued that the Mother’s list of expenses for the children were not inflated. At no point in this line of cross-examination was the Father’s alleged spending on the children challenged. Indeed, it appears from counsel’s strategy that he accepted the Father’s claims that he had spent those sums on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Further, the Mother, in her letter of 6 November 2023 filed (without leave) in response to the Father’s closing submissions, did not deny that the Father was not cross-examined on this issue, but instead tried to explain this inadequacy in her case by arguing that “the [Father] is well aware of the [Mother]’s case and his case was presented to the [Mother] … and the [Mother] extensively engaged the same”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> This missed the point, which was that the Mother’s case that the Father did not contribute adequately to the children’s expenses was not put <em>to the Father</em>. And while the Mother cited case law stating that the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> should not be applied rigidly, the issue of the extent to which the Father had been contributing to the children’s expenses was a key (if not, <em>the</em> key) issue in this case, and the failure of the Mother’s counsel to touch on it on cross-examination was a serious deficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In particular, as stated above at [19], the Mother explained at paragraph 14 of her written submissions her reasons (for each particular expense) for not agreeing with the Father’s claim on how much he had been spending on the children. These reasons were not put to the Father in cross-examination, and hence the Father was not given a chance to rebut the Mother’s position. For example, the Mother disagreed with many of the Father’s declared expenses on the children because the statements tendered were dated 2020, “when the marriage is [sic] still good”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> In my view, it did not necessarily follow that the Father would spend less on the children because his relationship with the Mother deteriorated. It was a point that should have been put to the Father during cross-examination. Thus, while the Father was aware of the Mother’s case <em>broadly</em>, he was not aware of the Mother’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> as to the <em>specific expenses</em> in his list of children’s expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I also note that while the Mother had argued that the rule of <em>Browne v Dunn</em> should not be applied rigidly, she also submitted that the Father had failed to put specific questions to her in cross-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> She clearly accepted that important points of a party’s case must be put to the other party. I further note that she argued that it was not put to her that her declared expenses on the children were inflated.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In my view, this was misguided. I have expressed my view above that the declared expense of $221 a month per child for holidays was extravagant. In this case, it was not disputed that both parties had spent significant sums on overseas holidays, <em>ie</em>, there was no dispute of <em>fact</em>. The question whether such expenses amounted to reasonable expenses (and whether the Court should in principle order a parent to spend on non-essentials like holidays) is a question of law that could and should be addressed in submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In light of the Mother’s failure to challenge the Father’s evidence on his spending on the children in cross-examination, it would be inequitable for this Court to reject the Father’s evidence for the reasons set out by the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> This, along with the lack of clarify of the Mother’s case as to how much the Father had been spending on the children, made it impossible for this Court to find on a balance of probabilities that the Father had neglected to maintain the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Father was aware of the children’s needs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In any event, even if there was a shortfall, the Father did not neglect to maintain the children because the Father was not aware of the shortfall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The law on the reasonableness of maintenance is set out above. Save for the eldest child’s private university fees, the Mother did not expressly communicate the children’s needs to the Father. She accepted during cross-examination that “You are right to say I never asked for more maintenance, yah”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> The Mother confirmed her answer in response to her counsel’s clarification in re-examination:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Alright. Alright. Alright. Okay. The follow up---a clarification to that when you say you decided to ask him, did you inform him of the amount you require?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Uh, no, actually, no.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Q    Okay. You---no, no, no, I---I am not---I can’t rephrase the question but I’m asking for clarification in answer to the question, right? Whether you’ve him to provide more maintenance. That was the question. Whether you did ask him to provide more maintenance. And you said that you’ve never asked for more maintenance. Right? Can you explain that? Can you clarify?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    Okay. I did not ask him for more maintenance, but I did ask him to pay for the son---the son’s tuition fee, which is part of the maintenance, lah.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother’s position is that the Father should have asked her whether she had enough money,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> and that in any event, she had asked the Father through this application.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> This is plainly not the law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>UHA v UHB</em> is instructive here because the Father here, like the father in <em>UHA v UHB</em>, had been paying some maintenance. He was not a parent who has disappeared from the children’s lives and left them to fend for themselves with their mother. He had made an effort to provide for the children, and if that was not enough, it was incumbent on the Mother to inform him before filing this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It bears noting that in a letter of clarification from Mother’s counsel dated 19 October 2023, the Mother’s counsel did not point the Court to any instance when the Mother had communicated the children’s needs to the Father, save for the eldest child’s private university tuition. While I will address the merits of the Mother’s claim on the eldest child’s private university fees separately below, I will just observe here that it is not clear why the Mother felt able to raise the question of tuition fees but no other aspects of maintenance to the Father. In re-examination, the Mother sought to explain why she did not ask the Father for additional money for the children’s maintenance:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A    I have to justify what I am spending. I have to justify to get more money. It was a chore to ask him. Right?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     If it was a “chore” to ask the Father for more money, or if there was any other unspoken reason, why was the Mother able to expressly ask the Father to pay the eldest child’s private university tuition, but not for the children’s other expenses? This, in my view, highlights the fact that the Mother had not sufficiently explained why she had not sought maintenance from the Father before the application was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Shortly before the decision of this matter was delivered, the Mother filed further submissions on 6 November 2023. A new argument in the letter was that <em>UHA v UHB</em> could be distinguished on its facts, and that the touchstone is whether the respondent in an application of maintenance must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs. The Mother submitted that because the Father had terminated her employment and the tenancy at one of their properties, the Father must have been aware that she needed more money for maintenance. I was prepared to accept the Mother’s submission that <em>UHA v UHB</em> does not require express communication in every case, and that a respondent’s awareness of the children’s needs can in principle be inferred from the circumstances. However, even if that were correct, I did not think that the circumstances were such that the Father was or ought to have been aware of any shortfall in the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Mother did not dispute that the Father had been contributing to the children’s maintenance (see the discussion from [14] above). As such, it did not necessarily follow from the Mother’s allegations of the Father’s conduct (even if true) that the children were not being reasonably maintained by either or both parents. The Father could have assumed that what he had been providing, together with the Mother’s fair contributions, were largely sufficient. In any event, it was not put to the Father that he must or should have been aware that the children were in need of maintenance because of these reasons. Thus, I did not accept, even on the Mother’s reading of <em>UHA v UHB</em>, that the Father was or ought to have been aware (even if true) that there was a shortfall in the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     For completeness, it was also significant that the Father had obliged when the children asked for money: [17] and [18] above. This showed that he was willing to pay extra if it was made known to him that the children required more money. This further cemented my view that Court intervention was not appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Private University tuition fees</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I address this expense separately because it was undisputed that the Mother had informed the Father about this expense before the claim was filed. The Mother gave evidence that when she informed the Father about the eldest child’s private university tuition fees, the Father did not want to pay because he was of the view that the eldest child should have enrolled in ITE.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> The quantum of fees can also be determined easily. Thus, the above discussion does not apply to this specific expense. I am hence prepared to consider this expense on its merits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Nevertheless, I am of the view that the Father should not, at least at this juncture, be ordered to pay the eldest child’s fees. In <em>UYT v UYU and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24272-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 8</a> (“<em>UYT v UYU</em>”), the High Court, faced with a similar situation, remarked that the Court was placed in an unenviable position to compare and assess different courses. However, this was not even possible here as the Mother’s evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> only explained why she had enrolled the eldest child in a private university – she did not lead evidence as to why she had chosen to enrol the eldest child in a private university <em>instead of pursuing other more affordable options</em>. No attempt to weigh the different options was clear from the evidence. In my view, this was a necessary step to show that the decision to enrol the eldest child into a private university was reasonable. This was especially since the fees at the private university were not negligible – the Mother was claiming more than $23,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The fact that the Mother had decided to enrol the eldest child in a private university did not mean that the Father was automatically obliged to pay for the tuition fees. As the High Court held in <em>UYT v UYU</em> at [12]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… s 69(5)(c) WC, which the court below relied upon, does not create a specific obligation on the parent to pay for the tertiary education of the child. Section 69(5)(c) is to be read with s 69(2) WC, and that is a provision for the duty of a parent to provide maintenance. Maintenance, as we know, does not mean maintaining fully or of an unreasonable amount. To say that a parent has a duty to maintain a child is not the same as saying he must pay for all the expenses of the child’s education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Further, this expense did not become reasonable simply because the Father could afford it: see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a> at [50]. It also bears emphasis that there was no Court order granting the Mother unilateral authority to make decisions on the eldest child, nor was there an order for the Father to pay for the eldest child’s general education expenses. Thus, given that the Mother had not adduced evidence as to why it was reasonable to enrol the eldest child in a private university as opposed to other more affordable options, I declined to order the Father to pay those fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For completeness, I also considered the possibility of ordering the Father to pay a reasonable amount for the eldest child’s tertiary education expenses. However, as I was not addressed on this point, nor was any evidence led on what would have been a reasonable amount, I did not make such an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Agreement</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Mother also raised a collateral issue on whether there was an agreement to settle the matter. In my view, this was not relevant save as to costs. The parties had not recorded an agreement through the offer-to-settle regime, nor had they recorded a consent order in Court. Insofar as the Mother sought to argue that parties had entered into a private agreement, this was a matter for contract law, for which this Court has no jurisdiction to apply. To be clear, this Court can take into account an agreement while making orders pursuant to s 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961, but as explained above, this was not possible because the threshold issue of neglect (which must be crossed before s 69 can be invoked) had not been crossed. There is also no order provision in the Women’s Charter 1961 that empowers a Family Court to directly enforce a private agreement on maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I considered the possibility of setting out my views on both parties’ assets and means and the maintenance I would have ordered if I were wrong on the above issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     However, I decided against that. First, doing so could result in inconsistent findings between this Court and the Syariah Court, which is hearing the divorce and the ancillary matters. It would also not have been right for this Court to serve as a forum to obtain ammunition for the Syariah Court proceedings. Thus, it would be appropriate to express my views on these issues only if absolutely necessary. Second, the Father had not had an opportunity to respond to the specific allegations on his assets and means in the Mother’s written submissions. If the proceedings were remitted back to me, I would prefer to grant the Father a right of reply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     For the above reasons, I dismissed the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I stress again that in coming to this conclusion, I assumed that the Mother’s case on the children’s reasonable expenses were reasonable, and that the Father should be responsible for all of the children’s reasonable expenses. Both assumptions were made for the benefit of the Mother and were highly unlikely to hold true if a full analysis were carried out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     I fixed costs at $30,000 to be paid by the Mother to the Father. In fixing costs, I took into the account the number of trial dates, the offer-to-settle made by the Father, and the Father’s disruptive and discourteous conduct at trial, in contrast to the Mother whom I find to be an honest and earnest witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I also note that this was an extraordinary case which had taken too long to conclude considering the nature of the matter. The Mother had served requests for discovery and interrogatories totally more than 100 items right on the doorstop of trial, which necessitated a lengthy adjournment. A large proportion of time was also spent on cross-examination of the Father’s assets and means, an issue which had become moot. The Father’s difficult conduct had also contributed to the delay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I also register my disapproval at the Mother’s filing of further submissions by way of letter on 6 November 2023 without leave. It is trite that such conduct is a discourtesy to the Court, and the Court is at liberty to disregard such submissions: <em>WJM v WNN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29555-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 18</a> at [13] and <em>VEW v VEV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/28897-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 2 SLR 380</a> at [9]. I had only addressed the arguments in the letter to show the Mother that her case would fail even if I were to consider all her arguments. It should not be taken as encouragement for any counsel to do the same in the future.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\"

District Judge Jason Gabriel Chiang:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The breakdown of any long-term relationship can bring about significant complications. The breakdown of a union involving transnational parties has the potential to bring about even more complex issues, particularly when there are disputes over the care arrangements of young children and where they should live.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This matter involved competing applications under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (“<b>GIA</b>”), by both the Father and the Mother, who were divorcing transnationals, in relation to two (2) young children: the 1<sup>st</sup> son aged 6 (“<b>Eldest Son</b>”) and the 2<sup>nd</sup> son aged 2 (“<b>Youngest Son</b>”) (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “<b>Children</b>”). The Father filed FC/OSG 8/2023 (“<b>OSG 8</b>”) and the Mother filed FC/OSG 40/2023 (“<b>OSG 40</b>”). The Father is the Plaintiff in OSG 8 and the Defendant in OSG 40 (the “<b>Father</b>”) and the Mother is the Plaintiff in OSG 40 and the Defendant in OSG 8 (the “<b>Mother</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       At the crux of this case, the Court was given the heavy task of intervening when the transnational parents could not reach a consensus on the care arrangements for their two (2) young Children, including which of two (2) countries they would reside in. Additionally, the Court also had to grapple with the issues of the custody, care and control of and access to the Children and the sharing of parental responsibilities for the maintenance of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father is in his early 40s. He was an Indian Citizen but acquired Singapore Citizenship in 2005 after completing his university studies in Singapore. He is, however, still considered as an Overseas Citizen of India (“<b>OCI</b>”; a form of permanent residency available to people of Indian origin and their spouses which allows them to live and work in India indefinitely).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother is in her mid-30s and is an Indian Citizen. She, however, acquired Singapore Permanent Residency (“<b>PR</b>”) Status in 2013. Her PR status was then renewed in 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties were married on 8 July 2012 in Singapore, and shortly thereafter, had further wedding celebrations in India. Parties only resided together in Singapore from March to December 2012 for about 9 months. Then, in 2013, the Mother relocated to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (“<b>UAE</b>”) for a period of time, with the Father making regular weekend trips to visit the Mother in the UAE. In 2014, the Parties jointly relocated to Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America (“<b>USA</b>”) for the Mother’s Master of Business Administration (“<b>MBA</b>”) studies. The Father initially only found work a state away in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, in August 2014 and would do weekly commutes to be with the Mother. He then managed to find work in Boston, USA, in May 2015 and continued to work there until 2020. The Father also managed to get a USA Green Card (i.e. USA Permanent Residency Status).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Eldest Son was born in Boston, USA on xxx 2017. The Parties continued to reside there for another 3 years thereafter. In April 2020, the Father found a new and better job in Singapore, and the Father, the Mother and Eldest Son relocated to Singapore. This was during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Mother continued to work for her USA-based company remotely, before subsequently finding work with a Singapore multinational technology company headquartered in Singapore. In June 2021, the Parties purchased a luxury condominium at the seafront (the “<b>Matrimonial Home</b>”), which was held in the Father’s sole name as the Mother was only a Singapore PR and not a Singapore Citizen. The Father applied for Singapore Citizenship for the Eldest Son, but this was withdrawn, purportedly because the Mother did not want the Eldest Son to have Singapore citizenship. This was disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In July 2021, the Eldest Son, the Father and the Mother, who was then 33 weeks’ pregnant with the Parties’ 2<sup>nd</sup> child flew to Houston, Texas, USA, for the birth of the Youngest Son on 23 August 2021. After the birth, they continued to reside there for about 3 months before returning to Singapore. It is disputed as to whose idea this was for them to have the birth of the Youngest Son in Houston, USA, but the intention was to allow the Youngest Son to have USA Citizenship, similar to the Eldest Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Thus, at all material times, the Children were USA citizens and were residing in Singapore under Long-Term Visit Passes (“<b>LTVPs</b>”). The Father did eventually apply for the Children to be Singapore PRs, purportedly without the Mother’s Consent in November 2022, after they had already left for India and this Singapore PR Status was only approved in July 2023 in the middle of the contested proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the dispute</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In March 2022, Parties encountered marital issues. Both Parties accused the other of committing abuse. In any event, it is undisputed that the Mother took the Children to India. The Parties had initially been planned for a short trip of about a week, but the Mother stayed there with the Children for about 3 months. This was the Parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> separation. Parties managed to reconcile and the Mother and the Children returned to Singapore in May 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 20 November 2022, there was an alleged event of family violence, where the Mother claimed that the Father had, among other things, strangled her. The Father also alleged that the Mother was violent to him. These allegations were disputed. While the Mother initially filed for a personal protection order in Singapore, she did not pursue it. The Mother purportedly raised these allegations for determination in Indian proceedings. As of the reporting of this decision, there has been no court determination on these allegations either in Singapore or in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     After this alleged event in November 2022, the Mother took the Children and left the Matrimonial Home to reside with a friend in Singapore. After a couple of days, she decided to take the Children overseas to India to be with her family. This was a few days earlier than an overseas trip that had been planned prior to the incident. The Father subsequently travelled to India to try to reconcile with the Mother but was unsuccessful and returned to Singapore by himself. The Mother and the Children then failed to return to Singapore from India in early January 2023 as previously planned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 17 January 2023, the Father promptly filed for the guardianship of the Children in OSG 8 and, among other things, requested for the Children to be returned to Singapore. At the 1<sup>st</sup> Case Conference for OSG 8 on 25 January 2023, by consent, the Father was granted interim virtual access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Subsequently, the Father also filed for divorce in Singapore on 21 February 2023 (“<b>Divorce Proceedings</b>”). As at the time of this decision, pleadings have completed and Parties were due to proceed with a contested divorce trial.

Both the Father and the Mother initially had legal representation, but by the time of this hearing, both of them had discharged their lawyers and were self-represented. The Father filed a Notice of Intention to Act in Person on 20 June 2023 for OSG 8 and the Divorce Proceedings. The Mother then filed her Notice of Intention to Act in Person on 8 July 2023 for OSG 8, OSG 40 and the Divorce Proceedings, after the 1<sup>st</sup> Written Submissions had been filed by her lawyers. The Father then filed a Notice of Intention to Act in Person in OSG 40 on 9 July 2023. With regard to the Mother’s initial lawyer and then, replacement lawyer, the Father made certain allegations of conflict of interest, before the Mother had discharged their services. In any event, throughout the proceedings of OSG 8 and OSG 40, both the Father and the Mother confirmed with the Court that while they did not have legal representation for the contested proceedings of OSG 8 and 40, they consulted lawyers within Singapore on various matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At the 1<sup>st</sup> half-day hearing on 11 July 2023 (the “<b>1<sup>st</sup> Hearing</b>”), significant issues were raised. Given the significant number of issues raised in the hearing, oral arguments could not be completed within that 1<sup>st</sup> half-day hearing. Additionally, Parties were directed to provide further written submissions and affidavits on a list of issues. As such, further urgent half-day hearings were fixed on 10 August 2023 (the “<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing</b>”) for the completion of oral arguments and on 31 August 2023 (the “<b>3<sup>rd</sup> Hearing</b>”) for rebuttals, decision and costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     By consent, further interim virtual access orders were made at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, which helped to clarify the Father’s and Mother’s responsibilities in facilitating such access (“<b>Interim Virtual Access Orders</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Between the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, the Father filed FC/SUM 2355/2023 (“<b>SUM 2355</b>”) in OSG 8 on 25 July 2023 for leave to commence committal proceedings against the Mother for purported breaches of the Interim virtual access orders. However, the Father decided to withdraw SUM 2355 at the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing, when procedural irregularities were highlighted to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father filed his 2<sup>nd</sup> Written Submissions on 4 August 2023 (“<b>Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions</b>”) with a supplementary bundle of authorities, and then filed a 2<sup>nd</sup> supplementary bundle of authorities on 7 August 2023. The Mother filed an Affidavit on 17 August 2023 as her written submissions on the outstanding matters (“<b>Mother’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Parties completed their oral arguments in the 2<sup>nd</sup> Hearing. A day after, the Father filed in the Divorce Proceedings on 11 August 2023, an <em>ex parte</em> application seeking a Mareva Injunction (“<b>Mareva Injunction Proceedings</b>”). The Father was heard by a duty judge on 14 August 2023 and was directed to provide further evidence and to notify the Mother. On 21 August 2023, Mareva Injunction Proceedings was heard on an <em>ex parte</em> basis, with the Mother observing on a watching brief having been provided 2 hours prior notice of the hearing. Given the evidence provided and arguments made, a Mareva Injunction was ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the 3<sup>rd</sup> Hearing on 31 August 2023, having carefully considered Parties’ 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions and various oral arguments, I rendered my oral decision. My orders are summarized as follows (more specific terms are elaborated on below in paragraph 140):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     OSG 8 was dismissed;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In relation to OSG 40:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       parties were to share joint custody of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       the Mother was allowed to remain in Noida, West Uttar Pradesh, India (“<b>Noida</b>”) for the relocation of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       until further order or written agreement between parties, the Children’s current education arrangements in Noida, shall remain as status quo;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       the Father was granted daily virtual access, and unsupervised physical access to the Children in Noida;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       the Father was to pay monthly Children maintenance of S$2,750.00 (being S$1,350.00 for each);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       there be no order as to costs; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b-p3_vii\"></a>(vii)       liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father being dissatisfied with my decision filed an appeal, HCF/DCA 87/2023 (“<b>DCA 87</b>”) for my decision in OSG 8 on 6 September 2023 and filed another appeal HCF/DCA 88/2023 (“<b>DCA 88</b>”) for my decision in OSG 40 on 7 September 2023. The Mother did not appeal against either of my decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     On 9 September 2023, the Father filed for an expedited appeal in DCA 87 and 88, which was heard on 18 and 20 October 2023 and dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Separately, since my decision in OSG 8 &amp; 40, as at the time of this reported decision, Parties have also filed other summons proceedings in the Divorce Proceedings:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Father, on 11 September 2023, also filed an application for leave to commence committal proceedings on the basis of the Mother’s failure to make disclosure pursuant to the Mareva Injunction, which was allowed on 15 September 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother filed an application to set aside the Mareva Injunction, among other things (“<b>Setting Aside Proceedings</b>”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Father filed an application for committal proceedings against the Mother (“<b>Committal Proceedings</b>”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Mother filed an application for a stay of proceedings on the basis of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in favour of Indian divorce proceedings which were filed after the decisions in OSG 8 and 40, but were purportedly yet to be served on the Father (“<b>Stay Proceedings</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The Setting Aside Proceedings was dismissed on 8 November 2023 and the Mother was found to be guilty of breaching orders of disclosure in the Committal Proceedings. Stay Proceedings have yet to be determined as of the date of this reporting. Hence, contested Divorce Proceedings have not commenced pending the determination of the Stay Proceedings. It is fairly evident that matters remain fairly contentious between the Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In the circumstances, the full grounds of my decision are provided below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Given the different positions taken by the Mother and Father, the following issues that had to be considered in this matter were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Custody of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether to reverse relocation or to order the return of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Care and Control of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Education of the Children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Access to the Children; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Children Maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There were also some preliminary issues that were raised, which I have touched on briefly before delving into the key issues:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether Singapore has the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matters;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether OSG 40 should have been applied as a summons application in the Divorce Proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the Family Court has the power to direct the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority to prevent a person from leaving Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Whether the Family Court can direct that thee be Mirror Orders in Indian Proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 1: Whether Singapore has the requisite jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matters?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The OSG 8 and 40 proceedings were complicated by the fact that the Mother had also simultaneously pursued Indian proceedings which include a custody petition and a domestic violence case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     There were no concurrent personal protection order applications in Singapore on family violence, even though the purported acts occurred in Singapore, and instead, these allegations were pursued in India. In any event, the Indian domestic violence case did not significantly overlap with the subject matter of OSG 8 and 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     However, the Mother’s custody proceedings in India had a clear overlap with both the OSG Proceedings and the Divorce Proceedings in Singapore, which could result in a multiplicity of proceedings with potentially different outcomes. The Father had claimed that his Indian Counsel had filed for the dismissal of the Mother’s case in India on jurisdictional issues, but such a hearing would take a further 6 to 8 months. It is unclear whether there has been any determination of this after my orders in OSG 8 and 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Both Parties admitted that the progress on the Indian custody proceedings had been slow and could take a few years if it is not dismissed on jurisdictional issues, whereas for the OSG 8 and 40, were heard within a few months from commencement and determination was rendered in a significantly shorter time frame.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Both Parties also acknowledged that there were mechanisms to enforce Singapore orders in India, and that deference may be given to the Singapore Orders in OSG 8 and 40 for international comity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It is noteworthy that neither side had filed for a stay of Singapore OSG Proceedings or an anti-suit injunction to prevent the Indian Proceedings from moving forward. Hence, I did not have to make a determination as to whether Singapore was the most appropriate forum to adjudicate these issues in OSG 8 and 40.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Both the Father and the Mother submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the Singapore Courts for the proceedings under the GIA and would be bound by the decisions reached in these proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 2: Whether OSG 40 should have been applied as a summons application in the Divorce Proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I move on to the next preliminary issue that was raised by the Father, of whether OSG 40 should have been a Summons Application in the Divorce Proceedings, instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     When OSG 8 was commenced, there were no divorce proceedings, but when OSG 40 was commenced, the Divorce Proceedings had already been filed. The Father initially argued that this was improper, but in subsequent submissions he acknowledged that this was not a crucial issue on hindsight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In this case, given that the Father filed OSG 8, the Mother was at liberty to file OSG 40, as this would be competing claims on an equal footing. If the Mother were to commence proceedings under the Divorce Proceedings the effect of any order made would have the status of being an interim order as opposed to a final order in the OSG matters. Additionally, I took the Mother’s point that if there were any withdrawal of the divorce, then that would invariably do away with her case. Hence there was valid practical effect to have it filed as OSG 40 instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Most importantly, there is no prohibition, in law, that prevents a party from commencing proceedings under the GIA, when there are divorce proceedings commenced. While there may be practical considerations for the management of such cases, the Mother was not incorrect in commencing OSG 40 when Divorce Proceedings had already been commenced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 3: Whether the Family Court has the power to direct Immigration and Checkpoint Authority to prevent a person from leaving Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As part of OSG 8, the Father was initially seeking an order for the Court to direct the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“<b>ICA</b>”) to prevent a person from leaving Singapore and/or removing the Children from Singapore, assuming that the Court were to agree in ordering the return of the Children to Singapore. This is very different from the power of the Court to restrain a party from taking of the Children out of Singapore pursuant to section 131 of the Women’s Charter 1961, which is imposed on the parent and not the ICA. The Father subsequently acknowledged that the Court did not have the power to order the ICA to do such things and abandoned its pursuit in response to directions for further submissions on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     As an alternative, the Father instead sought for the Children’s travel documents to be held by him or a neutral party. The possession of the Children’s Passports is an issue that does come under the ambit of custody issues, which is dealt with subsequently in this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Preliminary Issue 4: Whether the Family Court can direct that there be Mirror Orders in Indian proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In relation to the Father’s request for this Court to order that any orders made in OSG 8 and 40 be mirrored in the orders in India, I had questioned him about the legal basis for the Singapore Family Courts to make such an order to bind the Indian Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In response, the Father had cited the high court decision of <b><em>VLI v VLJ </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26340-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 27</a></b> (“<b><em>VLI v VLJ</em></b>”) decided by Justice Debbie Ong was in relation to whether the Family Courts had the power to direct a husband to apply for a pass for the wife in divorce proceedings. While this is not the same as the Husband’s request, it is an analogous on the basic principle that the Family Court cannot go beyond the provided statutes to exercise inherent jurisdiction to make orders and also applies in relation to preliminary issue 3 above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Ordering that the orders reached in Singapore be mirrored in India would be an issue of international comity. Just as our Family Courts would have to consider the foreign orders and relevant arguments before making any mirror orders in Singapore, the Family Court would not be able to insist that the Indian Couts mirror the orders made here. It would, however, be practical for the Parties to make the necessary orders to be mirrored, but the Court is in no position to impose this obligation on the Indian Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 1: Custody of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having addressed these preliminary issues briefly, I move on to the key issue of the custody of the 2 Children aged 6 and 2 years respectively. As explained to the Parties, this entailed a bundle of rights involving major decisions, such as relocation, education, religion and major medical intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Both Parties had began their respective applications both seeking sole custody of the Children. At the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing, I had highlighted to Parties to consider the landmark Court of Appeal case of <b><em>CX v CY </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a></b> (“<b><em>CX v CY</em></b>”) that for the Court to depart from the default position of joint custody, that there would need to be exceptional reasons as to why sole custody needed to be ordered (see particularly at [39] of <b><em>CX v CY</em></b>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father subsequently clarified at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing and in the Father’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Submissions that he sought sole custody for the primary reason of preventing any further purported abduction of the Children, and since considering the case of <b><em>CX v CY</em></b>, he was willing to agree to joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     With regard to the Mother’s position, she was of the view that cooperation with the Father was “<em>impossible</em>” given that the Father was purportedly raising further acrimony. The Mother had argued that if the Father were willing to work on his behavioural issues and take steps towards reducing acrimony, that only then, would she find joint custody to be appropriate. The Mother cited the Father’s purported abusive acts towards her, being allegedly deceitful in hearings and also cited an incident on 20 May 2023 where the Father had gone to the Eldest Son’s School in Noida. She had also raised the issue of the Father’s foul and abusive language over correspondence. The Mother alleged that the Father had made false accusations about access and that he had meddled with the marital finances and made unilateral decisions against the Children’s best interest and had jeopardized the Children’s education.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In relation to the allegations of abusive acts, it was undisputed that there was an alleged incident on 19 November 2022, however, the alleged violent acts were unclear save that there was a purported strangling. A personal protection order application was filed and withdrawn and that there was no determination on such allegations in the Indian domestic violence proceedings. The Mother did confirm at the 1<sup>st</sup> Hearing that there had not been any physical abuse of the Children. The Mother, however, alleged that the Father had called them names and had thrown items around the house, even though it was not directed at any particular person. These allegations, even if they could be proven to be true, did not amount to the issues of abuse that would disqualify a parent from having joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Regarding the Father’s unkind words, having reviewed both sides’ correspondence, it is fair to say that both Parties have exchanged some heated words and could have been a lot less acrimonious in their exchanges, but that also did not rise up to the level that it would make it so acrimonious to disallow joint custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Allegations of financial abuse and/or mismanagement were definitely troubling, and this would need to be further investigated in the appropriate forum at an appropriate time, but once again, that would not disqualify a parent from sharing joint custody. This similarly applied for disputes over access arrangements, while the Court may need to intervene to resolve issues, this did not warrant granting only 1 parent sole custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     On the issue of the Father’s purported unilateral decisions and messing with the Children’s education, it is noted, that the Mother has made unliteral decisions as well. The fact that there were such allegations of unilateral decisions actually makes it more pertinent that the parents were to be reminded that they cannot make major decisions on their own and that they have to make major decisions for the Children as co-parents. If such agreement was not forthcoming, then the Court would need to intervene and make the relevant decision, but only as a last resort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I agreed with the Father that as stated in <b><em>CX v CY</em></b> at [26] that has since been oft-repeated in multiple subsequent cases that “<em>the welfare of a child is best secured by letting him enjoy the love, care and support of both parents. The understanding is that a child will feel more secure if both his parents continue to be involved in his life</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In the circumstances, I found no reason to depart from the status quo of joint custody. It is in the Children’s best welfare that both their Parents remain involved in the necessary decision making for major decisions and that the Parents are reminded of this joint responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 2: Whether to reverse relocation and to order the return of the Children?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Having determined that the status quo of joint custody should be maintained, I next delve into the key issue of where the Children should reside, i.e., whether to order that the relocation of the Children to Noida be reversed and order their return to Singapore or to allow them to continue to reside in Noida.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Before we delve into the law on relocation, I first deal with the factual dispute as to whether or not the Father had consented to the Mother on the relocation, which is discuss below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Was consent provided?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Given that there was no order on custody and that joint custody remained unchanged, all major decisions for the Children should have been made jointly instead of unilaterally. The issue of relocating from Singapore to India would definitely be a major decision. Additionally, enrolling the Children in a school and applying for Permanent Residency status would also be major decision, which will be touched upon below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     With regard to this, the Mother claimed that she had embarked on the relocation with the Father’s knowledge and consent, whereas the Father insisted that she had instead abducted the Children and that all he had consented to was for her to bring the Children to India for a planned holiday, albeit a few days early.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Mother’s case was that the Court should believe her that the Father had provided consent for the relocation of the Children because:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     she and the Children had resided in India during the previous separation, between March and May 2022, after a purported incident of the Father beating her when the Eldest Son had a high fever. The Mother further asserted that in a conversation in April 2022, the Father had proposed for them to either continue living in India or to figure out how they were going to reside in Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     then in October 2022, the Mother had stated that if there were to be a divorce, she would not continue to live in Singapore and would want to go back to India, to which, the Father purportedly responded that “<em>that is for you to decide</em>”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_c\"></a>(c)     subsequently, on 20 November 2022 after the purported incident of family violence on 19 November 2022, when the Mother was staying with a friend in Singapore, the Father purportedly sent a message that “<em>[y]ou are welcome to come back anytime …. I don’t mind if you need to take them to India</em>”;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_d\"></a>(d)     additionally, in the 9 months prior, the Mother alleged that relocation had been discussed and the Father had purportedly agreed to relocating back to India; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_e\"></a>(e)     in general, the Father had purportedly allowed the Mother to “<em>figure out children’s arrangements</em>” by herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     While, on the face of this narrative, there appeared to be an agreement for the Mother and the Children to spend some time in India, there did not appear to be sufficient evidence to support the Mother’s case that the Father had unequivocally agreed to a permanent relocation of the Children to India. A past living arrangement for a separation period did not mean that there was consent for a future permanent relocation. The statements made in October and November 2022 were also ambiguous and subject to interpretation. More importantly, the purported discussions on relocating back to India were not corroborated by any documentary evidence and seem to indicate her personal views on wanting to return to India as opposed to a joint position. Additionally, just because the Mother claimed to be the primary parent making arrangements for the Children did not mean that this provided her with <em>carte blanche</em> or implicit consent for a permanent relocation of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Apposite to the Mother’s arguments, the Father strongly denied that he had provided any such consent for relocation. He had provided evidence of him sending emails to certain law firms. He claimed that this was to seek legal advice on how to apply for an injunction to prevent the Mother from removing the Children from Singapore. In this regard, the emails provided only went as far as to show that the Father was looking for legal advice, but did not specifically go towards corroborating his intention to seek an injunction. However, what is significant is that very shortly after the Mother and the Children failed to return back to Singapore after the intended date of return of 3 January 2023, the Father did apply for OSG 8 swiftly by 17 January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In the circumstances, given that the Mother had the burden to prove her assertions, I found that she had not discharged her burden to prove that the Father had provided consent for the Mother to permanently relocate the Children to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     While parties can consent to the relocation, the lack of consent is not fatal to the application. The Court can still determine whether the relocation should be allowed. In this case, the Mother had jumped the gun and unilaterally relocated herself and the Children without seeking the necessary Court intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Is the Hague Convention/International Child Abduction Act 2010 applicable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Father had initially argued that the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction (25October 1980) 1343 UNTS 89 (entered into force 1 December 1983) (“<b>Hague Convention</b>”) should apply. However, while Singapore is a signatory, India is neither a contracting party with Singapore, nor is India a signatory to this Hague Convention. Hence, there is basis for an immediate return of the Children to their place of habitual residence before this change in residence, which would have been Singapore, pursuant to section 6 of the International Child Abduction Act 2010 (“<b>ICAA</b>”). The Father then argued that by analogy, the principles applicable to the Hague Convention should also apply to the present case. However, to do so, would be circumventing the intent under the ICAA which only applies to contracting states.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Moreover, the application for the return of the child to the former place of habitual residence under the Hague Convention and the International Child Abduction Act 2010 only relate to the forum to determine issues of the child’s welfare. As clarified at [29] to [34] of <b><em>TDX v TDY </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17573-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 4</a>; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a></b> (“<b><em>TDX v TDY</em></b>”), particularly at [31], that under the Hague Convention regime, “<em>the habitual residence of the child is the sole criterion in determining which court should decide on the child’s substantive welfare</em>”. Upon application, the Court would still need to determine where the child should reside as a part of the child’s substantive welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     A clear example of this is shown in the case of <b><em>UYK v UYJ </em></b><b>[2020]] SGHCF 9; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a></b> (“<b><em>UYK v UYG</em></b>”), where the father had successfully obtained orders in the United Kingdom (“<b>UK</b>”) under their Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 (c 60) (UK), which obligated the mother and child to return to Singapore. The mother then applied for sole care and control of the child and relocation of the child from Singapore to the UK. This was granted by the district judge and upheld on appeal. Hence, even though the Hague Convention and ICAA were inapplicable in this case, given both Parties’ submission to jurisdiction, the Court is at liberty to determine the substantive child welfare issues raised in OSG 8 and 40, such as the relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relocation Principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Hence, I move on to the relevant authorities and applicable legal principles on relocation for guidance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The key principles that the Court has to consider for a relocation, as stated in the Court of Appeal case of <b><em>BNS v BNT </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a></b> (“<b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>”) is the paramount consideration of the best welfare of the children. Providing further guidance on this, is the High Court case held by Justice Debbie Ong in <b><em>UFZ v UFY </em></b><b>[2018] SGHCF 823; <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22303-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 1350</a></b> (“<b><em>UFZ v UFY</em></b>”) that 2 important factors to balance are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver: and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_71-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the children’s loss of relationship with the left-behind parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Each case is an intensely fact centric exercise. The factors that the Court can consider include “<em>the child’s age, the child’s attachment to each parent and other significant persons in the child’s life, the child’s wellbeing in her present country of residence, as well as the child’s developmental needs at that particular stage of life, including her cognitive, emotional, academic and physical needs</em>” (See <b><em>UXH v UXI </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a></b> (“<b><em>UXH v UXI</em></b>”) at [28])</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Court in <b><em>UYK v UYG</em></b>, the High Court also delved into the issue of well-settledness at [51] to [52]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">51    The Father’s case heavily emphasised C’s well-settledness in Singapore. I agreed that whether a child is wellsettled in Singapore is a relevant factor that should be given appropriate weight. It was also important, however, to bear in mind that in a globalised world, families are geographically mobile and adaptable, and the <em>weight to be placed on well-settledness will depend on other related circumstances including how many years the child has lived in that country, the age of the child, and whether that country has been the family’s home for many years.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">52    Well-settledness in a country is also not an immutable circumstance that can never change. The passage of time and support from a loving parent can enable a child to adapt well to transitions in life… [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Overall, the Courts duty is to balance all considerations for the welfare of the Children. Applying these principles, there have been cases where relocation was allowed and other cases where it was not, which a briefly reviewed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In the recent case of <b><em>UYK v UYG</em></b>, as briefly described above in paragraph 69, the mother, who was the primary caregiver, had brought the child to a planned vacation in the UK and did not return. As stated above, the child was ordered to be returned to Singapore, where, upon return, the mother applied for sole care and control and for leave to relocate, both of which were granted. The Father appealed, but the appeal was dismissed. A key factor considered was the Joint Letter of Intention that parties had entered, that provided that in the event of relationship breakdown the mother’s intention was to return to the UK, and while this was not binding, it shed light on parties’ intentions. Another issue was well-settledness of the child. In a globalised world, the weight that is to be given to well-settledness depended on related circumstances, including how many years the child lived in that country, age of the child, whether the country was the family’s home for many years, and acknowledging the child’s ability to adapt to new environments given time and support. Showing relocation to be a necessity was not a requirement but should be considered amongst other factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     It was held in that case that refusing relocation would be to compel the mother to live indefinitely in a country which was not her home where her immigration status was tenuous. The loss of relationship with the left-behind parent was an unfortunate consequence and the trauma of such loss could be mitigated by a willingness and ability of both parties to support substantial access. An inability of relocation would potentially result in a transference of insecurity and negative feelings on to the child under her primary care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     However, in <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>, relocation was not allowed. This was notwithstanding that the mother and father of the children were both Canadian citizens who were married in 2002 but relocated to Singapore and then moved to Bangkok for work in 2004 where the 2 children were born in 2006 and 2007, before returning to Singapore in 2008. Parties and the Children stayed in Singapore since then. The marriage broke down in 2011. The Court ordered joint custody and interim care and control to the mother. The High Court allowed the appeal of the father, disallowing relocation. The Court held that while a child’s welfare is closely linked to the primary caregiver, the wishes of primary caregiver were not decisive. A child would benefit from continuing to have a meaningful relationship with both parents and the potential loss of an opportunity to have a meaningful relationship the left behind parent had to be considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     In <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>, it was held that the mother displayed hostility to father and given the distance between Singapore and Canada, the existing good relationship between the children and the father would be undermined by relocation. The Court held that on scrutiny of the relocation plans, the motivation to move was to avoid unpleasantness of having to deal with the father rather than seeking emotional and psychological support. The Court further held that the children were young, and it was not appropriate to inflict this sense of displacement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     In another case of <b><em>TAA v TAB </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a></b> (“<b><em>TAA v TAB</em></b>”), the High Court disallowed the relocation. The father of the children was a Singapore citizen, whereas the mother was an American citizen. They completed their divorce in Singapore and then the father who married a woman from Spain who had Singapore PR status applied to relocate the 3 children to Spain. In that case, the children had lived their lives in Singapore and the father did not have a concrete plan on relocation to Spain and would entail him finding a new job and the children adjusting to an environment where English was not the main language of communication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In yet another case of <b><em>UXH v UXI</em></b>, the mother, father and 2 children were Portuguese and Singapore PRs. After divorce, the mother had a new British partner and sought to relocate to the UK with the children, but the Children’s entire lives had been in Singapore. Hence, the relocation was not allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     I will now apply the legal principles as elaborated on in the above cases to this present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Who was the primary caregiver of the Children?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     To determine the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver, I, first, had to consider whom amongst the parents was the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In this case, while both Parties held jobs, it was clear that the Mother, was the primary caregiver for the Children, and the Father had sought sole care and control, largely to allow him to take back the Children from India if an order was made in his favour. There were hardly any arguments from the Father about how he was the one taking primary care of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Conversely, the Mother had breast fed each of the Children till age 1, was responsible for attending to their daily meals, cleaning and grooming. She was involved in the planning of their activities and was in charge of dropping off and picking the Children up from school, even while they were in Singapore. As the Mother described it, the general day-to-day decisions for the Children were largely made by her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Thus, having determined the Mother to be the primary caregiver of the Children, had to consider what her reasonable wishes were and balance this off with the Children’s potential loss of relationship with the left-behind parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity &amp; Motive of Relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     In this case, there was no immediate necessity for relocation. While the Mother was fully entitled to decide not to reside with the Father, living separately from the Father, did not require relocation to another country. The Mother was a Singapore PR, so her residency status was not in issue and she was well able to continue work in Singapore. In fact, as of the time of the decision, she had continued working for the Singapore multinational company whilst in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     The above-mentioned factors were in favour of the Father’s position. However, as held in <b><em>UYK v UYJ</em></b> [at [67] to [69], necessity was not a requirement, and should be considered with other factors.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     The Mother had explained that she wanted to extricate herself from the home environment and wanted to protect the Children from the Father’s alleged behaviour. The Mother had initially sought refuge at a friend’s home but had to leave and decided to go to Noida, India earlier than initially scheduled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     While Noida is not a location in India that Parties had spent significant time in before, this is where the Mother’s has family support had moved to and her extended family actively assist her in the care of the Children. So, in this case, it was not that the relocation was to avoid unpleasantness of having to deal with the Father rather than seeking emotional and psychological support, unlike in <b><em>BNS v BNT</em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     As the case law previously cited also suggests, the wellbeing of the Primary Caregiver is closely related to the wellbeing of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     Based on text messages exchanged between the Parties, it was explicit that the Mother was desirous of not staying in Singapore if Parties were to get a divorce, and she had already spent a stint of time in India with the Children and her family during an earlier period of separation. To order for the Children to be returned to Singapore would mean that the Mother would have to leave her family support system and return to Singapore, where she does not have a home to go to as the Father insisted on still residing there and she did not want to cohabit in the same home as the Father. Hence, the ordering of the return of the Children would present a logistical challenge and would strain parties’ finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The effect this would have on the Mother had to be taken into consideration as it could also adversely affect the care of the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ Connection to Singapore – were the Children well-settled in Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Next, I considered how well-settled the Children were in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     In this case, as stated above, the Father was a Singapore Citizen, and was also an Overseas Citizen of India with a USA Green Card. The Father was originally an Indian Citizen but gained citizenship after studying in Singapore sometime in 2005. Thereafter, the Father lived in the USA, Norway and London for significant stretches of time. The Mother was an Indian Citizen and a Singapore PR since 2013. This PR status was renewed in 2018 and was still valid as of the time of this reporting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     Parties were married in Singapore in early July 2012, but conducted their ceremonies in India on the later part of July 2012. Parties had only been residing in Singapore from March to December 2012, before the Mother moved to the UAE and then both parties moved to the USA. Hence, substantially, the Parties had only been living together in Singapore for about 10 months before their return in April 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The Children were USA Citizens and Overseas Citizens of India and were originally only in Singapore under LTVPs that were valid till October 2023. However, after the Mother had left with the Children, the Father applied for and obtained Singapore PR statuses for the Children as of July 2023. The Father claimed that this was with the Mother’s consent, but the Mother has vehemently denied granting consent. Notably, Singapore PR status for the Children had only been applied for when Parties were not on good terms, and the Mother and the Children had left for India in November 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Eldest Son who was 6 years old, was not born in Singapore but in the USA and remained there with his parents until he was about 3 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Parties relocated to Singapore in April 2020. This coincided with the Father finding new employment in Singapore. The Mother relocated but continued to work remotely for her USA company, but then transitioned to her current job with the Singapore multinational company.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     It was undisputed that in 2021, the Matrimonial Home in Keppel Bay, Singapore was purchased where Parties and the Children resided at.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    But in July 2021, the Parties moved back to the Texas, USA for about 3 months for the birth of the Youngest Son who was born in late August 2021. Regardless of who had planned for this, going to Texas, US, was purposefully engineered for the Youngest Son to obtain USA Citizenship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    It is undisputed that between March and May 2022, the Parties were separated and the Mother and the Children had resided in India, albeit not Noida, for this period of time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    It is also undisputed that the Mother and the Children left for India on 21 November 2022, and have remained there since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    So, in summary, the Children had not spent much time living in Singapore:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_103-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Eldest Son had stayed in Singapore for about just under 2 years out of his 6 years of life (i.e. 9 months in 2020, 9 months in 2021, and 7 months in 2022); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_103-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Youngest Son had stayed in Singapore for about 10 months out of his 2 years of life (i.e. 3 months in 2021, 7 months in 2022).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>During such time, the Children were residing in Singapore only on an LTVP (Singapore PR status was only obtained after they had left Singapore).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    While enrichment programs were attended by the Eldest Son in Singapore, he had not entered into the formal Singapore school system. It was unclear if there was an intention to send him to local schools of international schools: the Father claimed he was considering local school, whereas the Mother was of the view that they were looking at international schools. Also, his kindergarten studies were disrupted by a 3-month travel to the USA for the birth of the Youngest Son. The Eldest Son had purportedly attended 4 different schools in the US, Singapore and India. The Youngest Son, at his young age, had not much of a social life in Singapore. I was also cognizant of the fact that in almost all of the audio recordings provided by the Father in support of his case, that the Eldest Son spoke primarily in Hindi, and not one of the 4 national languages of Singapore, to the Father and the Father also spoke largely Hindi with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    Furthermore, while the Parties made connections with friends in Singapore, they appeared to mostly be of the expatriate community as seen by the persons that they got to file affidavits of support for each of their applications. Moreover, they had relocated in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic where there were restrictions, and the Father was unable to present sufficient evidence of the Parties and the Children having integrated into Singapore culture. In the circumstances, there was insufficient evidence to support the Father’s assertion that Singapore was the Children’s domicile or that they were well-settled in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    It is curious to note that the Children being born to a Singapore Citizen, would have normally availed them to the option of obtaining Singapore Citizenship, but such Singapore Citizenship was not pursued at any material point in time while the Parties were jointly residing in Singapore. The Father only belatedly sought, in OSG 8, an application seeking the authority to apply for Singapore citizenship for them without the Mother’s consent, which was also not allowed, given the ultimate decision reached and that the issue of citizenship being a major decision that the Parents with joint custody should reach a decision on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Other factors relating to the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    As stated above in paragraph 72, <b><em>UXH v UXI</em></b> guides that the Court should consider the factors relating to the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In this case, the Children have already undergone several changes in their young age, having relocated from the USA to Singapore and then spending a period of time in the USA and in India before remaining in India for the last 10 months in Noida prior to the decision. The Children being young would mean that they could very well adapt to a change in environment without significant difficulty. Based on the evidence provided, it appeared to suggest that the Children had grown largely accustomed to their living arrangements in Noida.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    The Eldest Son had started primary schooling in Noida, in 2023, albeit by way of enrolment made by the Mother unilaterally. As opposed to kindergarten studies which were more flexible, for the Eldest Son to return to study in Singapore, this would be a tectonic shift in the education system, which must be given due consideration for the Children’s best welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    What appeared to be significant was that the Children have the support of the Mother’s parents in Noida, as well as the Mother’s sister and brother-in-law. The Mother’s family appear to be close-knit and the Children appear to be comfortable in their care. I have to acknowledge that the Children’s connection with the extended maternal family in Noida, India, was fairly significant. There also appears to be well-settled arrangements for the care of the Children and the education for the Children, particularly the Eldest Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    Conversely, in Singapore, there were no further familial support systems, instead, the Father’s mother resides a few hours away from where the Mother resided. If the Mother were to be ordered to relocate with the Children back to Singapore, it is unclear where they would reside. The Father insisted on remaining in the Matrimonial Home and if the Mother refused to reside with him, this would entail her obtaining alternative accommodations in Singapore and also setting up wholly new arrangements for the care and education of the Children. This would be without the support of the Mother’s extended family who are in Noida, India. The Father did not provide any concrete plans for how such care could be effected in Singapore, save that he wanted to have care and control of the Children and that he would be assisted by a domestic helper for such care, while attending to his full-time work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    A factor that was of some concern was the effectiveness of ordering any interventions for the Children, if they were to remain in Noida, India. Counselling, and evaluation reports could only be done when the Children and Parties were largely physically in Singapore. Hence, if the Children were to remain outside of Singapore, that would be a limitation in the intervention that can be ordered. However, notably this was not one of the accepted factors for the Court to consider for relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    Notably, in the few cases cited where relocation was not allowed, a common factor was that there were no concrete plans on relocation, and it would entail significant upheaval for the Children. The proposed relocation in those cases also had little connection or significance for the children. Whereas in this case, there were already firm arrangements in place, and India had a significant connection to parties and the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Loss of Relationship to the Father</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    If relocation were allowed to persist, it would invariably affect the Father’s relationship with the Children. While the regular virtual access had afforded the Father with some contact, physical access with the Children would be more substantial. While the Mother had offered to provide the Father with access in Noida, India, the Father was of the view that he would be at risk if he were to travel to India. The Father alleged that the Mother’s father had political ties and that he had encountered significant difficulties during an attempted access in May 2023, where the Indian Police had been called down, and he had to spend significant time in questioning. In this regard, while allegations were made and a video with transcripts provided showing a tense exchange between parties over who was able to spend time with the Eldest Son, I found that the Father’s assertions that he was unable to exercise access in Noida, India to be unsupported in evidence. In any event, the Father had decided not to have any further physical access until OSG 8 and 40 were fully determined. It is noted that after the order was made, the Father appears to have exercised regular access to the Children in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    While the Father being in a separate location from the Children, is a significant impediment to their bonding, this can be ameliorated with robust access arrangements including physical and virtual access. Both the Father and Mother were earning substantial income, and the Father’s travels to and from to Noida, India, while being an inconvenience, could be well managed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    Generally, it appeared that the Father still maintains a fairly good relationship with the Eldest Son despite the distance and the Father has also spent some time developing a relationship with the Youngest Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Balancing the Considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    Hence, in favour of allowing relocation to Noida, India, to persist included:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Children’s lack of significant connection to Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother’s support systems in India and the Children’s well-settledness in India instead of Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the concrete plans which were already in place for the Children’s care in Noida, India instead of Singapore; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_117-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the primary caregiver’s relocation was based on reasonable reasons of family support and her wellbeing would affect the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    In favour of ordering a return of the Children to Singapore included:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_118-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the loss of relationship for the Father;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_118-p2_b\"></a>(b)     relocation was done unilaterally by the Mother and should not be condoned; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_118-p2_c\"></a>(c)     there was no immediate necessity for relocation as Mother had PR status and the Children could reside in Singapore on LTVPs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    Overall, on balance, the Children’s lack of substantial connection to Singapore, the Mother’s support system in Noida, India, and the Children’s strong connection to the Mother’s extended family there and the concrete plans which have been effectuated, to me, presented as stronger factors showing that the Children’s best welfare was better served with allowing them to continue to reside with the Mother in Noida, India. While the Mother’s actions to unilaterally relocate the Children was wrong, ultimately the decision was reached on the Children’s best welfare and disapproval of the Mother’s actions can be achieved through the means of costs or other measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    In the circumstances, I allowed the Children to continue to reside in Noida, India and did not order for their return. However, given that the Mother had unilaterally relocated the Children, the Father should be compensated with costs, which is discussed subsequently in paragraphs 141 to 143.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 3: Care &amp; Control of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    With regard to the care and control of the Children, the Father had initially sought sole care and control but subsequently pivoted to consider shared care and control, whereas the Mother had also sought sole care and control to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    Given the Children residing in Noida, India and the Father continuing to reside in Singapore, shared care and control across countries would be impractical. As stated above, it was clear that the Mother has and continues to be the primary caregiver of the Children. In the circumstances, there was no reason to not grant sole care and control of the Children to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 4: Education of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    The Father had expressed a desire for the Children to study in a Singapore Public School, whereas the Mother preferred for them to go to an international school. Given that that I allowed the Children to remain in Noida, India, I did not find any reason to disturb the current education arrangements. The Father also provided no alternative schooling options in India. However, as this matter was something that needed to be further determined in the ancillary matters in the Divorce Proceedings, I reserved this for reconsideration at such time, when more complete evidence would be in place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 5: Access to the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    In relation to access, pursuant to the cases such as <b><em>BKJ v BKK </em></b><b>[2013] SGDC 26</b>, overnight access should be the default position unless there are strong grounds against it and the Courts should be slow to deny overnight access as it would be normally helpful for the development of the parent-child bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    In that case, District Judge Colin Tan had summarized the well-held principle that overnight access should be approached from the perspective of the child’s best welfare and the child’s rights to spend time with their respective parents. The child should be equally entitled to overnight access with the father as he is with the mother, unless there is evidence to disprove either party’s eligibility, such as a history of abusive or negligent parenting. Even though the child is asleep during a part of the overnight access, there is an intangible value of building up familiarity, being able to say good morning to or to have a particular storybook read by the parent before the child goes to bed, these are important opportunities to build bonds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    In the circumstances, I found not reason not to order for overnight unsupervised access with the Father for both of the Children, provided that the Father has another adult present with him, such as his mother. This is because there has not been cogent evidence provided that the Father was incapable of caring for a the children independently overnight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    While the Mother had raised certain concerns over the Father, there was no cogent evidence presented on how he was a risk to the Children. Additionally, she acknowledged that he was never physically abusive to the Children. In light of this, the norm of unsupervised overnight access was allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    Given the logistics of travel and the Father’s full time work, I ordered that the Father be able to have 2 weekends of access to the Children every month. As held in <b><em>BLD v BLE </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGDC 0333.xml')\">[2013] SGDC 333</a></b> (“<b><em>BLD v BLE</em></b>”) at [34], weekend time with school-going children is important and where the bulk of parent-child bonding takes place given the realities of modern life. So, the Mother should also have 2 weekends per month with the Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    I did not grant any overseas school vacation access to the Father at this juncture, given the dispute between parties over where the Children should reside, but reserved it to be reconsidered in the ancillary matters for the Divorce Proceedings. The full terms of the access are described below in paragraph 140(d).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key Issue 6: Children Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    While both Parents are equally responsible for the maintenance of the Children, this may not translate in equal financial contributions. The sharing of this financial responsibility would correspond with their financial means and capacities. This position was affirmed in the recent decision of <b><em>WBU v WBT </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Income of Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    For the Mother, taking an average of her take home income for Year of Assessment (“<b>YA</b>”) 2022 and 2023 from her Notices of Assessment (“<b>NOAs</b>”) of:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_131-p2_a\"></a>(a)     YA 2022: 288,796 – 19,713 (CPF deduction) = S$269,083; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_131-p2_b\"></a>(b)     YA 2023: 228,761 – 18,279 (CPF deduction) = S$210,482.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>Her average annual income works out to be S$239,782.50, which is a monthly average of S$19,981.88.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    Even though the Father claimed he was earning less than the Mother, by averaging his income for YA 2021 and payslips for YA 2022 and YA 2023 (as these NOAs were not provided):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_132-p2_a\"></a>(a)     YA 2021: 345,276 – 20,400 (CPF deduction) = S$24,876 annual income, and thus, a monthly average of S$27,073;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_132-p2_b\"></a>(b)     YA 2022: 253,499.72 annual (after CPF deduction), and thus a monthly average of S$21,124.97; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_132-p2_c\"></a>(c)     YA 2023: 232,364.65 annual (after CPF deduction), and thus a monthly average of S$19,363.72.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>His average monthly income amounted to S$22,520.56.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    However, I accepted the Mother’s point that if the Court were to observe the receipt of monthly salary into the Father’s bank account, his current salary would be S$27,103.24. This was the sum that the Father had been receiving regularly into his UOB account from January to June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    As briefly touched on, the Father failed to provide his NOAs for YA 2022 and 2023 (which would be income earned in 2021 and 2022), because they were purported unavailable. The Father’s narrative on this is put into serious question, when the disclosure was allowed as late as August 2023. It was quite unbelievable that the NOAs for the income earned for the previous year would not be ready as of such time. Even if the Father was disputing the assessment, he could have provided the disputed NOAs or his 1R8A Form for income tax, but he did not. Given that this regular monthly income received into his bank account does not even account for the average bonuses for the year, which I do not have insight into, I found it fair to consider the sum of S$27,103.24 to represent the Father’s most recent income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    In the circumstances, given their joint monthly income of S$47,085.12, their

id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    In general, the Father’s estimates were significantly too low and not representative of what would be the Children’s reasonable expenses and some of the Mother’s claimed sums were largely inflated. For certain specific requests, I elaborate on why these sums were disallowed or reduced as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_a\"></a>(a)     given that the Mother and the Children were residing with the Mother’s parents, with no immediate plans to move to her own residence, no rental income has been incurred. In the circumstances, such claimed amount was not allowed at this juncture, and can be pursued for variation if there was a material change in circumstances, such as the Mother moving out with the Children to a new residence that she has to rent;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the claimed fees for a domestic helper of S$1,355.20 a month was excessive for a family of 3, where there already is a cook, a nanny, a driver and a cleaning service engaged which were paid for by the Mother’s family. In the circumstances, I adjusted the sums down to a reasonable rate of S$750 per month, which was comparable to the costs of domestic helper and levy fee in Singapore;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_c\"></a>(c)     for the Youngest Son’s education, I note that they were not yet incurred, but were due to be incurred in a few short months. As such, given the imminent expenses, I allowed it on the basis the Youngest Son would either be in childcare or enrolled in school shortly; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_137-p2_d\"></a>(d)     with regard to the registration fees this would not be a recurring sum, and as such, I excluded such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    Overall, I found the monthly expenses of S$4,538.61 per month to be reasonable for the 2 Children and commensurate with the lifestyle that the Parties ad previously been enjoying, particularly given their relatively substantial monthly income. I further found it fair to order that the Father bears a 58% share of such reasonable expenses, which amounted to S$2,632.39, but this was rounded up to S$2,7000 to take into account various miscellaneous fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    That would be a sum of S$1,350 per Child per month, which was well within each Parties’ means to afford. This was still the case, even when accounting for the Mareva Injunction imposed against the Mother in the Divorce Proceedings, which allowed her monthly withdrawals of S$8,000, and payment of her taxes and legal fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Full Order of Court</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    In the circumstances, having considered all these issues, I dismissed OSG 8, as the substantive issues of custody, care and control, access, child maintenance and relocation were instead dealt with in OSG 40.

However, as this was not previously raised before and no evidence had been led on this, I did not allow such a submissions at such a late stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    Separately, having delivered the decision at the 3<sup>rd</sup> Hearing, I invited Parties to make arguments on the costs. The Mother submitted that she had incurred S$25,000 in legal fees thus far and was desirous of the Father paying her such costs. The Father estimated that he spent between S$40,000 to S$50,000 on legal fees in Singapore and another S$10,000 to S$15,000 in India (i.e. between S$60,000 and S$75,000).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    While the Father was successful on the issue of joint custody, the Mother was successful on the significant issues of care and control and the relocation. For the access arrangements, it was a compromise between both sides’ positions and for Children Maintenance, both were far off the mark and the Court made an order that was in the middle ground. Overall, the Mother was more successful on the substantial points. While costs are usually only provided when parties had legal representation, both Parties had began with lawyers and both acknowledged that they sought legal advice of Singapore lawyers for the proceedings. In the circumstances, I was minded to allow costs of S$8,000 to take into account the amounts paid for disbursements and their seeking of legal advice, even though they were largely not legally represented in the hearings. However, I also had to take into account the fact that the Mother had unilaterally relocated the Children without submitting the disputed issue to the Court to determine the issue before taking further steps. In the circumstances, I found it fair to make no order as to costs, so as to indicate the Courts disapproval for such unilateral actions taken by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    I appreciated that both Parties had to grapple with complex legal issues as litigants in person after having discharged their lawyers. However, I would be remiss not to point out that even though both Parties did not have formal representation, they had acknowledged that they were receiving legal advice on the arguments in OSG 8 and 40. Having said that, both Parties were intelligent, well-spoken and did their best to argue their cases. They acquitted themselves nicely in their oral arguments but were, at times, unfocused and significant time had to be spent on procedural issues and refocusing them on the legal basis for certain arguments. While they had to be reminded about decorum on occasion, the oral submissions were largely civil even though the issues were hotly contested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    I did not come to my decision lightly, as I understood the significant repercussions that it would have on Parties and the Children as well as the extended family. As such, I gave both the Father and the Mother ample opportunities to address me on further evidence and submissions after raising my concerns with them, while also setting reasonable timeframes to ensure that decision was rendered within a fairly short time frame, taking into consideration the complexity of the issue sand the breadth of evidence provided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    In my decision-making process, I had to consider the matter carefully and did go back and forth on the merits of each Parties’ cases. In the best case scenario, Parties should have been able to have civil discussions with each other to reach a consensus on such important issues for the Children, however, they were unable to do so and the Court thus had to intervene. Ultimately, I made the difficult decision on the various issues based on established case law and principles which puts the Children’s best welfare as the paramount consideration.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Relocation"],"date":"2023-11-24","court":"Family Court","case-number":"D 5714/2016 (FC/SUM 1740/2023)","title":"WRT v WRU","citation":"[2023] SGFC 38","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F30720-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff in Person","Mr Ng Kiat Han (Advance Law LLC) for the defendant"],"timestamp":"2023-11-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Chia Wee Kiat","html":"<root><head><title>WRT v WRU</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WRT <em>v</em> WRU </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30720-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGFC 38</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">D 5714/2016 (FC/SUM 1740/2023)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">24 November 2023</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Chia Wee Kiat </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Plaintiff in Person; Mr Ng Kiat Han (Advance Law LLC) for the defendant </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> WRT — WRU </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Relocation</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">24 November 2023</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Chia Wee Kiat:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff shall be referred to as the “Father” and the Defendant shall be referred to as the “Mother”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties were married on 26 March 2011 and have two children born to the marriage, [G] and [K].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> G turned 12 in September 2023 and K turned 10 in November 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Owing to parties’ irreconcilable differences, the Father filed for divorce on 25 November 2016 and Interim Judgment (“IJ”) was granted on 15 May 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> The IJ was made final on 19 February 2018.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 31 May 2023, the Mother filed FC/SUM 1740/2023, an application to vary the IJ to allow the children to relocate to the United States of America (“USA”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       At the hearing of the application on 17 August 2023, the Mother requested that I interview the children.

Although the legal principle is simple in concept, the challenge lies in its application to each unique case (see <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> (“<em>TAA</em>”) at [7]). As noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>BNS</em> (at [2]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Cases of this nature are never easy to decide. As Mostyn J observed pithily in the English High Court decision of <em>Re AR (A Child: Relocation)</em> [2010] EWHC 1346 (Fam) at [4], “[t]hey involve a binary decision – either the child stays or he goes” and hence, whichever way the court decides, the decision is bound to cause considerable pain and anguish to one of the parties. The relocating parent will be aggrieved by a refusal of the application as that ostensibly ties him or her down, against his or her wishes, to an environment which he or she has little affinity towards. On the other hand, it is the left-behind parent who suffers if the relocation application is allowed because that naturally curtails not just the quantity but also the quality of that parent’s contact with the child (or children).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The welfare of the child involves a consideration of different factors. In <em>UFZ v UFY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22303-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 4 SLR 1350</a> (“<em>UFZ</em>”), Debbie Ong J provided the following guidance (at [8]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The inquiry of what is in the welfare of the child involves a consideration of a multitude of factors. Relocation applications involve one parent exercising his or her authority to relocate the child to another jurisdiction. Two important factors that will come into play will unsurprisingly be: (i) the reasonable wishes of the primary caregiver; and (ii) the child’s loss of relationship with the ‘left-behind’ parent (<em>BNS</em> at [28]). These factors, amongst others, are pertinent in helping the court assess what the best interests of the child are. This assessment is “<b><em>an intensely fact-centric exercise</em></b>” [emphasis in original] (<em>BNS</em> at [28]) and will remain a very difficult one in all relocation cases. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As regards the weight to be given to the various factors, the Court of Appeal in <em>BNS</em> (at [22]) provided the following guidance:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[T]here can be <em>no pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy</em> among the many composite factors which may inform the court’s decision as to where the child’s best interests ultimately lie: where these factors stand in relation to one another must depend, in the final analysis, on <em>a consideration of all the facts in each case.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(1)   Reasonable wishes of primary caregiver</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As noted above, an important factor the court will consider in a relocation application is the reasonableness of the primary caregiver’s wishes to relocate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the present case, the Mother’s reason for relocation was her engagement with her fiancé B.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> The Mother wishes to move to the USA to be with B and has expressed her intention to marry him in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Although the Mother’s intended marriage to B will be her third one, her wish to move on to the next stage of her life is understandable. Afterall, the Mother is divorced from the Father. This is acknowledged as much by the Father who “wished her well in her new marriage”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     That said, the Mother’s relocation to the USA with the children will result in the physical separation of the children from the Father. Indeed, the same difficulty was noted in <em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a> (at [18]) (“<em>UXH</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A divorced parent can certainly move on with life with a new partner. Indeed, there are many reconstituted families formed by divorced parties who move on to marry a second time, or even a third time. No difficulty in respect of a loss of relationship with a left-behind parent arises when the reconstituted family resides in the same country as the other parent. In the present case, however, the Mother’s wish directly affects the Father’s relationship with the Children because she and her partner have plans to relocate to the UK, which will result in physically separating the Children from the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In <em>UXH</em>, the court quoted with approval the following observation of the lower court (at [22]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… In my view, where relocation is a matter of choice, the reasonableness of the wish of the primary caregiver would have to be evaluated against the impact of the relocation on the welfare of the children …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the present case, there is no evidence to suggest that the Mother cannot stay put in Singapore. The Mother and the children are all Singapore citizens. The Mother’s evidence that B “will have to leave his wonderful job in the USA to move to Singapore, if it is even allowed” suggests that she has not given sufficient consideration or seriously explored the alternative option of having B relocate to Singapore, which would be less disruptive to the stability that the children currently enjoy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It seems to me that the Mother’s decision to relocate is a matter of choice, and not borne out of necessity. That being the case, the reasonableness of the Mother’s wish will have to be evaluated against the impact of the relocation on the welfare of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(2)   Loss of children’s relationship with the Father </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As noted in <em>TAA</em> (at [19]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A relocation of children to another jurisdiction is a serious matter. It would mean a fundamental change in whom the children would see as their close family and the children would lose the experience of hands-on parenting from both their mother and their father (see <em>K v K</em> [2011] EWCA Civ 793). <b>The court must give sufficient weight to the loss of the children’s relationship with the left-behind parent</b> …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in bold added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In <em>BNS</em>, the Court of Appeal explained (at [25]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is axiomatic that a child benefits from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of <em>both</em> parents in his or her life and this does not cease to be true upon the breakdown of marriage. Relocation, however, represents a serious threat to this ideal state of joint parenting since the left-behind parent would, as its appellation suggests, become less of a presence in the child’s new life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Court of Appeal emphasised (at [26]) that although the loss to the child of his or her relationship with the left-behind parent is an important consideration, it is, like that of the wishes of the primary caregiver, not to be treated as having determinative weight or as being decisive in every case. How adversely the loss of that relationship will impact on the child’s welfare is a matter that depends on the facts, in particular, the strength of the existing bond between the left-behind parent and the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Court of Appeal elaborated further (at [26]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In general, the stronger the bond, the larger the resultant void in the child’s life if relocation is allowed, and, accordingly, the weightier this factor must be in the overall analysis. Indeed, it may <em>further</em> be appreciated that it is only when there is a <em>subsisting</em> relationship between the left-behind parent and the child that one can properly speak of there being a “<em>loss</em>” of that relationship upon relocation. As has been astutely contrasted in <em>Ong</em> at para 9.42, the severance of an already functioning (if not blossoming) relationship will generally be both more agonising and disruptive to the child than if the effect of relocation was, relatively speaking, merely to hamper the “<em>building</em>” up of that particular parent-child relationship:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">There is a difference between the trauma and harm to a child arising from the <em>loss</em> of a close relationship and the benefits of <em>building</em> a relationship with both parents. Where the relationship between the child and non-custodial parent is not close, it may still be beneficial for the law to support the maintenance of this relationship or encourage parties to strengthen the relationship. However, if this must be sacrificed because of pressing reasons for relocation, it may be the less harmful choice for the child. In contrast, where a <em>loss</em> of a close relationship is concerned, the harm to the child may not justify the sacrifice. [emphasis in original]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In the present case, the Mother contends that the relocation will not jeopardise the relationship between the Father and the children as the children have never been close to the Father even before the divorce. The Mother says that there were minimal interactions between the Father and the children ever since they were little and this has not changed to the present day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     This is disputed by the Father. The Father says that he has always tried very hard to bond with the children but the Mother will find ways to prevent the children from getting close to him.

This is borne out as much by the evidence of the Father. However, as noted in <em>BNA</em>, where the relationship between the child and non-custodial parent is not close, it may still be beneficial for the law to support the maintenance of this relationship or encourage parties to strengthen the relationship. In my view, this factor is especially important in the present case given that there are no pressing reasons for relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The current bond between the children and the Father has weakened due to the ongoing conflict, but the relationship is salvageable with appropriate intervention and more opportunities of bonding and interactions between the children and the Father. The children are still young and would benefit from the nurturing presence and joint contribution of both parents in their lives. By relocating now, it would force an inevitable end to the relationship for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I note, in this regard, that similar concerns were expressed in <em>TAA</em> (at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Mother is now fighting to spend time with the children and rebuilding her relationship with them. She had been an involved parent until the marriage broke down. Whatever may have been the true state of the circumstances during the years 2009 to 2014, the difficulties during that time had caused issues between the Mother and the children such that they are no longer as close as they were prior to the marriage breakdown. In fact, there is tension in their relationship. Does this then mean that the mother-and-children relationship should never be supported any further? Are the children to simply live without their Mother in their lives from now on, erase the earlier childhood memories of their relationship with her and move on without their mother in their lives? The reality here is that when the Father and children relocate to Spain, the Mother's access to the children will be more difficult than ever before. The Father's position appeared to be that he could not do anything more to facilitate access if the children themselves did not want to see or talk to their Mother. There was no evidence of any discussion between the parents on the proposed move to Spain, nor on any arrangements on how access could continue when the children left for Spain in September. It is doubtful anything will improve in terms of greater encouragement and support for access by the Father when they live in Spain for the longer term. There is no evidence of efforts by the Father to be supportive of access; instead, there appears to be support for the children to write letters that they do not wish to spend time with the Mother. Thus, relocation to Spain is likely to sound a death knell to the relationship between the Mother and the children. If the children remain in Singapore, their relationship with their Mother could get better, or it might not. Life is not predictable. But relationships are dynamic and it would be a disservice not to give the children the opportunity of building a positive relationship with their mother. The father is also obliged by the law to be a cooperative parent, to actively support the building of the relationship, for this is in the welfare of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">(3)   Children’s wishes</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Mother submits that the children have often expressed their wishes to relocate to the USA.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     However, as acknowledged by the Mother herself,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> the children’s wishes, while relevant, are not determinative. In <em>TQ v TR</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) 971 (at [20]), for example, although the son had expressed his wish to study in the Netherlands, the Court of Appeal decided that it would be best, having regard to all the circumstances, that he remain in Singapore with the Mother, instead of returning to the Netherlands with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Similarly in <em>VDU v VDT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24096-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 15</a>, in response to the mother’s submission that the access terms must accord with the children’s wishes, i.e., that the father should not be allowed access to the children if the children did not want to meet him, the court expressed the following concerns:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is in the best interests of a child for him to maintain links with both of his parents (see <em>UYK v UYJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24728-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 9</a> at [65]). The Children, being young, may not appreciate the importance of maintaining the links with the Husband, and thus it is not in their best interest to allow the Husband access only when the Children feel like meeting him. Moreover, the Husband has moved out of the Matrimonial Home and away from the Children since as early as 2012. The Children would thus have necessarily became somewhat estranged from the Husband, and there is a real possibility that the Children would be unwilling to meet with him. In the circumstances, to subject the Husband’s access to the Children’s wishes would not help improve their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the present case, the children’s wishes must be viewed against the fact that they are still young and may not fully appreciate the importance of maintaining their links with both parents and the significance of the loss of relationship with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Furthermore, the relocation to the USA calls for major adjustments. For the Mother, this would be her third marriage, but first cross cultural marriage, leaving a familiar environment that she has lived for more than 40 years to relocate to a new country with no social support except the new husband and his family. For the fiancé, this would be his first marriage, and a first to a Singaporean divorcee with two pre-teens. Aside to adjustments for new marriages, he will have to deal with cross culture issue, and new experience not just as a parent, but a “step” parent to two pre-teen daughters from different culture. For the children, they will have to be uprooted from a familiar environment to a new environment with little family and social support. Apart from having to adapt to a reconstituted family, they will have to adapt to a new environment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     While the Mother has brought the children for holiday to the USA to experience how it is like to stay in the USA, the impact of relocation vis-à-vis a temporary vacation is different (see <em>WNO v WNP</em> [2023] SGCF 19 (at [47]). It would not be wise to expect the children to fully appreciate the impact of the relocation at such young age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     To reiterate, the welfare principle of the child is paramount and this principle overrides any other consideration. As the Mother has the real option of staying in Singapore and the relocation if allowed would result in the children’s loss of relationship with the Father, I do not find the wish to relocate to be a reasonable one.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Moreover, there is no presumption at law in favour of relocation even if the primary caregiver’s desire to relocate is not unreasonable. As noted in <em>UXH v UXI</em> (at [11]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… While the wishes of parents may have a bearing on the welfare of the child, the court must determine if those wishes are incompatible with the interests of the child; where they may not be compatible, the law expects parents to put the interests of the child before their own (<em>TAA</em> at [17]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Balancing all factors, I do not find the Mother’s wish to relocate to the USA to be compatible with the best interests of the children at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     While I understand that the Mother will likely be disappointed by my decision, the law expects parents to put the interests of the child before their own. As noted in <em>TAA</em> (at [20]), a refusal to allow relocation at the time of application does not necessarily mean that a future relocation can never be possible. When circumstances have changed such that it is clear that relocation is in the best interests of the children, the Mother can always renew her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Keeping the status quo for now will provide for stability and continuity of care for the children, and an opportunity for the relationship between the Father and the children to be repaired and strengthened. It will also allow for the children to adjust to a newly reconstituted family within a more stable and familiar environment. The Mother can plan trips to the USA to give the children more exposure and experience of living in the USA, without the need disrupt the stability that the children currently enjoy.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     For the above reasons, I dismissed the application with no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As it was clear to me that there are co-parenting issues that need to be addressed, I encouraged the Mother and Father to seek help from a psychologist or counsellor experienced in parent-child issues who can assist them to implement a workable co-parenting system that will protect the relationships of the children with significant adults. I also encouraged the Father to acquire the skills and necessary insights that will help him engage the children at a pace they are comfortable with and strengthen the parent-child bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Notwithstanding the Mother’s decision to appeal against my decision, it is my hope that both parties would take immediate steps to improve their co-parenting relationship which is essential to the wellbeing of the children.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note:

District Judge Darryl Soh:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This matter concerns ancillary reliefs arising from divorce proceedings between the Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Husband”) (collectively referred to as the “Parties”). The Parties robustly litigated the care orders in respect of the children, the division of matrimonial assets, the Wife’s maintenance, and the children’s maintenance. The Wife is appealing against the access and contact orders, and part of the maintenance orders. My decision hereafter will focus on the access and maintenance orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Parties were married in 2014 and they are in their 30s. They are blessed with two children – their son is in primary school and their daughter is in pre-primary. The Parties marriage was a short single-income marriage wherein the Wife was primarily the children’s caregiver and the Husband was primarily the family’s breadwinner. According to the Wife, she has either been helping at the Husband’s company, tried to set up her own business, or seeking gainful employment, with little or no support from the Husband. In light of disagreements over the Husband’s behaviour, the Wife and the children moved out of the matrimonial home in 2021. As at the time of the hearing, the Husband was a director of a food business, and the Wife was working in a part-time home-based administrative role.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife commenced divorce proceedings against the Husband on 15 December 2021 on account that he behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him. On 5 January 2022, the Husband filed his Defence and Counterclaim on a similar claim against the Wife. The Husband subsequently withdrew his Defence and the divorce proceeded on an uncontested basis on cross amended pleadings. The Parties’ marriage was dissolved on 12 May 2022, thereby lasting for approximately eight years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders Made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The ancillary reliefs were adjudicated on 6 July 2023 and 3 August 2023. The Wife’s appeals were filed against part of the decisions made on each hearing date. In board terms, care orders were made on the first day and financial orders were made on the second day of hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 6 July 2023, I granted the Parties joint custody of the children and for the Wife to be granted sole care and control. Consequential orders were also made on the safekeeping of the children’s passports. Further, I made detailed access and contact orders between the Parties vis-à-vis the children. On 20 July 2023, the Wife appealed against the access and contact orders by way of HCF/DCA 63/2023. I have set out those orders in detail below at [16].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Parties agreed to limit the court’s powers on the division of matrimonial assets to the division of the matrimonial home. On 3 August 2023, I ordered for the matrimonial home (with an agreed value of $650,000.00) to be sold within nine months of Final Judgment. After discharging the mortgage (with an agreed outstanding amount of $442,037.23) on the matrimonial home and the payment of the costs and expenses of the sale, I ordered for the net sale proceeds (approximately $207,962.77) to be divided between the Parties in the ratio of 45:55 in favour of the Husband. Each party shall thereafter be responsible for refunding their respective CPF accounts. In other words, the Wife is expected to receive approximately $93,583.25 from the division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Insofar as the Wife’s maintenance is concerned, I ordered the Husband to pay monthly cash maintenance of $2,000.00 to the Wife for the period of September 2023 to May 2024 and for this to be reduced to $800.00 for the period of June 2024 to December 2024. The Wife’s maintenance is to cease in 2025 when the Parties’ daughter enters primary school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I also ordered the Husband to pay a cash maintenance of $500.00 to the Wife for each child and for the Husband to be solely responsible for their school and enrichment classes for up to $300.00 per child per month on a reimbursement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> basis. To avoid doubt, the Wife is to be responsible for amounts over and above the $300.00 prescribed per child per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 11 August 2023, the Wife appealed against the cessation of her maintenance in 2025 and the children’s maintenance orders by way of HCF/DCA 75/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Access and Contact Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband sought for the following access orders in respect of the children:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Every Thursday 6pm to Sunday 6pm;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Telephone or videos calls to the children when they are in the Wife’s care and control;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On the 1<sup>st</sup> day of every Chinese New Year; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Each party shall be at liberty to take the Children overseas for one week during the June or mid-year school holidays and one week during the December or year-end school holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Wife’s submitted that the Husband shall only be granted supervised access to their son and no access to their daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I will first set out the conceptual grounds of my decision before turning to the specific terms of my access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I found the Wife’s submissions to be curious since the Parties earlier recorded a consent order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> on interim access whereby the Husband shall have access to their son every Friday 5pm to Sunday 5pm and for him to have supervised access to their daughter every Friday, 5pm to 7pm. In other words, the Wife’s submissions were a stark regression from what they agreed to earlier. According to the Wife, the interim access arrangements were still taking place, but they were not smooth sailing.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> She argued that the Parties have made allegations about the other about their respective adherence to the access timings and that Parties have not been able to communicate effectively for the purposes of making access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the outset, I will deal with the Wife’s submissions for the Husband’s access to their son to be supervised. Taking the Wife’s case as its highest, the alleged circumstances do not come anywhere close to the exceptional circumstances required for supervised access. See the High Court’s observations in <em>APE v APF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16869-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 17</a> at [32] as to when supervised access should be awarded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I next turn to the Wife’s submissions for the Husband to have no access to their daughter. I note that this was part of the broader dispute between the Parties on the biological link between the Husband and the daughter, which the Wife regrettably advanced without any factual or legal basis so as to deprive the Husband of his parental responsibilities regarding that child. I have deliberately omitted elaborating on this as I dismissed the Wife’s case in the strongest of terms and the Wife rightly has not appealed against. The Wife’s case for the Husband to have no access therefore could not be sustained. Elaborating on this dispute herein may negatively impact on their daughter’s relationship with both her parents in the future should she read this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I now turn to the specific terms of my access and division of contact orders in respect of the Parties:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband to have six hours of access to the children on alternate days of the weekend (<em>i.e.</em> alternating between Saturdays and Sundays each week) from 10am to 4pm commencing 15 July 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband to have an hour and a half of access to the children on one weekday per week for dinner, from 7pm to 8.30pm with 48 hours’ notice to be given by the Husband to the Wife;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Parties to share all school holidays and public holidays contact time with the children save for Chinese New Year holidays equally. For the avoidance of doubt, the Husband shall have overnight access to the children during his share of the school holidays;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Parties are at liberty to bring the children out of Singapore for a holiday during their access or contact time. The travelling parent shall provide confirmation of the travel date and details at least four weeks in advance. The travel itinerary, with details on accommodation, flight, and contact numbers shall be provided at least four weeks prior to travel. Prior to travel, the Wife shall handover the passport(s) of the children to the Husband 14 days prior to travel, which shall be returned to the Wife within 14 days after travel;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For the Chinese New Year holidays, the Parties are to alternate between years where one party shall have Chinese New Year reunion lunch and the 1<sup>st</sup> day with the children, and the other party shall have Chinese New Year reunion dinner and the 2<sup>nd</sup> day with the children. Should there be a 3<sup>rd</sup> day of holidays, this shall fall under the equal holiday schematic; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>(f)     For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no restriction on remote access (phone and/or video calls) between the Parties and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I found that the Husband’s interim agreed two-hour weekly access to the Parties’ daughter and this single weekly opportunity for him to have contact with the children to be insufficient. Further, it was not in the children’s collective best interests to have their individual access time with the Husband structured separately as this will lead to perceptions of different treatment between the children. Accordingly, whilst the Husband previously had two full days with the Parties’ son under the agreed interim access terms, I was of the view that having the children spend time jointly with the Husband (albeit a shorter time in respect of the Parties’ son) and more frequently (<em>i.e.</em> in addition to the weekend access, to having a dinner on one weekday and liberal remote access) would facilitate collective bonding in a reconfigured family unit so as to achieve better overall developmental outcomes for the children. However, I did not agree with the Husband’s submissions for a far longer weekly access time with the children as this would be (a) a significant departure from what the children are presently used to as a whole, (b) incompatible with his busy schedule since such a structure comprises two days of the weekdays, and (c) practically deprives the Wife of the entire weekend’s meaningful contact time with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In respect of the holiday access and contact time, I made orders to divide the holidays equally and equitably between the Parties so that the children can have the opportunity to spend quality time with each parent during the respective breaks. I also saw no reason why either parent ought to be constrained from bringing the children out of Singapore for a holiday. I therefore granted them liberty to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance for the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife is appealing against my decision to grant her maintenance for a limited duration, ceasing in 2025. The Wife had sought maintenance of $2,000.00 for an indefinite period on the basis that she has been financially reliant on the Husband for the majority of the marriage and the need to care for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Husband argued that the Wife is more than sufficiently capable of maintenance herself and submitted that there be no maintenance for the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I found no merit to the Wife’s case for indefinite maintenance. The power of the court to order maintenance in the context of ancillary reliefs is supplementary to the division of matrimonial assets. In this case, it is critical to appreciate that the Parties agreed to limit the scope of the court’s exercise of its power to divide the matrimonial assets to just the matrimonial home. In this context, the Wife is to receive 45% of the matrimonial assets. Quantitatively, the Wife is expected to receive approximately $93,583.25. In my view, this was a just and equitable share of the matrimonial assets given the Parties’ short marriage. Furthermore, the Wife is in her 30s, she holds a diploma and is presently working in a part-time home-based administrative role. There is no reason whatsoever why the Wife should not work towards self-sufficiency (which I will elaborate on below) and achieve a clean break. I however accepted that she needed time to find her feet after the divorce and prioritise the care of the children, especially when the younger child has yet to start primary school. I therefore granted her request for $2,000.00 maintenance but I limited it to nine months, which is the ordered duration for which the matrimonial home is to be sold. Thereafter, I ordered six months of a reduced monthly maintenance of $800.00, the expiry of which the younger child is expected to start primary school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I found that the Wife can work towards self-sufficiency. Together with the $20,715.13 balance in her CPF Ordinary Account and the approximate $93,583.25 from the sale of the matrimonial flat, the Wife will have sufficient funds to afford the downpayment and monthly mortgage payments from her CPF contributions to purchase a new home for herself and the children. This will consequently obviate the need for the Wife to incur out-of-pocket rental expenses. After removing the rental and the highly discretionary monthly expenses of car rental fees and the allowance for her parents in the circumstances of this case, the Wife will only be incurring reasonable monthly expenses of $1,100.00.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> This would be lower than the Wife’s present monthly take-home income of $1,120.00 from her part-time job. Finally, once the younger child starts primary school in 2025, the Wife will be more than able to find full-time time employment that provides a higher monthly income. When those circumstances were considered in their totality, I was of the view that the Wife is more than capable of maintaining herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance for the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife submitted for the Husband to pay monthly maintenance of $1,500.00 for their son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Wife initially did not seek maintenance for the Parties’ daughter but sought maintenance in light of the court’s care orders relating to their daughter. The Husband submitted that he should only pay maintenance of $700.00 in total for the two children. I disagreed with both Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I first considered the children’s reasonable monthly expenses, which the Wife submitted to be $1,510.00 for their son and $1,050.00 for their daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Wife provided a breakdown of their son’s expenses and clarified during the hearing on 3 August 2023 that their daughter’s monthly expenses were similar:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    Food $100.00</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    Medical/Healthcare $70.00</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    Clothing $50.00</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    Transport $300.00</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(e)    Hobbies, Toys and Sports $100.00</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(f)    Pocket Money $60.00</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(g)    Enrichment class fees $830.00 (comprising $80.00 for swimming, $200.00 for abacus, $350.00 for Mandarin, and $200.00 for English)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I agreed with most of the Wife’s submissions on the children’s expenses except three areas.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     First, I found that the transport expenses for each child was excessive. Even after taking into account that the Wife has chosen to use a private vehicle instead of public transport and factoring the possible savings or economies of scale when the children travel together, I budgeted $200.00 for each child’s transportation expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Next, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence that the children will incur total annual medical and healthcare expenses of $840.00 per child and $1,200.00 per child for their hobbies, toys and sports. These amounts were excessive when considered objectively. As such, I found it reasonable to budget $200.00 as miscellaneous and upkeep expenses per child for the above-mentioned expenses including amounts submitted by the Wife for their pocket money and clothing which I found reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Finally, I found the total amount submitted for the children’s enrichment classes to be excessive. The aggregate amount of $830.00 for the Parties’ son is more than 50% of his total expenses submitted by the Wife. Whilst there was insufficient evidence for the Parties’ daughter and whether it was still reasonable to expect the Parties’ son to go for all four classes, I found it reasonable in the circumstances to budget $300.00 per month on a reimbursement basis for each child for their school and enrichment classes in general given their respective ages. Should there be a material change in circumstances in the future, either party can file a variation application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In light of the Wife’s current financial capacity and her need to work towards self-sufficiency, I ordered the Husband to be responsible for the entirety of the children’s reasonable monthly expenses. <em>i.e.</em> $500.00 per child per month and additionally $300.00 on a reimbursement basis per child for their school and enrichment classes. In the event that the children require additional enrichment classes per month, I ordered the Wife to be responsible for amounts over and above the $300.00 that the Husband is to reimburse her for. In my view, this will ensure that the Wife will not be profligate in those expenses for the children and yet contribute towards their expenses. Further, I am cognisant that the children’s expenses will increase over time. Once the younger child starts primary school, the Wife’s financial capacity is anticipated to improve, and she will be able to take on a greater share (<em>i.e.</em> the expenses not covered by the maintenance the Husband is to pay) of the children’s overall reasonable monthly expenses by then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife sought a backdating of the children’s maintenance to the date of Interim Judgment. Backdating is a matter of discretion by the court and the Wife did not provide any discernible case for such a discretion to be exercised. The Wife’s case was the Husband has not been providing any form of maintenance but yet she did not apply for interim maintenance. I accordingly ordered for the children’s maintenance to commence on the start of the month immediately after the hearing, <em>i.e.</em> on 1 September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife’s case during the ancillary reliefs was regrettable. The stance she took in respect of the care orders for the Parties’ daughter was a negative example and cannot be accepted. I have given the benefit of doubt to the Wife’s counsel that the positions taken on those matters were due to the Wife’s instructions. Be that as it may, I made no order as to costs as I was cognisant that the litigation has been trying on both sides and I did not want to aggravate matters further.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Reimbursement is to be done within seven days of production of receipts <em>via</em> email.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 8 of the Husband’s Fact and Position Sheet.

The Plaintiff, another of P’s sons, seeks to revoke the appointment of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants as donees of P under the LPA on the ground that P lacked mental capacity at the time that the LPA was executed or alternatively, on the ground that P’s donees have engaged in conduct that is not in P’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The LPA was activated on 26 January 2021, about 3 months after its execution, when P was diagnosed with dementia with moderate severity by Dr CMS. It is not disputed that P currently lacks mental capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The sole dispute between the parties at the hearing of the originating summons is whether the LPA should be revoked pursuant to section 17(4)(b) of the Mental Capacity Act 2008 (“MCA”) based on the grounds provided by the Plaintiff. There are no allegations of fraud or undue pressure being applied to induce P to make the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The application by the Plaintiff to revoke the LPA was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       P is presently 84 years old. He is a widow and had 6 children, 3 sons and 3 daughters. One of P’s daughters died during the course of the proceedings (“the late daughter”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       P has been in the pig farming business since the 1970s. There is a holding company for P’s businesses. P, the Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant are directors of this company. The Plaintiff is the managing director of the company. P has a residential property in his sole name as well as 2 commercial properties which he owns with the Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant as joint tenants.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Background to the Dispute </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It is the Plaintiff’s case that he has a close relationship of trust with P and that when P was travelling to China frequently for business, he looked to the Plaintiff to hold the family and assets together. According to the Plaintiff, it has been P’s wish for his 3 male children and his only grandson (the Plaintiff’s son) to reside with him in the residential property and for the sons and grandson to continue residing there even after P’s passing. Out of respect for P’s wishes, the sons and grandson are living with P at the residential property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Plaintiff was not aware of the execution of the LPA at the time the LPA was executed before a solicitor, Ms A. He only found out about the LPA in April 2021 when the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendants made claims against him on P’s behalf. According to the Plaintiff, P lacked mental capacity at the time the LPA was executed. The 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant take the position that the Plaintiff’s allegations are bare and unsubstantiated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Plaintiff and the Defendants share a strained relationship. There is litigation in the General Division of the High Court between the Plaintiff and the 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant over the 2 commercial properties which they hold with P as joint tenants. There were also personal protection order applications which parties had taken out which had been withdrawn by the time of the hearing of the originating summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The issues to be determined are –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     did P have mental capacity at the time he executed the LPA on 28 October 2020; and/or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     have the Defendants, as donees appointed by P under the LPA, not been acting in P’s best interest; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     should P’s LPA be revoked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Did P have mental capacity at the time he executed the LPA? </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>Re BKR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17323-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 26</a> at [55], the Court of Appeal held that the test for capacity in s 4(1) of the MCA contains a functional as well as a clinical component. The functional component is that P is “unable to make a decision for himself”, and the clinical component is that this inability stems from an impairment of the mind. There must be a causal connection between the inability to make decisions and the mental impairment. P must be unable to make a decision “because of” his mental impairment. At [134], the court held -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As we have mentioned, the test for capacity in s4(1) of the MCA may be thought of as having a functional and a clinical component – the functional aspect is that P must be unable to make a decision, and the clinical aspect is that this inability must be caused by a mental impairment. It is not difficult to see that we require the assistance of expert evidence when addressing the clinical component of the test: we need medical professionals to tell us whether P has a mental impairment based on the observable symptoms and any other diagnostic tools available, and if so, what that impairment is, and what effect it has on P’s cognitive abilities. But as to the functional component, it is in our judgment a question for us to grapple with leaving perhaps a limited scope for the involvement of the medical experts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Section 5 of the MCA provides –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    For the purposes of section 4, a person is unable to make a decision for himself or herself if the person is unable —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    to understand the information relevant to the decision;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    to retain that information;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    to communicate his or her decision (whether by talking, using sign language or any other means).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Although there were affidavits from 6 doctors and a medical report from Associate Professor LWS which was admitted by consent, references were made mainly to the affidavits of Dr TCH, Dr KK (the 2 doctors whom P consulted prior to the execution of the LPA), Dr CMS (who activated the LPA) and Dr CT (the doctor appointed by the Plaintiff) during the hearing. The other doctors (Associate Professor LWS, Dr DY, and Dr CHT) affirmed Dr Chong’s diagnosis of dementia and lack of capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Plaintiff accepted that he bore the burden of proof to show that P had no capacity to make the LPA on 28 October 2020. He submitted that on a review of all relevant evidence, P lacked capacity to execute the LPA on 28 October 2020 as both the clinical and functional components of the test for mental incapacity are satisfied. It is not disputed that P lacked capacity as at 26 January 2021 when the LPA was activated. The Plaintiff chose not to cross-examine the doctors and made submissions based on the medical reports as well as Dr TCH’s notes (parts of which are illegible). A summary of the Plaintiff’s submissions is as follows –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As early as 6 July 2019, P consulted Dr TCH at CK Family Clinic for complaints of increasing forgetfulness and poorer memory. An Abbreviated Mental Tested (“AMT”) conducted by Dr TCH showed that P could answer 8 out of 10 questions correctly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 14 December 2019, P attended before Dr KK at CK Family Clinic with the late daughter for Vaso-Motor Rhinitis and occasional lapses of recent memory. Dr KK prescribed a trial course of Donepezil as a means of preventing further lapses of memory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 17 October 2020, P consulted with Dr TCH for complaints of increasing forgetfulness and poorer memory and requested for another assessment. The late daughter brought P to this consultation and observed some deterioration in P’s memory function. P was able to answer 8 out of 10 questions for another AMT, but in an Elderly Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire (“ECAQ”), P scored 5 out of 10. As P’s symptoms were noted to have deteriorated and he managed to score 5 out of 10 on the ECAQ, possible cognitive impairment was considered. Dr TCH had the impression P had mild cognitive impairment. Dr TCH advised P and the late daughter to refer P to a psycho-geriatrician for further specialist assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Instead of bringing P to a psycho-geriatrician for an assessment, P was brought to a lawyer, Ms A to execute his LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Dr TCH and Dr KK’s reports show that P was suffering from an impairment or disturbance in the function of his mind by 28 October 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Less than three months after the LPA was executed, the LPA was activated on 26 January 2021 by Dr CMS. Dr CMS diagnosed P with Alzheimer’s disease. Dr CMS’s opinion was that P did not have mental capacity and his mental incapacity was likely to be permanent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Although Dr TCH opined that P still had mental capacity on 17 October 2020 (as mild cognitive impairment is a condition in which a person experiences slight but noticeable decline in mental abilities compared to others of the same age but the changes are not severe enough to interfere with daily life and activities), the Plaintiff argued that based on Dr TCH’s handwritten notes of the consultation, Dr TCH was actually of the view that P had significant cognitive impairment and that Dr TCH’s impression of mild cognitive impairment does not hold water. Dr TCH’s attempt to contradict the contemporaneous notes must be rejected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_h\"></a>(h)     Dr TCH is not a specialist geriatrician and is clearly not trained to assess mental capacity as a general practitioner. Dr TCH’s opinion on P’s mental capacity is affected by hindsight bias (Dr TCH’s report is premised on Dr CT’s Report, which indicated that P was able to express his opinions notwithstanding his diagnosis of dementia in October 2021). Dr TCH’s report also fails to explain or elaborate on the analytical process by which its conclusions were reached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Although Dr KK stated that there were no other symptoms to suggest that P had a degenerative disorder when P consulted him on 14 December 2019 and that his prescription of a trial course of Donepezil does not necessarily indicate that P suffered from mild dementia at the time of issue, the Plaintiff, relying on medical literature indicating that Donepezil is approved for treatment of mild or moderate dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and the fact that the doctors who saw P after he was assessed to lack capacity prescribed Donepezil to him, argues that Dr KK’s prescription of Donepezil is evidence that P was already suffering from some form of cognitive impairment as of 14 December 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_j\"></a>(j)     Taking into account the preparation of and execution of the LPA and the surrounding circumstances, it is clear that P was not able to understand what he was signing on 28 October 2020. The terms of the LPA allows the donees to sell P’s residential property without court approval were contrary to P’s previously expressed wishes that his three male children and only grandson should continue to reside at the residential property, thus demonstrating that P did not understand the consequences of executing the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_k\"></a>(k)     Little or no weight should be given to Ms A’s Affidavit on the execution of the LPA and her account that P was able to understand and fully understand her explanations regarding the LPA and to consider and make decisions independently. Ms A is the certificate issuer of P’s LPA. Ms A did not have complete information about P’s condition and was clearly not trained to medically assess P’s mental capacity. Ms A’s lack of any contemporaneous attendance notes to substantiate her account seriously undermines the reliability of her testimony.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Defendants’ arguments are as follows –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proving that P lacked capacity when he executed the LPA. The evidence that has been adduced by the Plaintiff’s own medical expert, Dr CT, in fact supports a finding that P did have capacity at the time that he executed the LPA. Although the Defendants submit that Dr CT’s report should be disregarded as she did not remain non-partisan, Dr CT’s view that notwithstanding his diagnosis of dementia, P is able to express his opinions at the time of her examination of P on 5 October 2021 and 7 October 2021 supports a finding that P had the requisite clinical component of capacity when P executed the LPA a year earlier on 28 October 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Having regard to the relevant factual and expert medical evidence, P had the requisite capacity to execute the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Plaintiff’s sole basis for claiming that P lacked the clinical component of capacity is the fact that Dr KK had prescribed Donepezil to P. The Plaintiff has not led any medical expert evidence which would support a finding that P lacked the clinical component of capacity or the Plaintiff’s belief that the prescription of Donepezil by Dr KK was intended to treat P’s dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. The Plaintiff’s expert, Dr CT, does not express any opinion on P’s mental capacity at the time of the execution of the LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The contemporaneous medical evidence shows that P possessed the clinical component of capacity at the time he executed the LPA on 28 October 2020. P had been consulting Dr KK for more than 10 years. Occasionally, when Dr KK is not available, P would consult Dr TCH who is from the same family practice. On 17 October 2020, 11 days before P executed the LPA, Dr TCH noted P to be conscious, orientated and rational and was able to express clearly the reason for his visit. P was concerned about his increasing forgetfulness and expressed his wish for further assessment and medical care. P was able to understand and answer the questions from the screening questionnaire. While Dr TCH was of the view that P had passed the AMT, she was unable to comment if the cut-off score of 5 for ECAQ was too stringent for the identification of mild cognitive impairment. (Dr TCH explained in the report that the AMT allows for age and education cut-off scores but the ECAQ has no education or age adjusted cut-off values.) Although Dr Tong was under the impression (which is distinct from a diagnosis) that P may have been suffering from mild cognitive impairment, she nevertheless observed that P was able to clearly express his concern for the deterioration of his memory function and requested for tests to check if he has dementia and able to understand and express his agreement for further specialist assessment and medical care. Dr TCH was ultimately of the view that P still had mental capacity on 17 October 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Paragraph 4.2 of the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice (“the Code”) provides that even if a person suffers from conditions such as dementia, mental health problems or intellectual disabilities, it must not be assumed that a person who suffers from any of these conditions necessarily lacks mental capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Plaintiff’s sole allegation that appears to go the question of whether P lacked the functional component of capacity is the alleged inconsistency between the powers granted to the Defendants as donees under the LPA and the wishes that P had allegedly previously expressed to the Plaintiff regarding the residential property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Ms A has provided evidence that P had capacity at the time he executed the LPA. At the time Ms A took P’s instructions to prepare the LPA, P had been a client of Ms A for about 8 years. According to Ms A, based on her personal knowledge of P’s character, personality and demeanour arising from her many years of interacting with P, P was able to consider and make decisions for himself. Ms A had observed that during meeting with P on 28 October 2020 –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g-p3_i\"></a>(i)       P’s manner of speaking was clear and smooth, and his thought process was lucid and logical;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       P chose a son and a daughter to show and achieve a check and balance between the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       P was clear about his displeasure and disappointment with the Plaintiff;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       P was able to instruct Ms A for his Donees and/or his replacement Donee to act jointly; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_g-p3_v\"></a>(v)       P was his usual self in terms of his demeanour, manner of speaking and thought processes, and he was able to understand and fully understood her explanations, and to consider and make decisions independently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On the Plaintiff’s allegation that it is highly unlikely that P would have granted the Defendants power to sell and mortgage his properties including the residential property based on P’s wishes contained in an undated letter, the Defendant submits that the evidence given in the High Court suit was that the letter was written by P between 2003 and 2009, 11 to 17 years before P executed the LPA and long before P had become displeased and disappointed with P which would have prompted P to change his mind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In order to warrant the revocation of a LPA on the ground of lack of mental capacity, it must be shown that the Donor lacks both the clinical component and functional component of such mental capacity, and that there is a nexus between the 2 components. It must be shown that P must be unable to make a decision, and the clinical aspect is that this inability must be caused by a mental impairment. There is no direct evidence that P had a mental impairment that caused him to be unable to make a decision regarding executing a LPA. Dr TCH was under the impression that P may have been suffering from mild cognitive impairment. The doctor nevertheless observed that P was able to clearly express his concern for the deterioration of his memory function and requested for tests to check if he has dementia and he able to understand and express his agreement for further specialist assessment and medical care. Dr TCH was ultimately of the view that P still has mental capacity on 17 October 2020. The Plaintiff is making arguments from Dr CMS’s diagnosis, other opinions of other doctors and the prescription of Donepezil to argue that the clinical component has been satisfied. I accept that P had some form of cognitive impairment at the LPA was made and that the clinical component is satisfied. This is clear from Dr TCH’s clinical notes and medical report. The question is whether the cognitive impairment caused P to be unable to make a decision regarding the execution of his LPA (the functional component).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Courts have accepted that even persons with dementia can have capacities to execute LPAs (see for example <em>ULP and others v ULS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25519-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 1</a>). It is clear from Paragraph 4.2 of the Code that conditions such as dementia may cause a lack of mental capacity, but it must not be assumed that a person who suffers from such a condition necessarily lacks mental capacity. Lack of mental capacity must be proved (see <em>ULP</em> at [19]). When making a LPA, a donor needs to have capacity to understand that he needed someone to look after him and that an LPA would achieve this purpose (see <em>ULP</em> at [32]). When making a LPA, a donor is deciding who should make decisions on his behalf in terms of his personal welfare and his property and affairs if he lacked capacity and the powers to be given to his donees. A donor needs to understand the consequences of appointing the donees and the granting of the powers to the donees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having memory issues and cognitive impairment (whether the cognitive impairment is mild or significant) does not necessarily mean that P lacked mental capacity to decide on who should make decisions on his behalf if he should lack mental capacity. There must be a causal connection between the inability to make decision in question and the mental impairment, in that P must be unable to make a decision because of his mental impairment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the evidence before me, I find that P had mental capacity on 28 October 2020 to execute the LPA. Dr Tong examined P on 17 October 2020 and stated that possible cognitive impairment was considered. An advice to refer P to a psycho-geriatrician for further specialist assessment and management was made to P and his daughter. Dr Tong’s opinion is that the changes are not severe enough to interfere with daily life and activities. When P consulted Dr Tong on 17 October 2020, he was noted to be conscious, orientated and rational. He was able to express clearly the reason for his visit. He was concerned about his increasing forgetfulness and expressed his wish for further assessment and medical care. P was able to understand the questions from the screening questionnaire and answered them accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     There is no contradictory evidence to show that P was disoriented or irrational on the day he executed his LPA. Although detailed attendance notes are lacking, there is no other evidence that the certificate issuer Ms A’s evidence is unreliable in relation to P’s preferences in terms of who he would like to be his donees and the checks and balances to be put in place for his donees to make a decision. Ms A was not a certificate issuer who only saw P on one occasion. P has been Ms A’s client since 2012. She has interacted with P since 2012 and I accept her evidence about what P told her about his preferences and his views of the Plaintiff. While P did express his wishes about the residential property in his letters to the Plaintiff, it does not mean that he did not understand the consequences of signing the LPA in the way he did. He had chosen for his donees to act jointly to achieve a check and balance (paragraph 18 of Ms A’s affidavit). It is not necessary to insist that the court be the check and balance if a donor of a LPA has made other arrangements for checks and balances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The explanation in Paragraph 17 of Ms A’s affidavit on P’s views of the Plaintiff fits into the circumstances at that time and there is evidence that there were issues in relation to the mortgage of the commercial properties which P had to take steps to address personally although the commercial properties were being managed by the Plaintiff. This is not to say that the Plaintiff bears sole responsibility for the mortgage issues relating to the commercial property but it may have affected P’s choice of donees when he was executing his LPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     From the evidence, I was satisfied that P was able to understand the information required to make a LPA in that he was able understand that he needed someone to make decisions for him if he lacked capacity and that a LPA could achieve this, he could decide who he wanted to make decisions on his behalf if he lacked capacity, he was able to retain that information, he was able to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision and he was to communicate his decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff’s case appears to be based on the premise that a LPA where he is not a donee was not conceivable since he is the one P trusted to hold the family and assets together. From the evidence, the Plaintiff is not the only one whom P trusted to handle his personal welfare and property and affairs. P’s medical appointments appear to be handled by P’s late daughter, not the Plaintiff. It was the late daughter who accompanied P to the relevant medical appointments. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant, not the Plaintiff, was the one tasked by P to administer P’s late wife’s estate. P made the Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant joint tenants with him for the commercial properties. The Plaintiff and 1<sup>st</sup> Defendant are directors of the holding company for P’s businesses. P had entrusted different aspects of his personal welfare and his property and affairs to different children when there were no issues as to his capacity. The mere fact that the Plaintiff was excluded as a donee of the LPA is not an indication that P had no capacity to decide who he wanted to make decisions on his behalf when he lacked capacity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Have the Defendants, as donees appointed by P under the LPA, not been acting in P’s best interest</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Section 6 of the MCA provides that in determining what is in a person’s best interests, the person making the determination must consider “all relevant circumstances” and take the steps set out at Sections 6. In <em>TEB v TEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17585-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 54</a> at [276], the court stated that in determining whether or not a person’s conduct is not in the best interest of P, it is important to understand why the person acted the way he did. If he acted in good faith and for good reasons, it might well be that, even though the act in question turned out, with the benefit of hindsight, to be wrong, the person in question would nevertheless not be found to have acted in a way that was not in P’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Plaintiff argues that the Defendants have engaged in conduct that is not in P’s best interest –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the Defendants were clearly acting in bad faith when they hid the existence and activation of P’s LPA from the Plaintiff. As the Plaintiff and his family live with P, the Defendants should have informed the Plaintiff and his family of the existence of P’s LPA when it was executed on 28 October 2020 and certainly by the time it was activated on 26 January 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Defendants failed to notify the relevant parties such as the company and the banks of the activation of P’s LPA. P signed a directors’ resolution in respect of the company on 21 January 2021. P continued to sign off on cheques for RM 240.40 and S$250 in both his personal capacity as well as on behalf of the company in February and March 2021, which was after the activation of his LPA. Although the Defendants had claimed that it was P who had insisted on signing the cheques, and they had assessed that it was in his best interests for him to do so, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendants should not have allowed P to make such decisions over his property and affairs. Had either of the cheques bounced, P could have been exposed to civil liability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Defendants had cut off the Plaintiff’s access to P and prevented the Plaintiff’s immediate family from speaking to P.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Defendants had removed P from his residential property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Defendants have explained their conduct as follows –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendants did not disclose the LPA in keeping with their duty of confidentiality under Paragraph 8.5.9 of the Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Directors’ resolution was signed before the LPA was activated. As for the cheques, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the late daughter had encouraged P to participate in the process and considered P’s wishes and feelings at that time. They allowed P to sign the cheques as P and the company would have been affected if payment was not made and the amounts were insubstantial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Defendants have not prevented P from interacting with the Plaintiff and his family members. They just want to ensure that at least one of them is present because of the hazards posed by the Plaintiff’s junk which have been left in a haphazard manner in the common areas of the residential property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On the removal of P from the residential property, the Defendants have given evidence that P had stayed with the late daughter in that instance because it was more sleep conducive environment and P had agreed to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I find that the non-disclosure to other family members that P had signed a LPA or that a LPA has been activated is not evidence that the donees have failed to act in P’s best interests. I accept the Defendants’ explanation why they did not disclose the existence of the LPA to the Plaintiff. A donor may sometimes take into consideration family dynamics when deciding whether or not to disclose the existence of a LPA. In some families, the disclosure of the existence of a LPA may lead to conflict and a donor may decide to only inform some and not all of his family members about the LPA to maintain some form of short term peace within the family. Before a LPA is activated, it would be for the donor and not the donees to decide whether to disclose the existence of the LPA to other family members as the donees cannot act in their capacities as donees until the LPA is activated. Mere non-disclosure of a LPA by the donees especially during the time before P is found to lack capacity is not evidence that the donees have failed to act in P’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I find that allowing P to sign cheques for small amounts for payments which were due when the donees have ascertained that P understood what the cheques were for is not a sign that the donees were not acting in P’s best interests. In relation to both cheques, I accept that P had insisted on signing on the cheques. The fact that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Defendant and the late daughter had allowed P to sign the 2 cheques for insubstantial amounts after considering P’s wishes and feelings at that time is not evidence that the donees had failed to act in P’s best interest. In <em>BUV v BUU and another and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23303-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 15</a>, it was held by Aedit Abdullah J at [110] that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Section 3(3) states that a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him do so have been unsuccessful. I read this stipulation as geared towards facilitative assistance, ie, that which enables a person to make a decision. This could entail the use of simplifying language, memory aides, and the like: see also s 5(2) of the MCA. In other words, the assistance conceived of in ss3(3) and 5(2) of the MCA is aimed at helping a person retain her existing decision-making ability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is questionable whether P had ability at the time the cheques were signed to make decisions in relation to payment of debts given the activation of the LPA. However, if the donees acted in good faith and for good reasons, even though the act in question turned out, with the benefit of hindsight, to be wrong, the donees would nevertheless not be found to have acted in a way that was not in P’s best interests. The Defendants may not have fully understood or appreciated the legal implications of allowing P to sign cheques for insubstantial amounts, but so long as they acted in good faith and for good reasons, they cannot be said to have acted in a way that was not in P’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I accept the Defendants’ explanations on wanting to be present when the Plaintiff speaks to P and why P went to stay with the late daughter. The fact that the Plaintiff and Defendants have issues communicating with each other is not evidence that the Defendants have not acted in P’s best interests. What the Plaintiff perceives as the cutting off of access to P by the Defendants is seen by the Defendants as taking steps to ensure P’s safety. The Plaintiff and the Defendants may benefit from seeking professional assistance to help them better communicate with each other in terms of P’s care but the evidence presented by the Plaintiff does not show that the Defendants have acted in bad faith and without good reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the circumstances, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application for the Court to revoke the appointment of the Defendants as donees of P under Lasting Power of Attorney registered on 3 December 2020.

My reasons for allowing the Mother’s application and ordering some Costs against the Mother are set out after the Facts of the case below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Plaintiff Mother (“the Mother”) and Defendant Father (“the Father”) married on 22 October 2006 in Australia. In the Statement of Claim, both Parties were listed as citizens of the United Kingdom but in the Summons application, both Parties were listed with Singapore NRIC numbers. In response to my query, the Mother informed that she has Singapore Permanent Residency status but still holds United Kingdom citizenship. The Father’s Counsel informed that the Father’s status was the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There is one child to the previous marriage namely, BCD (f) DOB XXX XXX 2007 now aged 16 years (“the said child”). The marriage lasted about 6 years before the Mother filed Writ of Divorce on 30 January 2012 in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Interim Judgement (“IJ”) for the divorce proceedings was subsequently granted on 8 October 2012 on an uncontested basis on the Statement of Claim and the marriage was dissolved by reason of the unreasonable behaviour of the Father. The Ancillary Matters were dealt with under the same IJ Court Order dated 8 October 2012 and accordingly, the Certificate of Final Judgement was issued on 9 January 2013. There was also a Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021 that was relevant to the Mother’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 3 March 2023, the Mother filed <b><u>SUM 695/2023</u></b>, with 8 prayers, which included 3 sub-prayers in Prayer 8. However, I will only deal with the five Prayers relating to the Father’s appeal (being Prayers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6), beginning with Prayer 1 of the Mother’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 1</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The crux of the Mother’s application in Prayer 1 was to increase part of the fixed maintenance payable by the Father on the rental accommodation for the said child. I noted that the key difference between Prayer 1 of SUM 695/2023 and paragraph 3(a)(6) of the IJ Court Order dated 8 October 2012 was the increase from $850.00 (in the IJ Court Order) to $1,200.00 (in Prayer 1) and the addition of one phrase which reads as follows (italics in bold added to show the variation being requested):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 1</u>: That paragraph 3(a)(6) of the Interim Judgment dated 8 October 2012 (the “Interim Judgment”) shall be replaced by the following clause: “The Plaintiff is to be entitled to stay in the same residence until the Plaintiff chooses to move out. In the event that the Plaintiff and the Defendant are not residing on the same premises, the Defendant shall be liable to pay for a monthly sum of <b><em>$1,200.00</em></b> for accommodation costs of the Plaintiff and the said Child under such separate residence for so long as the said Child is residing in Singapore and until such times as the parties agree to send the said Child abroad for overseas studies. The Defendant shall bear all of the said Child's accommodation <b><em>and living</em></b> expenses if the said Child is sent abroad for overseas studies.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Mother submitted that the IJ Court Order figure of $850.00 was fixed some 10 years ago when the said child was 5 years old and that global inflation had increased for market rent by 30%<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. The Mother also submitted that there had been an increase in her rental from $2,600.00 per month to $3,900.00 per month for the same rental unit (which was a 3-bedroom unit) that she had been staying in with the said child since 2019. The increase in rental in the sum of $1,300.00 took effect from 1<sup>st</sup> May 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Father’s Counsel submitted that the Mother had not shown any material change in circumstances to warrant her application since the Settlement Agreement which had resulted in the Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. In summary, the Father’s Counsel submitted that there was a global agreement for the Variation Court Order, which was a Consent Order, and it was agreed at the time, being just 2 years prior in 2021, that the sum of $850.00 was still suitable so no change was made to this amount. It was also submitted that the Mother should downgrade to a 2-bedroom apartment so that she would not have to pay the increased rental of $3,900.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Father’s Counsel also relied on his Written Submissions in paragraph 6 that pursuant to paragraph 77 of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions (“PD”), the Mother had failed to provide the required supporting documentary evidence for her application. However, the Father’s Counsel noted that the Mother’s Tenancy Agreement was exhibited in her 8 May 2023 Affidavit at page 92.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Mother responded that the increase in rental was a 1/3 difference. She also submitted that she and the said child had lived in the same unit since 2019 and the said child was very comfortable there. The Mother also informed that the said child was in the last year of her school and doing her N levels this year. It was submitted that the rental unit condominium was close to the said child’s school and the said child was very familiar with the bus routes and timings. The Mother also submitted that another unit in the same condominium, which was a 1-bedroom unit, was going for about $3,000.00, so it was not about the size of the unit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     At the next and final hearing on 18 July 2023, I confirmed that the directions that I had given at the previous hearing had been complied with. These were namely, that the Mother was to send by letter/email to the Court and copy to the Father’s Counsel, stating her estimated monthly income, her total list of monthly expenses and the said child’s total monthly expenses indicating what she was paying and what the Father was paying. The Father’s Counsel was also directed to provide by letter to the Court and copy to the Mother, their client’s current income (gross and nett) for the past 3 months with documentary proof and a list of his total monthly expenses, including what he was paying for the said child’s total monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Mother submitted that the total amount that she was paying monthly for the said child was at $1,081.00 maintenance plus the said child’s ½ share of the household expenses of $4,831.60 (being at $2,415.80) = $1,081.00 + $2,415.80 = $3,496.80 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father’s Counsel submitted that the Father’s current nett monthly income was at $16,690.00 which was less than what he had earned in 2021 at $18,470.00 which was a 10% decrease of his income when the global settlement was reached for the 2021 Variation Court Order. The Father’s Counsel reiterated that under this global settlement in 2021, the sum of $850.00 for accommodation provided in the 2012 IJ Court Order was not changed. The Father’s Counsel also submitted that the Father was paying $2,904.67 for the said child’s monthly expenses and that his personal total monthly expenses was at $13,755.00 which included the rental for both his Singapore apartment and his Riyadh apartment in Saudi Arabia where he was based.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father’s Counsel further submitted that the reason why the Father had 2 apartments was because he travelled back to Singapore 4 times a year which largely corresponded to the 2 major Muslims festivals and 2 further times when expatriates were allowed to return to their home countries and work outside Saudi Arabia when the temperatures are very high in the summer months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother challenged 6 items of the Father’s total monthly expenses as follows: (i) that the said child’s school fees were inflated by $65.00 per month as it was only at $523.00 and paid by the Father’s GIRO. (ii) the fact that the Father set aside dental expenses at $150.00 per month when the said child only had 2 dental check-ups a year. (iii) Similarly for medical expenses as the said child had no ongoing medical issues. (iv) it was not known what the miscellaneous sum of $166.67 per month was for and (v) why he was maintaining a helper at $1,650.00 per month when he was mostly overseas and (vi) his food expenses at $3,000.00 per month which was excessive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father’s Counsel responded that (i) on the school fees, the figure of $588.00 per month was the average of what the Father had been paying for the past 6 months. For points (ii) and (iii), the Father put aside $150.00 per month for medical and dental expenses each as this was set out as the cap for both items in Paragraphs 2(iii) and (iv) of the 2021 Variation Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On (iv), the Father’s Counsel submitted that this was in relation to the Paragraph 2(x) of the same 2021 Variation Court Order which was the cap for all other reimbursement claims at $500.00 per quarter so $500 ÷ 3 = $166.67 approximately for reimbursement claims under the same Court Order which was what the Father had set aside every month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On (v), the Father’s Counsel submitted that he did not have the breakdown for the helper’s expenses at $1,650.00 per month. However, it was submitted that the Father came back to Singapore 4 times per year and this was the same helper who had been with the family since the said child was born. Therefore, the helper had been with the family for 16 years and previously, when the said child came over to stay, this helper would take care of the said child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     On (vi), the Father’s Counsel submitted that his instructions was that food costs in Saudi Arabia was quite high as a sandwich in Saudi Arabia costs $25.00 as compared to local food at about $5.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 2</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For her application in Prayer 2, the Mother had applied for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 2:</u> Paragraph 2(v) of the Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021 (the “Variation Court Order”) shall be replaced by the following clause: “All payment of tuition expenses shall be paid directly to the tuition centre – XXX Studio – at the tuition centre’s prevailing fees.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I noted that the previous clause was that “Unless otherwise agreed, all claims for reimbursement of tuition expenses shall be limited to the sum of S$610.00 per month. All tuition expenses beyond the said S$610.00 cap shall be payable only if the Defendant Father’s agreement is sought prior to such expenses being incurred.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Mother submitted that at the time of the Variation Court Order, she did not check that the tuition fees would go up yearly and that it had now increased to $680.00 from $610.00 per month. The Mother confirmed that the tuition centre remained the same but submitted that she wished to remove the clause that the Father’s agreement was required as it was not up to her when the tuition fees would be increased as that was the price that the tuition centre was asking for<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Father’s Counsel submitted that firstly, this was a negotiated agreement in 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. Secondly, if the Mother succeeded in her application, this would result in removing the Father’s rights to decide the appropriate level of tuition and the appropriate fees that he should pay. It was noted that the said child was now taking tuition for Maths and Science. It was submitted that if the Mother’s application was allowed, then the said child could go for more times a week or at a higher difficulty level or another type of tuition<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Mother responded that the said child was only taking Science and Maths tuition. For Science it was once a week and for Maths, it was twice a week. The Mother informed that if the said child needed more classes, then this would be at no additional costs and the teachers at the tuition centre would decide if the said child needed more classes. The Mother submitted that the said child had previously taken additional classes at no additional costs and that the said child had been scoring As in both Maths and Science. So, this demonstrated that the tuition was working for the said child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 3</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For her application in Prayer 3, the Mother had applied for the following variation:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 3:</u> Paragraph 2 (vii) of the Variation Court Order shall be replaced by the following clause: “All payment of psychiatric expenses shall be paid directly to the clinic, capped at $2,400.00 per annum.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I noted that the previous clause had provided that “Unless otherwise agreed, all claims for reimbursement of psychiatric expenses shall be limited to the sum of S$600.00 per quarter (i.e., January to March, April to June, July to September and October to December). All psychiatric expenses beyond the said S$600.00 cap shall be payable only if the Defendant Father’s agreement is sought prior to such expenses being incurred”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I also noted that in the Mother’s application, the total cap remained the same at $2,400.00, but that the Mother was asking to remove the Father’s agreement for all psychiatric expenses beyond the S$600.00 per quarter cap.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Mother submitted that the reason for this variation was because the total amount of $2,400.00 per annum was not changed but for some quarters it was more than $600.00 and some quarters it was less than $600.00. The Mother submitted that she was just removing the Father’s control of $600.00 per quarter as she did not think that it would go beyond $2,400.00 per annum. The Mother also submitted that she was asking for payment to be made directly to the clinic because she did not get reimbursed in a timely manner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Father’s Counsel submitted that he was prepared to accept the proposal for $2,400.00 per annum but his concern was what would happen if this exceeded $2,400.00. The Father’s Counsel submitted that anything beyond the sum of $2,400.00 should be agreed by the Father and if not, then the Mother should pay<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Mother had no response to this<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 4 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For her application in Prayer 4, the Mother had applied for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 4:</u> Paragraph 2 (ix) of the Variation Court Order shall be replaced by the following clause: “The Defendant Father agrees to pay the Plaintiff Mother, by the last day of each month, the sum of S$150.00 per month in respect of the Defendant Father’s contribution towards BCD’s food and groceries expenses. The Defendant Father also agrees to pay into a joint bank account in BCD’s and the Defendant Father’s name, by the last day of each month, the sum of S$150.00 per month from October 2021 in respect of BCD’s pocket money and transport expenses. No receipts of spending of pocket money nor travel log are required.” </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I noted that the previous clause had provided that “The Defendant Father agrees to pay the Plaintiff Mother, by the last day of each month, the sum of S$150.00 per month for the months of October 2021 to October 2022 in respect of the Defendant Father’s contribution towards BCD’s food and groceries expenses. The Defendant Father also agrees to pay into a joint bank account in BCD’s and the Defendant Father’s name, by the last day of each month, the sum of S$150.00 per month from October 2021 in respect of BCD’s pocket money and transport expenses”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I also noted that the variation being applied for was (i) that the Father was to continue to pay the sum of S$150.00 per month (which expired in October 2022) as his contribution towards the said child’s food and groceries expenses and (ii) that no receipts or travel logs were to be required for the spending of the said child’s pocket money and transport expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Mother submitted that for the payment into the joint account under the current Court Order, there was no requirement for receipts but that the Father would not allow any withdrawal of the money unless it came with receipts and travel logs <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father’s Counsel submitted that on the receipts and travel logs, referring to paragraph 29 of his Written Submissions, his first point was that the Father had not pre-conditioned any withdrawal by the said child. Secondly, there was a reason for this as there was a need to inculcate good spending habits in the said child. The Father did not see why it was wrong to require his daughter to pick up good financial habits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I noted that in paragraph 29 of the Father’s Counsel’s Written Submissions, it was stated that the said child had “displayed less than savoury behaviour involving the management and use of money in her care and that for a child with ADHD, having rules is important”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Mother responded that if these funds were easily accessible to the said child, the Father would have given her an ATM card and there had been no withdrawal by the said child for her pocket money and transport expenses for the past 2 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Father’s Counsel responded that his instructions were that the Mother had not collected the ATM card from his client. The Mother replied that she was prepared to pick up the ATM card from the Father’s Counsel. As the Father’s Counsel had no objections to this. I directed that this be done before the next hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     At the next and final hearing on 18 July 2023, the Mother submitted that she was giving the said child $100.00 per month pocket money and the Father was also supposed to put the same amount of $100.00 into the said child’s account and $50.00 for the said child’s Ezy link card but he had not done so since October 2021<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     However, in response to my query, the Mother informed that she had not yet collected the ATM card as the Father’s Counsel had only just obtained the ATM card. The Father’s Counsel confirmed that the ATM card was now with them as stated in their 5 July 2023 letter and that the sum of $150.00 per month had been deposited into this account since October 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Mother reiterated that they should not be required to give the Father receipts and travel logs for the said child’s expenditure of this $150.00 per month as this was not in the original Court Order<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Prayer 6</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The last issue of appeal was for Prayer 6 of SUM 695/2023, wherein the Mother had applied for the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Prayer 6:</u> Costs of the application shall be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     At the 14 June 2023 hearing, in response to my query on what costs and on what basis the Mother was asking for costs, the Mother responded that she had just copied this from a past summons variation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     However, the Father’s Counsel submitted that he was reserving his position on costs until the next hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     At the next hearing on 18 July 2023, the Father’s Counsel submitted that they were asking for Costs of $1,000.00 all in, which included the Disbursements component of $576.70 and that the filing of the Order of Court would be another $20.00 to $25.00. This was due to the Mother’s conduct for not agreeing to mediate this matter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. The Father’s Counsel informed that at the first Case Conference, they had made it very clear that their client’s instructions was to seek mediation but the indication from the Mother was that she was not amenable to mediation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father’s Counsel submitted that this was not a reasonable position to take because (i) the last Court Order in 2021 was premised on a mediated settlement so there was no reason for the Mother to take the view that mediation was not viable for this case. (ii) if there had been mediation, he believed that there would have been a settlement on 2 major points firstly, the Australian passport issue, as all it took was the suggestion by the Court to bridge the gap between Parties on this issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The second issue was the enforcement prayer which was struck out by the Court. The Father’s Counsel submitted that they had stated from the beginning that this was the wrong forum for the enforcement prayer and if the matter had gone for mediation, the Mother would have been apprised of the correct legal position<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Mother responded that based on the October 2021 mediation, a lot of the agreed points were not adhered to by the Father. That was why she did not think that there was any point in going for mediation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Father’s appeal against my decision was set out in the Notice of Appeal as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_i\"></a>i.     The Court's decision not to make the appropriate orders in respect the Plaintiff's breaches of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions and lack of full and frank disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     In respect of paragraph 1 of FC/ORC 3272/2023, the order increasing the monthly sum payable for accommodation costs to $1,200.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     In respect of paragraph 2 of FC/ORC 3272/2023, the order increasing the monthly cap for tuition expenses to $680.00 and for direct payment to XXX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_iv\"></a>iv.     In respect of paragraph 3 of FC/ORC 3272/2023, the order for direct payment to the clinic for the said child's psychiatric expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_v\"></a>v.     In respect of paragraph 4 of FC/ORC 3272/2023, the order that “<em>No receipts for the spending of the said child's pocket money nor travel log are required</em>&quot;; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_vi\"></a>vi.     The order on costs made at paragraph 7 of FC/ORC 3272/2023, including the Court's decision not to take into account the Plaintiff's breaches of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions and lack of full and frank disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The first ground of appeal relates to the provisions of PD 77 wherein the procedural requirements of Supporting Affidavits are set out. The Father’s Counsel submitted that the Mother had failed to comply with PD 77(12) because she had failed to include various supporting documentary evidence. This was on the basis that the Mother was directed to provide the required supporting documentary evidence at the last Case Conference on 18 May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I note that at the first hearing on 14 June 2023, under Rule 22(1)(b) of the Family Justice Rules 2014, I had directed that both the Mother and Father were to provide documentary proof of their current monthly income for the past 3 months and their total monthly expenses. This was because I was of the view that the increase in the sum of $350.00 (from $850.00 to $1,200.00) under Prayer 1 of the Mother’s application, did not require any further investigation of the Parties’ financial situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     I had also noted that the Mother had filed a Supplementary Affidavit dated 8 May 2023 in which she had explained that IRAS had confirmed that there were no Notices of Assessment for YA 2021, 2022 and 2023 for her. In the same Affidavit, the Mother had also provided a copy of her Tenancy Agreement and the said child’s monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I had further noted that the Mother had filed another Affidavit dated 22 May 2023 exhibiting the past 3 months of her bank statements, which is in accordance with PD 77(12)(f). At the first hearing on 14 June 2023, the Mother had also explained that as a freelancer, she could only provide an estimate of her monthly income<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I also took note of the fact that the Mother was a Litigant in Person and accepted that she had complied with the procedural requirements of PD 77 to the best of her ability and there was no lack of disclosure on her part. Therefore, in my view, the Mother had submitted sufficient documentary evidence for me to make a decision on Prayer 1 of her application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Father’s appeal was against Prayer 1 of the Mother’s application but only with regard to the portion of my Order increasing the monthly sum payable for the said child’s accommodation costs from $850.00 to $1,200.00 (an increase of $350.00 as noted earlier).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In my view, the key issue that I had to decide was whether there had been a material change in circumstances to warrant the Mother’s variation application and if the increase to $1,200.00 was a fair and reasonable amount for the Father to pay. I took note of the fact that the IJ Court Order when the sum of $850.00 was agreed upon, was made over 10 years ago in 2012 when the said child was 5 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I also noted that the Mother had submitted that at the time of the IJ Court Order, she and the said child were still staying with the Father and not paying any accommodation costs. The Mother had also submitted that the increase in rent was in the sum of $1,300.00 from $2,600.00 to $3,900.00. I noted that this was a 50% increase from $2,600.00 whereas the Mother was asking for an increase of $350.00 which was an increase of about 40% from the original sum of $850.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In my view, the material change in circumstances was that the original agreed amount in the sum of $850.00 was made over 10 years ago and that after the Mother and said child had to move into their own accommodation with effect from April 2018, there was a global increase in rental fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I also noted the Father’s Counsel’s submission that the accommodation portion in the sum of $850.00 had remained unchanged under the mediated global settlement agreement in October 2021. However, the rental increase to $3,900.00 per month only took effect in May 2023, which was more than 1½ years after the mediated global settlement was reached. Therefore, it was not an issue which existed at the time of the mediated settlement in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In my view, it was in the said child’s best interests to ensure that the said child, who had lived in the same premises since April 2019, continued to feel stable and secure in her home, especially when she was going to be taking her N levels this year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I was also of the view that the increased sum of $350.00 per month was not a large sum and within the Father’s financial capacity to pay, after taking into account what the Mother was also paying for the said child’s monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Father’s appeal was against Prayer 2 of the Mother’s application regarding the portion of my Order increasing the monthly cap for the said child’s tuition expenses from $610.00 to $680.00 and for direct payment to the tuition centre, being XXX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In my view, the Mother’s explanation was reasonable and I accepted that she did not realise that she should have checked that the tuition fees would go up yearly. I noted that since the time of the Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021, the said child’s tuition expenses had only increased by $70.00 per month within a 1½ year period. So, this was not an annual increase in the tuition fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In my view, there was no dispute that this tuition was beneficial for the said child. Therefore, I allowed the Mother one free pass and partially granted her application in that I accepted that she had not factored in an increase in the Maths and Science tuition fees for the said child and that $70.00 per month was reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     However, I also agreed with the Father’s Counsel that the Father should not be made liable for any additional increases of the said child’s tuition fees or any additional tuition subjects that may be required by the said child without obtaining his prior written consent. In order to prevent further acrimony between the Parties, I agreed that the Father should pay the tuition centre directly. In my view, this would give the Father greater autonomy on this issue of the said child’s tuition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 4</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Father’s appeal was against Prayer 3 of the Mother’s application regarding my Order for direct payment to the clinic for the said child's psychiatric expenses. It was not disputed and in fact, the Father’s Counsel agreed to accept the Mother’s request for the sum to be set at $2,400.00 per annum for the said child's psychiatric expenses. However, the Mother had asked for payment to be made directly to the clinic because she did not get reimbursed in a timely manner..</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In my view, the said child’s psychiatric expenses was clearly a necessary expense as it was provided for in the mediated global agreement of the Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021 that the Father’s Counsel had raised several times during the hearings. Again, my intention was to prevent further acrimony between the Parties. Hence, I ordered direct payment by the Father to the clinic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 5</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Father’s appeal was against Prayer 5 of the Mother’s application regarding my Order that “<em>No receipts for the spending of the said child's pocket money nor travel log are required</em>&quot; (italics added in the Notice of Appeal).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I noted that the Father’s Counsel had raised several times during the hearings, that there was a mediated global agreement which had resulted in the Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021. In my view, if it was such an important requirement for the Father to have these receipts and travel logs, then it should have been included in the mediated global agreement of the Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021. At the time, the said child was already 14 years old and it would have been the opportune time to make the said child financially aware of good spending habits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     I was also of the view that it was not up to the Father to dictate his own terms for the implementation of a Court Order obligation. Therefore, I allowed the Mother’s request that no receipts or travel logs were required as this was not a legal requirement in the mediated Variation Court Order dated 21 October 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 6</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Father’s appeal was against Prayer 6 of the Mother’s application regarding my order on costs. In the Notice of Appeal, this was referred to as “the order on costs made at paragraph 7 of FC/ORC 3272/2023, including the Court's decision not to take into account the Plaintiff's breaches of the Family Justice Courts Practice Directions and lack of full and frank disclosure.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     I had ordered costs against the Mother because this matter could have been resolved earlier if she had agreed to go for mediation. Therefore, the order of costs was made against the Mother for the additional time taken and delay in completing this matter. However, as there was no inordinate delay in this matter, I was of the view that the sum of $500.00 as costs against the Mother, would suffice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     I have already addressed the issue of PD 77 under the first issue above. I have also stated above that I did not find any lack of disclosure by the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     My Court Order with brief reasons, were sent to Mother and Father’s Counsel by RN on 18 July 2023. I have nothing further to add to my reasons given above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 6 in lines 13 to 20 of Day 1 on 14 June 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 9 in lines 8 to 21 of Day 1 on 14 June 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at pages 10 to 13 in line 20 of page 10 to line 5 of page 13 of Day 1 on 14 June 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at pages 14 &amp; 15 in lines 6 to 28 of page 14 and from lines 4 to 9 of page 15 of Day 1 on 14 June 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at pages 10 &amp; 11 in lines 10 to 32 of page 10 and from lines 1 to 16 of page 11 of Day 2 on 18 July 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 13 in lines 4 to 14 of Day 2 on 18 July 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 14 in lines 3 to 7 of Day 2 on 18 July 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 16 in lines 7 to 28 of Day 2 on 18 July 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 17 in lines 1 to 26 of Day 2 on 18 July 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at pages 22 &amp; 23 in lines 10 to 32 of page 22 and from lines 1 to 19 of page 23 of Day 1 on 14 June 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 23 in lines 26 to 29 of Day 1 on 14 June 2023.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>See Notes of Evidence at page 8 in Section A from the transcript of the Judge’s own notes of Day 1 on 14 June 2023 as the Judge forgot to turn on the recording function after IT fixed some technical faults during the first part of the hearing.

Both his parents are in a dispute regarding his care and control. I dismissed both their applications. His mother appeals against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The child’s Mother is the Plaintiff, and the child’s Father is the Defendant in this case. The parents had married in June 2011 in Norway. At all material times, the Mother was a Singaporean and the Father a Norwegian. They lived in Norway for a few years and then moved to Singapore. Their relationship broke down, and by consent, they were divorced by an interim judgment in May 2017. The ancillary issues were not agreed upon. I heard and decided the ancillary issues in December 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I ordered the child to be in the joint custody of both parents, and that he be in the care and control of the Mother. I ordered the Father to be given access as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The parents shall have Joint Custody of the child with care and control to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father shall have access as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    Every Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6.30 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekday access”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Every Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.45 p.m. (“Weekend Access”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    From 1 June 2019, the Weekday access shall remain or adjusted to different days if agreed to by parties, or else shall remain the same; and weekend access shall be on alternate weekends Saturday 10 a.m. overnight to Sunday 2 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Father is permitted to bring the child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from 2019. The Defendant shall ensure that the child is returned to Singapore to the Plaintiff no later than 30 December immediately thereafter. The Plaintiff shall release the child’s passport to the Defendant for this purpose. The Plaintiff shall also furnish the passport details of the child to the Defendant to enable travel arrangements to be made. The Defendant shall furnish the details of the visit including the travel documents and the addresses where the child shall be at to the Plaintiff in exchange for the child’s passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother appealed against my whole decision. Her appeal was heard in December 2019. The appeal was heard by the learned Judicial Commissioner Tan Puay Boon who made the following orders on the issue of the child (“the Order”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Custody, care and control</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The parties shall have Joint Custody of the child with care and control to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">a.    Weekday access</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Father shall have access to the Child every Tuesday and Thursday from 6.30 pm to 8.45 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">b.    Weekend access</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Father shall have access to the Child on alternative weekends from 10.00 am on Saturdays to 2.00 pm on Sundays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">c.    Overseas access</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Father shall be permitted to bring the Child to Norway for temporary visits not exceeding 15 days every December starting from December 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Father shall ensure that the Child is returned to the Mother in Singapore no later than 30th day of that December immediately after the temporary visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Mother is to keep the Child’s passport and maintain its validity for travels.

In it she does not seek to disturb the orders on custody care and control of the child, but she seeks to get changes regarding access as well as to remove a penal notice that had been attached to it:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>During School Term</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(A)    The Father shall have access to the child on alternative weekends as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    On Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   On Sundays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   If the Father has weekend access on Saturday and Sunday, the Mother will have the child for the next or following Saturday and Sundays.

On that week (where he takes Wednesday – Friday from 10 a.m. to 5p.m.) there will be no Tuesday and Thursday access from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   The Father is to bring the child for his enrichment and tuition class commitments as scheduled if it falls within his access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>During December School Holidays every year</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(C)    The Father shall have access to the child every December as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    Monday to Friday from 10am to 5pm for (5 days) on any of the week that he does not get the weekend access of the child.

The business, office work, emergency trips involving the child shall not be more than 10 days. The Mother shall allow for make up access to the Father upon return to Singapore, on the access not taken during such overseas trips.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <u>Child-First Approach to Joint Custody</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    Since the child will be going to Primary 4 in the year 2023 where the academic life of the child becomes more challenging the parties shall endeavor [sic.] to have mutual understanding on the following non-exhaustive matters:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    The Father is to understand that the child has to take up extra tuition and enrichment classes to better his academic performance at school in Singapore; and to prepare for PSLE in 2025. These classes will be fixed on weekdays and weekends most of the times; and the child is to have an adequate and healthy night routine during the school days especially to rest and recuperate the rigors of lessons and school activities of each school day, which will be in the best interest of the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   The Father is to ensure the child is able to continue and/or proceed with his academic and/or personal development pursuits without any disruption whatsoever especially when they fall within his access times. The Father must ensure that the child's homework/tuition work/sports commitments are met promptly and without disruptions during his access time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iii)   The Mother is entitled to fix any tuition or enrichment classes during the Father's access times if there are no other times available. In the event the tuition or enrichment classes are fixed, notice should be given via email to the Father forthwith so that he can bring the child to and from these classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(iv)   In the event the Father needs to change his weekend schedule or he is travelling and is unable to take access of the child, the Father must provide 7 days' notice of the same via email to the Mother, so that alternative arrangements can be made for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(v)    The Father is not to turn up unannounced and/or early to take access of the child causing disruption of work to the Mother and disruption to plans for the child. The child will be sent for access on the day and time stated in the Order give or take 10 minutes and parties must be prepared to wait for the child. The Father is to pick up the child from the drop off point at the place of residence (as a default).</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(vi)   The Father shall not bad mouth the Mother to the child or in his presence, to avoid causing the child alarm, hurt, sadness and/or fear to the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(vii)  The Father shall behave cordially and amicably in the presence of the child and shall not raise his voice or carry out any action or behaviour to put the child in an awkward, difficult, pressured, embarrassing and fearful situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(viii)  If the child is unwell or is tired either due to illness or due to exams anxiety especially during the mid-year and year-end exams, parties are to communicate on alternative access days to allow the child to focus on his studies exams and results.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ix)   The Mother shall give make up access to the Father as much as possible whenever the Father misses his time with the child for purposes of the mid-year and year-end exams to allow the child sufficient time to practice and prepare for these exams.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(x)    Mode of communication between parties shall be email only. All email communication relating to the child moving forward shall be cordial, amicable and respectful. There shall not be any name calling, threats, demands and belittlement in the tone and intention of the email communication between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The penal notice attached to the Order to be rescinded.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father objected to these requests and filed a cross application to vary the care and control of the child to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In May 2023, the two cases came before me. I heard counsel for the parties. I directed that I wished to interview the child. The case was adjourned for this purpose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I interviewed the child with the assistance of a counsellor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I considered the matter, and I issued my decision in writing to the parties in July 2023. My decision was to dismiss both applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Mother appeals against my decision. The Father does not. I give the reasons for my decision here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Mother’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Mother gives the following reasons for her requests:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_1.\"></a>1.     It has been almost 5 years since the Order was made. At the time of the Order the child was not yet in primary school, but he now is in Primary 4. The Mother relies on this as a material change of circumstances. She says that the child is unable to cope with the shuttling between access and his studies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_2.\"></a>2.     The Father does not allow the child to do homework during access. This causes the child to fall behind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_3.\"></a>3.     The Mother is not able to arrange for extra tuition during the access period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_4.\"></a>4.     After returning from access, the child needs time to settle down which ends up with him sleeping late.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_5.\"></a>5.     The weekday access can be replaced with telephone access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_6.\"></a>6.     There be no overnight on the weekend access, because the child is not comfortable staying over at the Father’s residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_7.\"></a>7.     The Father’s insistence on the Mother’s strict compliance with the orders led to incidents such as in August 2022 where there was an incident which resulted in both parents launching personal protection applications against each other. Both applications were heard by the learned District Judge Amy Tung, and both were dismissed. The Mother argues that as long as there is a penal clause, there is a likelihood of such incidents again in the sight of the child, and this will emotionally devastate the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father says that the access arranged in the Order was carried out at least until mid-2022. He claims that the Mother deliberately deprived him of weekday access by imposing tuition classes during this period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father also says that the Mother unilaterally ceased the overnight access on weekends. The Father complains that this is against paragraph d of the Order directing parents to <em>“endeavour to agree on having overnight access sessions for the Father of longer durations”</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father says that the Mother denied him the overseas access to Norway, and instead brought the Child for overseas trips herself to India and Switzerland, without giving him the 21-days notice required by the Order. He adds that these overseas trips by the Mother were for the purposes of her religious activities, which he does not agree to. He claims that the Mother ought to be restrained from involving the Child in her spiritual group meetings in India or other countries. He submits that the Mother has no regard to his opinion on the Child’s religion, that the Child ought not be involved in the spiritual activities until the Child comes of age and is able to discern for himself, and not to condition the Child towards what he refers to as the Mother’s “cult” religion. He points out that the Mother’s extreme zeal towards her religion leas her to publicly proselytise and remove the Child from school during school term to participate in overseas spiritual trips. The Father says that the child academic performance has plummeted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father submits that to allow the Mother’s requests will be to legitimize her breaches of the Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father says that the Child has been enjoying access with him since the making of the Order. At the Father’s home, the Child has his own room and bed, toys, books, bicycle and other items. He claims that the Child is familiar with the environment and enjoys his time staying there. He says that the Child has a good relationship with him, his spouse, and the Child’s half-siblings. His spouse is a primary school English teacher and assists him to ensure the Child excels in the classes that he is aware of. He does not agree to the allegation that he did not facilitate the Child doing his homework.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     My interview with the Child revealed a cheerful, energetic, eloquent, and confident boy. He was dressed sharply in a grey suit. He was of appropriate weight and height. Throughout the interview, he was inquisitive and not hesitant to ask questions without prompting. He clearly understood what he was there for. As he was getting bored of the conversation, he engaged me to play some toys with him. He was forthcoming and responded as well as a child of his age can be expected to. He did not appear to have been under undue influence or coaching.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I had promised the Child that the contents of the interview will remain private, so I shall not detail it here. I will instead state what my findings are regarding the case, based on the overall evidence presented to me as well as what I conclude from the interview.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I find as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_1.\"></a>1.     The Child has a loving and happy relationship with the Father, but he does not wish to live in the Father’s care and control. He is happy living with the Mother and her spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_2.\"></a>2.     The Child is happy being raised in the Mother’s beliefs. He enjoyed the trips to India with his Mother. I find no evidence showing that the Child is in need of protection from that.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_3.\"></a>3.     It is therefore in the best interest of the Child to remain in the care and control of the Mother, and I dismissed the Father’s request to switch care and control to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_4.\"></a>4.     The access scheme already put in place by the court is workable, and ought to remain in place. To retain the access scheme as it is will not be against the welfare or best interest of the Child. It is understandable that the Child may have to attend lessons or tuition on weekday evenings, but a reasonable care parent will endeavour to arrange for it to be on a non-access evening. If indeed there is no tuition available at all on any other evening, then it is reasonable to expect a discussion to ensue between the parents to shift the weekday evening access to another evening of the week as long as the tuition is ongoing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_5.\"></a>5.     Regarding the Mother’s request to vary the terms of the Father’s access during school holidays, I find the change to be unnecessary and complicating, and is not shown to be better in the interest of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_6.\"></a>6.     On the Mother’s request to vary the Father’s overseas access, it is noteworthy that the Father has not yet exercised this so far. There has been no change in circumstances since the Order was made regarding this issue, so there is no basis to vary this aspect of the Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_7.\"></a>7.     On the Mother’s prayers regarding how the Father ought to behave and approach the issue of joint custody, I find that they are superfluous. Parents must, in any case, work together to co-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_8.\"></a>8.     In any case, the circumstances do not call for the Court to direct any party how to parent the Child during their respective periods of care or access. The parents can, and ought to work within the parameters already set by the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_9.\"></a>9.     On the Mother’s request to remove the penal notice, the fact that the parents have been in continuous contention regarding the issue of parenting the Child is by itself reason why the penal notice on the order ought not to be removed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_10.\"></a>10.     In view of the above, I dismiss the Wife’s application.</p> </div></content></root>"}]
